Not just another Oscar bait movie,"Do you know the feeling you get when you go into a film with no expectations at all or thinking it might be decent, and the film turns out to not only be good, but blows you away by how amazing it ends up being? That's LION, and if you've been watching films for several years like me thinking you've seen everything committed to cinema, it's a fantastic feeling to be proved wrong.Let me explain to you exactly what I experienced while watching LION: Almost half of the film is in Hindi, which lends incredible authenticity to the story, not that BS where they have actors in which English is their second language speak English for the sake of sparing the American audience from reading subtitles (I'm looking at you, MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA, and every other Hollywood movie ever made). In fact, the entire first act takes place in India, where about 40 minutes of the film rides on the shoulders of a first time child actor – played by the wonderful Sunny Pawar – and it's one of the best first acts I've seen in years. Think of it like the silent first act of Wall-E; it feels like it can be its own film, yet the filmmakers do a great job connecting the story once Dev Patel comes on screen.On top of that, the filmmaking is impressive. The script is fantastic, the cinematography is lush, the soundtrack complements the film really nicely, and the pacing is on point where it rarely feels like it's dragging, despite the story taking place over the course of 25 years. Every actor in here is also terrific in their roles. As stated earlier, Sunny Pawar makes a compelling lead for the first third of the film. If Oscars were given to kid actors, he would have a damn good chance at winning one. For the last two thirds, Dev Patel more than carries the rest of the film, giving an emotionally naked performance worthy enough to top his role in SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE. Finally, Rooney Mara, Nicole Kidman, and David Wenham are ace, despite all of them having limited screen time.In a time where diversity is being talked about more in the film industry, LION makes a compelling case for having diversity in storytelling. It's not about a guy meeting his girlfriend's parents for the first time. It's not about a group of friends going in a cabin in the woods. It's not even about a guy/girl struggling with the death of his/her father/mother/son/daughter/dog. No, LION is a personal story unique to South Asians growing up in India, and it's refreshing and easily one of the best films the year has to offer. Don't dismiss this as yet another Oscar bait movie put out by the Weinstein Company – it probably is one. But the film is much more than that. With a distinct vision from director Garth Davis, LION offers an enthralling story that deserves to be seen by everyone.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Powerful story, will move you to tears. Be sure to bring plenty of Kleenex.","Just saw this at TIFF . I saw the trailer a few days before the screening and I have to admit the trailer alone made me a little emotional. I mean just the thought of a 5 year old separated from his family for 25 years is bad enough, add in the fact that he was lost in India, a country of over a billion people and was the child of an uneducated poor single mother and you are looking at a very stressful situation.This happens there everyday..and most children never find their way back. They either end up dead or in the hands of heartless people who use children for various illegal / unethical operations. The fact that one boy survived this situation and went on to tell his story is very inspiring and this fantastic film did justice to showing it on screen.There wasn't a single scene in the movie which doesn't suck you in. Hats off to Dev Patel. He managed to make you feel the character's pain just by the way he looked at a jalebi (indian sweet that his brother and him fantasized about back in India). Special shoutout to the young actor who played little Saroo. His performance blew me away. It would be difficult to watch any child go through what he did and the fact that he was absolutely adorable looking made it even harder.The movie explores some great themes: What happens to lost children in developing countries? How do poor, illiterate citizens of a country go about finding their lost children...who helps them? What are the dangers faced by these lost children? Why do certain people choose to adopt? How do adopted children adapt to their surroundings? Especially when they're transplanted so many miles away from home where they do not even speak the language. Do children every fully recover from traumatic childhood experiences? Does one forget their original family if they never see them again after the age of 5? As an adopted child do you ever completely feel like you fit into your new life? What is the bond with your adoptive parents like? The film touches upon all these themes while primarily being about the physical and emotional journey of a young man finding his way back home with very few clues to work with.I kid you not, I could hear the whole theatre crying during several parts of the movie and most people had tissues in their hands. So be prepared. If you're in the mood for a heart wrenching drama with an uplifting ending, go watch this one once its out! The lead cast as well as supporting members have all done a wonderful job. You will not be disappointed!",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Couldn't stop crying,"This is such a beautiful film, with a simple story line, without any frills.A young Indian boy leaves their village with his older brother to do some ""jobs"", in one of these jobs he gets lost and cannot find his way back home. Pass some years and he's adopted by a family from Australia, and when that boy becomes an adult, he starts wondering where he's actually from.It deals with aspects of origin and identity, and that we cannot escape from who we really are.Superb, superb acting from everyone, from the little Indian boys, specially Sunny Pawar that plays the young Sarro, to Dev Patel who has clearly matured into a top class act and is endearing and touching playing the older Saroo.I'm certainly watching it again.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
The story of my life..,"It's the story of my life. I was born in Bangalore in 1983 and I was adopted by an Italian family when I was almost two years old. My father told me that the nuns found me on the street, and they took me to an orphanage in Solur. My father made a very difficult journey to come and get me and we stayed a month in India before returning to Italy. unfortunately I do not remember anything of that world and for me it will be very difficult to understand where I was born but one day I will come back.

Truly Exceptional,"May I start this off by saying that I'm astonished at the extremely unfair negative, even 'mixed' reviews the film has gotten so far... The film is not even remotely close to being average, it's far, far, beyond magnificent.By now you probably know the synopsis, so I'll add for those who haven't seen the film that it's visually stunning, the acting is superb (special mention to phenomenal newcomer Sunny Pawar, who plays 5 year old Saroo) and the story is so gripping and moving, that there wasn't a dry eye in the house when the film reached it's emotional climax.I've been thinking about this film since I saw it, there's drama, mystery, romance, a whirlwind of emotions throughout the 2 hours - in the best way possible.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Waiting for Guddu...,"Whenever I wander in the streets of the Moroccan Medina, I feel at home. There's that strange mixture of various fragrances floating in the air: spices, kebab, frying delicacies (not much different from these appetizing jelabis), sea spray from the fish market, tanned leather from the shoe shop and this whole conglomerate smell outsiders or tourists might feel stinky, but as far as ""my"" senses are concerned, ""there's no place like home"". I didn't pick it, it picked me.And maybe there's something innately circular about life, we're born home, we move close or far from it, and there's the need to get back. I even have a personal theory: that even your children can find a deep ""connection"" with the place you were born in, your home will also feel like home for them. And it is indeed ""A Long Way Home"", the poignant and inspiring story of Saroo Brierley, born in India, lost at the age of five, adopted by an Australian couple and reuniting with his mother and his family twenty-five years later. What else can be said? It's a simple story but it's often in the most plain-looking grounds that you can find the most precious gems.Garth Davis' ""Lion"" is indeed simple in its storytelling; it's linear and straightforward in its clarity. Basically the whole first hour shows poor Saroo looking for his brother Guddu in hostile and overcrowded streets of Calcutta and finding a few moments of relief interrupted by adults, and in the huge lottery of karma, some can look extremely friendly and have sinister motives. But good fate sides with little Saroo and one lucky encounter leading to another, a couple of Australian tourist discovers the 'wanted notice' published in a newspaper and they instantly fall in love with the kid and adopt him. Saroo is then taught English and good manners.Then, something interesting happens: while I expected some resistance, he actually tries to fit in his new family as if he's aware that there's something really providential in that couple of good-hearted people from Tasmania, played by Nicole Kidman and David Brienham. The one twist that spoils the family harmony is the adoption of a mentally troubled and self-harming Indian boy named Mantosh one year later. ""Lion"" manages to say a lot without words, from the reaction of Sunny Pawar, who does a fine, subtle, acting job, I could feel that he didn't welcome this arrival with much enthusiasm but wouldn't display jealousy out of love for his new mom.And the way he grew up was in line with the character. Dev Patel finally makes his entrance as a brilliant young man in his mid-twenties, ready to embrace studies in hotel management, he's also a nice guy like you seldom see in movies, no tortured soul, no rebel, no wimp either and respectful toward his parents. Seeing Patel again made me regret how harshly I judged ""Slumdog Millionnaire"" but I never commented his acting but a script that took a rather simplistic turn near the end. So, I was glad to see Patel again, playing another guy trying to find a loved one through a ""modern device"" but I hoped Davis wouldn't derail the film from its beautiful simplicity.And I had a good scare when his soon-to-be girlfriend, played by Rooney Mara, started improvising a little dance on the streets as it almost felt like there would be some Bollywood number, but it was just her twisted way to seduce him, and it worked well, to some degree. Personally, she struck me as a too cold and sophisticated girl, I didn't buy that a guy so warm and ""sunny"" like Saroo would fall in love with a younger version of Kristin Scott Thomas. Even the love scenes made me wonder if Mara wasn't still under the influence of her previous romance in ""Carol"". Never mind, the center of the movie were Patel and Kidman and as soon as Patel has this delicate 'Proust Madeleine' moment, the story takes off and with the miracle of ""Google Earth"", Saroo tries to find the way back home.The film tries to inject some 'suspense' in that powerful journey but that wasn't necessary, I think they could have just compressed the 'research' within the last weeks before Saroo's departure and avoided these little 'pending' moments, only to focus on the relationship with his adoptive mother and some emotional insights about the heights of generosity some hearts can reach. There were many heartfelt statements about adoption that could have enriched the story but the girlfriend allowed Saroo to explain his existential crisis to the audience without never really existing on her own, I didn't care for her anyway. The tormented brother could have made a more interesting foil for Saroo and would have provided a fine back-story paralleling Saroo's experience.While ""Lion"" isn't flawless, it's a movie whose emotional power relied on the ending, and when Saroo was getting closer to his home, I could find my own heart beating, that's for the empathy and that was the price to pay, to earn that teary explosion of happiness and a few emotionally rewarding revelations, concluding one of the few 2016 movies of universal appeal. Indeed, If there ever was one statement to sum up the general appeal of movies, or stories regardless of their narrative medium, I would quote the late Roger Ebert who said ""The more specific a film is, the more universal, because the more it understands individual characters, the more it applies to everyone"".Truer words have never been spoken indeed. Garth Davis' ""Lion"" might have an Australian-Indian protagonist but anyone can relate to him, from India, Iceland, Jamaica, Morocco or any part of the world.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Such a powerful film!,"Missing child cases are ones that really do send a shiver down the spine, the uncertainty of the child's whereabouts or whether in fact they are actually still alive being the major worries. You can't possibly understand the effect it must have on a family. In Garth Davis' Lion, we see the effects of such a case on the child rather than the family left behind.Saroo (Sunny Pawar) is a five-year-old child living in a remote Indian village with his mother, brother and sister. Spending his days helping his brother steal coal from trains, Saroo joins his brother for a job one night but finds himself lost and on a train to Calcutta, nearly two-thousand kilometres from his home village.Surviving many challenges and meeting various faces, Saroo is eventually adopted by an Australian couple, John and Sue Brierley (David Wenham and Nicole Kidman). Twenty-five years later, Saroo (Dev Patel) decides to track his lost family down.I must start by saying that I absolutely loved Lion, a film that deals with such a traumatising true story in such a delicate manner. Garth Davis splits the film into two halves, the first focusing on Saroo as a five-year-old lost in such a densely populated city and the second looking at Saroo as a grown man, so far away from the life he left years before. It is quite tough to watch at times, particularly some scenes of a young Saroo trying to survive on the streets of Calcutta however, Davis' film builds to a truly beautiful conclusion that left me emotionally destroyed.I think the fact that this is a true story played a massive part in the conclusion having such an impact on me. Davis plays it out brilliantly and the inclusion of real life footage in the end credits, along with startling facts about how many children go missing in India, just added more power to the already powerful film.Lion doesn't just get its power from the story but from the tremendous performances also. I have always liked Dev Patel as an actor but this is the first time I've watched him give such a powerhouse of a performance as a grown up Saroo struggling to cope with tracking down his lost family. From here, Patel could really go places, starting with awards recognition in the early new year.Sunny Pawar deserves a special mention for his performance as a young Saroo, lost and alone in such a unfamiliar place. It's always a risk to have such a large portion of the film led by such a young actor but it's ultimately one that pays off greatly in Lion. There's also fine support on offer from Rooney Mara, Nicole Kidman and David Wenham, ensuring the quality runs right throughout the film.Lion is a film that I urge you to go and see because a film like this needs the coverage and its subject matter is something people need to be made more aware of.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
harrowing first half,"It's 1986. Saroo and his brother Guddu steal coal from passing trains. Their mother is an illiterate laborer. The family scraps by in rural India. Guddu leaves Saroo sleeping at the train station for night work. Saroo wakes up and stumbles into an empty train. He find himself trapped as the train travels 1600 miles to Calcutta. He is alone in the city and unable to speak the local dialect. He escapes the scary streets and gets taken to a Dickensian orphanage. He is adopted by Sue (Nicole Kidman) and John Brierley (David Wenham) from Tasmania. Twenty years later, he moves to Melbourne to study hotel management and starts a relationship with Lucy (Rooney Mara). Friends suggest using Google Earth to pinpoint his lost home town.The first half with young Saroo is a harrowing journey. The nightmarish streets are closer to the horror genre. It's a very compelling story. The kid is undeniable. Once he leaves for Australia, the story slows down. There are some compelling aspects but it falters when compared to the first half. That imbalance leaves the movie wanting. Maybe it's possible to add more flashbacks into the second half.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
This Film has Oscars written all over it,"I had not read anything about this film and I went to see 'Lion' yesterday. I was moved, I was shocked. I had tears in my eyes and the hair on my skin stood up. I could listen to my own heart beats while watching this film. It has never happened to me before when I saw a film and I was touched immensely. The film took me back to my roots and streets where I grew up. I am from Pakistan and I have been living in San Francisco for the last 15 years. I come from that part of the world where this story takes place. I grew up in streets like the streets of the movie 'Lion'. I have met many children who collect garbage to make a living and are lost in the streets of this universe. They sleep alone on card board boxes at night and when you look at them , there is a question in their eyes. The world has forgotten about these children and there are thousands of these children on the streets of India and Pakistan. Do you really know what it feels like when you are only 5 years old and lost in some crowded street in a big city and do not know how to get home? To the boy who played Saroo (Sunny Pawar), I want to give you an Academy Award. The film grabs you from the beginning as it starts out with showing a beautiful relationship between two brothers who are running on a train track. The actress who played mother (Priyanka Bose)touched my heart. Her performance is breathtaking. The way she looks at her sons, shows you how a mother pours her heart with love when she looks at her children. There are no words to express that feeling and actress gave her full self and emotions to play this role from young to old. It is commendable and her acting moved me and reminded me of my own mother. There are so many things which I think my mother does not know about me but the way she looks at me, I know she knows.Lost Saroo looks around for Guddu at the dark train station and then looks for Guddu everywhere, in his thoughts for the rest of his life. What a beautiful role of Guddu played by Abhishek Bharate and what a promising actor! There were some real gripping performances in this film by actors which had only small roles in the film but they left their mark and touched me. I want to give a big hug to Garth Davis for choosing these powerful actors and giving them a chance to express their emotions. I must mention Tannishtha Chattergee, who knew her character and made a mark with just two scenes. Now that's called Actor.I have always seen Nicole Kidman in great grandeur roles. But I was shocked to see her in 'Lion'. A small role with few scenes. She gave herself all. Her performance in Lion is heartfelt. The cinematographer was able to capture her emotions and her heart on the big screen. David Wenham, plays the part of father to Saroo with amazing acting skills and warmth. Dev Patel, you did a good job.I want to give a big salute to all the filmmakers and actors who were involved in making this film. You have done an exceptional job and gave me something which will be in my mind and heart for a very long time.

Intelligent and moving,"""Lion"" is the kind of inspirational movie I normally shy away from but first-time director Garth Davis treats the material with a harder edge than I expected. The potential for sentimentality is, of course, high in this true story of a five year old Indian boy separated from his family by 1600 kilometers when the train he is sleeping in 'accidentally' takes him to Calcutta forcing him to live on the streets until a kindly Australian couple, (Nicole Kidman and David Wenham), adopt him and raise him to adulthood in Tasmania.As a child he is played by the remarkable Sunny Pawar and as an adult by the equally remarkable Dev Patel in a film full of fine performances. The tragedy of the early scenes are that they will immediately remind you of Dickensian London, (complete with a Fagin and a Nancy), though mercifully these children encounter as much goodness as they do evil. This is, after all, a film about hope.Of course, one of the risks involved when Western filmmakers make movies in such 'exotic' locations as India is the temptation to prettify them out of all recognition. This is fine in a movie like ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" but a movie like this needs to look at least more 'realistic' and Greig Fraser's excellent cinematography does go some way to rectifying the problem; there is a darkness here, literally and metaphorically. Ultimately this is a moving and intelligent picture that could easily have been so much less; a film in which even the obligatory romantic entanglements, (here involving a fine Rooney Mara), work. Hardly Best Picture material but worth seeing nevertheless.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Roars like a near mighty lion,"'Lion' showed a lot of promise. There was potential for a very powerful story, had heard a lot of good things about it (as seen from many positive reviews and a high rating here) and there is a lot of talent involved. A lot of my friends had said how much it touched them, as have many reviewers here, and it seemed like my kind of film.Fortunately, 'Lion' was a film that had great potential and mostly lived up to it. Cannot say that for many recent viewings, with a few too many wastes of good concepts and potential (along with wastes of talent, that is a bugbear of mine because it feels like somewhat of a slap of the face) so that there was a film that did not waste it was refreshing and restored a bit of faith. It is a very good film, albeit it was very nearly a great film. That it wasn't the great film all the way through than when it started is something of a shame, but there are so many great qualities all the same.It is an uneven film sure, starting with the negatives. The second half is not as strong as the first half, it is not as compellingly paced and the clarity of storytelling is less good, some of it feeling vague. That is not to say it is unwatchable, it is still touching in spots in a film that is quite the emotional experience.Rooney Mara also came over to me as the cast's weak link. She didn't look very interested and her character felt like a misplaced and underwritten plot device.However, 'Lion's' first half is wonderful. Hugely compelling and very emotional, and what is meant by why the film very nearly was great. The whole film though was poignant, and count me in as another film who has become tougher generally over the year but got through several tissues by the film's end.Throughout, 'Lion' is beautifully filmed and complements the beautiful sceneries very well. Scoring and sound never come over as obvious or intrusive. The script provokes thought, charms and moves. The story is never dull and the emotional impact never feels forced or manipulative.Garth Davis does a very good job directing. Aside from Mara, the cast are very good. Dev Patel's performance here is perhaps the best seen from him personally and David Wenham and Nicole Kidman are similarly excellent. The star here though is Sunny Pawar who is just outstanding, have not seen a child performance this good in a long time, it is perhaps among the best ever.In conclusion, very good and very nearly great. 8/10 Bethany Cox",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Great Story, not a Great Film","Lion is an a amazing story of an exceptionally lucky child grown up to be a man. Lion is not a great film however. It becomes overbearingly melodramatic and overwrought in the second half. I felt like screaming at the main character, go to India and see your family already! This would have been a good documentary. Spare us the Aussie attempt at angst, it just doesn't work. Here we have a lucky young man with a loving family, all grown up in the ""lucky country"". What's the problem? He can figure out where to go in India to see his birth village, but we have to endure an hour of film with him being moody around his supportive girlfriend and family. Talk about manufactured drama. The scene with Nicole Kidman and Patel seemed pointless - just a contractual opportunity for her to show off her acting chops and make this sellable overseas. Don't be fooled. This is a great story, but poor filmmaking in my opinion.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
A movie with a soul of its own,"To put it in simple words, ""Lion"" is a journey that grabs you entirely ; whether you want it or not, you are a part of each and every scene. Exactly like the hero, you find yourself having visions of a past that you think you have forgotten, you long for something more and you dig for something deeper. This is a journey back home, filled with emotions, hard decisions, and an infinite willingness to reach somewhere safe.. Simple story, dream like sequences and real characters that are aware that ""there are no white pages"" but that in a way, there is always a black ink somewhere that you can use to finish the endless books that you have in your head. A gem and must see. Highly recommended for the cast's performances, the musical score and the emotional layer that refuses to let you go even after the movie had ended.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Cried for England!,"I first saw Lion on a whim 3 weeks ago and didn't know what to expect as I hadn't even seen the trailer but I was so incredibly moved by Saroo's story that I decided to watch it again 10 days later. It's the kind of film that stays with you hours or even days after you leave the cinema. It's not just an amazing true story but the acting is superb, the musical score haunting and the cinematography stunning. My decision to see it for a second time was partly due to how much I'd enjoyed the film but also in case I'd missed something of importance through all the tears. Well that didn't work out well as I cried even more the second time round as I knew the significance of certain scenes.All the adult performances were first class especially Dev Patel and Nicole Kidman who shared some very moving scenes together as adult son and adoptive mother but little Sunny Pawar's performance as young Saroo was totally captivating. There isn't much dialogue in the first 45 minutes but his face and especially his eyes perfectly portray his anguish, desperation and loneliness. Unlike some reviewers I enjoyed both distinct halves of the film equally and never lost interest for a moment.I can't believe for one minute you'll make it through this film emotionally unscathed but if you do then I'm sure the end credits will get you. I don't have anything negative to say about this wonderful film and can't wait for the DVD to be released. I'll finish by using the 2 most used words when reviewing Lion.

"An immensely satisfying cinematic experience: visually stunning, narratively powerful, and an emotional whirlwind. Best Aussie film of the year.","If film-art is the pursuit of visual pleasure, powerful storytelling and high emotional impact, then Lion (2016) is the year's high-water mark for Australian productions. Based on the novel A Long Way Home (2014), this film adaptation is a richly textured essay on the primal human need for belonging that will resonate with anyone who has ever wondered who they are.This true story is told in two parts and filmed across two continents. Five year-old Saroo is a ragamuffin sidekick to his older brother Guddo, two poor boys who support their family by stealing coal and scavenging trains in their West Bengal village. They become separated one night and Saroo finds himself alone on a train heading to the other side of India. He he joins hordes of homeless children who must fend off predators while begging to survive. Eventually he is placed in a crowded orphanage, then adopted by two big-hearted and childless Tasmanians, Sue (Nicole Kidman) and John (David Wenham). Twenty years on, Saroo (Dev Patel) begins to have memory flashbacks of his native land. As they increase in intensity, he becomes obsessed with finding his family. With some luck and Google maps, the story comes full circle.There is so much that makes this film stand out. The storytelling is more than engaging: it is so captivating that the two-hour run-time feels like an hour. Acting performances are outstanding: Nicole Kidman is at her best while the five year-old Saroo (Sunny Pawar) is the heart of the film and Dev Patel its soul. The cinematography is brilliant, especially the filming in India. The camera-work is both expansive and intimate, shifting often from sweeping aerial panoramas of mountainous Indian countryside and tranquil Tasmanian waterways to narrow winding alleys, village markets, and the inner-world of Saroo's turmoil. Some of the most powerful scenes are shot from the eye-level of a terrified lost boy jostled by masses of humanity and the close-ups of Saroo's painful face desperate to know home. The colour palette is exotic, sound track emotionally intense, and the directing finds a rhythm that is almost orchestral.This film offers an immensely satisfying cinematic experience: visually stunning, narratively powerful, and an emotional whirlwind. It comes at the end of a very mixed year for Australian film, with some of the world's finest produced but many that are less than inspiring. Lion is one of those films that will appeal to everyone and it has a very long after-taste. It easily tops my film year.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Incredible true story of a tiny needle in a very large haystack,"I've seen 104 movies so far in cinemas this year and I was wondering all year long if I will ever see a movie which will truly deserve a 10-star rating.

Riveting first half but movie loses luster in second half,"""Lion"" (2016 release from Australia; 118 min.) is ""based on a true story"", we are reminded at the beginning of the film, and brings the incredible story of Saroo. As the movie opens, we are in ""Khandwa, India, 1986"", and we see 5 yr. old Saroo and his older brother doing whatever they need to do to get by, hustling and bustling. During one of their outings, they get separated and Saroo mistakenly ends up on a train bound for Calcutta, 1000 mi. away. He desperately looks for his mom and his brother, to no avail (for one thing, the boy speaks Hindi and not Bengali), and eventually ends up being adopted by a couple in Tasmania, Australia... To tell you more of the story would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this movie is the big screen adaptation of Saroo's memoir ""A Long Way Home"", and is directed by Australian newcomer Garth Davis. The movie can be roughly divided into two parts: in the initial 50 or so minutes, we follow the young Saroo as he gets separated from his family and eventually ends up in Calcutta. The second half of the movie brings us the grown-up Saroo, now fully integrated in Hobart, Tasmania in his adopted family. I personally LOVED the first half of the movie, which is truly heartbreaking as we follow young Saroo. There is little dialogue to speak of (remember, Saroo doesn't speak or understand Bengali), and in a way this is the truest survivor story you will ever see. The young actor portraying 5 yr. old Saroo is nothing short of sensational. The photography is gorgeous throughout. Things are not nearly as interesting in the movie's second half. Dev Patel (Slumdog Millionaire; Best Exotic Marigold Hotel) portrays the grown-up Saroo, and does so with pained passion. The same cannot be said of Rooney Mara's performance. I love most of the stuff she does, but here she looks strangely aloof in the proceedings, like she wasn't interested at all in this role (other than it being filmed on location in Tasmania). Nicole Kidman plays the adoptive mother. And am I the only one who was bothered with the way the movie becomes one long advert for Google Earth? On the plus side, there is an outstanding orchestral score, courtesy of Hauschka (!) and Dustin O'Halloran which I intend on seeking out (the movie also features a brand new Sia song ""Never Gives Up"" which plays over the end credits). A few weeks ago I heard an interview on NPR with the real life Saroo, discussing the film (and unfortunately giving away the entire story including how it all ends). Despite that, I was eager to see the movie.""Lion"" opened at the Toronto International Film Festival to good critical acclaim, and it finally opened in theaters in late December. The New Year's weekend matinée screening where I saw this at was attended quite nicely. I thought that the first half of the movie was nothing short of riveting, if heartbreaking, but the second half of the movie is too obvious and predictive too keep my attention all the way through. Still, this is an incredible story that is worth seeking out, be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Gripping and compelling,"This film was for me one of the most gripping and compelling films I have ever watched. Nothing was dragged out the whole film was to the point and from the moment it started to the moment it finished I was engrossed with the story. I found it emotionally harrowing but went to see it with my sister during the BFI film festival which I think made the emotional side harder as you could relate to the pain you would feel if it were to happen to you, afterwards we both walked home in silence still playing it over in our heads. Also true praise for the composer the soundtrack was exceptional - so beautifully written and in perfect harmony with the film. A truly exceptional film, this story will stay with me forever. The casting, the story, the cinematography and the amazing music was done perfectly and I actually cannot fault this film. It was truly mind blowing and makes you appreciate how lucky you are to have whatever it is you have In a seriously humbling way. If you appreciate good film, this one, is a must.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
The lost child,"Lion is a film of two halves. It starts with the story of 5 year old Saroo in India who with his older brother Guddu tries to make ends meet for his mother by stealing coal from train trucks.One day Saroo pesters his brother to take him to work some distance from their home but Saroo gets tired and falls asleep on a train and ends up in Calcutta, hundreds of miles away from his village. Unable to speak Bengali, unsure of where he is from, his mother's name, he survives with other street children and fend of sexual predators. Saroo is then placed in an orphanage before he is adopted by a well to do Australian couple.In Australia the now grown up Saroo (Dev Patel) haunted by visions of his brother and mother searching for him starts to search for his family, home and identity. The search becomes an obsession, he gives up his job, becomes distant from his adopted parents as he goes through Google Earth looking for clues based on vague childhood memories.Director Garth Davis made the underwhelming television series Top of the Lake in 2013. Here he has a surer touch, maybe because he has a better and more coherent screenplay.The second half of the film is not as strong or powerful as the first half, even clunky in places. Saroo's other adopted brother has emotional problems, it his hinted in the film that some of the kids in the orphanage might had been sexually abused but we never find out why Saroo's adopted brother is the way he is.However the film is well paced and we see the contrast from the tumultuous scenes in India to the more tranquil scenes in Tasmania.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Average,"I found this movie to be average. Starting off with two boys on a coal train, stealing coal, it seemed like the film was going to be similar to Slumdog Millionaire, but while the film takes some familiar themes- child poverty, parenting in third-world countries, and living in a country with an enormous population like India- it is an entirely different film. The first half of the film is very good, set in India as young Pawar puts in a fantastic performance as he wanders around looking for his brother and mother, but the second half is just awful. Set in Tasmania, Australia, the film gets boring very, very quickly as we are introduced to a character 20 years later who is going to Melbourne to study and seems to be happy, then abruptly his life starts unraveling, he suddenly has this yearning desire to find out what happened to the family he left behind in India some 20 years ago. There is a scene with his foster mother in Australia that made me physically cringe as Nicole Kidman goes off on a tangent about how she had a ""vision"" that could have been interpreted as a ""mental breakdown"" and saw two brown boys and knew that this was her calling in life...Dev Patel also has a foster brother that he is wildly inconsistent with in his relationship. One minute he hates him, he's ruined his mother's life, the next he loves him. The whole half in Australia just ruined the film for me. We all know he will and needs to go back to India, but instead he spends his time getting upset at his girlfriend, quitting his job and avoiding his parents. There is a general feeling of: why doesn't he just go back to India and look for them for goodness sake? So he can finally find the clarity he's looking for? His sudden desire to find his family in India is so bizarre as he seems content then boom at mid- twenties, he needs to go back, its perplexing. Perhaps the first half and the ending when he finally returns to India makes the film worth watching, but the second half was intolerable and ruined what was a extremely promising first half.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A fabulous movie based on reality, not a comic.....","I see myself as quite tough, but Lion had me in tears, but engaged and totally captivated. One of the best films I've seen in a while, certainly one of the most powerful. Bad I know, but I can't watch a film with subtitles, it's a fault, but there you go, i fiddle with my phone or tablet etc, but the story was such that I didn't take my eyes off it.

The heartbreaking story of a young boy's desperation to discover his roots. I thought Dev Patel did a magnificent job in playing Saroo in later life, what a terrific actor he is.

Great Film Based on a True Story,"In 1986, in Khandwa, India, the 5 year-old boy Saroo (Sunny Pawar) lives a very poor but happy life with his mother Kamla (Priyanka Bose), his older brother Guddu (Abhishek Bharate) and his younger sister Shekila (Khushi Solanki). Kamla works carrying stones during the night shift and Guddu also works in the night in the Central Station. One night, Saroo insists on going with Guddu to his work and does not resist and sleeps. Guddu leaves Saroo sleeping on a bank I the station and asks him to stay there until he returns. However the boy wakes up in the middle of the night and decides to seek out his brother in a train. He sleeps again and he wakes up in Calcutta, West Bengal, and 1,600 km east of Khandwa. Saroo does not speak Bengali, only Hindi, and lives on the street of the big city. One day, a young man brings Saroo to the police station and he is sent of an institution for children. In 1987, Saroo is adopted by an Australian family and moves to Hobart, Tasmania. He is raised with love by his foster parents and one day, he goes to an Indian party promoted by his Indian mates from the university with his girlfriend Lucy (Rooney Mara). He tells the story of his childhood and triggers the feeling of missing his family. Now Saroo becomes obsessed to find his mother Kamla and his siblings. Will he succeed in his search?""Lion"" is a great film based on a true story. The first part is a masterpiece and the boy Sunny Pawar steals the show. The plot is heartbreaking with the 5 year-old boy lost alone in the big city and without speaking the local language. There is an ellipsis when he grows up and the film turns into a melodrama inferior to the story of Saroo's childhood on the streets of Calcutta. The conclusion is emotional, with the reunion of Saroo and his biological mother. Along the credits, the footage of the real characters in India will make many eyes brimming with tears. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Lion: Uma Jornada Para Casa"" (""Lion: A Journey Home"")",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
An incredible Story: Something that should not happen to any child,"It has been mentioned on this page that one of the writers is ""Saroo Brierly (novel)"". His book is not a novel. It is a biography. I am from Khandwa where the boy in the story (Saroo Brierly) hails. My residence is just about two kilometres from his mother's residence. A few years ago I met him 'accidentally' and spoke to him briefly. I was totally excited to meet him. He does not know his mother tongue Hindi. He talks with an Australian accent. His book 'A Long Way Home' is worth reading. In the movie his adult role is played by a 'white' man. It should have been a 'brown' man to reflect real appearance. The child actor who plays the role of child Saroo is in fact a child who was washing teacups for a living in a roadside snack shop on the Khandwa-Indore road. His acting and voice are true to what would have been that of a local boy. Saroo's life has touched the hearts of many. In fact his story was topic of a sermon in our little Church in Hyderabad",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Overall a good movie,I think the best part of the movie was everything with Guddu. Especially the last scene was very emotional and the actor captured that in a way that it actually brought me to tears a bit.What I didn't feel/need was the story with the girlfriend. A lot of the stuff when Saroo was an adult came across a bit flat. Maybe it was supposed to feel that way. He grew up to be a typical english speaking person who didn't even bother to visit his birth place with a person to translate even though he had enough memory to realize that they don't speak english. But in some way that was emotional too because coming home but also being a stranger shows how one mistake changed everything and it's hard to call it a flaw when the movie is based on a real person.,,Anonymous,Biography
Falls flat,"Not sure what happened here...The first half gets off to an incredibly good start but then it runs out of plot to fill the hour and a half screen time.The acting is great it's just not supported by the script, the edit and the soundtrack.It's really quite a pity because the quality of the first half of the film only serves as the film's own benchmark that it then fails to live up to.There's lots of atmospherics, montage and unnecessary scenes and it lurches toward plot turning points like its almost afraid of its own shadow.Then once it does round the corner the polish is off and everything just feels a bit lost when compared to the first half. So much so that at points I considered it to be too self indulgent.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Lost in Train-station.,"India's vibrant and teeming tapestry of life is a natural gift for film- makers, without a word needing to be spoken, and director Garth Davis - in an impressive feature film debut - utilizes that backdrop to the max.In a true life story, five-year-old Saroo (Sunny Pawar, in an astonishingly adept child performance) is accidentally separated from his family in the Madhya Pradesh region of Western India and goes on a journey by train of hundreds of miles to Calcutta: a city full of people who don't even speak his language.Lost, alone and facing the perils of a street child in a dangerous city, Saroo is eventually adopted by a kindly Australian couple (played by Nicole Kidman (""Before I Go To Sleep"") and David Wenham (Faramir in ""The Lord of the Rings"")).Growing up in a comfortable, loving, but not - ultimately - idyllic home environment, Saroo (now Dev Patel, ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"") grows up and in his late teens goes to Melbourne University to study Hotel Management (Dev Patel? Hotel Management? What were the odds?!). While there, memories of the past resurface and an obsessive need to trace his Indian origins takes hold, disrupting both his career plans and his relationship with the love of his life Lucy (Rooney Mara, ""Carol""). But with a remembered home-town name that doesn't exist, only hazy memories of the train station he departed from, and thousands and thousands of train stations across India, how could he ever succeed?India is enormously photogenic and cinematographer Greig Fraser (""Rogue One"", ""Foxcatcher"") takes the maximum advantage of that with some memorable and dramatic landscapes: work that has been Oscar nominated. Also Oscar nominated and contributing strongly to the look and feel of the film is a well-judged and effectively used piano score by Volker Bertelmann and Dustin O'Halloran.In the acting stakes, Dev Patel gives his best ever performance and his Oscar nomination - curiously for Best Supporting actor since, I presume, Sunny Pawar has the most screen time - is very well deserved. A moving performance, particularly at the tearful end of the movie, for which a box of tissues is recommended.Nicole Kidman, not an actress I have ever hugely warmed to, is excellent here as the fragile adoptive mother, despite having to sport a crazy red curly wig. Another Oscar nomination.Also worthy of note is young Abhishek Bharate as Saroo's brother Guddu: the touching chemistry between the thieving young rascals at the start of the movie grounds the whole family relationship that's sets up the emotional heart of the subsequent quest.Luke Davies' adapted screenplay is also Oscar nominated, although perhaps not as deserving to win as some of the other nominees. I would (naively perhaps) assume that adapting a screenplay from a true-life story must be an easier task, since the facts have to speak for themselves. But besides that, while the first half of the film, with the scenes in India, is exceptionally good, the Australian section became a more patchy with the motivations of Saroo's actions and the impact they have on his adoptive family not feeling completely fleshed out.While I'm sure being a street urchin in Calcutta in the mid-80's was a horribly difficult and perilous existence, the screenplay paints the sense that that almost EVERY male in the city is either a paedophile or hopelessly corrupt: something that if I was a Calcutta resident I would likely take offence to.However, this is a hugely involving and enjoyable movie, and a ""Best Film"" rounds off the impressive haul of six Oscar nominations. You might be cynical and view the subject matter as being comfortable Oscar-bait... but you can hardly argue about the absolute quality of the film-making on show here.By the way, if you are curious as to where the title of the film comes from, you need to wait until the end titles: a masterly touch that I really liked!The end titles also lay out the fact that the perils of street kids in India is still real and present, and the film is supporting charitable work to help. If you were moved by the film (as I was) you can make a donation at http://lionmovie.com (as I did)!Highly recommended.(For the graphical version of this review please visit bob-the-movie- man.com or search for One Mann's Movies on Facebook.

a trip to one's past,"I had never heard of Saroo Brierley before Garth Davis's ""Lion"" got released, and that made it all the more harrowing. You've probably learned that it's about a boy in India who accidentally got separated from his family and eventually got adopted by an Australian couple, but later decided to try and find his original home. The most intense scenes are in Calcutta, where the young Saroo is forced to wonder the streets and fend for himself, all the while avoiding kidnappers. Knowing that this is a true story adds to the intensity. I can't imagine how terrible it would be to get completely cut off from one's family.Dev Patel brings strength to the role of the adult Saroo, newly interested in finding out where he came from. I also liked Rooney Mara's performance as his college acquaintance, but I thought that the adoptive parents (Nicole Kidman and David Wenham) weren't as important to the story once he set out in search of his birth mother. Nevertheless, it's a movie that everyone should see. Outstanding one.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Tear jerker and good for Hollywood,"Lion was a good story and definitely contained some emotional moments.The western audience's fascination with poverty in other countries, especially India is an easy gravy train for Hollywood. Often films are made to highlight and heighten every poor part of India that can be found which resonates with an unfamiliar Western audience who feel better about themselves and their lives. This shock value is where the directors grasp their audience and where the money lies. The purpose is not to educate audiences and give a complete account of life in India but manufacture certain reactions and surprises to boost the ratings of the film. So off course this film was well received.India is a beautiful country with raw beauty. It definitely has serious problems but it also has real strengths, charm and a rich culture. I was born in India and have lived in a developed city along with millions of fellow Indians. This city as many other parts of India was quite developed in most parts. Yet sadly this is not documented in any movie, no stories are sought from here and believe me there are tons of moving stories. I shouldn't be surprised because there is no shock value and Hollywood is only interested in showing India in a negative and poor light. It exploits and uses the stories of poor Indians because that would be better for the bottom line. So off course Westerners think the entire country looks like this and that these are the lives of all Indian people.Lion was a good film but adopted the standard formula Hollywood uses when making Indian related films, showcase a huge amount of poverty. Close to one hour, around 45 minutes, is dedicated to poverty. The same emotional value could have been delivered but the film wanted to emphasise poverty for almost half the film. It also dragged on in parts. The last moments were the best part of the film. I have to admit that when Sheru reunites with his mother it was one of the most emotional moments in cinema. The same story could have delivered with a lot more finesse. No doubt Lion is a beautiful story but Hollywood could not resist the opportunity to use this poor son and his story for commercial purposes. The filmmakers couldn't help themselves from showing excessive poverty.I do not detest this film's story as it is a moving story but I detest Hollywood for exploiting such a story for its commercial value. You can always expect such stories to be made into films. India is full of rich and successful stories that show this great country in a good light. If Western audiences want to get a 'complete' picture of life they should not lap whatever Hollywood throws at them.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

One of 2016's Best Films,"Lion (2016)**** (out of 4)A young boy named Saroo (Sunny Pawar) goes with his older brother for a job when he becomes lost and before long he's thousands of miles away from his home. He's eventually taken off the streets of India and given to adopted parents (Nicole Kidman, David Wenham) who raise him. Twenty-five years later Saroo (Dev Patel) starts wondering what happened to his brother and mother and tries to find them.Garth Davis' LION is certainly one of the best films of 2016 and it's really amazing to see it all unfold. Going into the picture I actually knew very little about it other than its central story so the journey that the lead character goes on is quite remarkable to watch and it's even more amazing to see how well-balanced the film was and how emotional it all plays out.I think the most impressive thing for me was the first hour as we see the young Saroo getting separated from home, the horrors of being that young and alone and then him trying to survive the streets before being adopted. The film certainly tries to get a point across about homeless children in India and the film can get this across without any preaching. Instead, it really does show you how scary a world would be to a child lost in it.What makes that first sequence even greater is the fact that Pawar is so wonderful in the film. His performance here has to go down as one of the greatest that you're ever going to see from a child actor and there wasn't a single moment where you feel as if you're watching an actor. The performance is so fresh and so raw that you really feel as if you're watching a documentary. The supporting cast is terrific as well. Patel really packs an emotional punch with his strong performance and Rooney Mara, Kidman and Wenham all doing great work.LION features a terrific music score, some very good cinematography and there's no question that the screenplay hits all the right marks as the story plays itself out.",,Anonymous,Biography
A really good true story that lacks focus,"This is a really good story, but its structure, pacing and editing threw me off constantly throughout. I couldn't completely engage with the film as a result.Nearly an hour of the film is spent on little Saroo, yet ultimately this has no bearing on the film as a whole. The film is about Saroo reconnecting with his biological mom, his culture and his heritage. Yet none of these scenes further that. They're from a different movie about the entire life of Saroo and the tribulations of all Indian orphans which this film clearly is not.I really think this film benefits from a less chronological structure - if his past as a young boy were something he was remembering in pieces in the present. Because ultimately how much of that time does he really remember? It seems unlikely it was all of it since he was so young, so these scenes are really for the benefit of the audience so we spend too much of the film waiting for him to find home because we aren't actively connecting with his past like he is. We already know what happened and the incoming inevitable conclusion.Still, it's a beautiful story and the conclusion is convincingly emotional and touching. Dev Patel and little Sunny Pawar are both pretty great.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Emotional yet aloof,"Going into an 'Oscar baity' film during the Oscars winter season is always an experiment: is this going to be one that will allow you to fully immerse yourself into the fibre of the story or will you be severely frustrated by all the teary closeups followed by the string score? Lion, for better of for worse, does both. The first half of the film is absolutely splendid. Raw, poignant, emotional. It has it all. A fabulous lead actor in the young Sunny Pawar and a heart-wrenching story to go with him. Things go a bit wonky once the film shifts time and place to Australia.While Dev Patel is splendid here, after Sunny's performance, it is difficult for him to live up to what has been presented. Rooney Mara is excellent, albeit rather tangential (potentially, actually unnecessary as a character). And that is where the problems lie. That strained relationship they have is just not meshing well. It does not progress the story anywhere. There are glimmers of hope in that Australian section, though. The dinner scene when Patel's character has a fit and Nicole Kidman, playing his adoptive mother, has one of the most expressive 30 second performances seen in a long time. Her ""big scene"" is also quite good but was too much of a tear-jerker moment for my taste.From the technical side - the cinematography is excellent (again, especially in the first part of the film), and the original score is mesmerising and gives a wholly new dimension to the film. The bottom line is that this film is all well-intentioned, and that is the problem probably with it. It veers on the edge of being fully committed to the story and characters, but then kind of drifts away to be ""a film"". Basically, it is overly obvious and cliché at times. And I bet that the real-life story was not a cliché at all. The film just does not fully realise itself as an excellent one. A good film, definitely. A very good film, surely. But not an excellent one.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A great movie wanting to come out of the editing room didn't make it.,"The first part of Lion I would give a 9, unfortunately the second part is in the minus numbers, dragging this whole affair into a frustrating thing where you see greatness just out of reach because it appears the studio wanted a shorter movie. That could be wrong about the studio being the cause, but the problem is there anyways. The second part of the movie where we meet up with the big award hype around Dev Patel and Nicole Kidman's parts in the movie is equal parts confusing and overly melodramatic. The melodrama is caused by the audience not being given enough to understand why they are acting the way they do, and the confusion is caused by the same. It jumps all over the place without allowing enough to fill in their stories. How can you follow a story when big chunks of the motivation are were left on the cutting room floor? I imagine there is going to be a directors cut that will flesh out the second part of the movie and make that part watchable, because as it stands it is not. The first part is really well done in every way, but maybe it also could have been a bit longer in certain parts because there was just so much great drama there. So it is hard to understand the acting accolades for Dev Patel when most of his scenes have him acting in ways that left me feeling like I was only hearing one side of a phone conversation because his emotional tone was all over the place, his concerns were all over the place, the drama was all over the place - and we are not given much to know the details on why? That was less so for Nicole Kidman, but her part also left a lot to be desired.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
Good but not wonderful,"The first half of this movie is definitely better and more powerful than the second half. Dev Patel's acting is not that great at all ( we like the character more than the acting itself) and the too complicated psychological relationship with the mother actually ruins the powerful sweetness, simplicity and drama of the first half. The star of the movie is the little boy. 10/10 for the first half and 6/10 for the second. The real life characters scenes at the end could have been avoided. This is not needed to make a good film.

Not for the Cynical,"Lion is the story is of a very young Indian street boy (Saroo) separated from his mother and brother and falling into destitution after an involuntary train journey of 1600km takes him to the Bengal area of India where a different language is spoken. His life turns around when he's adopted by a loving and wealthy Tasmanian couple (Nicole Kidman, David Wenham) and flown to a new life in Australia.The film skips 20 years and we find Saroo, now played by Dev Patel, a happy and well-educated young man on the brink of a promising adult life. But a minor incident causes a flashback and he becomes obsessed with finding his original family to the detriment of his career and Australian relationships.The direction is solid and acting good - Nicole Kidman and Dev Patel particularly; the story rarely falters.Most films are manipulative to some degree, and Director Garth Davis occasionally lays it on a bit thick. But when you leave the theatre and find you're in a majority of the audience with swollen red eyes, who cares?",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Dev Patel is swell.,"""You can't go home again."" Thomas WolfeIf that's true, then Lion as a film is pure daydreaming, for Saroo (Dev Patel) as a 25 year old man in Australia has spent 20 years away from his home in India and wants to return. Not as easy as it sounds: After leaving home at 5 unwittingly on a train for days, he is eventually adopted to Australia with loving foster parents and the need to find his real mother and family.As far as daydreaming, Lion is based on a true story, so take that you naysayers. For those in love with technology, see Google Maps work its magic.This lyrically-played, beautifully shot, at times depressing melodrama is a study in love: Saroo's love shared with his adoptive mother, Sue (Nicole Kidman), is affecting, so authentic is Kidman's performance. I've never seen her act as finely as this. Too bad she is underused here. Her joy in the little boy and her deep connection to the adult is one of filmdom's finest relationships. An Oscar nod is sure to come.However, so distraught is Saroo's adult life with his dreams of youth and finding home that he leaves his hospitality job, almost destroys his love with a classmate (Rooney Mara), and distances himself from his adoptive family. Nobody ever said searching for your mother would be easy, and this film makes sure you know that. Its metaphors about two worlds reaching for each other give dramatic and interpretive heft.In an effective juxtaposition, the addled, ruinous adopted brother, Mantosh (Divian Ladwa), contrasts the mature and overly-sensitive Saroo. His anger against Mantosh saps the film of its established melancholic pace, almost as if we needed to be jolted out of sharing the obsessive homecoming dream.Saroo must eventually decide which identity to take—Aussie or Indian. Meanwhile, as we wipe the sympathetic tears from our eyes, we can faintly hear the lion roar.",,Anonymous,Biography
Remarkable Performances Lead A Decent Film!,"Based on the non-fiction book A Long Way Home by Saroo Brierley with Larry Buttrose, 'Lion' tells a true-story so heartbreaking (though beautiful eventually), you'd be heartless not to be moved by it. And despite that fact, cinematically, 'Lion' is a decent film, that never becomes a triumph due to its uneven Writing. But, the Remarkable Performances lead the show!'Lion' Synopsis: A five-year-old Indian boy gets lost on the streets of Calcutta, thousands of kilometers from home. He survives many challenges before being adopted by a couple in Australia; 25 years later, he sets out to find his lost family.'Lion' has a heartbreaking first-hour, that arrests you & emotionally drains you. Sunny Pawar as the young Saroo, the protagonist, delivers such a realistic performance, you actually believe the kid is lost in the big bad world. Pawar adds such depth to 'Lion', its hard to keep your eyes off him, as he struggles with being lost, homeless or later smartly dodging a pimp who sells children. The first-hour works without any stops!Its the second-hour, however, when 'Lion' results into monotony. Dev Patel is remarkably complex in his role of the older Saroo, but his journey to get back home after living 25 years with his adoptive parents in Australia, is repetitive. And by the time Saroo actually gets home, the emotions are done by. The first-hour has a addictive feel to it, but the second-hour is monotonous & drags itself for a bit too long!Luke Davies's Adapted Screenplay is excellent in the first-hour, but slows down right after. One truly wishes if the Writing remained superior, as this is a true-story that's nothing less than a triumph. Garth Davis's Direction is well-done. Cinematography is sharp. Editing is fair. Art & Costume Design are perfect.Performance-Wise: Sunny & Dev are obviously the winners here, but that doesn't mean the supporting players don't leave a mark. Nicole Kidman, to begin with, is masterclass as the Saroo's adoptive mother, who portrays true feeling without every over-doing it. David Wenham as Saroo's adoptive dad & Kidman's husband, is another topper. He's first-rate! Rooney Mara as Saroo's girlfriend, is precisely natural & owns the part with dignity & restraint. Priyanka Bose as Saroo's biological mother, also, is quite good. Deepti Naval is in top-form! Tannishtha Chatterjee is remarkable. And Nawazuddin Siddiqui is terrific in that one scene he appears in.On the whole, 'Lion' is an uneven film, about a triumphant true-story.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Guddu and his younger brother Saroo help out their impoverished family by scavenging anything they can. One night Guddu and Saroo are separated at a train station. Saroo tries to find Guddu but ends up on a train that takes him to Calcutta, 1,600 kms away. In Calcutta he is taken in by a organisation that finds adoptive parents for orphans and lost kids. Saroo is adopted by an Australian couple, the Brierleys, and moves to Hobart, Tasmania. 20 years later he decides to find his mother and brother.Quite flat for something that should have been enthralling and emotional.Starts very well - the story of how Saroo was separated from his brother and ends up in Australia is well told and is very engaging.The movie, however, loses its way in the second act - where the 20- something Saroo first goes to Melbourne and then starts to look for his mother. The plot development here is incredibly padded, filled with empty, superficial melodrama and sub-plots that go nowhere, making for dull viewing. The search itself was interesting, but does not get much screen time and is diluted by the padding around it.There's also the fact that you know from the trailers and synopsis where this is all going. Trying to create an air of mystery around the course the plot is going to take is pointless when viewers already know the outcome.It all comes together, eventually. Ending is quite emotional.Ultimately, okay, but could have been really good with a tighter, shorter middle-to-late section.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Decent 10 minutes at start and end....,"Shame about the hour and three-quarters in the middle.Lots of lovely stuff in this film, but as a story, it really dragged in the middle. Cutting it by 20-30 minutes, all from the middle bit, would have improved it tremendously.Beautifully shot, the opening part of the film is superb - a real sense of the desolation of the young, charming child is established. But as the film goes on, and on, and on, and on, we lose all sense of empathy with our main protagonist, and the lovely ending is almost lost in the rush to leave the cinema because of the sheer tedium and ennui of the middle section.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography

One of my favourite movies of the decade,"I watched this movie for the first time about four or five years ago and I just remember being amazed at how much it impacted me. So about half a year ago, when I saw that it was coming on television I made sure to catch it again. And I was confirmed in how special I think Lion is..This (true) story is about an indian boy who gets lost after he jumps on a train unable to find his brother and eventually ends up at a foster home before being adopted into an Australian family. He moves on to have a happy and loving upbringing but as he grows into adulthood, he becomes more and more haunted by the thought of his original mother and brother and the grief they must feel. He therefore commits himself to tracking them down in order to find inner and outer peace.This movie isn't just about a man wanting to see his family - it's a story about how this terrible tragedy for one family turned into a miracle for another and how that doubleness affects the man in the middle of it all. It's about how love can be tied to so many things and people at the same time and can be embraced in so many forms. It's about how family is a treasure like no other.Lion is wonderfully crafted with breathtaking cinematography, an absolutely beautiful piano-score that really sticks with you afterwards and, on top of that, so good acting performances across the board; Dev Patel, Nicole Kidman, Rooney Mara, David Wenham and even Sunny Pavar, who played the protagonist Saroo as a young boy, were remarkable in this movie.This is one of the movies, maybe THE movie, to have touched me the most. It displays its themes of love, family, tragedy, guilt and feeling lost in an incredibly powerful way that just hits me hard.Even though it was nominated for six Oscars I still feel like Lion is so overlooked and underappreciated, which speaks volumes. I can't lie, I'm obviously very biased - as I said, Lion is very special to me, and it's easy for me to look past any flaws it may have; I certainly can't think of any off the top of my head. But that's because this movie is an emotional punch that I believe has the rare ability of being heartbreaking and heartwarming at the same time.Do yourself a favour and experience it, I think there's a good chance you'll feel the same way.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Powerful and Unforgettable,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Lion"" (2016) is definitely one of the most involving and powerful stories done in 2016. What is the most amazing thing is that this is a true story. Its not hard to imagine kinds being lost now and especially back then in India, but its hard to imagine a more deeply moving coming back home story of one of those lost kids.I was involved into this movie more then i could imagine even i knew it was nominated for 6 Oscars. The storytelling here is magnificent. Directing by Garth Davis and writing by Luke Davies and Saroo Brierley himself was amazing - deeply moving, superbly paced and involving. Acting was top notch from everyone involved, and if there was one moment during the whole running time almost 2 hours that i thought ""it was done mainly for Oscar bait"" and this is Nicole Kidman monologue about her childhood nevertheless everyone shined in this movie especially Dev Patel, Priyanka Bose, Nicole Kidman and Sunny Pawar (as Young Saroo).Overall, ""Lion"" is definitely a movie that should be seen by everyone. It tells a true, powerful and deeply moving story about how you should never give up on hope of searching. Great movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
These kind of movies are rare for a reason...the story and the execution here cannot be for everybody...,"But guess what, the film doesn't give you a choice in the matter because it speaks to everyone about what we assume and take for granted on a daily basis, that we really shouldn't..this film asks you to look at yourself in the mirror and say who you are... and if your not happy with something, no matter what it is...TRY....you never done or seen it before...TRY...

Emotional Tear-Jerker,"Make sure you bring a box of Kleenex to this one! You will shed heartfelt tears or spend an inordinate amount of energy trying to hold them off. But, while I truly enjoyed the movie, I don't think the movie was structured as well as it could have been. Basically, the first half of the film follows a young Indian boy lost in a strange city and then transitions to Australia 20 years later where the boy was raised by an adopted family. Instead, I would have preferred starting with Dev Patel (the lead character as an adult), seeing him struggle with his identity and gradually show us through multiple flashbacks his experiences as a lost child in India. His growing awakening and recollections about his past would have been a journey both character and audience were making together and would have given the film more heft. Still, this was an uplifting and, at times, bittersweet movie held together by charming leads.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
I literally have no complaints about this movie and would strongly recommend it.,"Lion (2016) is a movie that was strongly recommended by a friend that I watched on a long plane ride on Delta. The storyline is about an Indian man who was separated from his family, becomes an orphan and is adopted by an Australian family. He has a fantastic upbringing and great opportunities for success but at 30 he decides to retrace his background and his original parents. This movie is directed by Garth Davis (Mary Magdalene) in his directorial debut and stars Dev Patel (Slum Dog Millionaire), Rooney Mara (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo),
David Wenham (Lord of the Rings) and Nicole Kidman (Cold Mountain). The storyline for this picture is outstanding. The challenges of an orphan and his desire to know who he truly is, is so well depicted. The details and cinematography are so good in this and so is the acting. The writing is also superb. I literally have no complaints about this movie and would strongly recommend it. I would score this a 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Very straightforward, but heartwarming","It's not a surprise at all that a story like this was made into a novel and then a film. It's the kind of thing audiences eat up. For that reason, the film follows a very predictable path that ends exactly where you expect. On one hand, it's hard to deviate too much because it is based on a true story. However, I still believe that the screenplay and director could have added so much more to make this a truly great film. As it is, it's still a very good one. A flawed one, but one that manages to effectively convey what it wants to. The acting is really good and I am really happy that Dev Patel got so many award nominations for this.",,Anonymous,Biography
A film about a boy with boundless determination and courage.,"Of this year's Best Picture Nominees, Lion (2016) is certainly one of the more . . . artistic ones. Heck, the title of the film wasn't clear until directly before the credits. In part due to the subject matter and the culture in which it takes place, this film can be hard to watch at times. The audience has to come to grips with the poverty and difficult living conditions present in India not only 25 years ago, but today as well. Perhaps it's my need to watch movies that help me to escape from these realities, but it was challenging to be shown such a stark view of another country's reality.While I understand that the larger, overarching message of the film is to bring to light the social issue of lost children in India, the more inspiring subplot had to do with adoption. Many couples have a lot of different reasons for wanting to adopt, but I have to say that the couple portrayed by Nicole Kidman and David Wenham certainly had the noblest reason imaginable. Even with this admirable goal in mind, an adopted child will likely want to uncover their past, especially if there are still questions to be answered.On the flip side of stark images of poverty, this film merely reinforced that we live in the future. The amazing capabilities that technology affords us is really what made this film possible. The ever-increasing proliferation of free and accessible information allows us to take our fates into our own hands. Whether it's for education to help break a cycle of ignorance or to track down long-lost family members, the information provided by the internet has an endless amount of uses, just as long as you're willing to put the effort in and use the tool that it is.A film about a boy with boundless determination and courage, I give Lion 3.5 stars out of 5.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

"1st half great, 2nd half fell short","This is tale of two movies. First half had an excellent pace, great acting, and kept you engaged at all times. The screenplay and film shots captured many of the scenes and moments perfectly. Music blended seamlessly.The second half, however, left a lot to be desired. The pace slowed down, the main character kept agonizing so much that it became old and tired, and the subplot of his relationship with the girl felt forced and rather unnecessary. It also felt like a Googlemaps paid for a placement as it was referenced and used so many time; this was a distraction.The ending was nonetheless heart touching and left me with a few tears in my eyes. It's just that the 2nd half could've been directed so much better to make this a truly great film.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

He has no idea where he is from, where he is at or how to get home. He is adopted by an Australian family subsequently, but he has not forgotten where he is truly from.I remember reading about this news story years ago, about a man who found his home using Google map. Just imagining what his journey could be like is already touching me to tears. Watching his journey makes my imagined scenario real, and touches me deeply. It must have been very terrifying for a five year old boy to go through such an ordeal. The film conveys the ordeal brilliantly. His time at the orphanage isn't that much better, though it is not because of anyone's malicious intent. The scene when Saroo asks whether the orphanage has tried to search for his mother is touching, and there are lots more touching degrees to come. It is a great emotional journey.",,Anonymous,Biography
We ran through the mountains of the Tasmania,"Usually, you'll find a few sentences end of the reviews which it summarize the movie, but this time I wanna start from that part. ""Decent movie, really good drama."" Now we may digging to the movie. I've listened Sia-Never Give Up while writing this article, I suggest you the listen the same song while reading. I want to start from the actings, which I think that is the movies weakest side, well except little Saroo. I am not saying the actings were bad, they were just cold. It doesn't pulls you to in to the movie. But storyline does. First criticism goes to the Lucy, played by Rooney Mara. I didn't understand what kind a role she had in the movie. She was just in a few doesn't make sense scene and a time jumps. Those time jumps were not good. In the middle of the movie I lost track cause of it. Saroo is played by Dev Patel, aka slumdog millionaire. He did a good job. Would I expect more from him? Probably not, cause Saroo character wasn't made for him. He also doesn't look like to the real Saroo. In his movies, when he acts you started to think like this is his real life, he is that good. Well it didn't happened to me in this movie. Despite all of this, movie manages to pulls you in. Cause story is really good. If somebody asks me ""What is movie?"", I'd say movie is storytelling. You can tell the any story that you want, there is no boundaries. Its up to your imagination, how good it is. Well, this story comes from the master. Real life.

Lion,"""Lion"" is the touching and heartfelt true story of a five-year old Indian boy named Saroo Brierley who gets lost and far from his family, eventually being adopted by Australian parents. Twenty years after this incident, Saroo becomes determined to find his mother, brother, and sister, despite the lack of information that he has. The film is pretty much a perfectly executed feel good movie. It is a deeply human film that pretty much anyone can connect to.What really made this film so good is that it is consistently from the point of view of Saroo. It is a pretty tightly constructed film. The first scenes of the film establish the strong relationship he has with his family, and what surprised me about this movie is that the entire first half is focused on Saroo being lost as a child. The child actor performs incredibly well, and the film simply wouldn't be nearly as emotionally involving without his performance. Since the film is from his point of view, all of the big, scary things that happen to him while he is lost that he doesn't quite understand are not directly explained. One night, while Saroo is sleeping with other children in a train station, he is forced to move because men suddenly appear and begin to physically drag the children away, against their will. Saroo, of course, just runs, and their is never a mention or explanation for it, because Saroo himself doesn't understand it. As a result, the audience member is along for the same ride that Saroo is, and that allows us to feel more emotionally connected to him throughout the story.While Saroo eventually gets two loving Australian parents, he still has troubles in the form of his emotionally challenged adopted brother, and when the film cuts to 20 years later, his brother seems to have nearly disappeared from his life. Now that Saroo is 25, he is going to college, and he soon gets a girlfriend, but after being reminded of his real family and telling his story to his friends, he can't seem to shake the feeling that he needs to find his family, and that becomes his main goal. In fact, he begins to become obsessed with that goal. He has frequent and sudden flashes of memory of his town and his childhood, and this is almost all he can go from, besides the train station he ended up at after getting lost. His obsession pretty much puts all of his relationships on hiatus for years, and although he seems determined to find his real family, he completely forgets about his adopted family, and because of his reclusive behavior his mother feels as if she is losing her children. Nicole Kidman delivers a great performance as Saroo's mother and an emotional monologue describing this. Why Saroo decides not to tell his mother that he quit his job to look for his family remains a mystery to me, but perhaps it is because he didn't want to make her feel unwanted, or build up expectations and then never actually find them.What eventually happens is that those flashes of memory that Saroo has of his hometown that also gave us a deeper emotional connection for him and his family also end up leading him to his home because of recognition of a certain spot on google maps that he then traces to his house. His actual visit to his hometown after over 25 years is one of the most emotionally involving scenes of the year, considering we as the audience have been through this rough journey with him. When Saroo walks through certain spots that both the audience and Saroo recognize from his memories, we share the anticipation of the main character. That means we also share his frustration, then relief, then sadness, and ultimately his overwhelming sense of joy. The music in these scenes also adds to their emotional impact.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

The persistence of memory is exceptionally well illustrated,"I loved this movie uncritically. It's only upon ""thinking"" about it as a work of art that my reaction to it (10) is revised to 9. Some bits are too long (what else is new), and the real-life personages that we see in a video at the end look more interesting than their actor counterparts. The child actors who dominate the first part of the movie are wonderfully effective.Although I've never been lost in the sense of not knowing where to find my family, I identified acutely with the adult Saroo who must wrack his brain and become heavily involved with Google in order to try to find out where he fits into the world. Nearly all of the most important people in my elderly life are persons I met when I was young but ""lost"" for a very long time thereafter.

It's dirty, it's crowded, it's poor -- but we all knew that -- there is no effort to shock us by exaggerating these things, and I appreciate that.

A Roaring Success That Might Spring A Surprise At The Oscars,"As soon as I heard about LION I instantly got it in to my head that I might be watching a reincarnation of SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE . Let's face it , India , street urchins ,rail journeys lasting days , Dev Patel trying to find a special woman in a sub-continent of over a billion people . Seen it all before in an Oscar winning movie from Danny Boyle . If nothing else the challenge of Saroo Brierley trying to find his mother after a gap of 20 years and thousands of miles mirrors that of director Garth Davis trying to make a film that won't have the audience shout out ""Final answer"" . And yet Davis succeeds in a film that might just surprise the Oscars this yearYou might have to meet the film on its own terms in order for it to work fully . By this I mean straight from the opening scene I was expecting a caption to crop up at any moment proclaiming ""Australia 20 years later"" as the pivotal moments in India are shown through flashback . This isn't a film that uses a fractured narrative to tell its story . Instead it's very linear and the first half plays out entirely as a foreign language film . Perhaps I'm misleading you because there is very little dialogue in the first half , instead the audience are asked to feel for the plight of young Saroo and nothing needs to be said . The second half then concentrates on Saroo as a young man in Australia only half complete as a human being as he tries to find his long lost mother and brotherOne genuine criticism I have at this years Oscar nominations is that many of the contenders feel rather poetic , slow and aloof compared to the in your face stylised LA LA LAND . Not to discredit it LION too has a strangely poetic feel but unlike MOONLIGHT which becomes cold and uninvolving after a while LION continues to keep its slightly hypnotic quality . Some people might claim this might be down to a slightly manipulative soundtrack by Bertelman and O'Halloran but I found the score haunting . Indeed the entire film is a haunting experience and is the film I hope will cause a couple of shocks at the Oscars this year .",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
This Lion Gives a Resounding Roar!,"Lion is superbly inspirational and it has Oscar baits all over it. The story sounds so out of this world that part of my mind thought it is a case of God playing a cruel trick just to witness the emotional devastation it would cause. Then the ultimate act of redemption is so moving that God will lift His finger off the button of mass destruction of the world.The first half of the film is simply the best Hindi film I have seen this year that didn't hail from Bollywood. IMHO this has been a disappointing year for Bollywood and thank goodness for Lion for showing the way. The effortless acting by the two child-newcomers, Sunny Pawar and Abhishek Bharate, is so great that I didn't even for one minute think they were acting. I love how Garth Davis captured the Indian cities, and it is even more remarkable that Lion is his first feature film. The city is portrayed like a lurking monster with different terrifying elements out to devour the innocent children. There is also an air of mysticism about it. The direction is assured and never heavy handed. However this is a film of two halves.The first half is so amazing that it is almost a futile task to be able sustain the wondrous energy in the second half. However, Dev Patel as the adult Saroo, demonstrates superb range; he has really blossomed as an actor since Slumdog Millionaire (2008). The problem with it is that it is too pre-defined and you would already know how it would go. Even though the narrative goes through the usual tropes and hits the typical emotional beats with a shoehorned romantic angle, Davis makes a creative choice to skim through and tip- toe round all the usual traumatic scenes, giving the film a refreshing feel. You know exactly what you will see at the end, but kudos to the filmmaker who still succeeds in never cheapening the journey and for making you an emotional wreck of a blubber.When the shameless weeping stopped, I felt my soul displace and move to a different place. This Lion roars resoundingly! The search for identity and home is absorbing and never boring. Don't forget to bring tissue and hankies, and remember there is no shame in crying for it is what makes us human beings.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Saroo's destiny changes from lost to adopted by a well-to-do family from Tasmania. A Proustian moment makes the  adult Saroo start an arduous quest for his roots.,"A little boy who bears a striking resemblance to Chaplin's kid in ""The Kid"". A tear-jerking story bordering on melodrama, but inspired directly from reality. A Tasmanian couple who altruistically decide there are enough people on the face of the Earth, so instead of having their own decide to adopt children already in existence. Beautiful cinematography. A soundtrack that accompanies the action impeccably. Excellent acting skills. We had no idea of all these when we decided to go and watch ""Lion"". We only wanted to watch a film and it seemed the best option at the moment. We enjoyed it tremendously, mainly due to the fact that it is depicting a real life story-otherwise it would be melodramatic. Plus all the reasons stated above. We got home- it is January 24- and were stunned to realize this film had just been nominated to six Oscars! Apart from having our choice so majestically justified by the Academy, the film offered us truthful images of rural India, bustling Calcutta and a glimpse of Tasmanian shores. In spite of its length of almost two hours, ""The Lion"" has you stuck in your seat because it is a story well told , flowing coherently, although the flashbacks are numerous. The tension of the quest is constantly mounting towards the denouement-no spoiler here, since the story is well-known already from the book.The final footage of the real moments of re- connecting was unfortunately lost to many from the public, who were already on their way out of the cinema hall. Too bad for them. At least there were no people left to see me with teary eyes...Long live Google Earth!",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
My favorite movie of all time,"Lion is my favorite movie of all time. No movie ever impacted me so much emotionally. No movie comes even close.I saw Lion in theaters in March of 2017. I never heard of it before that day. I only read about it in the program sheet of the theater, which described it as something along the lines of ""A boy from India is trying to find his family"", a description that doesn't come anywhere close to doing this masterpiece justice.Lion is based on the book ""A Long Way Home"", the true autobiography of Saroo Brierley. As a five-year-old Saroo lived in a poor village with his mother, his older brother, and his baby sister. One day his brother is going away to do work at night for a short time, and despite his initial refusal, Saroo convinces him to let him come along and help him. At the train station of destination young Saroo is way too tired to work, so his brother tells him to stay at the station until he comes back. In the middle of the night Saroo wakes up, he's all alone, he desperately looks for his brother in a train at the platform, and falls asleep again, taking him further and further away from home. One day he's adopted to Australia, and as an adult he's looking for his biological family.I hardly ever cry at movies, but when I said in this theater I was sobbing. Lion is an extremely impactful story that feels the most genuine I've ever seen in a based-on-a-true-story film. Whether as a five-year-old or an adult, you feel for Saroo at every turn. Especially the ending, which I'm not going to spoil, had me cry my eyeballs out. Saroo's search for his biological family and his secrecy about it made a huge impact on the people around him, which was extremely well-realized by the writers. The side characters are also amazing, especially Sue Brierley, Saroo's adoptive mother. There's an immensely powerful scene where she explains why she and her husband chose to adopt Saroo and his adoptive brother Mantosh. The acting is also amazing. Sunny Pawar as young Saroo had one of the best acting debuts I've ever seen. Dev Patel is amazing as adult Saroo, and Nicole Kidman as Sue Brierley is one of the stand-outs as well. The film is extremely well-shot and lit as well, which is only amplified by the lack of any effects. After a couple of minutes you'll forget that you're watching a movie. I also loved that half the movie is in Hindi and Bengali, which provides a whole lot of authenticity. Whenever the characters' real counterparts would've talked in English, Hindi or Bengali, they do so in the movie. Literally my only flaw with the movie was that the character of Mantosh was underdeveloped, I would've liked to get to know him a little more.You won't find out why this movie is called Lion until the very end, but it's a perfect title. Also, if you're living in a country where movies are dubbed into your language, please do NOT watch the dubbed versions, especially not the fully-dubbed ones. The Hindi-Bengali language barrier is an important plotpoint, and it would probably be erased in a dubbed version.I recommend Lion to you 100%. It's the #1 best movie I've seen in my entire life. It's near damn perfect, it's genuine, it shaped many of my views about adoption and parenting, and I hope it will have the same impact on you!",,Anonymous,Biography
How Fully Committed,"As some critics have noted, during the first half of this move we can identify with Sharu who manages to survive after being lost far from home. The second half is more problematic and not just because it is hard to portray, in a movie, the difficulties involved in finding ""home"". But also because the character himself doesn't seem fully convinced of his effort. On the one hand he disparages the first world lifestyle and privilege but he fails to relearn the Hindi language at all. If and when he finds the town in which he grew up one would think he would want to be able to communicate with his relatives and friends without a translator. Of course, this is not just a movie but is based on a true story so that this failing would seem to apply to the real life character. To the extent it does, we identify less with the adult Sharu. The film also has some awkward cuts.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Little Boy Lost,"(RATING: ☆☆☆☆ out of 5)THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: An uplifting and riveting story, given even more credibility due to a strong performance by Dev Petal in the central role.GRADE: BSYNOPSIS: An adopted child searches for his biological mother.JIM'S REVIEW: Garth Davis makes an impressive directorial debut in Lion, the true story of a little boy lost. Through a series of unfortunate incidents, five year-old Saroo (Sunny Pawar, giving a lovely performance) is forced to use his wiles and survival instincts as he is abandoned in the street jungle known as Calcutta, India. He perseveres and grows up to become the child of loving adoptive parents in Australia, all the while yearning to find his way home and the family he left behind.The story elicits an empathetic reaction from any moviegoer and Mr. Davis mostly resists the melodramatic hyperbola and concentrates on the more personal view of a man trying to come to terms with his past. The director tends to overuse cross-cuts of the past and present images to advance the narrative, but emotionally, it's always embraces his audience as we journey along with this child's plight.The screenplay by Luke Davies is based on Saroo's own autobiography, A Long Way Home, and seems to stick to the facts rather well, although some of the minor supporting characters are in need of more depth. Except for Dev Patel as the older Saroo and Nicole Kidman as his adoptive mother, who are both superb, others play a more peripheral role. Especially underdeveloped is Saroo's relationship with (Roma Downey). Also, some of the build-up of Saroo's traumatic upbringing seems spotty, as if some scenes were missing or excised during the filmmaking which could have explained more clearly his sudden behavioral changes and mood swings.Yet the underlying story is still quite powerful and moving. Lion is a well made and thoroughly engrossing film that has enough impact to satisfy the most jaded of viewers.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Prodigal Lost in a Labyrinth,"'Lion' tells the story of one of the 80,000 children who go missing in India each year. One evening, a 6YO boy called Saroo accompanies his older brother who is searching for work in a nearby town. Left alone at a deserted railway station, he wanders into a stationary train to sleep, and awakens to find himself locked inside an empty moving carriage. One thousand miles later, he disembarks in Calcutta, and quickly becomes lost among its teeming masses. For a while Saroo exists on the streets of this vast megalopolis, ignorant of his own full name and that of his home town. He survives human predators of various kinds, before he's taken in by a sinister orphanage. Eventually he's sent for adoption to Australia, and many years later begins the search for his original family.Producers are well aware what kind of 'real' stories appeal to mass audiences, and like so many other based-on-true-story projects, 'Lion' is hemmed in by facts. The film is rescued to some extent by excellent acting, but nobody should expect any big surprises - the ending is obvious from the trailer. The script milks the material for maximum emotional impact, which encourages the viewer to forget about the fate of the other 79,999 lost souls.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography

An Emotional Journey,"What a fabulous film! The first half has sub-titles which could turn some off, but shouldn't. It's set in India, they are speaking Indian and it's all when this lad is very young, becomes lost from his brother, his family. Some of it is difficult to watch as, in truth, this sort of thing does happen to so many youngsters there. But it will grab your heart and hold on tight. There should be an Oscar for those 12 or 14 years old and younger. I thought that when Sixth Sense came out and I think it even more with this picture. Sunny Pawar is amazing. He, and his voice, will stay with you – well, if like me – probably forever. The movie loses the sub-titles and switches to English when this little lost child is adopted by a family in Australia where Nicole Kidman as his new mother is wonderful. This is an emotional movie from beginning to end. Dev Patel is one of my favorites anyway and he literally shines in this picture. Perfection. I felt wrung out, but not unhappy when I left the theater. And this is not a spoiler but you won't discover why the movie is titled Lion until the very end. This one has Oscar winners written all over it.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Thoughtful and thought provoking,"This film presents the dilemma of the adopted child. Did my parents not want me? Did they search for me? Will I upset my adoptive parents if I seek my birth parents? But it also presents more. The grinding poverty in India and the plight of lost children. Why they are lost does not matter - they fall prey to abusers and the system itself creaks and strains to cope.Of course, these issues will pull on the emotions, but the film never presents situations simply to give an emotion rush. The situations it portrays are real and with is today. They deserve to evoke an emotional response.The acting is top notch - the writing of the characters and the performances are engaging.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Lion feels like two separate films; we liked the first but not the second! (Audio),"Our Hollywood critics, Les Roberts and Ann Elder, decided that Lion feels jarringly like a two part film. They absolutely adored the performances of the young Saroo and his brother. However, they felt that the grown Saroo (played by Dev Patel) should have moved them to tears. This true story, based on Saroo's search for his family was definitely sentimental, but it simply missed the mark. The flashbacks were sweet, but they were interjected somewhat jarringly at times.Lion feels like two separate films; we liked the first but not the second! Overall, Ann and Les gave it a ""yellow"" light, meaning this movie is definitely worth watching, but approach it with caution. The direction is amiss, as are some of the performances. However, the cinematography and performance of the young Saroo are breathtaking.Ann and Les discuss more aspects of the film in podcast form here: https://www.thefrontporchpeople.com/greenlightreviews/lion",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Warm and well composed story brought to life by stunning performance.,"Lion is a film that I put off watching for far too long. I heard a little negative feedback from a friend whose opinions are usually reliable, and there was so much else coming out that I just didn't get around to putting this on. And boy, had I been missing out!As if the story wasn't heart-wrenching enough, the production elements contributed equally to provide an incredible two hours of colour and sound that underlined and enhanced every moment of the film.The bar for child actors has been well and truly raised by Sunny Pawar as he runs into the first part of the film with a gaze that you can't tear yourself way from. There's so much going on in his eyes that you could probably get people to watch an hour of him staring at a camera.Dev Patel is excellent as usual, though perhaps not as commanding as Sunny in his screen presence. He works alongside the other well- known faces as they come together to support the first forty minutes of excellence in an admirable fashion.If you are prone to tearing up at films, I suggest you have a box of tissues close at hand.Do not let the negative reviews put you off from watching this. It will warm your heart and make you realise the value of the thing that matters most: family.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Journey Worth Taking,"Lion isn't the most tightly directed film, nor the most emotionally impactful. But it's one of the most unique films I've seen this year. So much like Captain Fantastic, I really like the film as a whole, but I appreciate the film's originality even more.I always love sitting down for a film that's structured entirely different than your prototypical movie thrown in theaters every weekend. I love blockbusters as much as the next guy, but there's something to be said about smaller and more independently made features. Lion is based on a true story about an adopted boy, Saroo, who uses google earth to try and find his original family from India.As happens sometimes with true stories adapted into feature length films, it's difficult to structure a 2 hour story from events that took place over the course of several years. Lion begins when Saroo is only five years old, and spans over 20 years. To say this was a difficult story to adapt is an understatement, and I think this is the only area where the film really has some faults. After spending significant screen time with a young Saroo, you are asked to then follow a late 20's Saroo, played by Dev Patel, and it's not the smoothest of transitions. Granted, I got over it after a few scenes, but the very nature of this story makes it difficult to keep the flow even throughout.Patel, along with his young counterpart, Sunny Pawar, are terrific. As a first time actor, Pawar, had to take on an entire first act by himself, and you'd think he'd been doing this for years already. It's unlikely he'll come close to winning, but he should be considered for best supporting actor. You can't find that much charisma at that age easily.When Lion hits emotionally, it really hits. I think it's the time in between that takes the overall quality of the film down a notch. Some sporadic pacing and a story that calls for a wandering plot makes for a mediocre experience. But when the film chooses to sink your teeth into an extremely engrossing journey into what it feels like to be lost, it contains some of the most emotionally impactful sequences. The last shot says it all. I just wish it wasn't so few and far between.+Some heavy, heavy stuff here+Pawar is a young star+A Journey worth taking-Pacing-Story sometimes strays away from where it should stay7.8/10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Bring some tissues...,"I've had this movie sitting on my shelf for far too long, only recently deciding to watch it.I hate this film... I hate how much it tugged my heart strings with its premise (how a boy ended up in international adoption), I hate how good the acting was (especially the child acting), I hate the compelling drama in that fantastic first act, I hate that I was in tears by the halfway point and had to pause the film to sort myself out, I hate the perspective on culture/nurture and the effects of trauma... I hate this film!!!! (This is sarcasm just to be clear).With that said I cannot recommend this film for viewing enough, it's well crafted from beginning to end. Everyone brings their a-game behind and in front of the camera. Imagine an adult Don Bluth (in his prime) experience that doesnt shy away from breaking your heart before doing some much needed mending. The child actors were phenomenal and like I've already said that first act of the film is amplified by those performances. I fear I'll spoil the story if I speak on it too much, but what I can say is its adoption from the adopted ones perspective from childhood to adulthood. The rest I leave to you dear viewer... bring tissues.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Tale of Two Movies (In One),"Whilst as an Australian, I am pleased to see Lion was such a domestic and international commercial success, honesty behooves me in suggesting that it is one of the most over rated films I've seen in quite awhile.The first half (and with its chronologically linear structure, this is indeed a film of two distinct halves) featuring the remarkable talents of Sunny Pawar as young Saroo Brierley is brilliantly structured by debuting director Garth Davis . It's full of pathos, suspense and drama, set against a richly involving Northern Indian backdrop of both realistic rural and urban locations. The little dialogue spoken through this portion of the film is Hindi, which is entirely appropriate, as we witness the fateful occurrences which lead Saroo to be separated from his family and in due course find the boy adopted by an Australian couple from the island state of Tasmania.Greig Fraser's cinematography, as it did in the Indian first half, portrays the natural beauty of both the Tasmanian countryside and its charming capital city, Hobart, both rarely seen in contemporary Australian films. However through no fault of the actors, whose performances are never less than highly competent, it is here where the story begins to slow and then grind to its inevitable conclusion. The problem is the drama as we begin to see is relatively light weight. Boy separated from his natural family, a world away, wants, at the very least, a few answers. Arguably, in times such as they are, characterised by a high degree of international trans-migration, this is likely to be a common source of teenage angst. The suspense and unpredictable nature of the film's first half becomes lost amidst an atmosphere of one man's increasingly high anxiety.Davis and screen writer Luke Davies attempt to compensate by dialing up the human drama surrounding the adult Saroo, played very impressively by Dev Patel, whose Australian accent is surprisingly authentic. Saroo has a loose cannon adopted brother. Saroo has a supportive girl friend, with whom he breaks up and later with whom he reacquaints (Rooney Mara, who really isn't given much scope to show her acting chops here). Saroo has loving adoptive parents (David Wenham and Nicole Kidman) who also only wish the best for him. (One feels in particular, that Kidman's role as his mother Sue is clearly padded out, as arguably befitting her international star status.) All well and good, but on a dramatic level not unlike an episode of The Young and the Restless.Rarely have I seen a film of two such contrasting halves in terms of dramatic content and cinematic quality. Lion received six Oscar nominations at the 89th Academy Awards, but did not win in any of the categories. Poetic justice in my opinion. Ultimately, it didn't deserve any.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Brilliant and touching,"I'm winding down a ""14 movies in 14 nights"" quest, and finally watched this film, which has been on my radar for years. And I loved it. It's a story that probably would be laughed out of a pitch meeting if it wasn't true, anchored by a wonderful star (Dev Patel) and a novice child actor (Sunny Pawar) who steals the show. The heartbreaking premise of a ""child lost forever,"" alone in a land of a billion people, is lovingly told, and the themes of love and loss, heartache and redemption, and the depths you will go to ""find yourself"" are explored and brilliantly on display. If you don't reach for a tissue near the end, you may not be human. Thought provoking, hugely rewarding, and well done by all. A gem.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Brilliantly acted and incredibly emotional,"Lion is based on a true story but at the same time manages to be a very powerful film, well paced and without being boring but still sticking to the original message.The acting is superb, especially from young Sunny Pawar as Saroo when he was a child. Pawar was one of, if not the single best child actor I have ever seen and he absolutely deserved an Oscar in my books. Dev Patel is as great as ever and Rooney Mara does a fine job as his girlfriend along with Nicole Kidman and David Wenham as Saroo's adoptive parents.The story is all completely true and is portrayed extremely emotionally, the cinematography is good in the way in focuses on and portrays poverty, very technically strong too. Saroo is a very strong boy who has to fight to avoid human traffickers and make enough money to help his family, as well as being in a part of the country where he doesn't know the language. Without spoling too much the ending is both heart-breaking and bittersweet.10/10: Perfect film",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Surprisingly Hollow,"Born in rural destitution, the 5-year-old Saroo followed his older brother to the local railway station one night. He fell asleep in a train car, and woke up 900 miles away edging towards the bustling city of Calcutta. After weeks of scavenging for scraps near the rails, Saroo was brought to a center for abandoned children and quickly adopted by a an Australian couple who raised and took care of him for 25 years.Lion's Dickensian tale of a displaced child who is adopted, brought to a faraway land and decides to trek back in search of his real family, is all the more harrowing when you consider the whole thing is a true story. While Saroo's ""A Long Way Home"" never really caught fire in the west until, well until just now, the story was all the rage back in India and Australia. In addition to being a challenging but ultimately heartwarming story of loss, reunion and renewal, the tale also works as a rallying cry, by drawing attention to India's indignant, indifferent and sometimes predatory policies towards impoverished children.Yet despite the story's obvious appeal and the anchored authority of it being true, there's still something about Lion that rings a hollow note. Part of might have something to do with director Garth Davis's approach to the material. As a fairly green feature length director, Davis injects the screen with liberal amounts of stylistic bravado, as if to show the audience what he as a storyteller can do. He uses a host of not just visual motifs but story devices to achieve his ends including prolonged fever dreams of the older Saroo (Patel), struggling with the penumbras of his young brother Guddu (Bharate) desperately searching for him. This of course is all set to a score that plucks on the heart strings like the licks of a wistful sitar.It's dapper film work to be sure, but it does surprisingly little as world building technique. That problem that is compounded when the young Saroo (Pawar) travels to Australia to meet his new parents (Kidman and Wenham). The camera likes to doddle on Saroo gingerly touching a TV for the first time and seeing a full fridge for the first time and ignores the multitude of micro-expressions that the cast is trying convey. At many points Lion felt less like a movie about people than about moving parts.The best parts of the film are the parts that feel the most honest. The scenes involving the budding courtship of college-aged Saroo and Lucy (Mara), all have a certain giddiness to them. On the opposite side of the emotional spectrum, Nawazuddin Siddiqui's minor role is so effectively creepy that you almost forget he's one of the most recognizable pacesetters in modern Bollywood. There is also a quiet scene in a classmates kitchen where for the first time as an adult, Saroo realizes there is something dolefully missing from his bourgeois life. It is at that moment Patel truly shows he's got a range that few movies would allow him to exercise.Yet every time Dev Patel, Nicole Kidman and Rooney Mara transcend to do some of their most compelling work, we're once again distracted by the shorthand version of truly effective film making. Sadly at these moments, you become aware that you're not watching the best version of this story but merely an inauthentic distillation. A white dude's version, of a white dude's script adapted for white people looking for the same high they got watching Slumdog Millionaire (2008).Unfortunately Lion leaves a little too much to be desired as a cinematic experience. It dances frustratingly close to the edge of being not just good but great, but ultimately leans on cliché and hackneyed movie-of-the-week dramatics to pull its story through. Those inclined to see Lion, should definitely wait through the credits. Surprisingly you get more of an emotional payoff watching the Brierley family home videos than you do watching everything else.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Intresting Movie,"Lion (2016) is a movie that was strongly recommended by a friend that I watched on a long plane ride on Delta. The storyline is about an Indian man who was separated from his family, becomes an orphan and is adopted by an Australian family. He has a fantastic upbringing and great opportunities for success but at 30 he decides to retrace his background and his original parents. This movie is directed by Garth Davis (Mary Magdalene) in his directorial debut and stars Dev Patel (Slum Dog Millionaire), Rooney Mara (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo), David Wenham (Lord of the Rings) and Nicole Kidman (Cold Mountain). The storyline for this picture is outstanding. The challenges of an orphan and his desire to know who he truly is, is so well depicted.

"Strong First Half, Weaker Second Half","You will be tempted, when thinking about whether or not to see the Oscar nominated film, LION, to recall back to another Oscar nominated film set primarily in India - SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE.  Don't do it.  This film does not hold a candle to SLUMDOG.That doesn't make this a bad film.LION tells the story of Saroo, who, as a child, is separated from his family and becomes a homeless child on the streets of Calcutta.  Eventually, he is adopted by a couple in Australia.  25 years later, he is haunted by his past and sets out to find his hometown, and his birth family.Sounds like a heartwarming tale that will fill you with love and tears in the end, doesn't it?  If only that were the case.  This film spends A lot of time watching our hero search the Internet (perhaps the appearance of a search bar in the films poster should have been a giveaway).  To be fair, this is a truthful way of showing how this ""based on a true story"" film played out in real life.  The only problem is that this is not very compelling for a film audience and this bogs down the film at the crucial 2/3 part of the film, thus washing away most of the good performances, good filmmaking and good will that this film had built upBut the build up is quite good.I usually start with the performances, but I think this film needs to start with the atmosphere, setting and mood.  Director Garth Davis is known primarily as an Artist and Designer and it shows.  The mood that is reflected in the pictures that he shows on the screen are strong (especially at the beginning), his use of music to reflect what is occurring is an aide to the story he wants to tell and the colors he employs help to bring forth the story.  This is both a blessing and a curse, for there are stretches of just ""mood"" and, after awhile, it bogged the story down.As for the acting, Dev Patel and Nicole Kidman both, rightfully, achieved Supporting nominations for their work here.  Patel  is growing stronger as an actor and is the anchor of the second half of this film as the older Saroo.  In limited screen time, Kidman, is very good as Saroo's adoptive mother and has the ""Academy Award Scene"" of this film.  Both are helped by strong performances by Rooney Mara and David Wenham as Saroo's girlfriend and adoptive father.  The problem is that all 4 of these performances are in the 2nd half of the film, the weaker half.The stronger first half of the film is anchored by a charming performance by Sunny Pawar as the young Saroo.  He moves through his adventures with aplomb, grit and a sense of ""moving forward' that instantly gets you rooting for him, so you are thrilled when he succeeds by getting adopted.There are missteps in this film - almost all in the 2nd half.  As I stated, we spend a good deal of time watching Saroo search the Internet.  His obsession with finding his birth location turns this lovable character into something less than lovable.  While it is ""true to life"" it is always disappointing to see the change in someone.  This change was so jarring that I wasn't rooting for him at the end and the climax was anti-climactic for me.  There also is a sub-plot involving Saroo's adoptive brother that never really goes anywhere and Rooney Mara's character becomes bland.But,despite these, this is a film that you should see.  It brings the American audience into a world that we haven't seen much of - and that is fascinating, and guided by a charming young presence that makes this journey that is worth taking.Letter grade:  B7 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Lion-Hearted,"Even though looking forward to seeing it - I was sceptical about 'Lion' and remain so with regards to a couple of story elements (screenplay to blame?) Otherwise, there was little to disappoint as it carried the viewer deeper into its harrowing situations. It's a difficult film to review as it's not in any way your standard story. Lion is a gut tearing true story about the fear of separation and extreme loss of the safety of family.The horror of seeing vulnerable children placed in shocking institutions - controlled by vile people - who should never be placed in positions of access, brings home the desperation of third world poverty. The screenplay by Luke Davis represents an adaption of the autobiographical novel by Saroo Brierley (Sheru Khan) and does well to capture the 'sweep' of the dramatic situations. Although, much credit has to go to Australian director Garth Davis, with this, his first feature movie. Both the dramatic production and sound designs are enhanced superbly with score music by two pianists, German, Hauschka and American, Dustin J. O'Halloran. This combination adds a strong atmospheric soundscape throughout this thoughtful film.The cinematography (on both sides of the world) is quite stunning with just a few minor scenes suffering shaky hand-held shots. Some say the movies pace changes for the last half – I would think it should, as the first half is a desperate search - leaving a definite need to allow for some serious introspection on the 'lost' lad's newly adopted life - in this strange land. This journey is never 'slow' as the searching for his soul family is ever ongoing. Performances by all concerned are heartfelt (despite what some may say) making Lion an exceptional experience that should not be missed by admirers of quality fact- based storytelling.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Liked it, but overly sentimental","Liked the India part way best, with little Saroo lost and bewildered trying to get home. In Tasmania, to me, the story faltered and was inconsistent with a lot of logic and story flow flaws. Not getting overwhelmed by emotion, I looked for the bits and pieces that told a complete story of a lost kid's almost divine rescue from probable tragedy. Little Sunny was great as Little Saroo, and Dev Patel was good as older Saroo. Nicole Kidman was also really good as his adoptive mom.As an internet researcher, I found that older Saroo was not very good at connecting the dots in order to find his home and his Mum in India. If I did it, first I would best figure how far he traveled by time and train speed, find a town name that was closest to what he remembered it to be, find if it had a water tower, then a covered rail station, sited next to woods and a rock quarry, on and on. Wouldn't take long, certainly not as long as it took him, so that was a very weak part to me, but it added to movie drama, of course. And, I must allow that he was delayed in his search by his dreams progressively telling him more details about his childhood home that led him further into his search.Sorry to get so scientific about such an emotional movie, but I saw too many realism flaws to make it a more rewarding story to me in the second half.

Lion's warm and inspirational true story doesn't translate perfectly to film,"Lion's warm and inspirational true story cannot be faulted or labelled as anything less than powerful or moving, yet the film doesn't always manage to capture this essence in its purest form and somehow loses twenty years of the story along the way, leaving the rest of the narrative a little thin on the ground and thus disengaging. It absolutely has its moments of real greatness, with a really solid start that renders a young Saroo's journey as a profound one - but the second half begins to undo that with too many coincidences and conventionalities that prevents the story's translations on to the big screen from being a wholly successful and effective one. It's a real shame that it cannot maintain the goodwill of its first half, as the general cast do a really tremendous job of making us feel sympathetic towards the characters they bring to life and the hard work put in by the writers and director is unquestionable. A few errors in this piece really has prevented it from ascending to greatness or award season worthiness, but I am absolutely sure there will be many more out there who are more impacted by this piece of filmmaking than I was.FULL REVIEW - http://perksofbeingnath.blogspot.com/2017/01/lion-2017-review.html",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
A WONDERFUL FILM,"A wonderful film, and very moving. Little Sonny should have won an award. He wa absolutely fascinating as an actor.Dev Patel was perfect for the role of Soroo.

A Winning Effort for Dev Patel,"Dev Patel saves this film which would otherwise be a bit of a muddle. There are many winning qualities - the beautiful cinematography, the apparently accurate but still sympathetic portrayal of the Indian condition, the sweeping feel of the narrative itself, and most especially the winning portrayal of young Saroo as a 5-year-old. But without Patel these qualities would not be enough. Realizing that this is an Australian film (Australian story-telling techniques often utilize different formats than American), the loose ends are still distracting. Characters and details are presented and then dropped without regard to continuity. Continuing characters go through changes that are not even hinted before they are portrayed. The screenplay is based on a memoir by Patel's character; the book itself is often described as a novel. So we are left to question just how much was truly remembered and how much was supplemented. (Patel's alter ego did not write screenplay.) No matter. Patel hurtles through all of this and makes it work. Now he needs to start finding some non-ethnic roles; he certainly has the chops.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Predictable bore,"I have lately enjoyed a number of Indian movies. They are getting better all the time. Most foreign films are getting way more interesting than the often formulaic US blockbusters. I looked forward to this, after all the hype. Nicole Kidman could only be expected to add to the mix. She has rarely disappointed me. However after the tantalizing start, the director just played out a limo stretch of a glossed over photo shop job with an dishearteningly predictable and pathetic attempt at pulling on heart strings. It may have possibly worked in the black and white silent era on my doting aunties. The director seems to have got bored and just carried on lamely to fulfill his contractual obligations. I had given up on a twist or flourish way before the end. Very disappointing indeed.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Lost in India, found in Australia!","Based on the book 'A Long Way Home' that tells the story of a young Indian boy who lost his brother in a railway station in the night and the next morning he woke up thousands kilometers away from home. Not knowing the language or the address and the names of his family, he struggled from various threats in the society. After that he got adopted from an Australian family and the rest of the film revolved on his true identity. Haunted by his past, how he rediscovered his originality was emotionally told.Very impressive film. The families should not miss it. Even though it is a must see by all ages. I am not a big fan of Dev's performances, even in his debut film 'Slumdog Millionaire'. After that success, he had survived in the film industry doing decent roles, for like a decade. But it was 'The Man Who Knew Infinity' that changed his career. For the first time I liked him very much in that, and again he was pretty impressive in this. The second best performance in his career. Though his part comes only after the half way mark. Yet in that one hour, he did great, particularly in the sentiments.I was wondering why it was called 'Lion'. And I got answered only just before the end credit. So you should be patient to learn why, if you are yet to see it. It was not until the 90s the India began to see a real change. This story takes place in the mid 80s, only the opening half and those parts were raw and cruel, especially in the eyes of an 8 year old boy. That kid was so good. Just like Jacom Tremblay, a year before who impressed us with his performance from the film 'Room'.It was a feature film debut for the director and he was wonderful in this attempt. The film splits into two, the first half was about lost and the following half is about finding the road back to the home. Less dialogues, but well written in those necessary parts. The music was good. Only negative was the film was out of depth. Yeah, all the events were like fast forward. If they had focused on details, the narration would have reached at least 3 hours. Especially I wanted the Australian mother's perspective on how she went through to raise those kids.Now I'm waiting for the 2020. I mean 2008 was SDM, 2012 was LoP and 2016 was this one. The 4 years later, surely there will be another India related western film would come. Despite this film nominated for the 6 Oscars, it had won nothing. That's very sad. Overall, I strongly suggest it. One of the best films of the Year.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Tearjerker,"This movie was good, but I wouldn't say great. Slumdog Millionaire was a lot better. This movie just did what it did, and just sort of deviated from that movie. It took it in Australia though, that was the difference.The movie surprisingly was mostly covering the guys childhood. I found that intriguing and fun to watch. The way he struggles. His adult life was kind of bland. He wasn't that cool or anyone special. Though he is celebrated when he goes back to India. That was interesting. The man should have done something exciting with his life in Australia. He didn't seem to enjoy it as much.The movie is about a boy who gets lost from his poor family in India. He goes into foster care, and is sent to Australia. He grows up into a gentleman, and goes back to India to find his family.It was a definite tearjerker at the end. It was alright, nothing I think back to at all.Good I guess. Worth a watch. Kind of bland.6 stars",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Good,"Whenever I wander in the streets of the Moroccan Medina, I feel at home. There's that strange mixture of various fragrances floating in the air: spices, kebab, frying delicacies (not much different from these appetizing jelabis), sea spray from the fish market, tanned leather from the shoe shop and this whole conglomerate smell outsiders or tourists might feel stinky, but as far as ""my"" senses are concerned, ""there's no place like home"". I didn't pick it, it picked me.And maybe there's something innately circular about life, we're born home, we move close or far from it, and there's the need to get back. I even have a personal theory: that even your children can find a deep ""connection"" with the place you were born in, your home will also feel like home for them. And it is indeed ""A Long Way Home"", the poignant and inspiring story of Saroo Brierley, born in India, lost at the age of five, adopted by an Australian couple and reuniting with his mother and his family twenty-five years later. What else can be said? It's a simple story but it's often in the most plain-looking grounds that you can find the most precious gems.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Heart wrenching,"A really very nice take on biopics. It is like two or three films with different flavour are joined very nicely. the first 50 minutes are well directed. One can watch and understand it without dialogue. A visually strong part.
The part where Dev Patel and Rooney Mara starts romance (with Rahman's URVASHI URVASHI in background) is lovely.
Theme is strong and so many can connect with that with their perspective. The montages of switching shots between two different countries, India and Tasmania, are really good and moving. The one scene with google earth montages is also powerful.
Cinema as a medium is brilliantly used in this real life story.

"A movie that is easy to see why it was nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars, while at the same time easy to see why it didn't win","""I'm not from Calcutta. I'm lost."" When Saroo (Patel) was a young boy he became lost in the city of Calcutta. After falling asleep on a train he wakes up thousands of kilometers away with no idea where he is or how to speech the language. He is eventually adopted by Sue Brierley (Kidman) and her husband and starts his new life. Unable to forget his past, Saroo finally decides to seek out his home, mother and brother. This is a true story that is full of emotion and questions. Patel's acting in this is amazing. This is a movie that you really find yourself sucked in and rooting for Saroo to find his answers, while at the same time feeling a little bittersweet when thinking about his adopted mother. This is a movie where there isn't really a whole lot to talk about since the movie is basically just him looking for his family but that doesn't mean its boring at all. I did like this.

LION,"Although this is a theatre worthy film, this astonishing tale of a young boy in India who lost his way and found himself in a foreign country with adopted parents triggers audiences to relate and connect emotionally with the child actor Sunny Pawer, this is sadly not the case later on in the film.LION fast forward 20 years into the future, when Dev Patel steps in as Saroo which alters the film entirely, the confusing and unclear events is hard to catch up on and comprehend. It's depressing acts and poor attempt to exaggerate panic, desperateness and helplessness does not connect with the audience like the promising beginning.

Really good film,"A lot of people are criticising the second half of the film, saying it is slow paced and drawn out compared to part 1, but I really liked that contrast. It shows that no much how much privilege you have, the heart can still be restless and needs to find where it belongs. I think Dev is a very likeable actor even though he was miscast in this role; he looked unsure of himself in a lot of scenes and didn't resemble Saroo at all, physically or emotionally. It was like they shoe-horned a famous Indian actor and hoped the audience wouldn't notice. But the film is what it is so good on him for trying. I hope he finds the confidence to back himself on other projects because Hollywood has a tendency to move on to younger, more confident and bankable stars.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Powerful and Emotional Journey Home,"Lion, directed by Garth Davis, is a deeply moving film based on the true story of Saroo Brierley. The film follows Saroo, a young Indian boy who gets lost far from home and is eventually adopted by an Australian couple. Years later, as an adult, he embarks on an emotional quest to find his biological family using Google Earth.Positive Aspects:Outstanding Performances: Dev Patel delivers a heartfelt and gripping performance as the adult Saroo, while Sunny Pawar, playing young Saroo, steals the show with his innocence and emotional depth. Nicole Kidman also shines as Saroo's adoptive mother.Emotional Impact: The film is deeply touching, with moments that feel both heartbreaking and uplifting. Saroo's journey resonates universally, making it a story of identity, loss, and love.Beautiful Cinematography: The film captures the vibrancy of India and the contrast of Saroo's new life in Australia, using breathtaking visuals to enhance the storytelling.Powerful Score: Dustin O'Halloran and Hauschka's musical score perfectly complements the film's emotional weight, making key moments even more impactful.Negative Aspects:Pacing Issues: While the first half, focusing on young Saroo, is gripping and intense, the second half slows down in parts, particularly as adult Saroo struggles with his inner turmoil.Limited Character Development for Supporting Roles: Some secondary characters, including Saroo's adoptive brother and his girlfriend (played by Rooney Mara), could have been explored further.Final Verdict:Lion is a deeply emotional and inspiring true story that leaves a lasting impact. Despite minor pacing issues, the film is carried by phenomenal performances, stunning cinematography, and a moving soundtrack. It's a must-watch for those who appreciate powerful, human-centered storytelling.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Vast Landscapes,"Essentially a film in two parts, the first hour of 'Lion' covers the struggles of a young Indian boy who gets separated from his family in the 1980s, while the second half deals with the boy now grown up, living with an adoptive family in Australia and keen to track his birth mother and actual family down. With a significant chunk of time omitted in between these time periods, 'Lion' never quite feels cohesive, however, both time periods are encapsulating and the film therefore manages to tell two compelling tales within the one film. With large, expressive eyes, first time actor Sunny Pawar as excellent as the protagonist as a boy who finds himself weary and unable to trust anyone after the separation from his family, and eerily enough, none of the authority figures he meets have even heard of his hometown. Equally as good is Dev Patel as the boy grown up who, after learning about Google Earth, becomes 'A Beautiful Mind'-like obsessed with tracking down his Indian family, quitting his job, walls covered in maps and pins, etc. This section of the film may have benefited from a greater depiction of the toll his quest has on his health (physical and mental) and livelihood, driven nearly over the brink by his unwillingness to tell his foster parents of his search, lest they be offended - however it is all interesting to watch all the same. Nicole Kidman is also solid in a small but pivotal role as his foster mother and the aerial photography throughout appropriately captures the vastness of not only India but Australia, emphasising just how significant an achievement his search is.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Good movie,"Do you know the feeling you get when you go into a film with no expectations at all or thinking it might be decent, and the film turns out to not only be good, but blows you away by how amazing it ends up being? That's LION, and if you've been watching films for several years like me thinking you've seen everything committed to cinema, it's a fantastic feeling to be proved wrong.Let me explain to you exactly what I experienced while watching LION: Almost half of the film is in Hindi, which lends incredible authenticity to the story, not that BS where they have actors in which English is their second language speak English for the sake of sparing the American audience from reading subtitles (I'm looking at you, MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA, and every other Hollywood movie ever made). In fact, the entire first act takes place in India, where about 40 minutes of the film rides on the shoulders of a first time child actor - played by the wonderful Sunny Pawar - and it's one of the best first acts I've seen in years. Think of it like the silent first act of Wall-E; it feels like it can be its own film, yet the filmmakers do a great job connecting the story once Dev Patel comes on screen.On top of that, the filmmaking is impressive. The script is fantastic, the cinematography is lush, the soundtrack complements the film really nicely, and the pacing is on point where it rarely feels like it's dragging, despite the story taking place over the course of 25 years. Every actor in here is also terrific in their roles. As stated earlier, Sunny Pawar makes a compelling lead for the first third of the film.

He's forced to be wise beyond his years and does so much without dialogue. In the second half, Dev Patel is equally endearing. Seeing his growing pain as he feels guilty for things out of his control is heartbreaking and makes the conclusion all the more impactful.Garth Davis directs with care and sensitivity, aided by beautiful cinematography by Greig Fraser.

Respects the humanity of its characters,"Whether Harvey Weinstein's purpose in producing Lion was to add to his collection of Oscars or just to tell a sweet, heartfelt story about a lost boy searching for his home, the result is that he has probably accomplished both. Directed by Garth Davis (""Top of the Lake,"" TV Series) the film tells the moving story of Saroo Brierley, a boy seeking to find his way back to India after having lived in Australia for 25 years, a country 5,000 miles away. Written by Luke Davies (""Life"") and based on Brierley's memoir, A Long Way Home, young Saroo (Sunny Pawar) is an impoverished 5-year-old boy from the village of Ganesh Talai in the Khandwr Province of India. Insisting that he go to work at night with his older brother Guddu (Abhishek Bharate), he falls asleep at the train station and becomes separated from Guddu.Frightened, he boards an empty train and ends up in Calcutta, almost 1000 miles away from Guddu, his sister Shekila (Khushi Solanki), and his mother Kamla (Priyanka Bose, ""Half Ticket""). Saroo is a strong little boy, yet the fact that he cannot remember his mother's name or the name of his village and cannot speak Bengali makes him prey for predators. Confused and afraid, he seeks the help of strangers, looks for places to sleep, and has to escape from a threatening situation. When he ends up at the police station, he is sent to a crowded and oppressive orphanage where, with the help of a compassionate social worker, he is fortunate enough to be adopted by Sue and John Brierley (Nicole Kidman, ""Secret in Their Eyes"" and David Wenham, ""Goldstone""), a loving family in Hobart, Tasmania.Here he must forget about his old family and adjust to a new home and a new country. A year later, the Brierley's adopt another Indian boy, Mantosh (Keshav Jadhav), but this time they are not as fortunate as Mantosh has both physical and mental problems. Jumping ahead twenty five years, Saroo (now played by Dev Patel, ""The Man Who Knew Infinity"") has gone to Melbourne to study Hotel Management but his memories are reactivated when the Indian food served at a party thrown by his girlfriend Lucy (Rooney Mara, ""Carol"") bring back thoughts of his family in India. It is now 2008 and the introduction of new Internet technology such as Google Earth allows him to believe that he might, after all these years, be able to find his way back home.Grateful to his new mom and dad who raised him, he has not told them of his background for fear of hurting them. Now that he can see a path back to his roots, his conflicting emotions make it doubly hard for him to communicate. When Sue finds out about his past, however, she is happy for him and wants his real mother to know how well he has turned out. In one of the most poignant moments of the film, Sue tells Saroo about a vision she had when she was younger that led her to adopt children rather than have her own. It is a moment of pure transcendence.The story that eventually takes us back to Ganesh Talai might seem far-fetched and manipulative if it were not for the fact that it actually happened. Though Lion has its flaws and is hindered by a failure to probe deeply into the inner life of its characters, the performances, especially those of Pawar and Patel, are so convincing that the narrative comes across as completely believable. While the film has emotional highs and lows that may induce copious tears, a fact that some of our more cynical critics will not hesitate to point out, Davis trusts his audience enough to keep the manipulative aspects of the film to a minimum and respect the humanity of its characters.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

10/10  And the Oscar for best film goes to ......,"GO SEE IT .Films just do not get any better than this . Truly exceptional . Everything you could want in a film , No lions were hurt during the making of this film but make sure you take a box of tissues. Where do I start ? The story is heartwarming and will have you crying , smiling and cheering . The acting was superb , Dev Patel is superb as the mature Saroo and Sunny Pawar was magical as Young Sarro.Although it would be wrong to compare this to Slumdog Millionaire ,it has all the hallmarks that made that film enjoyable to watch and has all the hallmarks that make it deserve to win the Oscar for best film , if Lalaland wins it'll be a travesty .The Weinstein company have the Midas touch , and this is a worthy addition to their incredible success in backing winning films . How they made this film for only $12m is a miracle especially with a major star Nicole Kidman in a supporting role. David Wenham and both actors playing Mantosh deserve credit .The cinematography was amazing and will make you want to visit India and Tasmania .10/10 need I say more ?",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Alone and desperate on the streets of Calcutta,"Lion (2016) was directed by Garth Davis. It's a coming of age story, but the story it tells is not one that you'll see in many movies. (I'm sure you could see stories like it every day in Calcutta, but those stories don't usually come to the screen.)Sunny Pawar plays the protagonist, Saroo, as a child. By bad luck, Saroo is locked inside a railway car at a station near his home. When he gets out of the train he's in Calcutta. He's trapped in a totally different world--urban rather than rural--and a different culture--people speak Bengali and not Hindi. By utilizing ingenuity and intelligence, Saroo manages to survive. Ultimately he's placed in an orphanage, and adopted by an Australian couple, John and Sue Brierley (David Wenham and Nicole Kidman). Wenham and Kidman both do a fine job, in roles that don't really use their talents fully.Saroo is portrayed by Dev Patel as a young adult. He has done very well in the home of the Brierley family, but he can't forget that he had a home and a family in India. The remainder of the plot follows from there.To a certain extent, Lion has been billed as a love story between Patel and Rooney Mara, who portrays his girlfriend, Lucy. Rooney Mara is adorable, but she's not the co-star. I think the love story between the two of them is a fairly awkward plot device. Mara has two expressions--loving and happy, and loving and sad.The real stars of the film are Sunny Pawar and Dev Patel. You really believe in both of their characters, and you can see how the young Saroo could have become the young adult Saroo. Both of them portray their roles brilliantly, and the movie would be worth seeing just to watch them act. (It's a bright, colorful, noisy movie, but it's not costumes, or cinematography, or hundreds of extras that make this film work. It's the acting of Pawar and Patel.)This movie will be better watched in a theater than on the small screen, because of the vast expanses of scenery in all of the locations. We saw this movie at the excellent Little Theatre in Rochester, NY. On Christmas/Chanukah day, 2016, the Little Theatre showed Lion, Fences, Manchester by the Sea, and Jackie. What other theater in New York Skate could match that combination?",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

"I do not wanna put any summery, because a movie has to be discover in front of  big screen.","A wonderful movie. I don't know about others new movies, but this should win an Oscar🏆. Sometimes a movie is wonderful when it teaches you something important about life, like this movie did to me. Half of the movie is in Indian and this give a lot of credibility to the movie. The children and his brother act very well. These two thinks help me to understand something that with my life comforts were not easy for me to understand, we hear that we are lucky for living in America, French, German, Italy, Spain and other rich countries like these. We hear that there are people who are adopted and don't know their true parents, we hear that there is a lot of poverty in the rest of the world, that there are people without a roof, children that work, adults who stole children, and many other bad news about this wonderful and ugly world that we have created. However, these reality seems far away for many of us. Thanks to this movie it easier easier to understand how life is hard and how the destiny could be cruel, but even all of this there is hope and love in this world. To conclude, I strongly suggest to watch this wonderful movie, because it can teach you something about life that many people think to know, but they don't really understand.

"We've Seen This Before. But Hey, it's for a Good Cause!","Eighty-thousand children go missing each year in India. Saroo Brierley, author of the autobiography, ""A Long Way Home,"" was one, and he tells about his incredible journey from India to Australia and back again. The result of the adapted indie drama, Lion, is a well-intended attempt which utilizes a ""been there, done that"" approach to prove how the community can pitch in to help families across the globe.Sure enough, being a depressingly heartwarming weepie, Lion starts on a heartbreaking note. Saroo as an adorable little five-year-old oversleeps and loses his way in a dark train station, separated from his older brother. He hops onto a train and arrives at another station far away, and sees no options available other than to sleep on cardboard with other lost kids. The stay gets cut short though, as several kidnappers force him out. He then comes across new parts of India's culture he never knew existed beyond his mother's work as a rock-hauler. A hospitable Hindu couple helps Saroo out until he runs away out of desperation. Soon, with hopes of locating his parents, an orphanage takes him in, where beatings occur daily.Eye-swelling in these first moments are guaranteed while watching a vulnerable little tike lose his innocence before reaching his full development of memory cells. When also considering how everyone in India speaks in their native tongue with English subtitles, an extra step authenticates the true story. However I must admit: the boy cast as Saroo, Sunny Pawar, acts precisely how any young actor would in his first role. Nobody cheers him on because of his talent, but because of his cuteness.A kind Australian couple eventually adopts Saroo, with some English lessons included to help him with the transition. As investing as it all feels, the very next event is, ""20 years later."" So did nothing interesting happen within twenty years? This sort of leap in time happens constantly throughout the picture, limiting the story possibilities and minimizing Saroo's motives of returning to India. So proof exists in why Lion would prefer to tug on your heartstrings over structuring the story to deserve the countless awards it campaigned so hard for.Speaking of awards, my complements go to the Academy Award nominated performances of Nicole Kidman (The Hours, Moulin Rouge!) and Dev Patel (Slumdog Millionaire). Both portrayals standout satisfactorily well, carrying the second half of the film to maintain the audiences' tears. Although I ought to complain about Kidman's distractingly obvious wig. Yes, I realize they needed to cast a talented actress, and yes, I understand she needs to look like the real-life counterpart, so why not cast someone whose natural hair looks like the real life counterpart? Or maybe dye Kidman's hair? Oh, right. They needed an already nominated actress to guarantee a nomination, and she has to still look pretty in her natural silky blonde hair for those expensive interviews and campaigns.Yet like any other Oscar-bait picture, the production crew still put in tremendous effort. Saroo's growth into manhood blooms to life through various scenic shots meant to highlight memories of home, such as moths illuminated by the sun, or the infinite route of a railroad track. Then as things turn more personal and distanced from youth, the camera pulls in closer to the human face. The minds and hearts of everyone involved were in the right place, even if Lion turns out no different in quality than the summer released indie crowd-pleaser.Clearly, Lion will fall out of the public's memory after the 2017 Oscars ceremony. But the #LionHeart campaign it started will last much longer. It exists to raise donations to benefit the 80,000 lost children in India, and worldwide. I encourage you to offer them a small donation; even just a little can travel a long ways to make a difference.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Outstanding,"Every once in a while a film comes along which stands out from the pack. A film where all of the elements come together to create a visual storytelling work of art. It doesn't happen often, perhaps once a year if we are lucky. And it nearly always happens with true stories like this one.The cinematography is beautiful, and whilst the locations perhaps made this easy. Add a musical score that is one of the best I have heard in years, and you are still only halfway to making a masterpiece. The cast and direction complete the recipe. With brilliant performances from all involved.If there is one film you see this year it should be this one. It is an emotional journey with moments of sadness and anger, mixed in with joy and relief.

One of the best of the year. A true tearjerker,"The holiday movie season continues to dazzle with LION, one of the most emotionally rendering movies I can remember. A story based on a real event that follows a lost boy reuniting with his mother, this is a film that exists purely on merit and a powerful combination of imagery and sound. It's like a Hollywood movie that's so unbelievable you can't believe could happen. It's magic.There are two distinct parts to the film, a front-half that follows our hero through the slums of western India. There is very little dialogue and the language we do hear is local dialect. Saroo (Dev Patel playing as the adult and the wonderful Sunny Pawar playing the child) lives in a small shack with his mother, brother, and younger sister. They work as laborers, lifting rocks and earning little to survive. At night Saroo volunteers to help his brother Guddu in earning more money. With little sleep and a crowded train station to navigate, Saroo is soon lost. The boy is stuck on a train for days, trapped with no idea where he is going or where his brother is. Once he manages to escape, he wanders the streets of Calcutta calling for his mom in a language that locals can't even comprehend. His story moves slowly, tragically, and we follow this small child disappear amongst a mass of crowds and commuters.It's a wonder he manages to escape, but fortune would find Saroo in an orphanage in the heart of the city. His story makes the local news, but with the memory of an 8 year old and little recollection of his town's name (he doesn't even know his mother's real name), he is doomed to exist as a lost boy nearly 1,000 miles separated from his home. Fortune would find him adopted by two Australians (David Wenham and Nicole Kidman) who fly Saroo to Tasmania and raise him with love. They adopt another boy from the same orphanage a year later, and immediately we see the mental disturbances that could be inflicted on these innocent children. How Saroo managed to grow up so normal is a wonder in itself.The last half of the movie follows adult Saroo (Dev Patel in a showy role that is at times a bit too flat but never fails to impress) as he slowly realizes these memories of his childhood. He meets a girl (Rooney Mara) while attending college who encourages him to try and trace down his mother using Google Earth and the few visual cues he recalls. Simple math puts his search area within 1,500 kilometers of Calcutta. Painstakingly, he searches the grainly online images of train station after train station.Here is where the movie develops into a more complex story, where Sue (Nicole Kidman in a heartbreaking role) admits her wishes to adopt, and how she has no regrets about never having children of her own. There is a scene spoken almost entirely in whispers where Sue tells Saroo all that she believes and hopes for her son. Saroo, in turn, finds new insight into this woman and the beautiful sacrifices his parents made for him. Saroo keeps his search hidden from his parents, fearful of what they may think and worried that it will all amount to nothing. As unbelievable a story as this is, we can identify with these worries and what it means to have guardians in our lives.I will admit that this movie packs a punch, and the last 45 minutes are filled with incredibly-written scenes one after the other. Saroo on the verge of giving up hope stumbles onto a familiar sight: a water tower near the train station he first disappeared. We know it's the same tower too, with winding stairs and a distinctive roof. He can retrace his steps down the rails, through the trees, and back to his village... Zooming in on a pixelated brown spot, at last he has found it: his home. This scene alone is so powerful with only the fuzzy Google images, a tight closeup on Patel's eyes, and the music. The film score by Volker Bertelmann and Dustin O'Halloran deserves much praise through melancholy sounds created on the piano, unique themes and a perfect marriage to the story at hand.It shouldn't be a spoiler to learn that Saroo an his mother reunite in one of the most beautiful scenes one can imagine, an embrace that is earned so fully that I doubt there was a single dry-eye in the packed theater I saw it. Stuck with no tissue I was caught with tears streaming down my face in a scene of pure electricity. I tremble with the memories of this moment, amazed by the story and more so by the accomplishments of these filmmakers to achieve something so wonderful and heartwarming. I wept at the end titles, which revealed more facts about this story including insight from Saroo's birth mother who never moved from her town and never gave up hope of finding her son. We learn the meaning of the film's title ""Lion,"" which had me puzzled until the screen went black and then gave the film an entirely new meaning.On merits alone this movie is a masterpiece. There isn't a dense plot with side stories and miscellaneous characters. This is a story of one boy who never gave up his search to find his mother. In a country of over 1 billion people, the odds were insurmountable. For this story to be told with so much craft should instantly put this on the top of your must-see movie list.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Saggy Drama,"Am I the only one who wanted to punch Dev Patel in the face while watching this film? He plays Saroo Brierley, a young Indian man who was separated from his family when he was a little boy, funneled into the Indian orphan system, and adopted by a loving Australian couple. He longs to return to India to see his birth family again, but is torn between wanting to reconnect with his roots and remaining loyal to the people who raised him.The first half of ""Lion"" is the film at its best, thanks to the winningly adorable Sunny Pawar, who plays Saroo as a little boy. But once Saroo ages into Patel, the film turns into a saggy, interminable series of scenes in which Patel mopes, lashes out at everyone who's nice to him, spends every night staring at Google Earth while taking no action whatsoever, and generally acts like a spoiled brat. What his actual dilemma is is never made clear by the screenplay or Patel's performance. I stated above that he's torn between two cultures, but I'm only conjecturing about that, since that's not shown in the movie. Instead we watch a privileged man surrounded by supportive people whining about how he wants to return to India while we watch him and want to scream at him, ""Then stop moping and and just go visit India already!!""Patel was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Academy Award, but he didn't deserve to be. Nicole Kidman, who plays his adoptive mother, was much more deserving of her Best Supporting Actress nomination. The film also nabbed nominations for Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Cinematography, and Best Original Score, but won nothing.Grade: B-",5.0,Anonymous,Biography

"An emotional, wonderful, experience","The main reason I wanted to see this badly was because of Rooney Mara. I love her to death but she's honestly nowhere near any of the top reasons why I enjoyed this. I don't think this film will be for everybody because it is meant to be emotional and can seem like award season bait. I thoroughly enjoyed it though. Much more than I thought I would. This is basically a much better version of Slumdog Millionaire. Slumdog is honestly a bit of a mess, and doesn't feel realistic. This (obviously based on a true story) is more or less a rags to riches story as well that is set in India and then shifts to Australia. The lead character lives in poverty with his mother and siblings and gets separated one night when he falls asleep on a train. He travels to areas in Calcutta where he struggles to understand Bengali and does not remember enough details to get home. He eventually ends up being adapted and has a successful life but then longs to find his family. It might be from being fresh out of the theater but I was quite emotionally attached to the protagonists quest to find his family. There are things that could be improved from a storytelling perspective, especially with the lack of focus on the adopted brother and his relationship with Nicole Kidman's character. I'll let it slide though because it was a fulfilling experience watching this film. All the actors in this film put in strong performances I know this might not get a lot of Award season love but I hope it at least gets nominated for Best Picture, and Best Adapted Screenplay.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Definitely one of the year's best!,"'LION': Five Stars (Out of Five)Another upcoming Academy Awards hopeful is this drama, directed by debut feature filmmaker Garth Davis. It tells the story of a 5- year-old Indian boy, that falls asleep on a train car and is taken 1600 kilometers from where he lives. He is later adopted, by an Australian couple, and 25 years later he decides to track down his birth family, by using Google Earth. The film is based on the 2014 non-fiction book 'A Long Way Home' (by Saroo Brierley), and it was scripted by Luke Davies. It stars Dev Patel, Sunny Pawar, Rooney Mara, Nicole Kidman and David Wenham. The film has performed well at the Box Office, and with critics, and it's also been nominated for multiple respected awards (and it's also won some). I loved it.Saroo (Pawar) goes with his older brother, Guddu (Abhisek Bharate), to work at a train station one night. When Saroo is then too sleepy to help, he waits at a bench, for Guddu, while his brother goes to work. When Guddu doesn't return though, Saroo goes looking for him. He then falls asleep on a train, while looking for his brother, and the train takes off with him sleeping inside it. It takes Saroo 1600 kilometers away, to Calcutta. Having no idea how to get back home, or how to tell anyone where he's from, the boy is forced to live on the streets. He's later put in an orphanage, and then adopted by an Australian couple (Kidman and Wenham). 25 years later, Saroo (now played by Patel) decides to track down his biological family, and finally return home. He uses Google Earth to help him do this, although at first it seems impossible.The movie is very involving, and quite fascinating; I was hooked on it from the very start. The characters are all lovable, and the performances are all topnotch (especially Patel and Kidman). It's also a very emotionally moving film, and in some ways it's quite inspiring. I look forward to seeing what Davis directs next; this movie is definitely one of the year's best, and it deserves all of it's awards recognition.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/B4EI2AvkLgo",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Not just a story about a lost boy and Google - It's a potential Oscar contender,"When I watched this movie, it was rather unplanned. Rather to kill time.But, boy! was I in for a surprise. Almost half of the movie is non English , but the powerful portrayal by a relatively unknown kid actor and than the accomplished actors like Dev Patel and Nicole Kidman completely raises the film to new heights. The film engrosses you from the very beginning – A different world from what we know in the west, but yet the same emotions of love between brothers, how a separation cannot be forgotten and how incredibly a technology which we now use rather ubiquitously can be used to re-connect lost bonds. But then the story is much much more than that. The emotions, the motivation and love for the son which connects the two mothers. The journey itself cannot be expressed but needs to be watched on the big screen.

Extremely well acted,"Lately I've been avoiding the ""based on a true story"" genre completely because I find it to be manipulative and exploitative, and lately there has been a spate of those titles (Deepwater Horizon, Sully, Hacksaw Ridge, Snowden, Patriots Day, etc. etc., ad nauseum) and some of them recount stories which are so recent that I remember when the true story happened, making it feel like I'm watching a rerun, but this, Lion, is one of the better of its kind.It effectively tells a story which I am unfamiliar with, and haven't seen/ heard/ read dozens of stories about, and does so with great acting from all participants, especially first time actor Sunny Pawar, about a young man attempting to trace his roots, find his tiny village in India (which he was lost from a quarter century earlier) and find his family, with the help of Google Earth.The first half of the film shows him as a child (played exceptionally by Pawar, who relies on facial expressions, and movements, with little dialogue used) getting lost, and on an abandoned train travelling cross country, and, creepily, nearly getting caught up in child sex trafficking. The second half deals with him as an adult (played equally well by Dev Patel) in his search, and how wanting to find his past affects his present day life, and relationship with Rooney Mara (who also does very well in her role)Well acted, and beautifully photographed in India, and Australia, my only issue with this film is its slightly uneven, overlong two hour-long run time.

'We wanted the two of you in our lives. That's what we chose.',"In a time where immigration is a raw debate along comes a true story that is not only touching on the level of the main character but also speaks clearly about the adoption agencies around the world placing lost or unwanted children in other countries where parents can afford them. This is a multifaceted story and one that gleams from each of the facets.The setting is 1986 India in the Hindu region. Saroo (a sensationally fine Sunny Pawar) was a five-year-old child in India of a poor but happy rural family. On a trip with his brother Guddu (Abhishek Bharate), Saroo soon finds himself alone and trapped in a moving decommissioned passenger train that takes him to Calcutta, 1500 miles away from home. Totally lost in a strange urban environment and too young to identify either himself or his home to the authorities, Saroo struggles to survive as a street child until he is sent to an orphanage. Soon, Saroo is selected to be adopted by the Brierley family (Nicole Kidman and David Wenham) in Tasmania, where he grows up in a loving, prosperous home. Yet for all his comfort and good fortune, Saroo finds himself plagued by his memories of his lost family in his adulthood (as played by Dev Patel) and tries to search for them even as his guilt drives him to hide this quest from his adoptive parents and his girlfriend Lucy (Rooney Mara). Only when he has an epiphany and his use of IT revolutionary technology known as Google Earth does he realize not only the answers he needs, but also the steadfast love that he has always had with all his loved ones in both worlds.The novel 'A Long Way Home' by Saroo Brierley was adapted for the screen by Luke Davies and directed with great sensitivity by Garth Davis.

"An Incredible journey of rediscovery and the maternal, family spirit","TV and commercial director, Garth Davis gives an exceptional main feature debut with a touching true story about a young boy getting separated from his family and lost in Calcutta to then be adopted by a family in Australia at the tender age of five, who then has the sudden, obsessive urge to find his real family.It's based on the published memoirs ""A Long Way Home"" by Saroo Brierley, the boy, now grown up man, who embarks on a mission to find the family he got lost from all those years ago. It tackles conflict of loyalty, love and determination, a truly heart-rending story, not just of Saroo, but of all involved.It's superbly balanced, basically in two parts. Firstly the origin of separation, a Saroo at 5 years old going through a hellish ordeal of being completely lost, not understanding the language, hungry, tired and just wanting to get home. The second part being the adult Saroo, now fully integrated into Tasmanian society and surrogate family, leading a privileged life compared to the one he lost.Young Saroo is played astonishingly by Sunny Pawar who manages to convey emotion and feeling with little dialogue. He's truly amazing, being totally believable and the chemistry he shares with the other actors is beyond incredible. He actually steals the show from the other leading actors, even though all give brilliant performances.Dev Patel plays the adult Saroo, those emotional torment is different, it's still portrayed greatly, racked with guilt with a sense of possible betrayal for all involved. Not wanting to hurt anyone, but to fulfil his need to find his original family. Patel did a lot of research for his role, travelling to India to visit the orphanage and to ride the same train journey trying to imagine what nightmare it must have been for young Saroo.Nicole Kidman was chosen by the real life Susan Brierley, the surrogate mother of Saroo and adopted brother Mantosh. Kidman and the film show just how remarkable the real Susan Brierley is, at first being kind and understanding beyond measure, brave and loving only to then become something greater when you discover her motives and reasoning. She's become an inspiration to myself.Dustin O'Halloran and Volker Bertelmann, better known as Hauschka, compose a fitting score for the film, with strings conveying themes of loneliness, discovery and enlightenment in both child and adult. Sia's busy year of end credit songs doesn't end in 2016, providing another great track ""Never Give Up"" which includes ethnic music.Davis does an exceptional job, directing names such as Kidman, Patel and Rooney Mara. He has a graceful, elegant style with brilliant use of light and composure. It's a tough story with perfect portrayals that embellishes the meaning of family, love and the maternal spirit. Really looking forward to see what Davis gives us next.Running Time: 8 The Cast: 9 Performance: 10 Direction: 10 Story: 9 Script: 9 Creativity: 10 Soundtrack: 9 Job Description: 8 The Extra Bonus Points: 10 for Sunny Pawar's performance.92% 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Dev Patel Shines in Lion!,"I was surprised with how much of this film just focuses on the character of Saroo. I mean, he is the main character, so I figured he'd be the center of the movie. But I thought the film's actual focus would be of him searching for his family. Instead, it develops Saroo as a child, played beautifully by Sunny Pawar. We then transition into him as an adult, where the film then focuses on his relationship with Lucy (Rooney Mara). They had unbelievable chemistry, and I really bought into their relationship. It wasn't some stereotypical boy/girl thing, but it was a human and compelling dynamic that I thought stole the film. Saroo traveling to India to find his family is actually a small portion of the film. On paper, that sounds like it would be disappointing and anticlimactic, but is incredibly effective in the context of the movie. Director Garth Davis does a magnificent job helming this film, and really knew how to navigate it in order to make it work. Because of his foresight, we buy into the human character of Saroo, instead of the situation. We understand this character, and that's what really makes this film work...",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Amazing,I loved the story and the way the story is made into a film. Not overdramatical but pure. Amazing actors as well.,9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Sunny Pawar is the actual Leading Man,"Based on true story how an eight year old Saroo got lost from his family and after struggling for number of months experiencing some hell of a journey finally ended up in Australia adopted by a caring family. Storytelling, Direction, Cinematography everything works for this movie making its audience to connects with the movie right from the start however it looked little dragged somewhere in the middle of the second half but it can be ignored as the idea and picturization is very strong there. Talking about the performances Nicole Kidman was brilliant it was indeed very good to see her in a role other then being glamorous. Dev Patel as usual delivered an intense performance he nailed the character effortlessly. Now talking about the star of the movie Sunny Pawar, who already impressed me in Chippa and did it again in this however Lion was released earlier then Chippa. From Slums to Oscars Sunny has done it and he deserves every bit of it as in this small age he is sharing screens with Nicole Kidman, Dev Patel & Nawazuddin Siddqui and making his presence felt which is indeed an achievement surely em his Fan and you'll be too",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Outstanding Fact based film,"Fact based film with exceptional portrayal of realism in most scenes shot. The story is such that the chances of a happy ending is the proverbial one in a million. Yet it happened. The acting by the child actor, Sunny Pawar,is superb. But the experiences such children endure still go on today. Poverty, corruption, and paedophilia meet charity, sacrifice and kindness while Calcutta shows one of its dark sides. Google, Tasmania and Indian Railway play prominent roles. The main actor is the hero from Slumdog Millionaire, Dev Patel, now grown up. No Bollywood stunts here. See it! You will certainly enhance your life experiences.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Lion is a full show of Dev Patel and only Dev Patel,"In the IMDb page, the movie is showed as a drama movie but I think this is a thriller movie. The movie's story line is full of suspense and the movie is more thrilling than dramatic. The story is about Saroo Brierley (who is also the writer of the novel) and the there are lots of suspense and emotional attachment about India. I am nit telling the story but as per IMDb, the story is about a five-year- old child who lost on a street of Calcutta city which is a thousand kilometers away from his home. He survives many challenges before being adopted by a couple who lived in Australia. After 25 years, he sets out to find his lost family. Very engaging story and this is based on a novel written by Saroo Brierley.Well, this is recognized as a drama movie but I think this is nit a drama movie. The story is full of suspense and the until the climax scene the story is a suspense thriller. There are lots of emotions and struggling of the central character and the survival story of the boy is very much imperious. The one and the only reason is Dev Patel. He has already done ""Slumdog Millionaire"" which is a very good movie. This movie is not like ""Slumdog Millionaire"" and the story between these two movies are completely different. In this movie, he is the central character and as ""Saroo Brierley"" he is just outstanding. The director missed some opportunities to create a gem like the novel but Dev Patel saved him from making a dumb movie. The movie is the full show of Dev Patel's acting and he made this movie an enjoyable one.I am not telling this is a bad movie but if you have already read the novel this is not for you. And another advice is if you want to watch a good performance, Dev Patel will make enjoy you.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Soars above the Rest,"Up until this morning when I saw Lion, my support was behind LaLa Land for the Oscar. Lion chased it off the landscape for me. I started crying fewer than ten minutes in and the fountain was never turned off after that. And, it's not as if they went for cheap tears; no, every tear was earned The casting was so good, it seemed magical to me. I was skeptical about Nicole Kidman to start with but she was the kindest, sweetest mom ever. The story is heart rending; even when you know how it ends, you are completely caught up till the very last words. I absolutely loved it, still thinking about it hours later. I'm resolved to donate money to a charity for Indian children. Four of them.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Heart-melting journey of courage and discovery,"Lion tells a truly incredulous story in a delicate, compassionate and credible way. It's a film of a definite two halves; the first half unflinchingly depicting the harsh brutalities of street life for Calcutta's lost children, the second half a more palatable but well-trodden journey of self-discovery. Patel's honest performance prevents this sentimentality becoming too mawkish, ably assisted by a grounded Kidman as his adopted mother (one of her finest performances for some years). For me however it's 5 year old Saloo's story that was the most engrossing, alarming and heart-breaking, played with perfection by Pawar. Lion may play safe in its storytelling, but it's affecting, distressing and ultimately uplifting. Only the hardest of hearts could fail to quiver a little by the closing credits.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

An intense and emotional story successfully made into a film,"Lion is a compelling and very emotional film.It is beautifully shot and well told. On a visual level, the photography wax great, capturing the beauty, but also the poverty which is characteristic of India. On what I would define as an ""intellectual"" level, meaning story-line and screenplay, I would say that the writers did a good job in transposing a true and extraordinary tale into a strongly moving picture. The story is cleverly balanced between the youth and the adulthood of the protagonist. In addition to this the soundtrack was also very beautiful and well suited. A final note goes to the actors: the protagonist was egregiously portrayed both by Dev Patel and Sunny Pawar.In conclusion, I would definitely recommend viewing this film, as it is a an excellent piece of work which will definitely move the viewer and that raises awareness of the condition of children in India.Definitely worth a cinema ticket and will definitely buy it on DVD.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

The emotional movie is sure to put a tear to the viewers eyes as it displays the struggles and strengths of the boy through this journey in such a way that you are instantly attached to the character and his story. Dev Patel is very good in this film, but is better and more emotional in Slumdog millionaire, however Sunny Pawar who plays younger Saroo is excellent and portrays a lost boy, missing his family, living in the streets of India brilliantly in this film and shows himself as a real talented young actor. Overall this movie is a very heart filling, emotional movie that will surely put a tear in the viewers eyes and I highly recommend it, but if you are to pick between lion and Slumdog millionaire, it would have to be the revolutionary and exquisite Slumdog millionaire.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Dev Patel picks up the role and captivates you with the anguish his character is going through.Nicole Kidman almost blends into the background and that is a major compliment for a Hollywood leading lady.

Lion,"Though it's Dev Patel and Nicole Kidman who take top billing, it's the hugely engaging Sunny Pawar who steals his scenes here as the young Saroo. He's growing up in rural India with his elder brother Guddu (Abhishek Bharate) living fairly hand to mouth with their mother (Khushi Solanki) and so the two set off into the city to try to make some cash. Once they arrive, though, the young Saroo is too tired to accompany his brother on his search for work, so he has a nap! Next thing, he's on a locked train heading through the countryside and when he does eventually manage to get off, nobody understands him nor has heard of his hometown. That's just the start of some adventures that illustrate how dangerous this society can be as he encounters some fairly malevolent souls on his travels. None of this is especially graphically portrayed, but you don't need a very vivid imagination to appreciate just what some had in mind for this five year old boy. Fortune smiles on him, though, and to Australia he goes where he is adopted by Sue (Kidman) and husband John (David Wenham) and now morphs into Dev Patel. He's happy enough there, moves to Melbourne and meets Lucy (Rooney Mara) but he's becoming more and more restless. Despite his comfortable life and his love for his adopted parents, he still pines for his family in India - so sets about trying to put together what he knows, remembers and can glean from Google maps. Can he ever find home? Patel is also a natural here and he manages to convey well the struggle between his innate need to find out what happened at home with his obligations to his parents, a challenge made especially difficult as Sue is having issues of her own which are explained here without sinking into melodrama. The latter stages are also effectively intercut with flashbacks that seem to be fuelling his desires to return but also offer us an opportunity to appreciate just how loving this family was, despite them having to pinch coal from the train to trade for milk. Kidman only really appears sparingly but she offers an impassioned and often quite poignant performance - but neither she nor Patel really hit the potency of the young Pawar who really does make this worth a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
lost child,"Immensely moving tale of a young child lost in India, preyed upon, rescued - falsely - then rescued again, and shipped off to a new country for adoption. Photography, pace, and atmosphere are all pitch perfect in the opening sequence in India, but what really draws you in is the charismatic performance by young newcomer Sunny Pawar. Dev Patel does a good job, but it is the flashbacks to the five-year-old boy, rather than concern for the man, that keeps you emotionally invested. Nicole Kidman is quietly powerful as a woman who surprises you by her choices and incredible strength. The film avoids sentimentality and completely earned the copious tears I gave up. I have a soft spot for 'lost child' stories, and this is one that rises above the pack.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

He makes up his mind to reunite with them, no matter how difficult his journey gets.Lion is an outstanding film. Director Garth Davis has flawlessly brought to the big screen, this incredible true tale of loss & undying hope & love. The screenplay by Luke Davies has impeccably adapted Saroo's novel, A Long Way Home. The cinematography by Greig Fraser is one of the highlights of the movie.

A movie of two halves,"Lion tells the incredible yet true story of Saroo, a boy who got lost and reunited with his family 25 years later.It is a movie of two halves. The first part shows how Saroo, played by Sunny Pawar, got separated from his mother and his older brother Guddu, travelled all the way to Calcutta, survived on the streets, went to an orphanage and finally got adopted by an Australian family. The second part shows an older version of Saroo, now played by Dev Patel, living a privileged and happy life, until the memories of his family start haunting him and he goes on an obsessive search for them using Google Earth as his main tool.The first part is clearly the highlight. It captures the feeling of being alone, lost and frightened in a huge and hostile world. Also, Saroo's bond with his brother is relatively short but leaves a lasting impression. The second part isn't as powerful, the gap is too large and it doesn't feel like it's the same character. The key aspect here is his relationship with his foster mother, complicated but highly touching nonetheless. On the other hand, the presence of his girlfriend didn't offer that much -if anything.

"Intelligent, sensible and uplifting","Slow, thoughtful and intelligent, Lion expertly and refreshingly avoids the typical clichés of the based-on-a-true-story-for-awards-season formula.The narrative, aptly split into two disparate narrative and linguistic halves, follows the real life events of Saroo, a young Indian boy who is lost on a train heading to Calcutta, wandering lost and alone for two months until he was brought to an orphanage and eventually adopted by an Australian family and relocated to Tasmania. Growing up forgetting is own mother tongue but never his family, his search for the exact whereabouts of his hometown and family, increasingly take a toll on his priorities.Garth Davis and Greg Fraser expertly capture the essence of loss and despair as well as familiarity and passion, in both Indian and Australian contexts, accentuating their intrinsic contrasting characteristics, while maintaining the characters' guiding thread.

Gentle and Uplifting,"Our society is flooded with think-pieces about the migration of people from one country to another. Still, we rarely get a thorough glimpse of what a person who makes this trek goes through, losing connection to their blood and culture. Lion, a purely human film that quietly draws you into the true-story of a lost Indian boy adopted by an Australian couple (Kidman, Wenham), provides us with a harrowing tale of discovery & rediscovery. A gentle epic about the mistakes we make in family & love, and the second-chances we long for. In the first half, we're introduced to 5-year-old Saroo, a financially-impoverished but family-rich boy lost thousands of miles away from his home. The world is never so overwhelming as through the eyes of a lost child; that perspective is our tour guide here. We are rarely given information outside of his naïve ignorance, allowing mystery and fear to bloom up in unexpected places. Even his eventual life-saving adoption by a kind Australian couple is blanketed in confusing culture shock (expensive houses, nice transportation). Pawar is perfectly casted, his sweet voice and heavy eyes perfectly capturing the complexity with which we try and reconcile his new privileges with his stunned sadness. In the second half, Saroo (Patel) is 25-years-older & more accustomed to his Western life, though still longing for a connection to his past. Some of the complexity fades here: the dialogue is more awkward, the side-characters are less-natural, and the narrative is clumsily pushed along. Still, the performances are strong, the score is gorgeous, and the story is enveloping. Lion is a gracious tearjerker that makes you wanna go out, live life and cling tight to the ones you love.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Solid film with some tedious fluff in second half,"The young Saroo character played by Sunny Pawar is a natural and the highlight by far. The first half of this film is the best half, featuring this young boy lost and surviving on the streets.The second half when he is grown up is merely anticipating the inevitable, waiting patiently for what we know or expect will happen - for the questions to be answered and the search to end.The poster for this movie is poorly designed. For some reason it focuses on the relationship with the girlfriend, which is not important to the story at all. Whoever designed and approved the poster attempted to invent significance where there wasn't any. It gives the impression of a love story, which it isn't.Photography is solid. Music is a bit tedious and repetitive with endless piano scales up and down. The second half tends to suffer from lack of punch. It merely delays the inevitable. The scene where Nicole Kidman unloads her emotions about everything is tedious. We don't need to know all that, it's not that interesting or relevant.Good story, shot well and good performances. Incredible that it happened. Just be prepared for some tedious filler and emotional fluff in the second half before the climax.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

A Gripping Story That Could Have Been Better,"To start with, I really enjoyed the film. It impressed me, even though I already knew the whole story. That takes some doing. The story of the young boy, the first half of the film, gives us a view of the sadness that takes place because of over-population. People live on a subsistence, but somehow many manage. Of course, many do not. Saroo goes with his brother to steal coal off the trains. It is utterly dangerous with possible death around each corner. They manage to trade their coal for a couple small bags of milk which they take home. The older brother can work and Saroo is a pest. He manages to talk his brother into taking him to a new job site by train, but he gets separated and the rest is history. We see the little guy trying to figure a way to get back to his village but he can't name it or his mother's name (he calls her Mum). He manages to get away from some nasty people, probably avoiding being sold into prostitution. Through a series of events, he winds up with an Australian family which adopts him and another boy who is severely, emotionally disturbed. If someone had done a little script work to bridge a twenty-five year gap, it would have helped tremendously. We now have Saroo as a man. He has been accepted into white (and brown) society. He has an attractive girlfriend played by Rooney Mara. But he is conflicted. He hates his brother because he shows disrespect for their adoptive parents. He has also begun to long for his original home. Bits and pieces of his life before the age of five have crept into his mind. Had there been even a few minutes for us to get to know when this longing started. Also, some of the specifics of life with the second brother. A psychological framework for his feelings. There is so much angst in the older Saroo. It could have been sold better. It would have made very good film a great one and could have been done without making it too long. The little boy who played little Saroo has such an expressive face. Beautiful.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Captivating Story about Family and Perseverance,"Lion is a beautifully produced film that truly captivated my heart and became one of my favorite movies. This film captures everything that I look for in a film. It is filled with emotional, heart-touching scenes, a powerful message and wonderful cinematography. It is very unique and special, very different from what you ordinarily see at the cinema.The story tells about 5-year-old, vulnerable Indian boy Saroo who gets lost on a train and travels thousands of miles across India away from his dear family. Saroo faces many hardships of life all by himself. Eventually he is taken in and adopted by a caring Australian couple. Years later Saroo feels a part of himself missing and is filled with murky memories of his past as a young child in India. Using Google Earth, Saroo is determined and passionate to find his lost family through the use of this tool.The lovable and kind Saroo is played by the talented Dev Patel who also had the leading role in the Oscar winning film Slumdog Millionaire. Dav Patel portrays Saroo's passionate determination to be reunited with his family and country in the most believable way. Rooney Mara plays adult Saroo's girlfriend who aids him finding his family. Sue Brieerley, Saroo's adopted mother is portrayed by Nicole Kidman in another stunning performance.The film runs 120 minutes and I have many favorite scenes, but what touched me most is watching the passion that drives Saroo to find his family. Although he faces many hardships and issues, his love and passion for his family drives him to not quit but overcome every obstacle. Seeing his dedication to be reunited with his roots is inspiring.The message of this film touched my heart, due to similar personal experience I share with Saroo. As someone who also left their motherland at age six to come to a country with better opportunities I, like Saroo, know how it feels to be reunited with your motherland and have only mercury memories from where you come from. So I relate very deeply to the message of not forgetting your origin and staying true to your background and roots. In addition, the film portrays the message of family and unity which are dear to me as well.I highly recommend this film and recommend it for ages 13 to 18. I give this film 5 out of 5 stars and expect to see this film be nominated for an Oscar.Reviewed by Maria G., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

"""Lion"" is an emotionally-engaging and fascinating true story that is not to be missed.","We all have a family. You may live with the family of your birth, with a family which adopted you or with a family that you have made through getting married and having children. It doesn't matter which. You have a family. Since we can all relate to having family, it also follows that we can all understand what it means to be separated from family. And you can probably imagine what it would be like to have a family that is lost to you, to desperately desire a reunion, but be unable to make it happen. A person in that situation may become part of another family, even one that is full of love, but still never stop thinking of his original family. That's what the main character is facing in the Australian-produced drama ""Lion"" (PG-13, 1:58).The film is based on the true story of Indian-born Australian businessman Saroo Brierley, as told in his 2014 book ""A Long Way Home"". As a 5-year-old, Saroo was abandoned by his older brother in a train station near his home in central India. Saroo wandered onto another train where he got locked in one of the unoccupied cars and was unable to get out until the train stopped for good in Calcutta, over 900 miles from his home. Saroo couldn't tell the authorities enough about his hometown or his family for them to help him find his way back home, so he was declared ""lost"" and put up for adoption. He was soon adopted by John and Sue Brierley, an upper middle class couple who lived on the southeastern Australian island of Tasmania. It was there that he grew up as a member of a happy family. When he became an adult, he began thinking more about his family in India and how they must still wonder what happened to him – and if he's even still alive – if they are still alive themselves. He began using satellite images from Google Earth to look at train stations he might have passed through 25 years earlier – and desperately hoping to match something in those images with any of the details he could still remember.That was the bare bones of Saroo's factual story, and here's how it plays out in the film ""Lion"": Saroo (Sunny Pawar) is a happy 5-year-old from a poor family living in a neighborhood of the city of Khandwa, India. Saroo's mother, Kamla (Priyanka Bose), is a single parent who works moving rocks at construction sites, in order to feed Saroo, his younger sister and their teenage brother, Guddu (Abhishek Bharate). Saroo is very close to Guddu, following him everywhere. Guddu tries to help his mother by stealing and selling coal from passing trains and Saroo helps. When Guddu announces late one night that he's going to take the train to a nearby city to get temporary work moving bales of hay, Saroo convinces Guddu to let him come along. When the boys arrive at their destination and get off the train, Saroo is so tired that Guddu lays him down on a bench to sleep while Guddu goes to see about the job. Before Guddu can get back, Saroo wakes up and, looking for his brother, wanders onto another train, but gets locked inside one of the cars. This train doesn't make all of its usual stops and Saroo is unable to get off or get help.Saroo ends up in Calcutta (now known as Kolkata), on the other side of India. Saroo is so far from home that the locals speak a different dialect than he does. Even with the help of a translator, Saroo can't tell anyone exactly where he is from and can only identify his mother as ""mum"". After living with other homeless children in or near the Calcutta train station for a few days and escaping some potentially dangerous situations in the city, he ends up in a center for missing children. After exhausting every effort to find where Saroo belongs, the center allows him to be adopted by Sue Brierley (Oscar winner Nicole Kidman) and her husband, John (David Wenham). John and Sue are loving parents who soon also adopt another Indian boy named Mantosh. As an adult, Saroo (now played by Dev Patel) begins a search for his original family. He doesn't want to hurt the Brierleys, but he agonizes over what the past 25 years must have been like for his Indian family, especially for his birth mother and for Guddu. As Saroo prepares for a career in hotel management, he falls in love with a classmate named Lucy (multiple Oscar nominee Rooney Mara), who is sympathetic to Saroo's emotional need to find his family, but is frustrated by Saroo's growing obsession with a search that has little chance of success. Understanding that he is looking for the proverbial needle in a haystack and is distancing himself from those closest to him, he still cannot stop searching for answers to who he is – and to find the family who loved him first.""Lion"" is a fascinating, emotional and very entertaining film. It showed more of Saroo's life in India than I would've expected and it sometimes seems like a bit much, but it's that background that gives this film its emotional heart. It's also helpful that most of the story is told chronologically, with flashbacks used only sparingly and for surprising reveals. The film's ending won't be a surprise to anyone familiar with the story, but it still makes for the most emotional 5-10 minutes in recent cinematic memory. And the last few shots and information revealed during the closing credits are both surprising and satisfying. With such an emotionally engaging story so well told and so well-acted, ""Lion"" is not to be missed. ""A""",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"love, faith, courage","The movie Lion directed by Garth Davis is awesome. The movie is about a 5 year old boy Saroo and his teenage brother Guddu who do whatever they can to bring home food for their mom and little sister. And then Saroo gets separated from his brother and is lost. Ends up getting adopted by an Australian couple (Nicole Kidman as Sue Brierly and David Wenham as John Brierly).The story is sad and happy, beautiful and mean . Even after living away from home for 25 years, Saroo remembers his first 5 years of life clearly, life filled with Guddu's caring and loving presence and mom's loving embrace. Mom, brother and sister made his life lovable and something he longed for again. One of my favorite scenes is when young Saroo prays to Goddess , eats the blessed food and after that manages to run away from a ""nice"" lady who feeds him and cleans him up to sell him to a child peddler. Saroo is blessed because he had excellent upbringing from a mother who loved him and taught her 3 kids how to care and look after each other. Excellent acting, especially Sunny Pawar as young Saroo is terrific and Dev Patel(slumdog millionaire, man who knew infinity )as adult Saroo is excellent, both are Oscar worthy. Script is perfect.

"Tells a moving, uplifting and gripping tale to the tune of one of the best, most emotive soundtracks of recent years.","Surprisingly dark for a 'PG' movie, 'Lion (2016)' tells the captivating story of a boy separated from his mother and the journey he takes as a man to try and find her again. It's a moving, heart-breaking, gripping and uplifting tale of loss, heritage, hope, determination, family and finding oneself in the process of finding others. Its phenomenal soundtrack evokes all the feelings of the film tenfold, and in tandem with the feature it creates an extremely emotive experience that does slow down in its second half - due to its straightforward, linear presentation of the material - but ends on a near perfect moment that will surely put a smile on your lips and a tear in your eye. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
An unchallenging story,"""Did you mean 'Ganesh Talai'?""Watching the Internet on the big screen makes my skin crawl. Watching someone use Google Earth on the big screen made my skin crawl. After 25 years of searching, it only took a little outside- the-box thinking, or rather, beyond an assumed radius, to find home.Don't get me wrong, Lion is a good movie and uplifting. You see, 80,000 children go missing in India every year, and thanks to some rich white people, a couple of them occasionally get back home to their squalid existence. Nicole Kidman channels her inner Johnny Depp and delivers a performance that is part love, part psychopath. They adopt two lost children. The good one, who is also well adjusted considering what he's gone through, is better looking than the other, the mentally disturbed one who likes to hurt himself.What is home? Where do you belong? Is home posh Tasmanian boat life? Is it in a shack with straw and goats? What is the dollar amount you can spend on happiness versus the bare essentials of life? Does anyone care about you? Does society care about others?The answers do not lie withing Lion. It's little more than the story of a boy who gets home after 25 years, and it never spends more than a fleeting glance on the underlying issues of the billions of poor people in the world who don't have any meaningful chance to climb an economic ladder.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Cognitive bias in cinema and the construction of visual differences between race and culture quite disturbing. No stars for a Kidman,"All I noticed was the implied sexual predator on the streets preying amongst poverty in Calcutta starkly contrasted with the fluorescent white skin in Tasmania, supposed to represent the ""good"".The film constructs a story that we are meant to accept without question: that white people do no harm. I can only imagine the distress in adoption and refugee experience when facing a different face to their mother and people. Facial recognition and emotional connection has been researched in relation to mental health. The disparate skin-knowledge (language, religion, smells, emotional expression are a few we develop through thr socialisation process from birth) and distance in body and land that that young man must have experienced is heartbreaking because he was sent without knowledge of mental wellbeing in young children to a foreign place. Of course the foreignness was meant to be accepted as white and good. Of course we are not wired through the media to see this as questionable and harmful , the white foreignness found a child from poverty. The child like others needs to find a place of belonging and entitled to question this not simply accept the cognitively constructed social that becomes ordinary everyday life in Australia. The stolen generation in Australia knows these feeling well and have not had their emotional expression validated outside of reconciliation policies and paperwork. Adoption exists and cross cultural relationships do exist some with more hope and acknowledgement than others.Quite clearly my negative reception of this film or bias is towards the actors not the story: the stark purposeful contrast in skin and culture offering me a way to reconsider adoption experience as well as refugee experience in a foreign place that is not always caring and welcoming. That their experience often invalidated and their mental health unknown other than to professionals and the ordinary person expects respect and gratitude without offering warmth through understanding.I think the casting was purposeful clearly skin difference (also from a Weinstein perspective???) as well as set up my cognitive bias: I have never watched a Kidman film with interest nor purposefully set out to find one. Maybe thats my own cognitive need for different faces and emotional expression when watching a film's story unfold. Other psychology research has begun to investigate the impact of botox on emotional recongition. Perhaps this presents a problem for me: actors overpaid through botox in a Weinstein production?",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Amazing Movie,"*** This movie is free of sexism and political correctness. I've added this note because so few movies meet this criteria today ***It's not often that I give a movie 10/10, but Lion definitely deserved it. There's a sincerity, a truth and some solid acting by Dev Patel and Nicole Kidman that support an excellent story. Dev even manages to pull off the first perfectly forged Australian accent i've ever heard in a film.If you are thinking that Lion is the usual cheesy Hollywood pulp, I didn't find that at all. I'd even say that most of these types of movies normally irritate me. This story mostly avoided those clichés. Although, I feel the weak point of the movie was Rooney Mara who was (thankfully) the only blight of the movie. Rooney certainly isn't the lovable, friendly girl next door who would fall for the boy in the story.I found just about every aspect of the story believable and relatable. The story starts with two brothers surviving day by day in an isolated Indian town. Through a series of events, the youngest boy is caught on a train that takes him far away from his home.If you manage to sit through this movie without a tear in your eye, you did better than I did.

Outstanding example of emotion-driven storytelling,"You know that helplessly choked up feeling you get watching a TV news feature or documentary special about parents and children reuniting after years or decades apart? That's the fuel that powers ""Lion,"" a classically emotional story accentuated by astute craftsmanship.The journey of Saroo — played in the first half of the film by young Sunny Pawar and in the latter half by Dev Patel — awakens our innermost empathy. Director Garth Davis and screenwriter Luke Davies take great patience in nurturing the deeply human core of Saroo Brierly's powerful true story.At five years old, Saroo was separated from his family in a small Indian village and accidentally boarded a train that shipped him to Calcutta, practically another country away. Forced to develop street smarts to survive, Saroo narrowly escapes potentially worse trauma (kidnapping, child labor) and eventually ends up in an orphanage, where he is later adopted by Austalian couple John (David Wenham) and Sue (Nicole Kidman) Brierly. As an adult taking hotel management courses in Melbourne, Saroo begins to reconnect with memories of his distant past, and becomes overwhelmingly compelled to find his family of origin.Especially in the first half of the film, the storytelling is almost effortless. Warmth comes instantly watching Saroo interact with his mother (Priyanka Bose), sister and older brother Guddu (Abhishek Bharate), and seeing him mistakenly separated from his well-meaning brother and then navigating the treacherous streets of Calcutta is heart-wrenching. Davies' script leaves us helplessly watching Saroo struggle and survive, taking its time to really tell that story rather than just provide the essential information. The move is a crudely emotional wallop, the kind that wins audiences' hearts.The simplicity of the childhood narrative also gives Davis a lot of wiggle room as a director. He and cinematographer Greig Fraser create so much atmosphere, making India dark and scary or beautiful and spiritual. When Saroo first arrives in Calcutta, lost in a mass of train station crowds, the scale, vibrancy and scariness put you there physically and emotionally with Saroo. They also capture his childlike wonder along with his skepticism. No knock on young Pawar's remarkable performance either.The large portion screen time dedicated to Saroo's childhood journey magnifies the film's ultimate catharsis, but it also creates a sort of partition between the first and second halves. Davies spends so much time acquainting us with young Saroo that we have to get to know him again as an adult despite being well into the throes of the narrative. The storytelling gets a little tougher here with this jump in time and the inevitable course of the plot leading Saroo to find his family.Patel plays a critical role in bridging our emotional experience watching young Saroo to his character's journey of rediscovering long-forgotten memories and becoming somewhat obsessively driven to reconnect and make peace with his cloudy past. He hits all the emotional beats of the story and we end up in complete sync with him at every one of those junctures as he discovers new information or makes a crucial realization. Kidman does the same thing, but in unexpected ways because of how wrapped up we get in Saroo's story. She gives the film a left-field punch that brings it added dimension.The only emotional challenge that the film struggles with helping us access why Saroo is so private about his search, as well as his inability to let others (namely his adoptive parents) in. A few points of contention between him and girlfriend Lucy (Rooney Mara) don't carry any kind of emotional weight despite their importance to the narrative of pushing Saroo to where he needs to be.The private nature of Saroo's search demands the best of not only Patel, but also Davis and editor Alexander de Franceschi, who weave together Google Earth searches with childhood flashbacks and Patel's emotional responses. It's an ambitious attempt to facilitate drama from the unexciting experience of a man searching on a computer for his childhood village, but there's a lot of visual symbolism connected to it and, of course, an emotional component.With emotion as the central cog of everything that makes it tick, ""Lion"" envelops the audience in a predictable yet no less moving way. What elevate the story beyond that human appeal are the production values. They work in concert with one another to enhance the artistic value of a viewing experience that almost exclusively engages the heart. For those who prefer films target their feelings above all else, ""Lion"" is one you can't miss – for everyone else, it's a worthwhile watch.~Steven CThanks for reading!

The opposite of Hakuna Matata,"It's important to remember there are orphans in mainstream cinema who aren't whiny superheroes. Indeed, as Lion's sobering closing title card reminds us, over 80,000(!) children go missing in India alone every year - a staggering figure that makes the story of one who found his way home to his family all the more incredible. Saroo Brierly's story is too irresistibly moving to ever dismiss; however, it's unfortunate that its cinematic telling stumbles in properly doing it justice. Despite many promising attributes, Lion falls prey to a glut of unwarranted Oscar bait clichés, making the 'so-incredible-it-feels-like-a-movie' tale feel disappointingly artificial when told in feature film form.Lion will invariably suffer from a spate of Slumdog Millionaire comparisons, which aren't as reductionist as you'd expect. Nonetheless, debut director Garth Davis could have taken notes in how to convey heavy content with the pizazz and massive heart of his film's begrudging predecessor, as his film plays as too overlong, stagey, and glum to properly stand out by comparison. Still, Luke Davies' otherwise clumsy screenplay makes one bold choice that pays off: unfolding Saroo's 'there and back again' linearly, rather than disrupted by traditional, hackneyed Hollywood flashbacks. This two-act structure forces us to empathize with the sheer enormity - emotional and geographic - of his journey, building up to a climactic emotional payoff that feels exhaustively earned.The first half, a near-silent parable of a young Saroo, disoriented, wandering across India, and besieged by countless unscrupulous, predatory individuals, grimly sketches the film's social consciousness and horrific climate of missing/abducted children. Poignantly severe as it is, the segment's length, aimless editing, and wordless lugubriousness still toe the line of being an episodic downer parade. Thankfully, Davis cleverly takes the Life is Beautiful route, filtering the looming evils through the cheerful shambling of its child protagonist. It works, as luminous newcomer Sunny Pawar, bursting with a quirky, Charlie Chaplin charisma, carries the first act masterfully, captivating with his wary but unquenchably chipper perseverance every step of the way.The film's second half, housing the bulk of the narrative, is more of a slog. Initially, Davis ably conveys the brittle social dynamics of Saroo's adoption process, including the unforeseen pain of an adopted brother struggling to integrate and prone to fits of self-harm. Similarly, Saroo's subsequent disinterested 'third culture kid' identity (""you still like cricket?"" ""Yeah, but I cheer for the Aussies, mate"") feels commendably real. Disappointingly, the script's set up for Saroo's central conflict is far from as finely honed. The tricky thing about PTSD is that, distressingly real as it is, it's hard to depict cinematically without it reading as wholly disingenuous, and Davis flounders somewhat to dredge up the urgency and emotional resonance in Saroo's triggered fixation with his past. Instead, we get pockets of cumbersome, frustratingly Oscar-baiting dialogue that brandish the film's themes with the subtlety of a cricket bat upside the head, including multiple superfluous exposition-fights with Saroo's girlfriend (Rooney Mara; capable but somewhat glassy-eyed in an underwritten support/indignation sounding board archetype). Increasingly, this second act involves watching an increasingly sulky and hairy Dev Patel loom over a laptop (and the fawning introduction of Google Earth - ""have you heard about this fantastic new program?"" is about as instantly dated as Chef's love letter to Twitter in 2014) - or worse: one of those splashy CSI-style map-pin-boards that seem to only exist in Hollywood detective fantasies.Davis does his best to counteract the stagnation with Google Earth footage turning into sweeping, gorgeous panoramic shots of beautifully lush Tasmania, and the arid, frustratingly elusive Indian countryside. Where Lion really excels beyond its central performances is in its ability to astutely capture a location's sensory details, with snippets of birdsong, local music, background banter, and cameras prowling as relentlessly as the titular predator lapping up the sights, sounds, and even smells of its two locales. This attention to detail is appropriate - after all, it's a sugary dessert that triggers Saroo's first childhood PTSD flashback - but it lends a welcome degree of authenticity and immediacy to a film otherwise scrambling to conjure such qualities.None of this is not to disparage Patel's excellent performance, as his furious, manic compulsion to reconcile the two halves of his life is commanding and fiercely believable, and the perfect counterbalance to the jauntier Pawar as his younger self. It's more a shame that the film's script and direction can't meet him at his level of intensity, as he's hauntingly human enough that we want to ache for Saroo's hardship, only to snapped out of Patel's magnetism by the frequent contrivance of the words that tumble out of his mouth. This is a fate that Nicole Kidman and David Wenham, as Saroo's adoptive parents, also struggle valiantly to combat through their honest and warm performances. Davies is mostly careful to position them gracefully and carefully, eschewing white saviour overtones by concentrating on their tentative but teeming love for their new family, and leaving Kidman only a single teary Oscar-flirting monologue. Their scenes are still a touch rosy-tinted, but the cabal of talent between them help make their thoroughly scripted exchanges play as raw and natural.Slow, disordered, and frustratingly cliché-peppered as it may be, Lion still serves as an emotional venus flytrap, pouncing with a (somewhat rushed) finale sure to leave even the most scornful skeptics misty-eyed - even its title drop is an rousing slam dunk. Nonetheless, the film's most moving moment is its closing credits' documentary footage of its real life personages interacting - tearful, gauche, but devastatingly authentic. Often, fictional filmmaking is championed for evoking a true story's inherent emotions more vividly than talking head anecdotal recreations. Lion, despite its promising attributes and visceral leading performances, is a strong testament to the contrary: sometimes such remarkable stories are better avoided by major studios, and told by those involved.-7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Pretty brilliant with some defects.,"Lion. My review:
The first part of the fim deals with five year old Saloo and his brother. They are peasant children scavenging coal on freight trains to trade for food while their mother is a rock gatherer.The bond between the family members is very well portrayed and this is what makes the narrative compelling. There is superb camera work in this first section, showing India and Indian people in hazy sunlight filled with dust, the darkness and isolation of the tiny child in vast and forbidding urban landscapes as the camera pans out from the particular to the machinery of deserted and vast spaces.The jolliness of Saloo's brother as he makes a game of survival and the palpable love between them ensures that you're fully engaged.There is great lighting which shows skin tones at their beautiful best , the pretty glittering smiling woman who 'rescues' Saloo and her handsome sleek seductive partner in crime are portrayed with great precision.However, we have already clocked that he is in a tumbling favella-like slum tenement and this polarised reality which is so much part of India , is again depicted with precision.Menace is very well portrayed here, in the scenes of the railroad, the men that collect the street children from their cardboard beds, in the militaristic, decrepit and corrupt orphanage and the uncaring crowd on station platforms, and the slinky procuress and her partner.However the second part of the film sadly is not as enthralling.There are things that let it down.Camera work is now a little staid and inexpressive.Rooney Mara is not a good actress as Dev Patel's girlfriend. I wish these privileged heiresses would just stay heiresses and not try to act.There is such a jump between the life in India and the adopted child growing up in Hobart , Tasmania that it renders the second part rather unfilmic and unengaging.I found the use of Superstar actors at odds with the use of unknowns in the street scenes of India. Dev Patel is rather inexpressive actor despite his best efforts, I do not think the director has coaxed enough out if him, and we are left relying on his physical beauty rather than his psychology. Nicole Kidman is compassionate and brittle as Saloo's stepmother but something is missing. The family dynamics is not fully depicted and we do not see Saloo and his stepbrother growing up together .A huge chunk is missing. Their stepfather is a cypher, barely shown at all.However is an almost brilliant film, it just needed a bit of reconstruction and use of better narrative construction and performance in the second part.The best actors in the film are the untrained unknown Indian people.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

This is such a beautiful film, with a simple story line, without any frills.A young Indian boy leaves their village with his older brother to do some ""jobs"", in one of these jobs he gets lost and cannot find his way back home. Pass some years and he's adopted by a family from Australia, and when that boy becomes an adult, he starts wondering where he's actually from.It deals with aspects of origin and identity, and that we cannot escape from who we really are.Superb, superb acting from everyone, from the little Indian boys, specially Sunny Pawar that plays the young Sarro, to Dev Patel who has clearly matured into a top class act and is endearing and touching playing the older Saroo.I'm certainly watching it again.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Feel Good Film,"I have been dying to watch this film ever since it came out and didn't watch it until now on Prime Instant Video. I need to start out by saying that this film is quite emotional, but then again I cried during Dragons 2 and Fantastic Beasts, so you can't exactly trust my judgment. Anyways, I bawled during this film and I would definitely recommend it if you need some good old fashioned happy crying. Hence the title, it is certainly a feel good film.My next big point about Lion is how artistic it is. Much like Manchester by the Sea, it can say more in silence than it can with words. I'm usually not a big fan of foreign films either, but though this one wasn't foreign, practically the entire first half is in Hindi, and I enjoyed it. Though it was in a language I do not understand I still found the emotions and expressions much more universal.Finally, I need to comment on Sunny Pawar. Now Lion's cast is made up of some incredibly talented actors, especially Dev Patel, but they are all adults. It is difficult to find a child actor who is as capable as this kid. I mean where was he when the live action Jungle Book came out?! I was thoroughly impressed with his talent, as he is better than half of the adult actors I have seen.So I am giving this film a 7 because it is not quite complicated or unique enough to really deserve anything above a seven, but it still does what it does with its own style and is beautifully done.

"I liked it a lot, it's gripping and packs a strong emotional punch","A little Indian boy (Sunny Pawar) gets separated from his family and ends up far away from home, living on the streets and in orphanage, until he's adopted by a nice couple who take him to Australia.Also starring: Dev Patel as boy as an adult, Nicole Kidman and David Wenham as his new parents, Rooney Mara, Diwian Ladwa.Based on a true story which was turned into book, written by the boy himself, and now a movie.I liked ""Lion"" a lot, for the most part it's gripping and packs a strong emotional punch. But the two-hour story as a whole is uneven, losing steam during its last quarter and – even worse – starting manipulating with the audience in unconvincing way.This big shift doesn't kill the movie but the whole experience would win if adult Saroo's journey was compressed into shorter period of time. As it is, the last quarter is not quite compatible with the previous hour and a half and ends up killing the mood that has been masterfully built up and maintained almost from the start.The adult cast offers impressive performances during that last quarter which is totally worth the awards recognition it has garnered. I am especially glad to see Nicole Kidman and Rooney Mara getting strong, well-written female characters and thus turning in more interesting work as usual for them.But the movie makers could have easily shortened the adult Saroo's detective work part which really bogs the story down and seems to be more of an excuse to show Patel hanging around aimlessly.He'd still have enough screen time for all those stronger acting scenes with the girlfriend and family, or just showing off his fab new looks. Watch out, girls and manlovers, he's turned into quite a heartbreaker indeed, wild hair and strong body, and all...""The mood that has been masterfully built up and maintained almost from the start"", as mentioned above, is the main reason why ""Lion"" turns out to be such a moving journey.The director uses as little dialogue and talking as possible, concentrating on just showing this lost little boy wandering around – sometimes enhancing the events with not too intrusive music.The environment becomes a character of its own – alien, dirty, sometimes hostile. Watching this little guy just trying to get by, without trying to make him act"", or remind us to feel something, gives the story a lot of poetic power and unexpected dimension of depth.Sadly they are unable to repeat or resuscitate this feeling later on, although Patel gives an strong performance of his own, as stated above.Interestingly, 2008's ""Slumdog Millionaire"" – Dev Patel's breakthrough hit which also shows the shadow side of India and its children's' lives – is also a movie of two halves, the first of which excites a lot and the second kind of kills the buzz.So, it's a great movie for the first three quarters and just okay after that.""Lion"" is one of the frontrunners during this award season, with 60 nominations and 32 wins already under the belt. It's nominated for 6 Oscars: movie, adapted screenplay, supporting actor (Patel) and actress (Kidman), cinematography and music. Was also nominated for four Golden Globes but did not win any.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

An emotional journey of discovery and homecoming,"Lion is a story that follows a young boy, Saroo, who becomes trapped on a train, and transferred hundreds of kilometres away from his hometown. He does not speak the local language, and struggles to survive in the harsh environment of urban India. Later in life, he begins to remember his past, and tries to discover where he came from, and track down his family.Lion is a wonderful tale, full of adventure, emotion and loss. The film is well shot, with the gritty city streets of India and the quaint rural villages shot on location, and gorgeously. The film has a deeply emotional feel, as Saroo struggles both to survive as a boy, and later to try and come to terms with his traumatizing experience. It is ultimately a tale of self discovery, and one that is an absolute pleasure to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Movie That Changed My Perspective on Adoption,"I've always thought of adoption as a last resort. I've never thought of it as a viable option for someone who could conceive children of their own, and I never thought that a movie, of all things, would change this perspective.Lion is the story of a young, impoverished, Indian boy named Saroo who mistakenly takes a train thousands of miles away from his home and cherished older brother. The strength and resilience of this five-year-old boy resounds with you as he faces hunger, loneliness, and danger in an area that speaks an entirely different language. He is later adopted by an Australian couple through an Indian orphanage. We then see the happy, well-adjusted, adult Saroo—he has decided to track down his home using the new technology of Google maps.If you're in the mood for a tear-jerker, this is the movie for you. In one scene, Saroo tells his adoptive mother that he is sorry she couldn't conceive her own children. She corrects him: ""We both felt that the world has enough people in it."" Unbelievably, this one scene left me considering adoption to start my own family someday.The ending is immensely heart wrenching, and I didn't know whether to cry tears of sorrow or joy. It is one of those movies that leaves a very lasting impression on you. However, I was left feeling a lack of resolution and character development in Saroo. Lion can be described in one word: powerful. I give it five stars.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Beautiful Film, Hampered Down By Its Need to be Mopey","The slew of flaws in Gareth Edwards' Lion are obvious & disappointing. The fictional pieces in its screenplay comes off wasteful, as the true events in Saroo's search for ""Ganestalay"" would have been a more sensible telling. Apart from this, the unnecessary embellishments to add to the drama, such as Saroo's myriad of clear as day flashbacks & everything Rooney Mara, are mere distractions that adds hollow screen time. Also, contrary to the heaps of praise from critics, Dev Patel's performance was mediocre. His over reliance on long blank stares to project every emotion grew exhausting fast. His propensity to be cinematic is as well too apparent for my taste.Despite these shortcomings however, Lion remains a worthy film, as it salvaged by its staggeringly rich storyline & the acting prowess of its supporting characters. Its premise that touches on the universal truth that each man is deeply connected to home, is well told & absolutely moving. Its harrowing first act that follows the sympathetic young Saroo, & his vehement struggle to reach home, are conveyed brilliantly. Through filmmaking strides in cinematography & score, the emotional footprints from these scenes, are elevated. As for the acting piece, the revelation that is Sunny Pawar as young Saroo set the tone masterfully. He portrays the tragedy of being lost with oozing grace that is heart-wrenching, engrossing his audience to what comes next. Nicole Kidman also deserves her flowers, as she portrays the love, the pain & the strength of a mother needing to let go.It is then undeniable, how relevant & beautiful Lion's messages are, as well as the sincerity poured to crafting this film. If only authenticity took precedence over mopey-ness, the experience could have been one for the books.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
LION - Lost In Other Nation,"A true story in raw form.
The young Saroo did a fine job by keeping it real. You can see that he was emotionless sometime and it was all good because scene demands it. The makers did a fine job by keeping the innocence of the child inside Dev (Adult Saroo) also. 
The Jalebi scene is in fact the true thing about India, you can get reminded of your country by a particular delicacy.

Lion King,"Lion shows how one small error could propel you worlds away from home, only to be forced to survive, assimilate to a whole new language and culture, and yet wonder what happened to home all those years ago. It's a beautiful, human story about being once lost, and somehow found.The aimed style of the film is predominantly realistic with a more documentary direction while simultaneously keeping a cinematic flare. The soundtrack is even more present than the camera-work, with somber tunes coherent with the style of the film.It was recognized by the Academy for 6 nominations, but somehow manages to feel like an alternative film to the general Oscar picks. If you find the subject matter interesting then you will surely not be disappointed!",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Stunning,"I saw this movie just now. It is absolutely beautiful, stunning, brilliant. There are moments when it doesn't move very fast - we're used to fast-moving these days, aren't we - but that only adds to the feeling of time that passes in the course of the actual story that the movie is based on, and of the distances in India. The acting is superb, the Indian actors are amazing. If you are in doubt whether or not to see it: go see it, now! And bring a hankie....",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A beautiful film,"This is exceptional film indeed, made all the more remarkable considering that this is based on a true story.The story revolves around Saroo, a precocious young boy, who while growing up in poverty was still very much loved and had a home to call his own. Through circumstances which are painful to watch, he is lost and ends up nearly 1600 kilometres away from home and is unable to communicate where or who he is. These scenes are difficult to watch as you see them through the eyes of the lost boy, desperate to go home, lost and confused. Fate deals him a good hand and he is eventually adopted by a couple in Hobart, Tasmania. But twenty years on, he is unable to forget his brother and mother.This visuals in this film, which convey Saroo's constant longing for his home are done superbly well. The parallels between glimpses of Khandwa, in rural India and glimpses of his current life in Australia leave the viewer feeling his nostalgia and melancholy, that haunt him at all hours of the day.The film has a great star cast, but undeniably the youngest of them all shines the brightest. Sunny Pawar, who played young Saroo through nearly half the film deserves to be commended for his scenes. Your heart breaks seeing his confusion and desolate but hopeful face. I can not recommend this film enough.This is a great movie, and it is difficult to keep a dry eye while watching it.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Riveting,"Riveting first half but movie loses luster in second half, still an incredible story worth seeking out.Sunny Pawar deserves a special mention for his performance as a young Saroo, lost and alone in such a unfamiliar place. It's always a risk to have such a large portion of the film led by such a young actor but it's ultimately one that pays off greatly in Lion. There's also fine support on offer from Rooney Mara, Nicole Kidman and David Wenham, ensuring the quality runs right throughout the film.This Film has awards written all over it.Based on the novel A Long Way Home (2014), this film adaptation is a richly textured essay on the primal human need for belonging that will resonate with anyone who has ever wondered who they are.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A lion with two sides,"A beautiful, emotional movie that looses its touch midway. The story of the young boy (played by Sunny Pawar) traveling through India feels real and very touching. However, when shifting surroundings to Australia 25 years later, the movie looses its grip a little with empty and repetitive scenes, saved by brilliant acting from Dev Patel. Despite the other half of the movie falling behind, it finishes off extremely strong and pure, leaving the viewers with a lot to think about.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Google Earth is an unlikely saviour to wonderful characters,"This film tells a convincingly true story of how a five year old Indian boy, adopted to Tasmanian parents, found his original village and birth mother some twenty five years later, via Google Earth. (Tasmania is the picturesque mountainous south eastern island state of Australia, which commonly gets left off maps of our country).Dev Patel as the older Saroo shines again and Sunny Pawar as the five year old Saroo is just wonderful.Yet another piece of evidence that fact can be stranger than fiction, I found this film intensely engaging once the initial set up was completed. The initial third of the film did seem slow, but the later structure of the story justifies this.The landscape and city photography and locations chosen in India, Hobart, country Tasmania and Melbourne are wonderfully evocative of these places – well they are of the Australian ones, and the Indian ones seem just as good.Nicole Kidman as the adoptive mother is a standout, and David Wenham makes the most of minor opportunities. Rooney Mara feels at home as the older Saroo's girlfriend. Australian audiences might recognise Todd Sampson in a brief but convincing role as a vocational training school principal.The strength of the movie is in the characters, and the parts of their lives the story tells. The concluding photos of the people on whose story the film was based provides evidence of the veracity of the factual base of the story, and the effort the producers have made to present an accurate portrayal.If you like films that are based on characters, their lives, how they unfold and locations, this may well be a standout.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A journey to meet,"""Lion"" is a film that essentially preaches for simplicity, he wants to do his homework, pass on his message, thrill the audience and it's over, but at some point he tries and ends up being deeper than he is. Here we have a bibliographical, linear script that does not attempt to deceive the viewer with subjectivity or parallel timelines, as I said, he preaches for simplicity to tell the story of Saroo (Dev Patel), a 5 year old boy who gets lost in his Brother at a train station in Calcutta, and after being adopted by an Australian family tries to find his family 20 years later. The setting of the film in its first act is so honest and simple, it is extremely captivating and beautiful, director Garth Davis spends an air of attachment and complicity, blending the violence and innocence that is a beautiful thing, pity that his second act is the Opposite that, with a beautiful photograph in its first act, dark and highlighting the elements of the screen, the rest of the film opts for something lighter and blending the shades of blue with a simple track and a camera that is often used without a tripod The film technically only pleases. The performance of Sarro is wonderful, but Dev Patel does not impress as Saroo, he does not pass the air of lost or desperate and alone does not raise the dramatic charge, and were it not for the good construction of the script, Patel would not make us dry The eyes at the end of the film. We have here a movie that has a great first act, a second act too elongated with many repetitions of idea and bad construction of characters (Only Sarro is built) and a third that is short, but extremely beautiful and precise, and is always very sensitive Of the director showing pictures or videos of the events has put film, served to spend more wipes, ""Lion"" is a good movie that fulfills its role.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Sunny Pawar is the true star of this movie. Spoilers.,"I am slightly annoyed here. Don't get me wrong, I loved this movie to the core. I am very happy that Garth Davis, Creig Fraser and Luke Davies recognized the importance of this story being told. It got me running back home to start donating to Magic Bus & Childline India, which by the way, the LIONMOVIE.COM promotion site does NOT facilitate the actual links to the aforementioned organizations (why? are you really helping then?!).I cried throughout the movie, from the moment little Saroo and his beloved brother Guddhu were introduced. You could feel the chemistry between these two actors, solidifying the wonderful bond of the brothers.What made this movie great, is the first half of the movie. It's the moment Sunny Pawar stepped into the train and you know his life will never be the same. It's when he hopefully starts to look for Guddhu, to find out that his brother is nowhere to be found. What follows is a horrifying journey, where we can see through the eyes of this (luckily) street smart kid, who managed to outsmart the dangers and horrors of his life as orphaned child. The emotional punch is delivered here and echoed throughout the movie.I respect Dev Patel, but his delivery was flat, bored and blasé. Did he really wanted to be in the movie? I miss the emotional burden the real Saroo Brierley carried in the six years he was trying to find back his family home. All Dev delivered was a flat, one- dimensional, tired spoiled brat with messy hair and a beard. Is that how you convey an emotional burden that has haunted you your whole life?I do think Nicole Kidman and David Wenham (the Tasmanian parents) delivered a wonderful performance - so gentle, so loving. After this horrendous turmoil in Calcutta all I needed (excuse, Saroo) was a warm blanket to spoil me and to never let me go.Rooney Mara. Why? Beautiful actress, the supporting girlfriend, all good, but was it necessary to have her in the movie?So, in my opinion, things got mixed up here. While I cheer that Dev Patel endorses this movie, I really feel that Sunny Pawar and Abhishek Bharate are the true heroes of the story. It's their bond captures you, leading you to follow Dev's grown up finding-back- home-journey.It's only fair that they are credited equally on the movie posters. Not only the big known names. Don't mess up your good intentions, producers!",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Deeply sentimental eye-opener,"I loved seeing rural India in this movie. The first half, being a straight story arc without flashbacks, is set entirely in India and, indeed, is truly a masterpiece. The second half sees several complications added to the storyline, with the importance of other characters (with their own stories), along with frequent use of flashbacks as Saroo begins reliving his early childhood in earnest. This half sees many tears. The first half is on par with Salaam Bombay, and in fact resembles that movie in many ways. The soundtrack is orchestral, and I thought a little old-fashioned, although the motif is sweet, with piano dominating at times. As a biography it's a good reflection of an emotional loss and subsequent journey to find one's origins. Personally I thought other India based movies were better, such as Slumdog Millionaire or the one mentioned above, but then again I'm not sure it's fair to compare them. I'm sure most people will find this heartfelt and very sentimental journey a revelation, but for me the frustrations of the latter half, albeit a true story, were not as spellbinding as the magical first half.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Roars like a near mighty lion!,"'Lion' showed a lot of promise. There was potential for a very powerful story, had heard a lot of good things about it (as seen from many positive reviews and a high rating here) and there is a lot of talent involved. A lot of my friends had said how much it touched them, as have many reviewers here, and it seemed like my kind of film.Fortunately, 'Lion' was a film that had great potential and mostly lived up to it. Cannot say that for many recent viewings, with a few too many wastes of good concepts and potential (along with wastes of talent, that is a bugbear of mine because it feels like somewhat of a slap of the face) so that there was a film that did not waste it was refreshing and restored a bit of faith. It is a very good film, albeit it was very nearly a great film. That it wasn't the great film all the way through than when it started is something of a shame, but there are so many great qualities all the same.It is an uneven film sure, starting with the negatives. The second half is not as strong as the first half, it is not as compellingly paced and the clarity of storytelling is less good, some of it feeling vague. That is not to say it is unwatchable, it is still touching in spots in a film that is quite the emotional experience.Rooney Mara also came over to me as the cast's weak link. She didn't look very interested and her character felt like a misplaced and underwritten plot device.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

A tearjerking masterpiece.,"It goes without saying that this is an incredibly moving picture, a guaranteed tearjerker to say the least. I mean how can you not shed a tear after witnessing such an unbelievably powerful story unfold before your eyes? Director Garth Davis (in his feature film debut!) made a key decision that completely transformed this plot into something even more special than it already is. Rather than switching back and forth between flashbacks as Saroo searches for home, we get a much more beautifully drawn-out life story of how Saroo initially gets lost in the jam-packed, hectic country of India and how he desperately tries to navigate his way back home, before he is eventually adopted and we see how his adult life in Australia is heavily affected by his unmoving desire to locate his home village. This directional choice adds so much emotional depth to the film that the ending hits us like a ton of bricks. But this isn't the only reason why this feature is so hard-hitting. The performances of Sunny Pawar (as Young Saroo), Dev Patel (as Saroo Brierley), & Nicole Kidman (as Sue Brierley) are simply exceptional. Sunny as the little boy aimlessly wandering the hustling & bustling streets of downtown India highlights the innocence of the sad sad mistake that he so dearly made. He is ultimately the star of the show, but of course we also have Patel as the despairing orphan-turned-adoptee and Kidman as the caring & tender maternal adopter who both shine with their richly emotive showings. And the third major factor in making this movie so touching is none other than the score. Just listening to it now as I write this review is enough to rend my heart, and it is wholeheartedly deserving of its Oscar nomination.In case you haven't figured it out by now, I absolutely loved this film to bits. The poignancy, yet at the same time, heart-warming nature of this picture makes it a sheer masterpiece, one which I completely and utterly recommend for your own personal viewing. It is seriously a must-watch.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Davis grounds the cultural authenticity throughout the movie, with the first half of the film in Hindi.

"This film shows that no matter where we are in this world, we cannot escape who we really are","Lion is a drama film starring Dev Patel based on the true story of Saroo Brierley. Touching and heartwarming, this film shows that no matter where we are in this world, we cannot escape who we really are.In 1986, a young Indian boy named Saroo (Sunny Pawar) is separated from his family while out one day with his older brother. After surviving on the streets of Calcutta for some time, Saroo is eventually taken to an orphanage where he is later adopted by an Australian couple named John (David Wenham) and Sue (Nicole Kidman). At first, Saroo is weary of his new adoptive family, but over time, he warms to them. 25 years later, the older Saroo (Dev Patel), still haunted by visions of his childhood, decides to search for a way to reconnect with his birth family, whom he believes are still waiting for him.Surprisingly, the film depicts more of Saroo's backstory in India than his actual search for his family, which is fine as this allows the audience to feel what he has been missing out on for so long. Dev Patel's portrayal of a young man searching for his birth family was fantastic and reminiscent of his role in Slumdog Millionaire. Nicole Kidman only really shines in one short scene, although it certainly leaves an impression on the viewer.I rate it 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

it's a great masterpiece that i didn't appreciate,"I Didn't excpect to Love this movie,I Adored Dev patel's Acting although he didn't surpass Michael Shannon in nocturnal animals cause shannon is my favourite supporting actor but dev patel is the 2nd best,the movie is divided into 2 stages,the childhood of saroo and searching for his family,if any screenwriter wants to make a movie to make his audience to cry he has to take lion as an example cause i did in a hard way i felt so sorry for saroo specially in the childhood stage,the child sunny pawar was fantastic in his role, for me rooney mara was way better than Nicole kidman but still both deserved the Oscar nomination,the music is perfect it could take u to another world, i just didn't like some of saroo's way of oration My score: 9.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

What an amazing story.,"After postponing it for a while I finally decided to watch Lion. I didn't expected it to be that good. It's an amazing story, with an almost incredible outcome. Lion got nominated for six Oscars and it's totally deserved. The acting is very good and that from the whole cast, from the children to the adults. The cinematography is also very good, but it's the story that just gets all the attention. It's an emotional movie, it got me teared up a couple of times, which is just a proof how engaging the story was. Lion won't disappoint a lot of people, the story is just too good for that.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Sentimental & Harrowing Journey,"LION is the story of a boy, Saroo, who goes missing for 25 years from his Indian home.This film plays on the emotions of loneliness, sadness, regret, and acceptance to convey the journey that Saroo is experiencing. It may teeter on the edge of over-doing it with it's grand and sweeping score and crying followed by hugs, yet it ends up being quite justified, considering this is an extraordinary true story.The acting in the film is very well executed. Nicole Kidman shines as the loving and confused mother of Saroo and his brother, Mantosh. Kidman smiles through the pain of the absence of Mantosh, and sometimes Saroo, as well. Sunny Pawar holds his own very strongly for the first hour of LION. He's fun-loving and charismatic, and also distraught, closed off, and alone. Pawar is virtually the only character for a good part of this film, up until Kidman comes into play, and he is phenomenal. Dev Patel is able to to portray the still-lingering feelings of loss and abandonment while trying to stay true to his adoptive family. Patel wrestles these emotions and emotes frustration off of the scree. Finally, Rooney Mara's character. I am a firm and unmoving Rooney Mara supporter; I believe she is a fantastic and understated actress who knows how to pick a film to star in (exlcuding PAN). There's no doubt that she is great in LION and that she does all the she can with what she has here; the problem is that there's not a lot there. Mara's character barely progresses the story along and is only there to add frustration and support to Dev Patel's character. I understand she was an important figure in Saroo's life so the film can't just completely exclude her, yet it almost brushes her aside, just like the adoptive father character. It's a shame to see Rooney's full talent go unused.Overall, this is crowd-pleasing, emotional, and investing film that uses all of it's emotion button-pushing with just the right amount. Paired with beautiful cinematography, a riveting score, powerful performances, and an ending that will stay with you; LION proves to be one of the better films of 2016.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Lion Review,"With a mixed critical reception I wasn't entirely sure what to expect here. However, it turned out to be an absolutely outstanding, captivating tale. The first half is an extremely morbid story of a 5 year old Indian boy who gets separated from his brother, ends up lost and homeless, and has to survive in brutal conditions in impoverished India. Not only this, but he also has to become road runner as just about every man seems to want to kidnap and molest him, and it really creates a harrowing portrayal of India. The performance from young Sunny Pawar is stunning and Oscar worthy in itself. It then flashes forward 20 years to Australia, where Dev Patel also puts in a good turn as the lead, still searching for his lost family.The melodic music throughout links excellently with the stylish cinematography and sombre, sentimental tone. It really is just a thing of beauty. There's obviously similarities between this and Garth Davis' previous directorial efforts on Top of the Lake. The intensity of the movie really starts to build, with Nicole Kidman also putting in an impressive performance. There's a particular critical scene where Dev Patel searches online for his family and as he does so he reminisces of being back home as a child, then breaks down. It's incredibly powerful and immersive stuff, but the movie has a plethora of scenes like this. The conclusion is extremely intense and as emotive a finish as I have ever seen.There is no doubt in my mind that this should be getting best picture. However, there's no black people or retarded singing, so nobody's interested.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

ROARING SUCCESS,"Lion is based on the book A Long way Home written by Saroo Brierly and is based on his life. 
The movie is about a 5 year old boy Saroo (Sunny Pawar) from Khandwa, Madhya Pradesh, India, a child of a labourer, who gets separated from his brother, Guddu (Abhishek Bharate) at a railway station and ends up in a train that takes him all the way to Kolkata. Despite his frantic attempts, he is unable to get help from anyone to take him back to his place, 'Ganestalay'. After facing a lot of travails and escaping from the clutches of child snatchers including the syrupy faced Noor (Tannishtha Chatterjee) who feeds him and bathes him only to make him presentable to Rama (Nazwazuddin Siddiqui), Saroo finally finds himself in a children's home which is no better than the outside world. There are shady things happening in this place and Saroj Sood (Deepti Naval) has taken it upon herself to rescue the children from this place. 
Saroo gets adopted by an Australian couple Sue and John Brierly (Nicole Kidman and David Wenham) and flies to Tasmania where he begins to settle in. The Brierlys adopt another boy from India, Mantosh who unlike Saroo has some difficulty adjusting with the family. 
The story moves forward in time and Saroo is now 26 years old (played by Dev Patel). He is an Australian now right down to rooting for the Australian cricket team rather than the Indian. He moves to Melbourne to study hotel management where he meets Lucy (Rooney Mara). A meal with his Indian friends brings back memories from India and with Lucy's encouragement Saroo begins to trace his roots to India using Google Earth. Whilst Saroo is drawn to India, at the same time, he is feeling conflicted wondering if tracing his biological mother would mean betraying his adoptive mother.
Will Saroo continue in his search for his hometown in India? Will he locate ""Ganestalay""? Will he be reunited with his mother and brother?
When I started watching the movie, I was wondering what all the fuss about Sunny Pawar was. I had seen better child actors. But as the movie progresses, you find that there is something so endearing about Sunny. He isn't ""acting"", acting and it would appear that film has captured a real life incident as is and that Sunny is the real Saroo, a lost and confused 5 year old who somehow still manages to have his wits around him. 
Lion received 6 Oscar nominations and won two BAFTAs. It is also the highest grossing Australian film of all time. 
All actors including those with minor roles (Guddu, Mantosh) have done a wonderful job. A special mention to Nawazuddin, whose screen appearance is less than 2 minutes but sends chills down your spine. 
Sunny Pawar, no doubt, is the star of the show. The film shows Sunny walking barefoot, covered in filth, rummaging through all that garbage in search of food and gets you wondering how does one film such a scene so realistically! His face looks unwashed, his eyes crusty and there's dried mucous around his nose!
The film beautifully captures emotions of the actors. The mother's anguish over her lost child, the blind hope of being finally traced by his mother, the joy of laying eyes on their adopted child who has travelled from across the world, the guilt of having led a comfortable life while your family may still be unaware of your survival, the conflict of having to choose biological over adopted...
The film doesn't have many dialogues but manages to tell the story beautifully. The ending is bittersweet but then all's well that ends well. 
Throughout the entire movie, you wonder why the film is called Lion. I even thought it was because Dev Patel's hair hangs loose from his head like a mane (!!!). The title of the movie is explained towards the end and I may have shed a tear or two.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Touching, but suffers from a weak second act","The first half of this film is practically perfect. Amazing storytelling, breathtaking cinematography. How Sunny Pawar was not nominated for any of the major awards is beyond me. This boy showed a whole gamut of emotions, and we felt what he was feeling. And although we know that he eventually gets adopted, we are left in the tension as we see all the things he goes through before getting to that place.However, once Suroo is placed with his adopted family, the story begins to suffer. His motivation behind his quest to find his real family is overshadowed with story lines regarding his family and his girlfriend. We see what he's going through, but we don't get to spend much time with him as we did with young Saroo. I still found myself engaged in his quest, but only because the movie made us love that young boy and want him to find closure.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

A beautiful film on so many levels,"This film has been on my to-do list since I first noticed it a couple of months ago. FirstlyI must praise Sunny Pawar as the five-year-old in the film. His facial expressions and the sheer reality of his circumstances could not have been brought to the screen any better.His instinct in realizing when things were not quite right when dealing with the adults around him was astonishingly portrayed. Dev Patel was also excellent in his role as the adult Saroo and a special mention to his uncanny ability to pull off the often difficult Australian accent was flawless. The support actors notably Kidman, Wenham and Mara were all excellent but perhaps all surpassed by the performances of the Indian actors in the film with special mention to Priyanka Bose who was extraordinary. Interesting to hear that the two actors who played the brothers in the film, Sunny Pawar and Abhishek Bharate have already made another film together where they also play brothers titled Love Sonia. The film is all about human emotions, the complexities that adoption can bring to a young person's life, and the need to discover your roots, whilst having obviously developed a close and enduring relationship with those who were able to bring some safety and stability to life and the recognition of the birth mother and how to deal with all these emotions while remaining true to yourself. A remarkable film.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Worthy of all six of it's Academy Award nominations,"I didn't know much about Lion when I first watched it. In fact, I knew almost nothing at all about it. That's how you should watch this film.In short, Lion is one of the best films I've ever seen. The performances are stellar, with Dev Patel as the standout, but every other actor does a great job. Rooney Mara and Nicole Kidman are very good, and Sunny Pawar does a great job carrying the first third. The visuals are just incredible: the framing, the camera movement, the colors... I found myself in awe more than once of just how beautiful Lion was to look at. The score also sounds amazing and makes an already great film even better.9 out of 10.

A masterpiece that will bring a tear to your eye,"When I chose to watch Lion at the cinema I didn't really know what to expect. I certainly didn't expect to be walking out of the cinema fighting back tears and checking my phone to see when the next available showing would be. Sunny Pawar who plays Saroo was given a humongous task of carrying the first half of this film, but he did it so well and deserves way more recognition for his role than he is getting. He is such a talented young actor with a bright future. Dev Patel carries the second half of the film as an older Saroo, alongside the wonderful Nicole Kidman, Rooney Mara and David Wenham. The true story is gripping from start to finish and has a few plot twists along the way. I loved that the film was split into two halves and we were able to see this story unfold in such detail. I'll definitely be going back to watch for a third time! 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A heart-warming true life tale, wonderfully bought to life in this film","On the back of the Australian led Hacksaw Ridge, locally tinged Lion represents another fine feature film of equal emotional resonance to Mel Gibson's standout World War 2 film which will likely see the two products competing alongside each other at next month's Academy Awards ceremony.Lion, which see's first time feature director Garth Davis (a wise choice after his work on many of the episodes of the fantastic TV series Top of the Lake) tackle the true story of Saroo Brierley, an Indian man that was adopted at a young age by a loving Australian family after being tragically separated by his family back home, is a film that feels ripe to be a cliché by the numbers finding my family bio that is instead a heart-warming tale filmed with a stunning visual palette and grace and filled with award worthy performances from its cast of seasoned professionals and newcomers alike.Davis tells Saroo's story in halves with Lion's first act bringing us into the harsh, unforgiving, yet often beautiful surrounds of India as Saroo (played wonderfully by newcomer Sunny Pawar, who could just be the films acting MVP) finds himself thousands of kilometres from home and thrown into a dangerous procession of events, then switching the action to an older Saroo (now played by the ever impressive Dev Patel, mastering an Australian accent like many others could only dream of) now at home with his adoptive parents in Hobart but ever wondering about his blood family back home.It's always a danger with these type of narrative set ups, that one section will trump the other but Davis keeps everything in Lion in check and each component of the film fits perfectly in with each other. Saroo remains a constant and likable presence throughout as both a young boy and an adult coming to grips with what has happened to him and his families and with solid supports from the likes of Rooney Mara, Nicole Kidman and the king of great supporting turns David Wenham, Lion packs a carefully developed emotional wallop that in the wrong hands could've come out as manipulative and twee but instead comes forward as true and full of heart, just like the story it is telling.One of the awards seasons most likable and crowd pleasing experiences, Lion is a heart-warming true life tale that is delicately handled by its crew behind camera and masterfully acted out by those in front of it. Filled with touching moments, Lion is a film that will resonate with all from young and old and Lion is another shining example of the films that can be produced here on our fair shores.4 ½ jalebi's out of 5",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

As an adopt child you are eager to find your reall parents and when he did so, he still loved his adopted parents the same which conveys his extremely strong bond with his adopted parents because of his appreciation for bringing him to this coutnry and loving him.This film is an extremely warm and touching, probably has to be one of my favourite movies.

Gut wrenching story of separation & re-union,"Lion was famously & deservedly nominated for Best Picture at the Academy and numerous other story, screenplay, direction and performance awards. But all these, and especially Oscar nominations raise a big question – Is this going to be another one of those dreary art films where you walk out depressed wishing you never watched it, yet feel the need to appreciate it for being an Oscar nominated movie? No. Lion is not only beautifully shot, it has authenticity, drama, mystery and romance which make it a wholesome entertainer.Lion tells the heart wrenching tale of a lost child from India and the extremely real horrors faced by orphan and homeless children like starvation and trafficking which scar them for life. Today, searching for something or someone is almost so easy that we have too many options or privacy concerns. The film also makes you think how today we take several privileges like food, shelter, safety & technology for granted while there are billions of starving children and families living on less than $1/day. It is unbelievable that there are extraordinary families like Sue & John Brierley; true heroes who decided to adopt two children from India and give them a fighting chance in the world. A true story of separation, imperfection, family, love and closure - that needed to be told.Sunny Pawar perfectly portrays innocence and despair of 'Saroo', and manages to look cute despite the homeless kid makeup. Nicole Kidman & Rooney Mara deliver poignant supporting roles, while Nawazuddin Siddiqui makes a surprising, eerie guest appearance onto international cinema. Dev Patel shows tremendous growth as an actor and expertly portrays the guilt and the yearning of a mature 'Saroo' who longs to find his roots and re-unite with his family. From a script standpoint, I would have liked a less dramatic; more realistic transition from Saroo's normal life overseas to his search to find closure. Technically, the film shows almost flawless direction and editing. Definitely watch the movie and find out why it's called 'LION'.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
I gave this film my highest rating at 2017 tiff - my only 9,"Unfortunately, at the second screening there was no Q&A.I had a great question.It was about the young boy.The central character that this film was entirely about.He was either very carefully selected or was actually groomed for the part.That was my question. Did you groom a young Indian boy over years for this role?I think that they did.An emotional roller-coaster to be sure. I was a young boy once, and when I think of a lost boy meeting his long lost mother after all those years my eyes well up with tears, as they do now, as I am writing this.During the film festival I repeatedly said the best film I had seen was this one.

The titles were clean and alluring with none of the gimmickry associated with other titles.There were lenses on some of the cameras and some tricky camera pulling which added to the film rather than detract from it. Never laboured, but with sleight of hand, Lion delivered a satisfying whole which is a compliment to the Producers, Studio, and Production Team.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
This movie's great! I'm not lyin!,"This movie was amazing! I'm still overwhelmed by how fantastic and beautifully done this was! It's one of the few non R-rated Best Picture nominees of 2016, so I decided to give this rare oppurtunity a shot. I'm so glad I did. This is an absolute must see. The first half of the film is in different dialects of Indian with English sutitles, and that can be kind of hard to get through, but about 45 minutes or so into the movie when the dialouge is mostly in English for the remainder of the film. Dev Patel and costar Rooney Mara have something in common. They've both starred in terrible films, but have redeemed themselves with Oscar nominated films. (Patel was in that garbage ""Last Airbender"" movie, and Mara was in the most recent ""Fantastic Four"" remake and ""Pan"", but has starred in ""The Martian which I liked.) This deserves the Best Supporting Actor and Best Adapted Screenplay awards it won. I agree with some critics that some parts of the film moved at a slow pace, but in my opinion the emotion portrayed in those scenes far outweighs the slow pace. The film is emotional and nearly made me cry. It's an absolutely fantastic and brilliant piece of cinema.

Favorite of 2016,"Lion was one of my favorite movies of the year. It made me want to travel, cry, write, and live. Dev Patel carries an incredibly vibrant performance of the true story of Saroo Brierley, who was lost as a child and then attempts to find his family in his 20's. Pair that with grand sweeping landscapes and the incredibly endearing Sunny Pawar, who shines despite the grit of 1980's slums of India, and it had everything I could have wanted in a hauntingly true film. This movie stuck with me days after leaving the theater and only deepened the lifelong crush I have been harboring on Dev Patel (which started in Slumdog and escalated in The Newsroom). I am in general pretty lukewarm on Nicole Kidman, but this is her at her best, and her maternal interactions seemed authentic without being romanticized. All in all, this was near perfect to me, and somehow managed to avoid landmine clichés that could have cheapened this standout of 2016. 9.7/10",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

'Lion' begins with familiar drama beats before it gravitates into uplifting perfection,"'Lion' is a biographical tale about a 5 year old Indian boy who becomes lost, stranded thousands of kilometres from home. He manages to persevere, surviving a frightening passage of time and dealing with the challenges before he gets adopted by an Australian family. 25 years later, he sets out to find his real family. Its powerful stuff.Sunny Pawar makes an impressive debut. The young actor is the heart and soul of the first half of the film, connecting your emotions with his plight of being lost, invested in seeing him safe. He wanders hungry and confused, whilst all manner of undesirables prey on his vulnerability. Dev Petel then brings the character even more depth years later as he comes to terms with his feelings regarding his real family, understandably empty knowing his mother and brother never knew of his fate/survival.Then the whole film is complemented by a beautiful soundtrack that gradually gravitates towards uplifting perfection in Lion's final teary and well-earned moments.

When a young boy becomes lost in the middle of India, the film shows how this displacement is both emotional too, not just physical - & how finding his way home can restore what he lost by bringing closure to an unresolved issue after 25 years - allowing the viewer to spectate at the powerful feat of a man piecing himself back together as an adult after being broken as a child through tragic accidental circumstances.
What's most endearing about Lion is how human the movie is; it wears its heart on its sleeve & embraces the resilience of the human spirit whilst also depicting the worst of it, creating a sense of honesty that the viewer can appreciate & admire.
Everything about it is beautiful - performances, cinematography, direction etc. & the fact that it's also a true story & told so well is worthy of praise too.

Unbelievable film! One of the very best that I have seen.,"This movie is truly exceptional. Everything about it is perfectly done. The way the story is told, the acting, everything is outstanding.Lion really resonates with you for a while after seeing it. The story is an epic tale of how one tiny decision can change the course of your entire life. The acting is impeccable. It reminds me a lot of Slumdog Millionaire, however, the story could not be more different. Lion is the true story of a boy who begs his brother to go to work a night shift with him and he falls asleep at the train station. When he wakes, he finds that the station is deserted. He goes onto the train in the station and falls asleep. When he wakes up the train is moving and does not stop for 1600 Kms. By the time he gets to the destination, he does not know where he is, where he is from or what his mothers name is. He is eventually taken to a center for street kids and is one of the very lucky ones who is adopted by a well-to-do Australian family.

Delightful,"My father was watching this movie and I just stared at it for few minutes, ended up watching the whole movie. The story, visuals, acting perfomance were all really good. Dev Patel was exceptional, the scene where he looks at jalebis in kitchen and remembering his family, all were performed so realistically. I was surprised when my father mentioned it was an Australian movie about half way through. The way they captured life in villages of India, I have never come across in any Indian movies. The visuals were amazing, often they show is how big the world is and how easy it is to get lost. This film will make us want more from Indian film industry. We're only making more and more hero movies with over exaggerated stunt scenes.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Cleanses the soul,This is my first review in IMDb and couldn't stop getting in to share the unforgettable experience after watching LION.You can't miss relating to your own life's reflections here and simply watching the little Saroo made me cry in every scene. Yes. He was acting but brought back the true feeling in every second of the film. I have never drenched so deep in watching a movie but this is an epic. Changes perspective on how we look at the privileges we have today and take it for granted.Congratulations to the team for sharing such a wonderful experience.,9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Wow,"Watched this at our local film club with about 50 people in the audience. At the end, there was literally not a dry eye in the house, including the presenter.
A stunning masterpiece and acting masterclass. We know Kidman and Dev Patel can act but the young lad that played the first half was sensational.

"Compelling, astounding and brilliance","When I started watching this movie, I was wondering why so much focus on the young Saroo but the camera was just brilliant and background score held me up and I was kind of glued to the whole movie. Superb acting, brilliantly directed and those flashbacks were just outstanding. Finally something really nice and Mature acting from Deb Patel and I will be looking forward for some more brilliant performances like this in future. This movie made me realize or it's a wake up call for me to somewhere I have to also get those dead ends open and move on. Hats off. Not to mention Nicole, she was just fantastic and fabulous, there was a moment when tears started flowing and I did not realize why but that was just something amazing what an actress has an effect on you.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Lion proves that through resilience and determination, the seemingly impossible can be achieved.","What a story this is! Incredibly remarkable and astonishing. A young Indian boy becomes lost 1600km from his home village. Months later he is adopted by an Australian couple, where years later he yearns to rediscover the location of his real family. After the first ten minutes, I could smell the awards fragrance. A powerful stench it is, but it has every right to attract golden statuettes. A real tearjerker in every sense, I advise you bring tissues. There is so much raw emotion here, both on the surface and embedded within the narrative. An important story that needed to be told to highlight the poverty and missing children of India. Then, to introduce Saroo to the privileged world, meant he adopted an internal conflict. Stay with his Australian family who provided him with a chance at having a good life, or locate his real family who might still be searching for him. Both have consequences which are explored rather well. Fortunately the Australian couple are the nicest and most generous people in existence, which makes Saroo's choice that much easier. A beautiful tender story, with plenty of rich depth. Dev Patel shines amongst the heavyweights in what is his best role. He is able to portray that internal conflict enigmatically to create an emotionally involving performance. It never felt falsified. Nicole Kidman, Rooney Mara and, a personal favourite of mine, David Wenham were are all fantastic and really supported Patel. Sunny Pawar, who plays young Saroo, was a revelation. He captured innocence and fragility. Google Earth has never been so useful, although I do find how Saroo utilised it to be rather coincidental in the film. It's slightly too melodramatic and emotionally manipulative for my taste, but when the last ten minutes arrived...I felt goosebumps. I let myself in and was overwhelmed with happiness. The addition of the real footage at the end was the icing on the cake. A truly wondrous drama that portrays generosity, resilience and happiness.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
An India you expected; a story that perhaps you didn't.,"Diane and I saw this memorable film today and she, more than I, (her words, found it ""enthralling""); however, I saw it as a movie that captured my attention and kept that attention throughout the film.Diane is more sensitive to the soft nuances of a screenplay, and she thought that, particularly the Direction, brought out the best in the actors. I know that this comment seems to be more about her thoughts than mine; however, I did see in the movie all her comments about what we saw on the screen.The plot is known to all aficionados of the moving screen but to see the actors draw substance out of a script that devours so many minutes of screen time is a delicious watch. The fact that the action takes place in the visually delightful country of India is a feast for the eyes to use a trite saying but the cinematography brings out India's horrendous poverty.

Simply Excellent,"I haven't watched much movies for a long time and had been hearing a lot about this movie ever since it was released. and this evening, I took the chance.Directed by Garth Davis, from the moment the movie starts it gets your attention. A five year old boy, who lives in a village in India, after going in search for some food with his elder brother, finds himself in the city of Calcutta - alone. He then fights to overcome challenges and ends up in a orphanage, where he is told that he is to be adopted by a couple in Australia.The movie stars Dev Patel, Nicole Kidman, Deepti Naval, David Wenham, Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Priyanka Bose, Rooney Mara and Sunny Pawar.Sunny Pawar, as the five year old boy, is simply excellent and carries his role well and is very convincing. Very powerful acting. Dev Patel, who I last saw in ""Slumdog Millionaire,"" is, once again excellent as are Nicole Kidman and David Wenham and Priyanka Bose. Garth Davis and the script writers have kept to the real story on which this is based as much as possible.Conclusion. Worth watching but be prepared to have plenty of tissues at hand.

Lion..roars..and how!,"Every once in a while comes a movie about survival that unknowingly ends up spreading the beautiful message of 'hope'. Lion is one such 'long' story of survival, a story that looses its way in the slums of Khandwa, struggles in the by lanes of Calcutta only to find solace in the arms of a childless couple living in Australia.Sunny Pawar is the little 'cub' here called Saroo who ultimately transforms into the 'lion' played beautifully by Dev Patel. It is great to see how the little hope in Saroo's eyes suddenly turns into 'questionable conduct' after 25 years when he realizes of his true origin and that's where Dev Patel actually scores as an actor. Nicole Kidman and David Wenham play these really humane characters who take this little brown-skinned boy under their wings giving him a life that every normal human child deserves. Rooney Mara is another great actress who emotes really well.Director Garth Davis directs his first feature film Lion and the result is a great story that brings together two lives, one lead by Saroo's Mother who despite her shortcomings never gives up upon her lost 'cub' and the other lead by Saroo's Mum who brings up a lost 'cub' and grooms him into a 'lion' making him competent enough to reach out to his mother even after 25 years. Had it not been for the Brierley's, Saroo may never have survived even to tell his story.Saroo is about that one such child who found his way home, there are million out there who don't even live to see that day.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

almost as good as the true story,"'Life beats film' might be one of those clichéd phrases, but it fits perfectly with 'Lion', Garth Davis' 2016 debut as a film director. The film is based on the true story of Indian-Australian businessman Saroo Brierley, who was lost as a child by his family in vast India and adopted by an Australian family in Tasmania. The real Saro Brierley wrote a book describing his years-long search, finding and reuniting with his biological mother and siblings left behind in India. If it had been a fictional story, 'Lion' would probably have been criticized as excessive melodrama. Aided as it is by an inspired final that ties it to reality, the film is compelling and manages to create genuine emotion.The first half of the film is excellently crafted. Nothing shows that we are dealing with a first-time feature films director. Garth Davis brings to life in detail the India of the 90s, with its geographical dimensions and especially with its human dimensions, with contrasts and poverty but also with the complex humanity that populates it. Greig Fraser's cinamatography is exquisite. The lead role in this part is interpreted by an Indian kid named Sunny Pawar, exceptional in expressiveness and intensity. The hero's journey, from the moments he leaves his native village and is separated from his older brother to the moment he is adopted by the Australian couple and travels to Tasmania, was a true x-ray of India at that time.Twenty years later, Saroo is by all accounts a young Australian of Indian origin. His identity crisis only kicks in when he leaves Tasmania to study in Melbourne, where he is faced with questions about his origins. Memories regain their place, the image of the biological mother and brother from whom he had been separated gradually replaces that of the adoptive parents and brother, and the questions left open turn into obsession. Nicole Kidman was chosen by the real Mrs. Brierly to play her role and manages to give her - in few but well-written scenes - consistency. On the other hand, the fictional character of Lucy, Saroo's Australian girlfriend, seems out of sync with the rest of the story and Rooney Mara's casting is not the most inspired either. Dev Patel is a very talented and extremely charismatic actor. I think he managed to fit into the role of grown-up Saroo well, and the scenes where he reminisces about his past or imagines the possible future reunion are the best in the second part of the film, which otherwise doesn't live up to the first part. The ending is familiar to anyone who knows the story that inspired the film, and yet, the way it was done, many viewers will shed a tear or two. In the end 'Lion' is not much inferior to the true story.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"important, informing and relevant","Lion stars Dev Patel and Sunny Pawar and tells the emotional and miraculous true story of 'Saroo' an Indian child who finds his way back home after 25 years of being separated from his family and adopted by an Australian family. The performance from the child actor Sunny Pawar was really great, his emotions and deliveries were all on point, His performance was heartfelt and heartbreaking, his fear and sense of isolation were done very well in the scenes where he first separates from his family, how he was depicted walking through the crowds, the sheer size comparison alone pacts such a strong effect.I really liked this movie because of how it was able to deliver an emotional and powerful story, the emotions from the child's point of view and also in the later act with Dev Patel depicting a victim of trauma and the feeling of lost and the idea of searching for self purpose and his own roots were great. The excruciating process of trying to grasp that thread of memory digging through a dark pool of nothingness. Also the guilt that he feels for not having contacted his family all well explored and acted out.The film also does a great job exploring India's poverty, the scene depicting a child snatching group was not only informing but relevant and impactful. Delivering an overall message of the amount of children that are lost in India each year at the end of the film, presumably falling into the hands of such criminal groups. This isn't necessarily a very commercially viable movie, but it is as mentioned very important and explores the darker corners of the world and human nature.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

The issues portrayed throughout the film reveal the harsh truths that many Indian families go through and the actors did an excellent job in representing these realities, young actor, Sunny Pawar does an astonishing job dealing with the script. The first act is very authentic which is something extremely different from movies these days, the Hindi language is present in majority of the movie which further makes the Indian culture very present. Dev Patel does an amazing job as he acts as a wounded adult who longs to find his birth mother, brother and sister, the story is emotional draining as you can see the characters hardships and challenges as Saroo searches for his biological family.

LION REVIEW,"This movie is a major tear jerker and beautiful story! The first part of the movie is absolutely fantastic with Sunny Pawar's amazing performance that draws the audience in so well. It's fair to see he is a star on the rise!The movie has a beautiful and real story line and although it has been changed to be a Hollywood film the authenticity is still there especially in the opening act when the Hindi language is used and in the end when their are real life shots shown.Although this movie is fantastic the second half when Dev Patel is main the movie quality shifts from a 9/10 to a 7/10. This is because this part feels a lot slower and feels as though something is missing, it is almost as if as an audience member you feel less empathy and connection with the character.I would definitely recommend this movie as I think it is very different to what you see these days in movies and I think the quality and story is amazing!",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

MUST SEE! POWERFUL! Bring on the Kleenex!! Extra boxes of them. The little boy is an instant star...,"I honestly, initially, didn't really have any interest in this film, even with all the Oscar nomination raves going towards it because I had no idea what it was about other than the title being ""Lion"" and it starred the guy from ""Slumdog Millionaire"" and had a very odd looking Nicole Kidman...When I finally heard what the film was really all about, it intrigued me and the film really had me hooked from the start of the film.The little boy in this film is easily an instant star! He is adorable like a little puppy. His older brother, Guddu, also has a strong memorable presence.I didn't really care about the relationship with the girlfriend, as that just felt rushed and irrelevant, but the relationships with the brothers and mothers is just so heart-wrenching.I thought once it got to the older version played by Dev Petel, I thought the film would end up being weaker, because the little boy is just so charming, but Dev did a great job.It didn't win any Oscars, but who cares. Anyone can relate to trying to find your home and that rush of emotions filling up. The music and cue really adds to the emotions.The power of technology and determination.

A compelling and emotion provoking story about an eternal belonging.,"This is truly an amazing film, it did not only grip and hold on to my emotions but it has the whole time kept me in the narrative. I simply enjoyed It. I wiped tears occasionally from my eyes as i watched. The film is full of intense substance that is relevant to me. Struggle - poverty, family bonds, coming of age, perseverance, purpose,fulfillment and many more vital and relevant issues are raised by this film that questions who i am and what i want out of life. Young Saroo - Sunny Pawar's performance on this film is outstanding; a down to earth and so good to be true performance!I also would like to get a bit technical about this wonderful piece, I loved one of the opening shots: The establishing shot where we see Saroo really small in a frame running. This shot for me really speaks a lot about the journey of Saroo from the onset. It speaks of the freedom he had, his whole world that is soon about to change forever but remain with him.I must as well comment the director Garth Davis for simplicity and remarkable, amazing outcome. As an aspiring director this film has challenged me a lot, to work more with first time actors and not fear. What he has achieved in directing this little guy is terrific. I also love the yellow color grading of the film with its high contrast images. It really draws our attention to important details such as eyes.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Lion Roars,"Lion finally helped me complete my viewing of all the best picture nominees, and I'd have to agree it deserves a place up there with the other great films.Lion is the story of a boy in India who gets lost and ends up traveling far from home not knowing where he is. He is then adopted into a family in Australia where he grows up and decides he wants to find his old family. The movie has two distinct parts: young Saroo and older Saroo. The younger of the two steals the show and makes you want to see more of his young bravery.Nicole Kidman plays his adoptive mother and she does a fine job but Saroo is the central character the entire way and I felt gripped the entire time rooting for him not to give up. The film briefly brings up the idea of leaving your past in the past. It asks the question, if you don't like what you find would you continue searching, but neither of those points are focused on for too long. Besides that brief discussion the main focus of this movie is just watching young Saroo survive surrounded by Indian's but not speaking their native Bengali since he is from another part of the country and speaks Hindi. The movie does a great job showing what many young children face being alone in the streets. As the movie ends, the credits explain there are over 80,000 displaced children like Saroo which really lends weight to the story and makes his one to root for.Dev Patel plays the older Saroo and he does a great job playing a man who has a conflict of roots. He speaks Australian, almost forgetting his Hindi, and assimilates to the culture. In college he meets Rooney Mara and some other students and while at a dinner party of an Indian friend he sees something that jolts his past square into his present making that search for his family the main focus while trying to juggle his current family.The music was beautiful and really helped push these emotions home without feeling forced as it so easily could have. The locations were also beautiful, giving a true feel to the streets of Calcutta and the wilderness of India along with Australia as well.Lion is a must see for this Oscar season with more going for it than not. Great performances especially from newcomer Sunny Pawar as young Saroo along with beautiful music and a feel good story that will have you teary eyed.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

In my perspective as a complete layman in professional acting I should say little Sunny made it easy for Dev Patel in the second half (Yes, I know movies are not shot in final view-able sequence & Dev patel did a great job too),I should commend the entire cast and crew for their work.

"A film of great quality, although marked by the duality of the script and by an excessive emotional appeal.","This film, for me, has one big point for it and one big point against it. The point in its favor is that it is consistently based on a true story, and as far as I can tell it has been relatively faithful to events. The downside is the fact that it is one of those films that constantly appeals to the public's emotions in order to have some ability to capture our attention. It's not particularly pleasant having to watch a movie that almost forces you to have a box of Kleenex next to you from start to finish.The script tells the story of an Indian child, very poor, who likes to play with his brother by the train tracks. It so happens that, one day, things go really wrong and Saroo - that's the child's name - ends up trapped in a train that starts moving, taking him to new places, and separating him from his brother and family. Lost, not knowing how to get back in touch, he ends up in an orphanage. There, he will be adopted by an Australian couple, and raised with all the sweetness. But he never forgets his mother and, as an adult, he decides to return to India to find her.After the success of ""Slumdog Milionaire"", it seems that Western cinema is permeable and open to what is best done in Bollywood. This film is not Indian, but it has actors of Indian origin and was well received, with good reviews and a good box office. The film ""cleaned up"" the Australian film awards and won some BAFTA awards, but lost the Oscars for which it had been nominated and was categorically ignored by the Golden Globes. By the way, while we're at it, it's quite difficult to understand how Dev Patel and Nicole Kidman - the film's protagonists and its main actors - ended up being nominated for Oscars in the Supporting Actor/Actress categories! The only reason I see for this ""disqualification"" is a possible attempt not to put them on the path of ""favorites"" to the two figurines, namely Ryan Gosling, Emma Stone and Casey Affleck. In any case, the film was one of the ""losers"" of that year's Oscars.The film is solidly starred by Dev Patel, an actor who thus consolidates his status as an international star and who guarantees him a place, if he wants, in American cinema. He only appears near the middle of the film because the story begins in the character's childhood, yet he didn't hesitate and confidently embraced his character with charisma and talent. For her part, Nicole Kidman also does not miss the opportunity to do another job very well done. Less interesting, David Wenham and Rooney Mara did what they could with two rather underdeveloped characters.One of the film's problems is its duality: developed in two halves (the first focused on the main character's childhood, and the second on her search for her mother, already in adult life), they are quite different from each other. I'm not going to say which one is the best, I think that's something relative and that says more about the viewer than the work, but I can say that I liked the second one better, even if it seems less coherent than the first one, more solid, but also more melodramatic. In this regard, it is necessary to praise the work of the young Sunny Pawar who, with an interpretation of demanding characteristics in which he shone, sustains a part of the film that, without him, would be much less interesting.Technically, what I most appreciated and feel commended for is the quality of the cinematography, which is clean, sharp, excellently framed and in magnificent colors. The sets and costumes are also very good, and the careful choice of filming locations allows for the inclusion of a beautiful set of landscapes. On this subject, it is worth watching the beginning of this film with attention. The soundtrack and the visual and sound effects complete all this with subtle touches, of great quality.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Authentically touching and beautifully done, nearly 10/10","Zero spoilers: Soulful without being trite, Lion is a journey film that explores the tie of family, the way we map our memories, and the longing to fully understand identity. Ranging from India to Australia, this chronicles a spirited boy becoming a quiet but determined man, a focused dreamer. Performances and story are a solid 10, with only a few aesthetic choices in camera department and a few issues of narrative focus robbing it for what would be a perfect score and one of the best films of the past few years.Dev Patel is mesmerizing, as are every one of the Indian actors who grace the screen for the first half of the film. Beginning with phenomenal aerial photography, the camera offers gorgeous visual narration and draws us into the themes of place and displacement from the first flicker of the projector.The editing is also sensational, with beautiful pacing and way-- creating tension then exploring memory. The film rarely drags or feels that it is rushing.Really, close to perfect. The aesthetic and narrative adjustments that I would have made come down primarily to preference-- the lighting, framing, and cinematographic choices made during a few scenes drew me out of the narrative, and as a fussy film festival director I could pinpoint them but it wouldn't matter.A few moments made me loose a bit of faith in the aesthetic cohesiveness because of a feeling that things vacillated from a ""shooting commercials"" look to a more self- conscious indie style shoot (which I found unconvincing given the grandeur of the film, and unflattering to several of the female actors, there seemed to be an unawareness of portraiture in some key scenes that involved women). Additionally, it was a sad oversight that there were no female characters in the entire film that existed other than to forward the male story-- while there were fantastic female characters and wonderful performances by a number of actresses (NK, RM, and the Indian orphanage lady as well as another female key character spring to mind)-- still, when there is license to translate a real story into cinema there is also license to expand some of the characters, Nicole Kidman's mother had such depth it would have been easy to have a scene with her and a female friend that showed more of her depth of life outside the frame of being ""the mom,"" or Roony Mara's ""girlfriend"" who also interacted with no other women. In an era in which awareness of the Bechdel test is so prevalent, and there are increasingly multi- faceted and wonderful roles for women as there are in this film-- it would really have been thoughtful and expanded the scope of story to include women whose purpose did not stop at serving this film-- because this is a gorgeous human story and not just a star vehicle. Likewise some of the camera department aesthetic choices seemed inconsistent and a bit insulting to the sensational aerial cinematography and superb editing. Truly worth a good watch, I enjoyed Lion on many levels. You're in for a treat!",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
The best movie of the last few years...,"From the start, I must say that I am an avid movie-goer, and as a result, most movies that I see barely scrape the surface of what I would begin to call a 'good movie'. Lion makes the cut, and more than that, I would venture to say that it is one the best movies that I have seen all year, if not in the last few years. Beautifully shot and acted, and complemented by a script and direction that goes beyond the conventions of your typical movie, Lion invites you to join the amazing and emotionally profound journey of 'Saroo' as he searches to find his way back home, to his family, and to himself, after having been lost for over 25 years.I am going to keep this review short. I watch a lot of movies - 1 to 2 every night - and I must say that Lion is a treat. It truly is movie making at its best. I am honestly surprised that it didn't win the best picture award at the Oscars. From a person that didn't care too much about the hit 'Slumdog Millionaire' a few years back, I must say that Lion is a step above the rest. A great movie that I must truly recommend. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Excellent tale of hope and determination,"'Lion' (the reason behind the title is revealed at the end) is an amazing journey - and a true story too! Simple premise - Saroo (Pawar - one cute kid!) helps his brother, Guddu (Bharate), little sister Shekila (Solanki) and mother (Bose) to survive in the Indian poverty, when one day his brother accidentally loses him on a train station. Being only five, after travelling for two days, Saroo can't pronounce his home town correctly, so he ends up in a juvenile prison, along with thousands of other lost kids. The time spent (45min) with young Saroo builds his character and back story nicely, and displays the vibrant and bustling India.Saroo is adopted by Sue (Kidman) & John (Wenham - needed a bit more to do) and given a great life in Hobart. They also adopt Mantosh (Ladwa) - Saroo (now Patel) grows up well-adjusted, Mantosh not so much. Saroo meets Lucy (Mara) at university in Melbourne and they fall in love. He then finally decides to search for his mother, brother and sister, which is a tough ask across the billion-plus people in India and the fact he doesn't know what region he's from.The pacing is good - doesn't feel like a two-hour film - and I would rate this on the same level as 'Slumdog Millionaire': they both have some similarities, but quite a few differences, with Patel's charisma shining through and helping him to carry the film. The support cast is good, but he has to display the most emotion and the ending in India is beautiful. Decent score, great Indian and Tasmanian settings and a great story.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Amazing and Moving True-Story!,"Lion is quite possibly the most tear-jerking film I've ever seen in my life; thank you Garth Davis. And I've seen Schindler's List, Pan's Labyrinth and One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest. Lion is the story of lost Indian-boy Saroo Brierley: and his long-gestating journey to find his family, from whom he was accidentally separated from in 1986. The story and journey from then to the present actually has some surprising twists and turns; and one of them was subversively shocking and disturbing (involving a character's paedophilic subtext). This is a family film that explores a deeper emotional spectrum than most family pics.Lion is one of 2016's finest offerings in cinema. I know that some critics and audience- based reviews cited issues with the pacing, but I believe that it was completely intentional on behalf of director Garth Davis. It's an emotional journey that needs some lenient pacing for the sake of the audience's emotional responses. Davis directs his actors with real flare and there's hardly a pointless moment ever caught on camera. Every moment is important to Saroo's struggle and the film's overall philanthropic message: help children less fortunate than us to reunite with their lost families. It's a powerful story, theme and message we can all identify with; and are more than willing to help.Lion is truly moving, and could be the first of many like-minded philanthropic films countering and solving childhood problems. Please see this film and spread the word.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A journey of hope and determination,"Lion is about a five-year-old Indian boy gets lost on the streets of Calcutta, where he is adopted by an Australian family in Tasmania. After 25 years he sets out to find his family.It is an inspiring and beautiful movie that explores the ideas of hope, determination and aspects of origin and identity. By having the first half of the movie in Hindu it captures the authenticity of this story. Many people may believe that having sub titles people won't want to read them. However this was the complete opposite for me, during the film it didn't even feel like it was an effort to read them.However, during the middle of the movie when he was using google maps to search for his home town, it dragged out to long. In between the main character Saroo searching using the platform google earth many complications occur which drag outs the process.I think the fact that this is a true story played a massive part in the conclusion having such an impact on me. By including the description, facts and images of the real life footage makes this a powerful film that addresses the issue of young children in India. It makes people question what happens to children that do actually get lost. Who helps lost children? What are the dangers faced by these lost children? Why do certain people choose to adopt?? How do the parents go about trying to find them? Do people and companies actually help look for the parents of these lost children?Overall this was a great movie to watch, with excellent actors and a great simple storyline!",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
There is GOD,"I am writing this review as an Australian Indian who moved to Australia in 1989. Unlike Saroo's experience I moved to Australia for education and work and later called Australia my home. To me Australians are great souls which Brierly family rightfully signifies and are excellent living examples.The film is very hard hitting showing us the true meaning of love and care. I love the scene in the beginning where Saroo is surrounded by butterflies that shows us the innocence is surrounded by and protected at the same time by love of God. There is no secret or spoiler to this film as its based on true story, therefore all I'll say is that the Writers and Director have done an excellent job, and to add to it we see some brilliant acting especially by Nicole Kidman.Please take a box of tissues with you when watching LION because you're sure to cry from start to end.You know there is GOD when you see this film.God bless ALL LOST SOULS.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Journey to Remember,"Lion is a film about the journey of a young Indian boy who was adopted into an Australian family and searches for his birth mother. The storyline is uplifting, hopeful and astonishing. It is hard to believe that a person can find their home using Google Earth. The use of technology to find his home is amazing as at the time Google Earth was a new feature for the internet. This small part of the film alone will move amaze you.The cast is incredible from the uprising child star Sunny Pawar who stars in the first third of the film. Through to Dev Patel who leads the rest of the film and carries on Saroo's journey to find his home. Nicole Kidman, David Wenham and Rooney Mara, although having limited screen time assist with convincing the audience of the miraculous story of Saroo. 
 
There is so much diversity this film has to offer. Although it is a true story, it is unlike anything seen in the cinematic world. It is not only about one thing; being lost, romance; a journey. It contains multiple aspects of films from action to romance and the whole plot encompases teh main idea of finding something and going on a journey to do so.Not only is the ending incredible but the whole plot and everything from the cast, cinematography and soundtrack is amazing.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
One Man's Journey,"LION (2016)Garth Davis's feature film directorial debut is an absolute wonder of a movie. LION chronicles the life of Saroo (Dev Patel), a young boy from rural India who gets separated from his family. The film explores Saroo's journey from the streets of Calcutta to his adoption in Australia, and his journey as an adult to locate his lost home.LION is a beautifully told and masterful piece of cinema. The film is gripping from start to end with a handful of intense emotional moments that will dampen even the driest of eyes. The first act of the movie follows Saroo as a young boy and is almost 100% without a hint of English and it absolutely works. The viewer is fully immersed into Saroo's world and you feel deeply his turmoil and strife. The film also has an incredible aesthetic appeal that starts with the opening shots and does not let up. The cinematography is gorgeous and the reoccurring piano theme fits the tone and feel of the movie perfectly.The acting was spot-on. Dev Patel was extremely convincing as was Rooney Mara with Nicole Kidman being the real standout. The Indian actors were lovely as well and held up fantastically against the more mainstream actors. But the movies main focus was Saroo and his physical and spiritual journey. His arc in the film was incredibly moving, especially in the 2nd and 3rd acts.I only have some minor issues with the film. I felt that Sunny Pawar, the actor who plays Saroo as a child, lacked a little bit and could have been more convincing, and I wish the film developed Saroo and his family's relationship with Mantosh a little more. It felt a little forced and the payoff would have been much greater with just a little more development. But, the most frustrating thing for me were the title cards throughout the film. They were overused and cliché and took me out of the movie. There are ways to explain the passage of time and location without spelling it out for the audience.Other than those minor grievances, I thought the film was absolutely lovely and wholeheartedly recommend seeing LION in theaters. This has Oscar's written all over it.Fav. Scene: The dinner scene towards the end of the filmMy Rating: 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A powerful and emotional experience,"Foreign films can sometimes be a trying experience. They can be hard to relate to and appreciate, often through no fault of their own. So when you come across a foreign film that features none of these problems, you know it is something special and must be excellently made. 'Lion' is certainly one of those films. It has deservedly been nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards, and while I don't expect it to compete for the actual win, its still good to see a film like this get the recognition it has earned.Dev Patel and Nicole Kidman have also both been nominated for Academy Awards in supporting roles. Both were very strong in their roles, without perhaps ever blowing me away. It sounds like Patel fully immersed himself in the role, and the only thing holding him back was probably a couple of very strong scenes that he could show his true acting talents off in. He was strong in every scene he was in, but nothing that was overly memorable. Kidman probably falls into the same category. Consistently strong, but never gets a chance to completely show off the vast talents we all know she has.The film is very different from what I was expecting going in, however I would have to say that that turned out to be a good thing. The way it went about telling the story actually worked very well. There is a lot of emotion behind the story and the characters, and the fact that this is based on a true story is nothing short of heart-breaking. There's also some terrific pacing throughout and it all results in a fantastic final product. A film not to be missed.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Beautiful and emotional,"Lion is an incredibly made film, using gorgeous set scenes and a powerful cast.Sunny Pawar is incredible at expressing emotions with nothing but his eyes and actions. Watching Pawar create young Saroo as vulnerable against the treacherous world, and flying to the whims of destiny creates a roller-coaster of emotions and intrigue. To then be transformed into a Saroo portrayed by Dev Patel is incredible and consistent with the film's aims. Patel does a wonderful job at Saroo's identity crisis, his want to know and find more, and his alienation from the current social scene.The flow of the film and where it ends really brings to light numerous questions revolved around identity, family, and ancestry. Garth Davis does very well in combining the cast with such a well developed story, and using scenery and music to really evoke the needed emotions to hit real life problems to an audience seeking genuine and raw goodness.

Schmaltz overkill,"As so often these days, the trailer for LION gives too much of the story away, including the ending, which robs it of any chance to surprise us. What did surprise me was how involving the story was. Sunny Pawar who plays the 5-year-old Paroo, marooned in Calcutta 1500 miles from his home village, is the most appealing and compelling child star since Joel Haley Osment. Both in India and in the early scenes in Australia after he is adopted by Nicole Kidman and her husband, he is gut-wrenchingly convincing as a lost little boy. Not just likable, this kid is utterly lovable.Dev Patel is someone we already like thanks to the MARIGOLD HOTEL movies, and here as the 30-year-old Saroo he comes pretty close to being lovable as well. Ms Kidman delivers one of her best-ever performances as the Aussie mum with a heart of gold. The script slightly loses its edge and some pace as Saroo wrestles with his memories and with Google Earth before embarking on the trip to be reunited with his lost family. His brother in Tasmania, another adopted Indian but with behavioural issues, gets forgotten in the final scenes – a careless oversight in a movie about abandoned siblings.The postscript, offering us glimpses of the real Paroo and his two mothers, comes close to schmaltz overkill but this is a picture that sets out to warm the cockles of our cold cynical hearts – and warm them it does (if your cockles aren't warmed you might want to think about a transplant).",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

A riveting drama that steers clear of biopic clichés.,"This Australia-India co-production has been a heavyweight in the awards season, having picked up multiple Golden Globe and Oscar nominations, and it's not hard to see why. Based on an incredible true story, Lion opens with the harrowing journey of 5-year-old Indian boy Saroo Brierley, who is separated from his family after being trapped on a cargo train that terminates in Calcutta, some 1600km away from his hometown in Khandwa. Anchored by an outstanding turn from newcomer Sunny Pawar, the first half is a devastating look at how easily children can become lost in the over-populated India, and how the terror is amplified when so few people—even those charged to protect citizens—seem to care. It's a relief to Saroo then, albeit tentatively and sceptically at first, that he's saved from his prison-esque orphanage by a sweet Tasmanian couple who, through genuine love and care, wish to provide him a fruitful childhood he otherwise would have missed. When we meet adult Saroo (Dev Patel) two decades later he is about to head off to university in Melbourne, blessed with a wonderful upbringing, a loving family and bright future ahead. Yet there's something nagging him, an underlying issue of identity and loss that is bubbling away underneath the surface. Saroo's search for home could have bogged down the second half in cliché and melodrama, but Patel's performance is so full of complexity and charisma that it grounds the unbelievable sequence of events in heartfelt realism. Despite sharing a cute chemistry together, Saroo's complicated romance with American exchange student Lucy (Rooney Mara) feels like an unnecessary subplot, but his unique relationship with adoptive mother Sue (a terrific Nicole Kidman) is captivating. Refining his trade on the haunting mini-series Top of the Lake, Aussie director Garth Davis' leap into feature films is a successful one; Lion is a riveting drama worthy of all the awards attention it has received.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

A film with a soul!,"Lion Cast: Dev Patel, Nicole Kidman, Priyanka Bose, Sunny Pawar Lion is the true story of Saroo , a 5 year old kid living in Ganesh Thali a small neighborhood somewhere in Central India. It traces his journey from Ganesh Thali with his big brother Guddoo, his sister Shakila and their mother Kamala to a very different life in Australia with his adopted parents. In very unfortunate circumstances , he gets separated from his family in India and gets transported to a very different life in Australia with his adopted parents. He has seemingly forgotten his past but is reunited with his childhood memories when he accidentally sights a Jalebi . It is 2008 and Google has just released a new software called Google Earth and he sets about completing an impossible task of reuniting with his family. Dev Patel is brilliant as the 20 something Saroo who is haunted by his childhood memories. His eyes convery the anguish of a person who cannot let go of his past. He has played a similar role in 'Slumdog Millionaire' but this is a more memorable performance , aided by the script and the good work done by his co-stars. Nicole Kidman and Tanistha Chatterjee are ably cast in the role of his real and adopted mothers. The star of the film is without a doubt the child actor Sunny Pawar, the younger version of Saroo who conveys the joy in his simple life as well as the tragedy that he undergoes with equal elan. The film follows a tight script through out and concludes with some photographs and a vide from Saroo's actual life. Those real life clippings literally brought tears in my eyes. Also revealed in the end is the mystery behind the title of the film. All in all , a must watch and in my view one of the best English films with an Indian connection- miles ahead of the Oscar winner 'Slumdog Millionaire'.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Absolute admiration for every aspect of this movie... breathtaking,"As many others, i cried since minute one to the end of movie and beyond...little saroo performance is just amazing, he drives you to live every moment he experienced and feel his wounds, from the minute he awaken on that platform bunch, crazy calling guduuuuuu on that damn train, picking up that spoon out of garbage and acting eating in front of that restaurant storefront, surviving orphanage- juvenile prison to finally being adopted, he was so brave, full of patience and had that survival instinct we all have in us. I suffered every moment i imagined the real saroo living his mishap and suffered more when was reading about sunny pawar coming also from a poor family but still, keeping the positive attitude as many children around the world. over 80 000 kids are living the same in India every year and 4 millions are living in the Indian streets being abused, mistreated and killed by hunger, that's happening all over the world, i hope this movie can help bring forward our human sense and help around in any way is possible- even if that movie gives you the rage to speak up for all kids around, to protect them and to give them all the love you have...

A film of stirring emotions,"When the source story is a compelling story, it makes it a little easier for it to be a powerful film. Lion is a film of stirring emotions. It depicts a real life story of Saroo Brierley, who after 25 years of being separated from his family, miraculously finds them with the help of modern day technology Google Earth. It took 6 years of painstaking search.Saroo (whose birth name name is actually 'Sheru' meaning 'lion') grew up in Ganesh Talai, a village in the city of Khandwa, India. His mother is a labourer carrying bricks for a living and young Saroo (Sunny Pawar) desperately wants to help out by joining his older brother Guddu (Abhishek Bharate) foraging for money at train stations. One night, when he was 5 years old, he took a nap and woke up to find his brother missing. In an attempt to search for him, he boarded a departing train, which ultimately took him on a 1,600km journey to the city of Calcutta.The young Sunny Pawar gave a magnetic and immersive performance as the young Saroo. He blends in so naturally with the life that is portrayed, and we as the audience are instantly drawn in by his innocence and on-screen charisma. Alone, defenceless and frightened, we follow him as he struggles through perils, before he is finally put in an orphanage and adopted by an Australian couple John (David Wenham - 'Lord of the Rings') and Sue Brierley (Nicole Kidman - 'The Railway Man'). It was delightful to see those two Aussie actors being cast in their respective roles.Pawar effortlessly carries the first half of the film and sets the perfect tone and foundations for the remaining half. In the present day, the grown up Saroo (Dev Patel), is now at university studying Hotel Management in Australia, where he meets girlfriend Lucy (Rooney Mara). We see him living a very different life than he otherwise would have. At a friends' gathering, he stumbled upon a plate of ""Jalebi"" – a sweet dessert popular in India, and it triggered a childhood memory of him and his brother Guddu back home. This was an extremely profound scene, as it is incredibly relatable. We all have those moments where something little like that can prompt us to reminisce about our childhood memories we keep close to us. For many of us, 'home' evokes sentiments that are familiar, tender and nostalgic. Perhaps when it comes to our childhood memories of home, we, like Saroo, are not afraid to show our vulnerabilities. The memories we have may be faint gossamers of the past, but they do leave indelible marks on us and the bonds we have with those we love are perpetual.The second half is comparatively weaker. The film loses a little of its momentum but it is quiet understandable as it is somewhat difficult to propel the narrative forward with excitement when the search for home is all via Google Maps on a computer screen. The result is that when he finally found his home on the map, it happened quickly and seemed relatively easy, compared to the many years spent in real life. And let me just say, the idea of using Google Maps to try and match the mental pictures in his mind of his home is just ingenious. Without it, the search would have been almost impossible.Nevertheless, Garth Davis ('Top of the Lake') manages to harness its energy of its brilliant cast and the story never ceases to move us, up until the final reunion. Kidman, in particular, portrays Sue's fragility and strength with sensitivity and density. Patel is equally solid, matching her fear and uncertainty with his own quiet conviction and understanding. He has matured immensely since his 'Slumdog Millionaire' performance, bringing a sense of stability and trust in his character.A relatively unknown Australian director, Davis does a fine job in finding a comfortable balance between heaviness and warmth, and gives us a film that is touching, but not excessively lachrymose. It is not only a film about searching for our identity and our roots, as it also touches on the theme of cross-country adoption. The cinematography by Greig Fraser ('Rogue One', 'Zero Dark Thirty') is magnificently real, and his most effective shots echo those of a satellite, giving us a bird's eye trace of Saroo's footsteps back home.Lion made me ponder, why is it so important to all of us that we know where we come from? Perhaps the answer is simple. When we are pulled apart from our origins by the vicissitudes of life, we would innately embody a kind of unrelenting determination to learn and connect with those that had an impact on us and made us who we are. To find peace and to know where we are going, we might first need to know where we come from. Saroo's bond with his family, particularly with Guddu and his birth mother was unbreakable. One can only imagine the years of anguish and torment he went through not knowing what happened to his family. Now, he can finally put those questions to rest.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Lion review,"This movie is amazing. I could not find a right words to come about for this movie. It's one of the best movies that i have seen after a long long time. Musical score, Cinematography, Screenplay, Direction, Acting and most importantly the story telling, all come together so beautifully and the representations of the characters and the country through cinematography and direction is just impeccable. I have watched it 30 times (approximately) and yet sobbed each times, and still not tired of this movie. This movie exerts so many feelings and embraces that warmth of motherly essence and family values which i think everyone can relate to. Hope is one of the key points that i extracted from this movie. It also talks about that subject which is practiced but not often talked about such as adoption and also explores beautifully the life and struggle of street kids in India which was very touching and brings all the audience of this movie into a firm ground and takes you along with the movie so beautifully. Acting credits to Dev Patel, Nicole Kidman and most importantly Sunny Pawar. Sunny Pawar is brilliant in this movie. As an audience i was so drawn to his performance. I bought whatever he was trying to convey through this movie that it was brilliant. Even the fact that he was only 6 years old when shooting this film is beyond my imagination.Therefore, i am looking forward to see what Sunny Pawar's next movie called Love Sonia (2017), so finger cross. And also i am looking forward to Garth Davis's and Luke Davis's next venture.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A beautiful movie,The movie takes your attention from the first minute and you are captured in it tp the end. The little boy Saroo is so streetsmart at such a young age. Its a very touching movie first as a mother and then as a human in this cruel world. Sunny Pawar is such a beautiful boy and I hope he will make more movies.,10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"If this was fiction it would be Oscar-bait, but as it's a true story it's simply very moving","Yes it's corny but why wouldn't it be? Such a heartbreaking yet heartwarming story, told tastefully with just the right level of tenderness.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Emotional drama, captivating characters","I had wanted to watch this movie for a while and finally got round to it this week. I was prepared for how emotional it was going to be or at least I thought I was. Get ready with a box of tissues as the story will pull all your heart strings. I loved it! Young Saroo sets the movie off perfectly, his ability is second to none. All this being based on a real life story, it really portrays his story amazingly. I left wandering how I could have cried so much watching a movie, you will understand too once you have.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

This movie is one of those movies that will forever leave a footprint in our hearts/souls. The story that is told in this movie is truly a unique story! I absolutely loved this movie and i bet you will too if you see it :-)",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Loved this film,"I absolutely loved this film.If the story was not true and amazing per se, this film would still be good. But the fact that this is a real person's story really blows my mind. The story made me reflect on the longing we all have for knowing who we are and where our roots are, and also about how we have to integrate the harsh parts of our past into our lives to have healthy adult lives. This story is so moving and so wonderful, that I don't think is possible to hate it.I loved all the actors in the film, some of whom I don't usually like it. I loved Patel's heart-felt performance and he really deserves all the accolades and the Bafta he won; and let me tell you, he is finally playing a man, and really he looks so hot in this film :). Nicole Kidman provides us with a honest mature believable performance; I wouldn't say deserving of an Oscar nomination, but very good nevertheless. Pawar, the child who plays young Suru, is truly amazing; such an small kiddo, and so mature in his acting. Rooney Marah and the other actors were correct in their respective performances as well.This being a real story, I was really pleased to have real footage of the real people behind the story, and some details of what happened to them.The main downside to me is that we get no background story about what happens to Saru's family after he disappears. We are not presented with their despair, heart-break and the actions they took to try to find Saru; of course, we can imagine that, but a bit of details on that front would have rounded up the story and the film.Lion really did it for me.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
This is a beautiful story about a lost little boy in India.,"Absolutely moving. Touches your deepest feelings. There couldn't be a better cast. Everything, from the language and location to the actual footage in the end, make this a masterpiece. Excellent Movie. This extraordinary tale was a good watch!",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Kidnapped children,"Garth Davis managed to make a film that touches a very serious situation existing in the world, especially in India, where annually it is estimated that 80 thousand children are lost or kidnapped by the existing mafias, which aimed at killing these creatures to take their organs or turn them into slaves of wealthy families or for working hard in factories that are not in sight of the population. ""Lion (2016)"" touches the issue of how children are kidnapped, managed and sent to unknown destinations, where prostitutes are painted as false mothers to delinquents who may well sin of pedophiles. The best for these children is to be adopted by decent families although they will never forget where they are coming from and look forward to come back and meet their relatives. The plot of ""Lion"" is very interesting, and let us know the concerns of these children once they become adult, their dreams and sufferings.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Surprisingly brilliant,Lion. A film about an Indian boy who gets lost and ends up being adopted and brought up in Australia and in later life looking for his family. With its PG rating I expected saccharine sickly twee. How wrong I was. Absolutely brilliant. Incredibly moving. Well acted and true story. 9 out of ten,9.0,Anonymous,Biography
As good as cinematography can get,"I am quite baffled by the lukewarm ratings and mixed reviews. This is a deeply moving, immensely satisfactory cinematic experience, based on a true story. This is not a fictional tear-jerker. Some people (mainly critics) felt they were manipulated. This is exactly how it all happened and it has been conveyed beautifully cinematically. I feel that we have come to the point that the pendulum has swung to the direction that any emotional reactions elicited from a film are seen as manipulative. This is easily one of the best films I have ever watched. Its emotions will stay with you after it has ended. Marvelous.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Most emotional movie I have watched till date.,"This movie made me cry 5 times till I stopped watching it i.e. I couldn't watch it till end. Most emotional movie I have ever watched till date, so if you don't like emotional movies then don't go for it otherwise its really a very good movie. Go for it if you are a emotional lover . The movie depicts a real picture of rural India.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great Story,"What a great story. I recommend this film! Heart warming, sad, so much there. Most folks probably soul search at some point. This is the ride of a person going through that. However, the history is such that it is a story we all want to see. Where do I come from? All that. But there is a lot too his story. Really amazing.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Magnificent and reality at it's best,"Being an Indian, I have witnessed the lives of the poor children's who have to spend their life on the streets and i know how hard it is to find a person (without much known details about the person) in my country... But finding one's home and his biological mother by using google maps, residing in Australia and that too with a baggage of limited childhood memories. WOW!.. It was a bit weird for me to believe this story and my biggest doubt was, even if this is a true story, will the actors succeed in passing the emotions to the audience? After watching this film i felt like slapping myself for raising such a doubt on this movie. Each and everyone in this movie, from Dev Patel to Nicole kidman to the young saroo.. Everyone did their roles beautifully and with utmost dedication. If you miss this movie, it will be one of the greatest loss in your life.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Excellent Biographical Film,"I understand that this film took some liberties with the true story it was based on, but it only did so in order to improve the flow of the film and heighten its dramatic impact. Base on what I've read, the actual story is still very intriguing.And the fact that they changed a few details doesn't make the truth any less astounding. The important stuff was left intact. And it really is an amazing story. I don't want to give anything away, but you just can't make this stuff up. The acting and directing are wonderful, even if the story is somewhat predictable. It's not a perfect film, but it is very good. Highly recommend.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
