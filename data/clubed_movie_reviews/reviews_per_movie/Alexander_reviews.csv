Alexander - The Final Cut,"It took Oliver Stone four tries and ten years of edits to get this film right...but he finally does.The Final Cut, released in 2014, shuffles the story elements around so the narrative is fast-paced and cohesive. Alexander's bisexuality is explored much more deeply. Those close to Alexander are further explored.If you're going to watch Alexander, watch The Final Cut. It's far and away the best version.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Alexander Revisited: The Final Cut.,"Alexander is directed by Oliver Stone and Stone co-writes the screenplay with Christopher Kyle and Laeta Kalogridis. It stars Colin Farrell, Val Kilmer, Angelina Jolie, Jared Leto, Anthony Hopkins, Rosario Dawson, Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Christopher Plummer. Music is by Vangelis and cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto.Alexander is an historical epic based on the life of Alexander the Great.
Off the bat I have to say that this ""Final Cut"" version of the film is the only one I have seen. Upon its initial home format release - the first theatrical version - I lasted an hour and 15 minutes before growing restless and sought enjoyment elsewhere. Consequently as a massive fan of historical epics through the years, it has been a constant nagging itch for me to see Alexander in its entirety. So with Oliver Stone tinkering away with versions - convinced he has made a worthwhile epic - I finally delved in.The Final Cut, as far as I'm aware, is a vast improvement on that savagely received theatrical release, well that is said by those who tried again instead of calling quits at the first production. Straight away I could see the difference, where once was a plodding first hour, now sits a vibrancy, with Stone seemingly saying that he can do great action and drama, just please hang around during all the historical chatter, sexual connotation, family strife and conquering machinations, and I will enthral you as a whole.By his own admission, Stone reveals he took on a most complex historical character and in his eyes has made a film to befit such complexity. We get a splintered narrative, as we kick off with the crux of Alexander the Great, the leader, while Alexander's childhood and family forming is interspersed at various junctures. The battles are high in intensity and blood letting - exhilarating at times - but more crucially they let us engage with the tactical ""ahead of their time"" manoeuvres of Alexander the Great. This version mostly flows alright, and I got to feel how Alexander's mind was working in the process, even if come pics closure I didn't fully know the man.Epically cast of course, some of them work, others not so much. Farrell's looked odd, in the way that Pitt's was in Troy (released this same year as Alexander), but apart from the accent issue he grows into the role and is fiercely committed. Jolie is just wrong for the role of domineering Olympias, worse still the scenes she does with Farrell are damp and threaten to derail the drama already built up. This latter point is more annoying given a great thread involving Dawson as Alexander's wife Roxanne is built up superbly, only to not be pulled until some drama very late in the play. The rest of the cast come through as ok for period flavours (expected for Hopkins, Plummer and Meyers, interesting as regards Leto).This is not the life ambition masterpiece Stone wanted to make, even if he proclaims on the extras that he's happy and content with The Final Cut version. This cut still shows some cracks, but these are not seismic enough to hurt the film. For there's a lot of grandeur, blood stirring and thought gone into the production, and there's a lot to be said for that in this day and age of soulless cash making filmic exercises. Honourable failure then? Yes for sure, but a better film in this form than some may have thought possible back in 2004. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Director's Cut: Not as bad as everyone says but certainly flawed across too many aspects,"The story of Alexander the great, the King of Macedonia who sweep across much of the world as it was known at the time. With flashbacks to his relationship with his father King Philip and mother Olympias, we follow Alexander as a boy taught by Aristotle and his rise to power and first conquers all of Persia before moving eastward into deeper Asia as he attempts to reach the Ocean to return to Macedonia. However this road is tough and his men struggle with his methods of ruling his conquered territories and with the seemingly never-ending quest.Despite the fact that this was slated (maybe because it was slated) I decided to give a try for myself. The only option available to me for rental was the slightly shorter Director's Cut, so I took that one and my comments are based around that  how different it is from the original release into cinemas I'm unsure but it was what I had. Taking the eagle of the early scenes as my guide and looking at film from a great height, it is actually not too bad. Cosmetically it all looks good with lots of money spent on the CGI, the battle scenes, the cast, the costumes and so on. However the reality is that every audience must watch this scene by scene and deal with it line by line and it is at this level where the film doesn't really work.To give it its dues though, the overall sweep is good and the battle scenes are impressive even to this post-Lord of the Rings viewer and it is fair to say that the money is right up on there on the screen. Talk about the narrative, the script, the performances, the delivery though and it is a different story. Whether the story is historically accurate or not I cannot say but, like with many of these things, I am happy to take the overall story as reasonably educational while also recognising that much of it will have been either made up for the sake of the telling or simplified for the same reason. The problem for me was not with the accuracy but more with the script. It is written like speeches rather than conversations; nobody seems to talk so much as proclaim. This makes the characters harder to get into and comes over like the writers were forcing themes rather than building them into their characters.I actually liked the flashback structure as it gave us both elements of Alexander building towards the conclusion of the film. That said though, it is a bit laboured at times and not every timeshift works as well as it should have done or contributes as much as I suspect it was supposed to. Stone's direction is impressive in regards the battle scenes but it is as writer and deliverer of the story that he falls down; even his ""cut"" contains structural problems and failings.Without a good script the starry cast mostly struggle. It doesn't help that the themes are mostly handed to the cast in clumps rather than being woven into the dialogue and the characters. Unlike many reviewers I didn't really mind the use of Irish accents; it was a bit funny at first but I got used to the device of the accents representing a certain people. Farrell is left exposed by his director. I do not mean the shot of his balls but more the fact that he seems rudderless in his performance, never being consistent and swinging wildly with each scene. It doesn't help that each line he says is delivered like it is ""the most important thing ever""  with this in mind I didn't care what he looked like, it was more fundamental issues I had with him. Leto, Meyers, Beattie and others provide unremarkable support but the bigger worry is in the A-list names that misfire. Contrary to what some have said, I thought Jolie did a pretty good job with her manipulative character; it is not her fault that she is too young for the role and I'm not entirely sure why she was cast as I can think of a handful of older actresses who could have risen to the role. More disappointing was Dawson who offers little apart from a nude scene (which is an absurdly comic sex scene in itself). Contrary to what my girlfriend might say, I do think Dawson is a good actress and although the male part of me appreciated seeing her naked, I cannot help but wonder why her real talents were wasted in a role that gave her nothing to work with and very little to do anyway. Hopkins is a good narrator and as a device he holds the film together well. Blessed provides a slice of his usual ham then disappears, Plummer likewise while Kilmer does an OK job as the father of the piece.Overall then this is not as terrible a film as the critics would have led you to believe but this is not to be confused with me saying that it is ""good"". The overall sweep of the film is OK while technically it is professional and impressive but the script is poor, the characters delivered on a basic ""and here's the theme for this scene"" level, while the performances are either weak or, at best, well-meaning. Like I say it isn't as totally valueless as some have claimed but what potential there is, is mostly missed.",,Anonymous,Biography
Splendorous Alexander The Great Irishman,"Oliver Stone is Oliver Stone. When you go to see one of his films you know you'll enter unknown territory. I though that was what movies were all about. A personal vision. Not documentaries or Sunday school classes. Richard Attenborough's ""Ghandi"" was that, and as a consequence Oscars, praises, oodles of cash. Ben Kingsley was superb but the title character is treated as if nobody had ever heard of ""Ghandi"" the same can be said of another Attenborough biopic: ""Chaplin"". No, Oliver Stone gives his audience a little bit more credit and, naturally, he is paying the consequences. I think the film is mind blowing. Arbitrary? Yes, beautifully so. Even the accents of the actors is one of the many strokes of genius. Within its historical context those characters spoke with different accents. They were in the ultimate melting pot. Colin Farrell bold portrayal, Irish accent and all is bound to leave its mark. Oliver Stone took every imaginable risk and I for one, applaud him with a loud Long Live the Cinema.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A possible and probable life that Alexander led (Ultimate Cut review),"This film is balancing on a thin line between artistic movie-making or pretentious failure. I watched it only once in its Ultimate Cut entirety and what I've witnessed is a bold epic, but besides that, much more of a character study film. The film has few shots with outdated CGI that are minimal and insignificant in the grand scheme of things. The acting is quite well for what the actors are trying to portray. Everyone's saying Alexander is miscast, laughable, and weak. But that's what this movie's going for; uncovering the man behind the legend. Was that man perfect? Did he appear perfect? None of us are, but he was clever, brave beyond measure, and had the wit for war and diplomatic leadership. His speeches portrayed as motivating and convincing are also at times awkward and frail. The action is sometimes too shaky, but the battles still deliver the intensity and violent nature of death in war. The last battle, although shorter, is a marvel to behold. Full of colors, intricate designs, ferocious imagery, and artistic moments. The music by Vangelis might be his best; it lifts this whole ancient world to life and elevates certain scenes to haunting heights of craftsmanship.Some characters could have been more fleshed out as they have paramount roles. Some of the accents are kind of overdone, but there is a meaning behind some of them. Rosario Dawson and Angelina Jolie are gorgeous and enchanting. Symbolism and the visual language of this film functioned remarkably well. The film's philosophy is very much about genders and sexism, racism and xenophobia, frailty and ego and myths, and their effect on people. A passionate man and a dreamer can only go so far, and that's what brought Alexander's downfall.The film finishes strongly with Anthony Hopkins's narration, where he goes back on his words and scraps them, cementing the element of an unreliable narrator. That being the main point of this film, history and its validity, and how some larger-than-life figures can be very much like us, mere mortals.I didn't even mention the elephant in the room (no pun intended), Alexander's homosexuality, or bisexuality. The film rarely presents it as some big problem or talking point. Kind of like it used to be more acceptable to feel the greatest love for a man. Now, this film is still getting condemned for that. How much more progressed are we today, ay?",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Alexander Revisited - The Final Cut,"Oliver Stone finally got it right. This is the third time I've cued up a version of the Colin Farrell swords and sandals epic. The first two occasions, I fell asleep and/or hit the stop button, which is something I rarely do.The final version is a much, much better version of Alexander than anything that has gone before. Granted, that isn't a huge bar to leap over, but everything was better: pacing especially, and the epic battle scenes felt longer and more bloody. And Farrell's Alexander comes across as being a lot less petulant than before, that attitude being one of the things that irked me about the previous two versions.Oliver Stone, despite a few missteps, is the master of the historical epic. And proves so in this final version of the film. There is some absolutely spectacular filmmaking here: the battle scene where the enemy comes to fight on giant elephants is some of the goriest and most epic combat on film I have ever seen. Incredible stuff!""Alexander Revisited - The Final Cut"" is worth your time.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
You've got to be kidding me...,"I'm giving this film one star for the reason that it has absolutely no excuse whatsoever for its wretchedness. With a cast like it has, a budget ample enough for three good films, and a legend-centered plot sure to pique the viewer's interest well before the movie is even seen, it delivers a seriously despicable, laughable fiasco.Of course it's set in ancient Greece. What's interesting is that Alexander sounds straight out of Dublin. And his mother? Why, it's Angelina Jolie, and she's...straight out of Prince Vlad of Tepes' castle in Transylvania. That's right, Vlad of the Dracul. I suppose miss Jolie spent some time watching Gary Oldman deliver his line, ""Leesten to Dem! Di tcheeldren ov da nyyaat; vhat sveet muzik dai mike..."" or ""Alexander, Oi know vat veemen vi-ll do in yore loif..."" Yes, it is that bad. So far no good.As for Alexander's supposedly legendary tactical genius and indomitable character, here instead the viewer gets to watch the boy from Dublin with painfully obvious bleached streaks in his hair and freshly tinted eyebrows look at Jared Leto countless times with a facial expression that's half ""Mommy can I have another cookie?"" and half irritable bowel syndrome. Leto reciprocates, and captivates movie-goers with a luxurious dark mane of Paul Mitchell's finest work and eyes that make Dakota Fanning look Chinese.Kilmer is wasted here, as is Hopkins. I didn't give a damn about either of their characters. Watch it yourself to see if you do.As a boy I was fascinated by Greek mythology, Greek Tragedy and Comedy. I jump at any chance I can get to tack on extra elements of wonder to my understanding of these subjects. At least I learned something new by watching Alexander. His mother was a vampire wanna-be snake temptress and Alexander's horse had more charisma than he did. Yup, Alexander's horse gets my nomination for best actor.JD",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
"It was ok, could be better","Alexander"" was not bad, earning a 6/10. The acting, particularly from Colin Farrell in the titular role, had its moments but also felt uneven, and the casting choices were a mix of hits and misses. The music and cinematography contributed to the epic scale of the film, while Oliver Stone's directing aimed for grandiosity but occasionally felt overindulgent. The writing attempted to capture the complexity of Alexander the Great's life but struggled with pacing issues and historical accuracy. Its strength lies in its ambitious scope and battle sequences, but it suffered from a lack of focus and a meandering narrative. Overall, 'Alexander' is an uneven historical epic with moments of brilliance but also significant weaknesses.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"How is it possible to take one of history's most interesting figures and a huge budget and make possibly the world's worst movie, ever?","I was saddened when Alexander the movie received criticism for featuring homosexuality. Besides being a neanderthalic prejudice, it distracted from the many valid reasons for criticism. This is a strong contender for worst movie ever made.I will say first that this film has a marvelous cast. But it really doesn't help. Really.It's almost totally ahistorical, but that's standard practice. It's irritating if you know something about Alexander's life and deeds (I studied him college), but the people I feel sorry for are the ones who walk away thinking they've been exposed to an educational experience. There is a small book in explaining how wrong this assumption is. It'd write it, but it would involve watching the movie again. But the rather liberal interpretation of the available information is a side issue in explaining why this is a strong contender for worst movie ever made.The script is dreadful. Mind-bendingly dreadful. It's deficiencies take several forms. I shall enumerate them;1) The dialogue is actually a series of monologues. Every-one is apparently reciting excerpts from their autobiographies, or treatises on whatever is at hand, letters to whomever they are talking to, letters to the editor, political speeches, self-help manuals... It's certainly not conversation.2) It's portentous. I sometimes like portentousness, it can lend atmosphere. Here, it lends to the tedium. The tedium doesn't need adding to, it's already oversubscribed.3) It never knows when to stop. Anthony Hopkins has a monologue at the end that goes on for several minutes. You keep thinking it'll end, hoping, praying it will end (this Anthony Hopkins! He could probably read the ingredients of soap and make it sound interesting), and it does, eventually, but by then you slipped even further into a coma and are in no fit condition to cheer. Colin Farrell seems to spend half the movie looking off into space and holding forth at length on, oh, whatever, but always passionately.4) It's badly written. It's a bad series of portentous monologues that never know when to stop.Aside from the script (perhaps) the film features other flaws that inhibit it from greatness. Such as?Pointless time jumps. I have nothing against time jumps. Highlander, Once upon a time in America, Godfather part two, Once upon a time in the West, For a few dollars more, and probably other films that weren't by Sergio Leone... Many great films feature them. But usually they follow a rationale. Usually they aren't apparently random and unconnected. Here, it's like they put a couple of reels in the wrong order.Sins of omission. While I said that the lack of adherence to historical accuracy was a side issue, not mentioning almost any episode that might actually have been exciting or interesting seems a dubious policy. Alexander, as the posters implied, was the stuff of legend made real. (I make no moral judgement here). Does it mention the phalanx? Any the innovative ways that he overcame apparently unassailable fortresses by looking at the problems from another angle? The political methodology whereby he kept a grip on all of the peoples behind him? The Gordian Knot? Does it hell. It does feature a couple of battle scenes, the second of which is shot in a vivid and pretty colour scheme, and both of which illustrate that he fought at forefront of his army. So that's something.The most laughable sex scene ever committed to film. Alexander wins over his bride by making kitty-cat claws gestures and noises. There's more, but that's definitely the stand-out feature.I could go on, but this film has already eaten enough of my life. The only thing epic here is the ineptitude. It actually made me feel nauseous.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Give THE FINAL CUT a try!,"Oliver Stone's ""Final Cut"" version of his much maligned Alexander the Great biographical motion picture is simply the most monumentally redeeming subsequent edit from a theatrical debacle ever.There's actually four different versions available (theatrical, director's cut, final cut, ultimate cut). The rejiggering I'm most staunchly voutching for is the third version, officially titled in full as ""ALEXANDER REVISITED: THE FINAL CUT"". All the versions are significantly different in narrative context and structural articulation (well the ""Ultimate"" is just a shorter refinement of the ""Final"" I guess). However, at an unabashed 3 hours and 34 minutes, The Final Cut is the most poignantly pregnant - some 40 minutes heavier than the theatrical, even while trimming out some content from that initial release. Ironically, whereas the theatrical felt like a hard long bloated slog, this substantially more voluminous revisitation carries itself with so much more deftly assured confidence of momentive purpose that its approprately earned heartiness gives the sense of no time wasted at all. Actually, dissecting all of the various incarnations of the seemingly same production is a truly fascinating excercise if you're really curious to. Especially because of how flat-out awful the theatrical version was. While the Final Cut version does retain some flaws, it approaches something approximating masterpiece level status in its epic resonance.The things you may have initially hated will all still be present - but this time they're also accounted for!The Final Cut version adds back much essential scenes and nuances, as well as more brutal edits of battle that actually inform the circumstaces and stakes far more effectively. The situational geography and ingenious war tactics are readdressed with much more clarity. And it returns to the original scripted and shot intention for a non linear narrative with scenes jumping from various time periods to contextually strengthen and impact character dynamics and motivations by contrasting juxtaposition. Plus, it may have legendary greek composer Vangelis' most robustly stirring music score!It's a complicated subject, from a sprawling script, and an audaciously daring director - but the 3rd time's the charm. Oliver Stone's true vision of Alexander is well worth reassessment. Trust me.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
how Alexander conquered the known world while facing different phases in his life,"Finally I saw this movie! After all that talking and controversy about it, I became more and more curious about what this talking all about. I must say that I've seen better epic movies ... even Troy was better! However I give this movie a 7 out of 10 ... It's not that bad but it could have been done much better. Firstly: I cannot understand why there was all that talking about Alexander's sexuality and the 'gay scenes' that there were supposed to be. There wasn't a big deal really! It's true that there is a lot of flirting between guys but only one kiss was seen in the movie that of Alexander (Farrell) kissing a young male dancer. The sex scene with Alexander's wife was by far more explicit when compared. I think and agree that the movie is historically accurate and that Alexander was bisexual. Sexuality was not an issue at those days so men were more free to do whatever they wanted to. Homosexuality was not a taboo!!! I admire Farrell for taking such roles ... it wasn't the first time that we saw him as a bisexual (A home a the end of the world). He is known to be some kind of a playboy so pretending to be the opposite in movies might be hard and it shows good acting. Acting means showing feelings that you don't really feel, and I think that Farrell and Leto did a great job. The acting of all of them was convincing enough and I think we had some of the greatest performances when compared with their past roles. Jolie was sexy (as always) and she really delivered. Her acting was great as did Hopkins and Kilmer. But flaws are not missing in this movie! Too different accents, Jolie is almost as old as Farrell and she played his mother, Farrell's hair, Leto's excessive make-up (too much eye liner)!!! The fight scenes were great but at first I couldn't understand who was killing who and who was winning ... it wasn't clear at all ... there was so much confusion! And the last thing ... I didn't really fell in love with the characters as we all did in Gladiator! This movie is kind of 'dry' in some aspects. I'm sure it could have been a masterpiece but it has certain things that are really missing. The movie starts with old Ptolomy (Hopkins) narrating the events of Alexander. At first we see the warrior as a young boy which became an obsession to a mother who is a snake fanatic (Jolie), who was also a crazy and cunning woman who desperately wanted her son to become a powerful king, than we meet the king (Kilmer) who was a beast and a drunk who slept with God knows how many women, there was nothing human in him. The movie than focuses on the different relationships of Alexander with his mother, the king, his best friend and lover (Leto), his soldiers when he becomes king after the murder of king philip. We see an Alexander who faces war and its bloody side, the glory of conquering the known world, marriage with a woman he doesn't really love (his true and only love was Hephaistion (Leto)) and betrayal.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
I didn't know the Greeks were all Irish,"After reading the comments on here, I have to say that I am stunned that anybody liked this film at all. I don't lightly say that I rank this as the worst non-B grade movie I've ever seen--ever. To begin with, all of the ""Greeks"" in this movie have Irish accents. Well, most of them, that is. Inexplicably, Angelina Jolie has a middle-eastern-meets-Russian kind of accent, and some have no accent at all. This hodge-podge of ridiculously out of place accents was so distracting that it was hard to stay focused on the movie. I laughed out loud when one of the soldiers actually said ""aye"" when confronting Alexander--I almost expected him to follow up by asking for ""me Lucky Charms"". I kept wondering how it was even possible that nobody in the production chain ever caught this absurdity and put a stop to it.Beyond that glaring issue, the movie was bombastic and melodramatic to the extreme, it was too long, and the battle scenes were incomprehensible. I almost turned it off about 10 times, but I kept thinking there was no way it could get any worse. It did. Horrible. Oh, and did I mention the accents?",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
My take on this,"At first, I didn't feel much of a need to comment on the film, since so many others have written and have said so many things. But I think there are some really important points to made, and I haven't seen anyone make them. So here I am writing.In my opinion, almost everyone misunderstood the relationship between Hephaistion and Alexander. In the modern world, especially in the West, two men are either very close to each other, sleep together, and have sex, or they keep a good comfortable distance from each other and, if they're friendly, might punch each other on the arm. In this film, we see a relationship that is hard for most people today to understand, namely a passionate love relationship between two men in which sex is not very important and possibly even absent.Aristotle essentially explained the whole film near the beginning when he told the young couple something like the following, as best I can remember it, ""When two men lie together in lust, it is over indulgence. But when two men lie together in purity, they can perform wonders."" Or something like that. Given what I know of that culture, I am sure that ""in purity"" means no sex, or at least very little. That's why we never see them kiss. In the film, as in many older films, kissing is a metaphor for sex. Even when Alexander kisses his mother, it refers to the idea of sex. That's why Alexander kisses Bagoas, but not Hephaistion.Now I'm not sure if the real historical Aristotle would have made that remark. That's not exactly what he says about homosexuality in the Nicomachean Ethics. But the remark is plausible enough since Alexander could easily have heard such an idea during his youth. Plato (before Aristotle) expressed that idea, and Zeno of Citium (after Aristotle) did too. So even if Aristotle never said this to Alexander, it is plausible enough that the idea was in the air and that Alexander heard it from someone or other.Some have complained that the ""homosexuality"" (assuming that A's relationship with Heph. should even be called that) was thrown in their faces too much. But it's crucial to the plot. Stone is hypothesizing that Hephaistion was essential for what Alexander did. Further, it's a standard Hollywood convention to juxtapose a love story with some great political, military, or otherwise grand event. There are tons of examples. Titanic, Enemy at the Gates, Gone with the Wind, ... the list could go on forever. It really is homophobic to complain about Stone continually going back to this theme, because he has a perfectly good artistic reason to do it.A few more details: Alexander's hair. I think that Stone was trying to make Alexander look like Martin Potter in Satyricon -- a nod to Fellini.Alexander's accent and soft appearance. Another nod to a great director passed on, this time Stanley Kubrick. Farrel really looks a lot like Ryan O'Neil in Barry Lyndon. In fact, he really looks like a Ryan O'Neill / Martin Potter coalescence. I think it's deliberate.The softness of Alexander's personality. In a lot of scenes it made sense. He was gentle enough to know how to approach Bucephalus and tame him without scaring him. He was open minded enough to adopt a lot of Persian culture and encourage intermarriage, while the other more ""he-man"" folks around him were less comfortable with the idea.Yes, if you haven't figured it out by now, I do like the film. People's hatred of the film is hard for me to understand.",,Anonymous,Biography
Historical and breathtaking epic movie but overlong and a little bit boring,"Historic , big-budgeted , mammoth rendition and enormous epic movie with stunningly staged battle scenes, but overlong , as it lasts too much , around three hours , and a little boring pacing ; this one being professionally directed by Oliver Stone (2003) .

great synopsis of a part of our history,"I thought Alexander was a great movie, a little long, but it was tolerable. It was nice to finally see a movie that explained a true part of history. I encourage everyone to see the movie for themselves, especially if they are into history or enjoy war movies. Angelina Jolie starred once again and gave a outstanding portrayal of Alexander's mother. Like all Oliver Stone movies, Alexander was long, but it was definitely worth seeing. Many people in theater I was at clapped at the end. Colin Farrell really impressed me with his portrayal of Alexander, especially because it was such a different and unique role for him. Jared Leto also did a nice job, I think the entire cast worked well together.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
many people liked it many people hated it,"well, i just saw this movie and i can honestly say that even though the script was disappointing, many actors excelled in the movie. Anthony hopkins being the narrator gives you a sense of presence and understanding the movie better for younger viewers. Angelina Jolie ( which i never respected as a good actor) really blew my mind on this movie. Colin Farrel, another chick magnet like brad pitt in troy which bring money to the box office did a great job in this movie and i was simply impressed. Oliver Stone gave the chance to new actors, and others which weren't known much; just like Peter Jackson did in the ""Lord of the Rings Trilogy"". All the characters are developed well and they all have different personalities, which brings a good variety. I was impressed even more by Clitus and craterus.I know its history, but i think that Ptolemy wasn't the guy for the job. Val Kilmer which i thought was a 'has been' by now came back in Alexander and also did a good job. Many metaphorical moments in the movie with some flashbacks like the ones used in Hero.It could had been a great movie , and Oscar sweeper, But the script needed a much better effort than the one that was given.It had great potential, great actors, great director but a bad script. Not many people want to watch a 3 hour long movie with a bad script, thats why i conclude that it was all a 50/50 between people who liked it and people who didn't like it. Colin Farrel should be nominated at least for his effort for the Oscars, also Angelina Jolie should deserve a Oscar for her performance in the movie, though i think meryl streep from 'the manchurian candidate' will win it. I give it a 7/10 instead of 5 because the battles, the effects and the character development and performance were mind blowing. 7/10 it is.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
What Was Mr. Stone THINKING?,"Alexander is essentially about this Russian sounding babe (played by Ms. Jolie) who marries into this big Oirish family, is driven to preferring snakes because her husband only has one eye, and begins dying her little boy's hair blonde. Then it all kicks off, Colin Farrell gets his eyebrows bleached and goes off in a flouncy tantrum to conquer the world. Meanwhile Jared Leto stands around with a twisty Cher hairdo, gazing longingly at bottle-blondie Colin, who every now and then gazes back with tears in his eyes and whispers 'Oy cahnt live if livin' is without you...' So anyway, about half way through that really handsome guy from The Book Group (the one in the wheelchair) and those porridge commercials shows up, but he has a different hairdresser... he stands around a lot, proving that sensible haircuts WERE possible in ancient times. I think he loses his razor at one point, but finds it again eventually... later Tim Piggott-Smith has to smush his hands around inside a dead animal, but they cut all his lines, so of course it all makes PERFECT sense.Then the elephants come...",1.0,Anonymous,Biography

The Problem with Alexander,"The historical epic is trying to make a comeback, and failing horribly. Just as Emmerich failed with the enduring legend of Achilles and the Trojan war, Stone fails miserably with Alexander.In the 60s, in the era of Spartacus and Lawrence of Arabia, audiences knew what they wanted and expected from a historical film--good history, a sympathetic hero (and hopefully heroine), lots of action. In many ways, our expectations have become much more sophisticated. We want convincing costumes and sets, special effects that make the action absolutely believable, and acting and dialog that allows us to get inside the characters' heads.I submit that Alexander and Troy bombed because the directors threw buckets of effects and money onto stories that they didn't understand themselves--they used overwhelmingly broad strokes and declamatory speeches when nuances and realism would do much more.We never understand the title character in Alexander. He's driven to conquer the world, but why? What's going on inside his head? Millions of dollars were spent on battle scenes, but almost nothing on a realistic portrayal of the man, his family, or friends. Olympia and Bagoas are not remotely believable in their femme fatale roles. Olympia, in particular, is nothing more than a caricature--she is never seen without at least one snake being present--is that subtle or what?Stone obviously doesn't understand Alexander, and so portrays him as an enigma. But as an enigma film, it fails as well! Rent ""Donnie Darko"" or ""Mulholland Drive"" instead",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
Out of the mindless masses.,"The audience is not being able to understand the difference between  ancient and modern morals, but to be honest I don't care about the  wider audience. Why should Oliver have to sugarcoat and alter his work  simply because the 'MTV generation' and mass TV watchers of the United  States don't know their history? I say he shouldn't. Their ignorance is  *their* problem, not Oliver's.  In a long shot, Oliver Stone chose to create a historically accurate  film around the life of a man, both fact and fiction, who created the  gateway for humanity's future path. Many will not appreciate this film,  because their minds are too stuffed with current calamity to realize  where their freedoms and dreams of equality originated from.   This is a brilliant film, which was portrayed correctly, from a  personable point of view, to create the character of Alexander in the  manner in which he lived; uninhibited by other influences save those  whom he loved and knew were trustworthy. This movie is about the  origins not only of the Western mind and intellect, but also plan  larger into the scheme of the man who saw and dreamt of the future- a  world which accepted each other and lived together in diversity in  harmony. This man was Alexander-- our Western father.   Like it, hate it; it doesn't really matter. The fact is, Oliver Stone  brought to his team of experts internationally respected historians to  make this film as accurate historically as possible. This should not go  without notice. Colin Farrell, a known Irish- now Hollywood loverboy,  does indeed display the heart and integrity of a natural born leader.  He has lead this cast in an epic performance, well past his personal  years and experience. He is worthy of praise in his portrayal of  Alexander.   The movie is fantastic;  Well done, Olivier, Colin, etc... Well done.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Alexander  an Instant Camp Classic,"Oliver Stone has imagined a vigorous, opulent homage to the Sword and Sandal genre, and like the best of those films of a generation ago, sheer visual style, over-the-top acting, and showmanship win the day. The best of those films-Lawrence of Arabia, Ben-Hur and Spartacus-also had brilliant scripts, pitting their protagonists in the center of conflicts where superhuman will and wit overcome immense odds. But as history's first and most insatiable conqueror, Alexander seems unchallenged. Mighty ancient cities fall beneath his sword like so much marshmallow, and his one true enemy-Darius, King of Persia-has no words in Stone's film at all!-he's just a face. Thus, without a central conflict to dramatize, Stone's film lowers itself to the Sword and Sandal genre's middle road, where writing takes a back seat, and characters make portentous pronouncements before going off to fulfill their destinies. Angelina Jolie, as Olympias, Alexander's mother, comes off best and worst in Stone's decadent stew. Her unnatural devotion to Alexander seems to inspire the 'You-Must-Conquer-the-Known World' flame, but she's quickly side-lined by the script and is left screaming in the wilderness, having no real effect on the ensuing action. But she looks magnificent, and her face at the moment of Philip of Macedonia's death, is alone worth the price admission. Her Transylvanian accent, however, is a distraction, as are the Irish, English and Scottish dialects of other actors. Stone's script also avoids Alexander's more elaborate military strategies-studied and duplicated for thousands of years-and makes short shrift of the ongoing power struggles he had with his generals. Colin Farrell, as Alexander, works hard and holds the screen for 3 hours with a strange mix of petulance, arrogance and good old fashioned Hollywood charm. He and Jared Leto, as Hephaistion, have a long and tender love scene (fully-clothed) on a Babylonian balcony, looking down on what has to be the most opulent scenery ever devised for a feature film. This is a clear, if telescopic homage to D.W. Griffith's 1916 Masterpiece, 'Intolerance.' All in all, Stone's Alexander is never boring, never brilliant, but always visually exciting. Probably the most gorgeous film made in years. Terrific showmanship. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Watch Michael Wood's series instead.,"You'd have thought given the amount of ancient source material which is still extant, dodgy or not, on Alexander's life that Stone could have cobbled together a story from the various accounts without resorting to simply making bits up (i.e Alexander being shot in battle with Porus), pointlessly attributing speeches from one character to another (i.e Darius's daughter giving a reply to Alexander which is actually that of Porus), having set designs which were simply ludicrous (i.e Olympias having the Ram on a tree thingy from Ur in her room)...I could go on, and on, and on...This film was simply awful on every level, the battle of Gaugamela just looked like a complete shambles, why did the Macedonians (Including non-Irish actors) put on Irish accents? A misguided attempt to mask the misguided casting of Farrell? Who was himself hammier than a pig farm but given that the script often stank more than the latter I loathe to blame him entirely.Avoid this film at all cost, especially if you have any education in the Classics, it's not even worth putting yourself through it for a laugh.Oh yeah and it was the 'directors cut' I just watched, have never seen the original release and if this was an improvement God help those of you poor souls who saw it at the cinema.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Alexander,"With such an epic story, you would think someone like Stone would produce an epic film. From the random accents of the characters (specifically, I have no idea what Jolie was trying to do), to some pretty atrocious acting from Farrell-he's capable of much better, but this was at the height of his grandiosity and ego. There are so many moments where it feels like the film is onto something, only to have it stop and spin off into another, pointless direction. Bottom line: a $155 mil film about Alexander the Great should have been iconic, but Alexander falls flat on its face from the weight of the egos involved.",,Anonymous,Biography
A reason why this film is important.,"Apart from it's historical quality, films like this are important because they tell us something about our time.

This righteous religious brainwashing has people actually thinking they're being right & good, it's the type of crap that's going to end this planet.This was set over 2 millenia ago and it begs the question 'Have we really progressed?'...

An Epic Hubris,"Viewers who expect an epic display of world conquest will be extremely disappointed in Oliver Stone's Alexander, which includes exactly two fairly brief battle sequences in its three hour running time. The film is not about conquest; it is an attempt to create a character study of one of history's most self-contradictory and enigmatic figures.The emphasis, however, should be on the word ""attempt."" Alexander fails in three basic ways: in its cast, in its refusal to meet certain character issues head-on, and in a directorial decision that easily ranks among the most serious misfires in recent memory.Alexander the Great was a charismatic, self-contradictory, and enigmatic leader who led and inspired the largest army the world had seen up to that point. He was a battle-tested killing machine by age sixteen, King of Macedonia by twenty, conqueror of the known world by thirtyand above all one of the great military geniuses of his or any other age. Colin Farrell plays the character as a weak-minded, emotionally distraught entity, going through the entire film with a series of facial expressions that would lead to believe he is desperate need of a dose of salts. It is completely impossible to accept him in the role.Although Val Kilmer and Angelina Jolie give acceptable if not particularly memorable performances as King Philip and Queen Olympias, the remaining performances are equally impossible. Jared Leto's Hephaistion looks for all the world like a Malibu hooker afflicted by an eyeliner addiction; it is impossible to perceive him as Alexander's military whip. Franciso Bosch's Bagoas could be an ancient-world version of Cher after a particularly thick night, albeit with better cleavage. As for Queen Roxane, history notes that she was an unattractive minor tribal princess that Alexander found annoying but whom he married in order to secure military aid from her father. The role, however, is considerably revised, and while Rosario Dawson gives it all she has the part plays like something out of bondage skin flick.During the film's theatrical release some audiences complained that Alexander was portrayed as a homosexual. Unfortunately, you cannot offer a psychological portrait of Alexander without indicating his general indifference to women and putting him in bed with at least two men: the general Hepaistion and the eunuch and sex slave Bagoas. That is who Alexander was; that was what the ancient world was like. But instead of meeting this issue head-on, the film attempts to ""indicate"" the relationships through a series of longing gazes, the occasional caress, and some of the most embarrassingly bad dialogue ever written for the screen. The resulting relationships read like something off a television soap opera that has been canceled halfway into the first season.For the sexually insecure, there is a DVD issue that deletes some eight minutes of this footage; although I went with the unedited version, and although the scenes in question are very badly done, I cannot imagine the deletion of these largely cringe-inducing scenes improves the film to any significant degreelargely because virtually everything about the film is no less awkward.The script is at best mediocre and the story line so incoherent that Anthony Hopkins is required to provide constant narrationsomething that has the effect of telling us what happened rather than allowing us to see it happen. But by far the greatest failing of the script and story line is Oliver Stone's decision to present a chunk of the story, such as it is, out of sequence.In essence, the first half hour of the film establishes the tri-fold conflict between King Philip, Queen Olympias, and the young Alexander and runs up to a major confrontation. At this point the film suddenly jumps eight years ahead to the invasion of Persia, and the jump does not read as intentional but as an outrageous, unexpected, and disastrous flaw in the film. Approximately two hours later the film presents this ""lost time"" in the form of a flashbackbut by this point of the scenes have been lost and we've all figured out the details anyway. Oliver Stone is a master of creating parallel story lines and time lines. One need look no further than JFK to see his skill. It is astonishing, utterly astonishing, that he could do no better than this and, not being able to do better, did not find a better way entirely.When all is said and done, Alexander is presented as an out-of-control weakling, his psychological motivations are hilariously pat at best, and it is utterly impossible to imagine that this person could command such a large force, much less lead it to a single victory, much less conquer the known world. Clearly Stone was attempting to reach a new height in epic cinema, but the Greeks had a word for ill-advised ambition founded on a god-like arrogance: hubris. It was a sin they believed was never left unpunished, and in this instance the punishment is a career-crippling, if not entirely career-killing, film.As noted, there are several DVD versions, including a director's cut that removes approximately fifteen minutes, eight of them dealing with Alexander's sexuality. Bonuses include documentaries on the making of the film and on composer Vangelis, who scored it, as well as an amazingly beside-the-point commentary by director Stone and historian Robin Lane Fox.Gary F.

Forgive the flaws and enjoy the grandeur of this mammoth film,"This film narrates the story of one of history's great military figures, Alexander of the Greek, Egyptian and Babylonian empires. In brief, Alexander was conquering Eastern Europe, Central Asia and the Middle East a few hundred years B.C. He died very young and by the time he passed away he had amassed a huge empire, a pretty incredible achievement made even more so by the fact it was done in such a short space of time.The film is largely a telling of this history, albeit with some creative license here and there according to other commentators who have researched the facts a bit. The story is told to us as a retrospective in the third person, through the eyes of one of Alexander's Generals who outlives him. This format allows the story to jump around chronologically, so that we go back and forth to different periods of Alexander's life and slowly stitch together the bigger picture of the character, his motivations and his achievements.This format requires the viewer to concentrate a bit harder to follow the story than would be needed if the story is told purely chronologically. But it also gives the film an extra dimension, allowing the viewer to discover more about the central character's motivations as the film evolves rather than laying them all out at the start.This is a grand film, hugely ambitious in scope, and best viewed in the full 3.5 hour Director cut to fully appreciate the film's scale. The sets are magnificent, lush, visually sumptuous, as are the costumes and the CGI is thankfully quite limited. The battle scenes are chaotic. The dialogue is rich, especially in the scenes with the Generals debating their expedition - almost like a fly on the wall peering over a military soap opera. The cinematography is at times really stunning and the acting is on the whole not bad at all, with decent turns from Val Kilmer and Anthony Hopkins amongst others.Overall, rather like Alexander himself, I think this film tries to reach too far. It is too ambitious and it's attempt at scale and grandeur doesn't quite succeed, giving the film a bit of a sprawling and incoherent feel. But the effort is truly admirable and for pure visual pleasure it is certainly worth a watch, and maybe even a re-appraisal.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Queen Who Wanted To Be King,"As Anthony Hopkins in a very prophetic bit of writing tells us ""His failures tower over others successes"" I believe that's also true for Oliver Stone you may like him, or not, agree or disagree with him but you can never dismiss him. He goes for it, he takes amazing chances. Naturally, the risks are enormous. Alexander is a misfire from almost every angle. Maybe the most important aspect that in Colin Farrell's portrayal there isn't a hint of greatness. If this was really Alexander he wouldn't have made it into the history books as ""The Great"" but as ""The Queen who wanted to be King"". With this I'm not attacking the gay portrayal. That was a fact, present in every serious biography of the man. I remember the Robert Rossen version of the story, with a moody Richard Burton as Alexander and a great Danielle Darrieux as his mother. The problem there was quite different. We had hints of what made Alexander great but the film was a plodding, solemn, unexciting little epic. Maybe this is one of those subjects that mere mortals shouldn't attempt. Not even Oliver The Great.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
"It was real, read it from the books...","SPOILERS? It's history, it was real, read it from the books...Society changes over time. What once was good, might be bad in the future; people always change their minds, about how the world should be. Homosexuality for example. Ancient male greeks used to ponder it, not everyone was gay; in fact they were bisexual (They had wives and children)but what was really appreciated was a long enduring relationship with a man. I have nothing against bisexual, homosexual or lesbian people; it's a subjective matter, and you can't judge a think like that because it depends of the person. In Alexander homos are everywhere, but I think is an overexploited subject that makes the movie a shallow pseudo-biography of one of the greatest generals ever alive. His grand achievement was to conquer almost all the world, not having sex with very thing that he encounter on his way. He fought magnificent battles with a superb ability to make intelligent moves on the battlefield. However tough it was disgusting whenever stone placed for a long time gay scenes(the persian he found was just TOO much)I don't hate gay people (I'm a fan of Judas Priest and Rob Halford, a confessed gay, is to me the best singer on earth; I think he is cool), I hate watching gay innuendos and kisses between men. Probably Stone tried to be polemic, but with a pointless thing. Focusing a biography in parts that could have also been included in a Truman Capote biography make out of Alexander a mediocre film. The man RULE the world, I mean place what actually cares. Battles were fine but the part that really caught me was at the near end, when Ptolemy (well played by Hopkins) regretted his last comment when teaching to his students; he lamented that they (Alex's generals) lack the vision Alexander had, as if he was telling us that short vision men ended a great man's desire, a man who care for something else than just a home with a family, mortal men desires: A man willing to be something else than the rest, a man who wanted to become immortal by becoming a god.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Ouch,"OK, let's stop beating around the bush. This is just a dog. The worst is undoubtedly the dialogue - unspeakable lines full of kitsch and pomposity in a style that Hollywood thankfully left behind somewhere in the 1940's. The other thing that sinks the movie is the pacing that is totally off. Every time the momentum picks up a little and we finally get into it a bit, we are suddenly thrown back into yet another agonizing scene between Alexander and his mother, or his father, that stops the film dead in its tracks because of the ridiculous dialogue and over-the-top acting.Not to mention the weird accents, Colin Farrell who is wholly miscast because he doesn't have the charisma of a world-class leader (nor the voice - in his pre-battle pep talk speeches he squeaks like a mouse on speed), the wishy-washy approach to his bisexuality (if you want to make the point, then just make it, for Pete's sake), the flat characters of his friends and generals that one cannot tell apart, Val Kilmer chewing up the scenery, and the rather poor aerial shots of the big battle.

"Hard to digest for hoi polloi, but true to history and Greek epic and tragedy","Oliver Stone consulted Robin Lane Foxe, Oxford historian and the premier Alexander expert, before making this film. It shows. The film certainly ranks as one of the closest-to-the-real-story Hollywood historical mega-films. To viewers with any background in Aristotelian drama and the Greek epic, it will immediately become clear that Stone has tried hard to emulate the epic form while integrating the culture of the Greek tragedy into his film. There is plenty of fear and pity here and there are plenty of tragic elements. The aging Ptolemy as narrator even takes on some of the functions of the chorus/choir. Tragic destiny in a larger-than-life man plagued by doubts over his own decisions, his consuming passions, is the universal here; the gripping story of Alexander the historical incidental, as it were. Not surprisingly, characterization and character interaction must loom large. Which explains the numerous and lengthy monologues and dialogues. Bravo, Mr Stone. Those who can appreciate will. But I fear that hoi polloi will not appreciate. They will simply fail to understand. Postscript: If there were any episodes in Alexander's life I missed and would have liked included (at the risk of making this film even longer) it would have been the Gordian Knot and the Oasis of Siwa.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Unfairly maligned, likable historical epic","Although I'd never seen it before, I knew that Alexander was a troubled film. The sheer number of different edits and versions available on DVD is testament to that – none of them successfully capture the 'spark' that would make the film a crowd-pleaser in the same way that TROY enthralled the masses. Despite the problems – and there are a fair few of them, not least the long-winded nature of the narrative (Hopkins' character is laboured and dull) and the slow moving and extraneous scenes – this is still a film I enjoyed. It's a pretty good retelling of the ancient story, employing a large cast, most of whom get the chance to shine on more than one occasion, and the spectacle is suitably impressive.Colin Farrell is something of an obscure choice as the Macedonian hero, but I was surprised to find he actually fits the part very well. He brings a high level of humanity to the part, making us focus on his character's warmth and integrity. Angelina Jolie is cast as his mother, even though she's only a year or so older than him in real life; this matters not. She, too, is effective as a sinister witch-type character whose overriding love for her son also makes her sympathetic to the viewer. Val Kilmer has fun as Alexander's one-eyed tyrant of a father, Philip.There's plenty of globe-trotting going on along here, along with debates, arguments, and cold-blooded murder. There are only one or two battle sequences, but they're big in scale and rather effective. By far the best is the fight in the jungles of India, in which Alexander and his men find themselves up against an army mounted on hulking elephants. Stone directs this part very well, soaking the screen in a blood-red canvas to ably evoke the chaotic events unfolding in front of us. It's gruesome, brutal, moving and disturbing, all as warfare should be, and in fact one of the best battle sequences I've witnessed in a film yet. It's a shame the whole of the film couldn't follow the same standard. Still, it tells an engaging story and, while it might vary in terms of effectiveness, believability and scope, as a whole I liked it, if not overly so.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Worst movie I have ever seen,"First of all, if anyone says this movie is historically accurate, please go back and read the surviving texts of Alexander's life. It is horribly inaccurate, which is bad enough, but to be completely expected for a movie based on any historical subject.In terms of film-making, it rates as low as historical accuracy. The acting is completely hammed up, I don't understand how Colin Farrell continues to get leading roles, he is a horrible actor. The sheer amounts of accents all over the place is annoying and distracting. Phillip and Alexander sound Irish, you have Scottish accents, and then you have Olympia, played by Angelina Jolie, who's insane accent I can't even place. The only real good acting came from Christopher Plummer and Anthony Hopkins.In terms of direction, the overuse of the eagle flying in and out of the sun became to distracting and was so glaringly obvious. Oliver Stone appears to exert no effort in making a good film. I remember hearing how he blamed the ""sexuality"" of his film for bad reviews, no I think it's the bad acting, the horrible writing, and the pointless direction.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
I Loved This Film,"Saw Alexander last night and loved it. Would I recommend it? Yes-BUT-be forewarned, this is not your classic historical epic so leave behind all ideas of what an historic epic film should be and bring along an open the mind for a wonderful ride. After all, one doesn't expect Ben-Hur or The Robe or The Ten Commandments from Oliver Stone. He uses jumpy camera shots and grainy filters as well as wonderful color filters that give the battle scenes a viscerally disturbing edge, taking the viewer out of their complacent acceptance of 21st century, violent battle scenes and making them squirm. I felt the desiccating heat at Gaugamel as well as the cloying humidity of the Indian forests. The grandeur of the CGI presentation of Babylon was awe inspiring as was the set for the Library at Alexandria.The subtle presentation of the film in Greek Tragedy format worked well for me, from Pharoah Ptolomy representing the chorus through the Oedipal angst of Alexander's love/hate relationship with his parents. The costuming was perfection, as was the architecture. Not once was I jolted by an incorrect piece of art, jewelry, fabric or weapon. The use of a Gypsy Horse (or Irish Cob) for Bucephalus was a striking choice. They are a majestic breed and, although I am under-educated as to what his actual breed was, he was well cast.Before seeing the film I was only aware of Messers Stone and Farrell and Ms. Jolie's involvement so I was pleasantly surprised by the appearance of Brian Blessed as the wrestling master and Jonathan Rhys Meyers as Cassander, and I was thrilled by the Vangelis score! I have not heard a Vangelis score since The Bounty.As for the representation of love between Alexander and Hephaestion, my hat is off to Oliver Stone for his presentation of a love that transcended gender and was as true as that Paris held for Helen. Unlike the recent film of Troy, in which the lovers Achilles and Patroclus were made into platonic cousins, Oliver Stone has courageously represented an historic love to a culture wherein the attitude towards male/male pairings have become anethema. That the Great General Alexander had a male life companion is a simple fact of history as we know it. In my years at school it was not presented as either laudable or offensive, it was simply a researched fact. History as we know it tells us that the Greece of Alexander's time looked upon such pairings as Alexander's and Hephaestion's as something acceptable as long as they grew in knowledge and virtue. Christopher Plummer's Aristotle sums this up in one simple speech near the beginning of the film and, by taking Ganymede to his side, the greatest of all Greek Gods, Zeus, sanctioned such pairings. Like it as not, right or wrong, the *gender issue* and *gay issue* are a none other than a matter of popular opinion, and popular opinion at the time of Alexander was that men lay down with men as well as women. It simply was, and that is how Oliver Stone handled it-simply-without defense or apology and that took guts.Even without the *controversial* relationship between Alexander and Hephaestion, this would have been a 9.5 out of 10 for me.",,Anonymous,Biography
Best of the greatest Generals of all time (Kidding),"I met Oliver Stone while sitting at one of my regular coffee haunts in southern California, when he asked about what I was reading. I said it was my favorite biography on Alexander and that it was for the the 6th or 7th time, that it was the only one I know of written by a woman, and it was by far the best one. I told him I had read 5 including 2 from the ancient sources, and I do not read biographies. That Alexander had been my only exception. While we were talking, it seemed that he looked vaguely familiar, but I didn't know who he was until hearing months later that someone was making a movie about Alexander.When I found out that it was Oliver Stone doing the picture, I just shook my head and smiled. We had been the only 2 people on the small patio of this downtown coffee house. Years later when I discovered he had donated 100k to the foundation (?) of this long dead Oxford graduate lesbian who lived in South Africa, whose writing seems to be generally disliked by classicists and scholars everywhere - I was certain it was him. At one point while asking me about the book, I told him no one had the balls to make a movie about Alexander. Not a real one. He must have taken it as a challenge. But then if you know his movies, someone like him would.I don't have time to go into all the error, misunderstanding and lack of well known and widely available historical knowledge by so many, of the same sex relations during the entire span of ancient Greek might. From Homer to the Spartan hegemony to 5th century Athens to the Empire of Alexander, almost everybody did it, they were all married - and nobody was gay. Such terms, the idea and attitude they convey, as well as modern societal norms did not exist in that society or at that time. It is a historical non sequitur to apply what we know and how we live to what they knew and how they lived. And that's coming from a Preacher, who believes every word of the Bible. I just happen to like Alexander, and have studied him for almost 20 years now.This film is highly accurate and well worth watching. But if you're not interested in Alexander - you won't be in the film. It's about one of the most influential men in history, but it is about a man. It's a great war flick also, but the action is incidental to the man. Not the other way around. With the exception of one movie with Richard Burton from at least 50 years ago, there are no other films about Alexander. It has a great cast with all giving strong performances, and Colin Farrell was perfect as Alexander.We're talking about a guy who named one town after his horse and another after his dog. Who gave lavishly to everybody, inspired lifelong loyalty and rewarded it. Who knew thousands of his men by their first names and had personally saved many of their lives as well as payed off many of their debts - with his own money. He restored many conquered rulers to their former place (under him of course), and tolerated to live many who he knew hated him and wanted him dead - both in Athens and in his own camp - when he could have easily had them killed and nobody would have said anything, but he did not. Arrian says of Alexander that unlike other Kings, he repented when he knew he had done wrong. Knowing all that will help you know the man a little, and I think help you enjoy the film more.I have read a fair amount by men who seemed to me jealous of him, and others who made the aforementioned non sequitur of judging him by the standards of their day instead of those of his own. It's also worth remembering that one of his boyhood friends and most trusted generals, Ptolemy, was the man responsible for the Hebrew Bible being translated into Greek - giving us the Septuagint. His son ( Ptolemy Philadelphus) finished the project. Giving us the very foundation for the Bible we have today.When Alexander became King of Macedon at a little past 20 years old, all that he had inherited from his father were a few gold and silver cups, less than 60 talents in the treasury and debts of 500 that he owed. Upon borrowing 800 more, he gave away everything he had to friends and loyal supporters, some would take nothing from him. The man who would become his second in command, Perdiccas, asked him""What are you keeping for yourself ?"" ""Hope,"" said Alexander, to which Perdiccas replied ""That I'll share.""",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
How did so many talents with such a story produce such banality?,"It took me two nights (2½ hours total) to watch this - as I couldn't stay awake the first night. The story of Alexander is fascinating, but you wouldn't know it from watching this movie. (Michael Wood's excellent TV series/DVD/book ""In the Footsteps of Alexander The Great"" is a much better use of your time, and much more engaging.)The Irish accents are invasive, and in the case of some (e.g. Val Kilmer) truly risible. (And the Russian accents? Come on!) Colin Farrell is utterly implausible - I wouldn't follow him to the bottom of my garden, and that's not very far. My wife thinks he looked like a porn star. (It would have been a very low budget porn film to use such poor wigs...)The film's historical accuracy is better than Stone's version of the Kennedy story, but it completely misses in its attempt to capture the true sense of scale and ambition in Alexander's quests. It similarly fails to adequately address the source of that ambition.In summary, this film utilises the talents of a dozen or so stars (and Colin Farrell), millions of dollars of very obvious production costs and is based on one of the most epic stories of individual ambition in the history of the world. And the result? An overlong, indulgent, ""who cares?"" movie.What a waste! Brian",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Hard to comment,"And I really mean it (the summary is no pun). I'm a loyal Stone follower and a true believer in his works. I'm also from Greece and there have been some badly executed (pun intended) or produced movies (ie Troy) about Greek history or myth. What also made the viewing experience more unpleasant, was that everybody would laugh even at the slightest homo erotic hint/visual that the movie would deliver.I could only give myself into giving this movie 7/10 by saying that it's the free interpretation of the director, that he portrayed Alexander the way he did. But then again that might be better than people thinking he might actually be from FYROM. Alexander was a Greek citizen, despite the fact that Spartans and citizens of Athens didn't like anyone from the northern Greek territory.I haven't seen the ""real DC"" that will be out in 2007 (maybe it is by now available), but I don't know if I will like it better...",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Rating: 5.4. Are you kidding me? Do you people need any Anti-Motion Sickness pills whilst riding that the hating bandwagon?,"I may like Oliver Stone a great deal, but I am no fawning fanboy (-girl?) of his and am still able to spot poor quality in his films. This is not one of them. Alexander is a flawed masterpiece. It is an original fare, not really relying on any hackneyed formulas or stunning visual effects to get the message across or else mask poor writing. Everything is out in the open--bold, blunt and vivid. It moves back into storytelling mode, exploring the character of Alexander and what drives him to set out on the Persian Crusades. What is the force behind his insatiable conquering hunger?The film never technically answers this question but it offers several explanations. Alexander's bruised relationship with his father. Alexander's mother complex. Alexander's inherent love for people and Greece. Alexander's wish to unite these two under the banner of his idealism.Putting forth these explanations, Alexander zooms in on the aging Ptolemy I (Hopkins) who retells the story of Alexander the Great for history students. He often drones in memories; when the story he tells is exciting it regrettably cuts back to Ptolemy; there is too much philosophizing, but it still works. About the philosophy part - this is a negative aspect in Alexander (2004). There is far too much philosophizing and inner monologue in the dialogue to be effective. The film itself is introspective enough, so there is absolutely no need to take that approach in dialogue too.So much like its character, Alexander (2004) has its ups and downs. The deep necks of Asia and its artistic portrayal being an up and Angelina Jolie's freaky acting and Translyvanian-sounding accent being a down. The pseudo-philosophy being another. Other than this, however, I think this is a masterful film with beautiful portrayals of history and settings. It is patient and careful -- at times falling prey to epic scenarios, giving us a taste of dramatic battles, emotions and landscapes only to jerk it away again and go into delicate mode. It entices the viewer with epic elements, instead of dishing out huge doses of gore galore in battle to keep one's interest Bruckheimer-style. It's refined and assured direction.And lastly, because it is impossible to get away from this controversy...the gay portrayal issue:I liked the fact that Oliver Stone shied away from the strongest homosexual elements in Alexander. Why? Because including daring rapports with his lover would have been a cop-out, crammed in to shock audiences and thereby get some free publicity and praise for being outspoken. Stone didn't feel as if he needed to do this, so he focused on other things instead. He still kept the gay elements to stay true to the historical account, but he never bothered to give them much importance. I think that is the best thing he can do, because it shows he does not think homosexuality is an issue -- it is a natural thing. It should be given no more screen time than any other aspect of Alexander's life.7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"No, No, NO!","This film isn't bad, it's terrible.It drags on for around 3 hours, (though it seemed more like 12). The characters are rather feeble, and although the battle scenes are good it just drags on, and on, and on. The Titanic style flashback method makes it even worse. This is not a film that is just, as one user put it, above the masses, it is just far too dull to get anywhere. It's not actually that historically accurate, it's not entertaining, but it IS the only film i've been to see at the cinema which i have been very tempted to walk out of! The script is also pretty abysmal.A shame - they could have made such a good film out of this. They didn't.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Totally Different Viewing.,"Last night I saw the movie a second time, with my 20 year old son. The audience was of an entirely different demographic than the first viewing (which was an advance screening). The average age of the audience was about 35-45, with not too many teens in there. And guess what? Besides the fact that the entire theatre was PACKED, there was absolutely not a sound from the audience...like they were breathless. No snickering at blond hair, eyeliner, sultry looks from Bagoas, or any of the things that drew slight laughs when I saw it for the first time. It bolstered my hope that as time goes on and more people see it, there will be a more favorable opinion of it.I myself liked the movie a whole lot more the second time around. I watched different things this time...paid more attention to the sets and the other characters behind and around whoever was the primary action of the moment. I listened to the narration more closely, and enjoyed the film much more this time.Response from my 20 year old son, who wasn't just trying to be nice to his old mom, was very positive. He even thought that the assassination scene was fine where it was because it related better to what was going on in Alexander's head at the time.I highly recommend a second (at least) viewing at a theatre with a very good sound system. I realized I had missed some of the dialogue and narration because the 1st theatre's sound system was horrible.P.S. Kudos to Mr. Stone for his lifetime achievement award in Sweden. They don't give those out to just anyone, you know?",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A reasonable stab at an epic subject.,"Any attempt to encompass the life of Alexander the Great in three hours is going to be fraught with problems and likely to draw criticism. Oliver Stone attempts an epic sweep and the photography and battle scenes are first rate. Having seen the film three times now though, I think the main problem lies with the casting. Both Colin Farrell and Angelina Jolie are too old for the parts of Alexander and Olympias and frankly, they are not good enough actors to do credit to such important roles. There are also other actors who are not of the right calibre, mainly male, with a resulting lack of subtlety and sophistication. The flashback sequences are not well done and confuse the narrative and the script in general lacks clarity and quality, with too much focus on Alexander's sexuality and not enough on his leadership and military abilities. That said, it is not as bad as some critics would have you believe and is definitely worth watching, especially for the two outstanding characters, Sir Anthony Hopkins as the elderly Ptolemy and the majestic Bucephalus, one of the greatest and most famous horses of history.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Didn't like it,"HATED this movie. The camera movement was all over the place, it was poorly put together, couldn't really bond with any of the characters as it kept flicking through time which got REALLY annoying.It took a long time for the actually storyline to start, and even then it took a long time for the viewer to actually understand what was going on (which was still confusing and to be honest, not a lot WAS going on.)Barely before the move had begun there was a massive battle. I didn't have a clue who was fighting who and who was loosing as the camera work during this scene was appalling. FAR too much movement found it difficult to focus on what was going on and who was dying.Was indeed true to history, but a lot of the time I found myself thinking wtf is going on? Whos he? Where did he come from? Whats his relationship with Alexander?REALLY confusing movie.The only character I liked was Alexanders horse.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Greece Is the Word,"Could one of the great figures in history (Alexander the Great), a great director (Oliver Stone), and a great deal of money amount to something significantly less than great? Yes, and this film is proof. Courageous Colin Farrell (as Alexander) wears different lengths of blonde wigs, in the title role. Alluring Angelina Jolie (as Olympias) is a couple of decades too young to play the mother role throughout, but she does. Veiled Val Kilmer (as Philip) is unconvincingly half-hidden, under an eye scar. Alexander digs men and women with heavier eye make-up.Unfortunately, the performers do not come across as well as you have a right to expect, under Stone's direction; in particular, the title character lacks Alexander's certain je ne sais quoi. Anthony Hopkins (as Old Ptolemy) performs double duty, as a semi-omniscient narrator (which works better in the original, theatrical version). Films with too many ""narrative"" interruptions are not, in general, successfully telling their stories visually.However, Mr. Stone more than earns an ""E"" for effort; his ""Alexander"" definitely evidences the many individual strengths of its cast and crew. The main battle scene is very well done; Stone successfully employs his great poetic violence, with an increasingly blood-red drenched infrared lens, marauding elephants, and slow motion. After this excitement, the remainder of the film moves along briskly, and effectively. Alexander's main relationship, with Jared Leto (as Hephaistion), is not fleshed out; he beds both genders, but is only allowed to hiss like a lion, on-screen, with wifely Rosario Dawson (as Roxane).Who knew either Stone, or the Greeks could be so prudish?****** Alexander (2004) Oliver Stone ~ Colin Farrell, Angelina Jolie, Val KilmerGood grief!

Terrible on every level.,"OK, first off Plutarch admits that in his account of the life of Alexander he was writing to teach a lesson (about 'civilised' moderation) rather than giving a 'true' historical account and therefore intentionally cherry picks scenes from different contradictory sources (a la Rumsfeld) to suit his point. Hollywood or Neocons manipulating history is nothing new, the ancient Greeks did it themselves. Stone uses Plutarch's theme throughout his film, don't be fooled by his placing the tale in the mouth of Ptolemy, Ptolemy was used as his main source by Arrian who wrote an altogether more honest and accurate account of Alexander's life and comes to quite different conclusions than Plutarch which while still dubious in their own right are demonstrably more trustworthy than a self-admitted propagandist.So why use Plutarch when you know he's intentionally historically misleading? Because it's more sexy.From him comes the portrayal of Olympias as having snakes in her bed (though not mucking about with them all the time), from him come the most lurid accounts of Alexander's excesses in sexuality, drinking, demagoguery and what have you...they have to be there so Plutarch can ultimately use them to kill him, it's Plutarch who puts Alexander's death down to drinking, a tendentious lesson in how ignoring the Greek virtue of self control will bring even the 'Great' to a sticky end.Here endeth the history lesson.As to the film itself my complaints would largely be repeating what's already been said...very silly and inappropriate accents, the structure of the film is a mess, manipulative historical inaccuracies which would have made even Plutarch blush, are they Greek or Macedonian? Misrepresentation of the Achaemenid Persians while completely ignoring Alexander's massacres of civilians, terrible and confusing battles which give no hint at his tactical brilliance (looking mad/daft and shouting a lot does not a great commander make), he gets an arrow in the chest at completely the wrong time and place, awful hammy script making for unintentional comedic moments.....and much, much more....takes a breath...So in conclusion, this film is largely based on the least trustworthy account of Alexander's life which is then messed about with a bit more by Stone, often for no discernibly good reason, then chopped up into a pointlessly confusing, often laughable shambles.Avoid.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Overlong but decentbiopic,"This has been slagged off by some reviewers, but I found it to be easy to follow, and reasonably acted. I can't assess its historical accuracy, but usually feel that criticisms on that basis are often over done - these are historically based fictional films, not documentaries. The story is a good mix of battles and biopic, and my main criticism is that a good half an hour at least could have been trimmed off.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Accents In The Film Are NOT The Problem,"What do you expect the actors to speak? In the Greek tongue with real ancient Greek accents? There are many films of this nature that are filmed in English, no matter the accent. Be it American, British, Welsh, Irish we all speak English with different accents. I cannot understand all the complaints about the accents then rating the film low over it. Clash of the Titans, Antony and Cleopatra, Gladiator, etc... all speak in an English accent and language. To bash this film (Alexander) over accents makes no sense what so ever. So the accent and language complaints of this film are completely invalid.The idea is to tell us an entertaining story in movie form and the film makers did that quite well with Alexander. I like this film. I realize it might not be 100% accurate but none of the films of this nature are because none of us were there to really know exactly what was said, who said it, what they did and and didn't really do.Overall I found the film quite entertaining, it gave me an idea of what it might have been like during this time period and how it might have been with Alexander the Great.7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

From the weird Irish accents, emphasis on Alexander's gay relationships to the failed attempt by Alexander (Farrell) to inspire his legions as William Wallace (Mel Gibson) did in Braveheart, this movie was a joke. I'm pretty tolerant of bad acting and directors trying to make big budget historical productions demonstrating some knowledge of the subject matter but this was literally 165 minutes of my life that I can't get back.

rise and fall of Alexander the great...330BC,"despite all the bad critics, the movie, seen on wide screen with 5.1 is really worth the go. Most historical elements have been truly kept, apart from Alexander's take of Persia (his main goal historically) which was disappointing. Few big battles (alexander only had to fight 7 in his whole reign, won 6), with a very exciting Gaugamela against Darius. The strongest point of the film being its full harmony with the special effects and synthetic images. Darius's palace of Babylon (all in blue tiles like it is historically known) is somptuous, as well as all the other palaces and landscapes, very thoroughly reproduced. great entertainment, good acting, a most beautiful Anjelina Jolie, a convincing Anthony Hopkins as Ptoleme and Colin Farrell quite in tune with his portrayal of Alexander.

Another Sword And Sandal Epic,"Hollywood star power and tons of money can't save this overwrought, melodramatic story of the life and times of Alexander The Great (Colin Farrell), the Greek warrior who conquered lands in times B.C.The single biggest problem here is the script, and in particular the plot structure. Just as viewers are getting familiar with a plot sequence, the time period of the story shifts backward to a previous era, or forward to a future era. Displayed on the screen as ""10 Years Earlier"" or ""40 Years Later"" or ""9 Years Earlier"" or ""8 Years Later"", back and forth we go. It's maddening. It makes the story, which already contains too many characters with strange names, muddled and hard to follow. Director Oliver Stone apparently tries to cram in too much information; as such, the story's scope is too broad. Another possibility is that the time-shifts were necessitated in post-production editing. But whatever the cause, the screen story's convoluted plot is a huge barrier to understanding Alexander and the people in his life.In addition, the script's dialogue contains too much exposition, mostly from Old Ptolemy (Anthony Hopkins) who, via numerous monologues, lectures us about Greek history. Again, one gets the impression that Stone is trying too hard to make the film a comprehensive history lesson.Non-script elements are not much better. Casting for the main parts is poor. I like Angelina Jolie, but she is no Olympias. And Colin Farrell, with his golden locks, would fit better in a modern day romantic comedy. Acting is hammy, at times almost laughably so. Actors don't communicate with each other so much as they speechify. Every line of dialogue is heavy with import. Even the film's makeup is overdone. Jared Leto, with all that eyeliner, looks like a drag queen.Perhaps the best element of the film is the color cinematography. It's quite good. Some of the landscapes are visually sweeping and majestic. And I liked that ethereal background music from Vangelis. Also, the costumes are colorful and apparently quite authentic.I like Oliver Stone. But I have never cared for sword and sandal movies. They always seem pretentious, so proud of themselves, in their extended runtimes and sweeping scope. ""Alexander"" is no exception; it muddles along for nearly three hours, and covers most of one man's lifetime as he conquers lands from the Mediterranean to the Far East.Maybe Oliver Stone would have been better advised to confine his saga to a smaller, more restricted story, one wherein viewers can get to know the protagonist and his inspirations and challenges. In its present form, ""Alexander"" is just too sprawling and epical to warrant any enthusiasm from me.",,Anonymous,Biography
History has its faults,"When I heard this movie was being released, I was very excited. I am a history student and I find Alexander the Great very fascinating. When my friend and I finally saw the movie, we were very disappointed. It seemed to me that Oliver Stone tried so hard to recapture his old glory from films such as; Platoon, Born on the Fourth of July, and Natural Born Killers, he seemed to have forgotten what makes a good movie.He focused on historical events, which I think was a plus, I admired that very much, but Stone ignored almost everything that made him a great director. Stone tried so hard to win awards with this film that he didn't realize that people were getting bored. The movie was to long, Colin Farrell over acted the role to extremes, and Stone incorporated facts concerning Alexander's homosexuality.However, experts cannot prove that Alexander was homosexual, all rumors of his sexuality surfaced several hundred years after he died. This was a way for anti-Macedonian and anti-Alexander patriots in the conquered provinces to discredit their Greek overlords. Therefore, although it is possible Alexander was homosexual, there is no surviving evidence from the time period he lived in that would suggest otherwise.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Alexander's conquests from Greece through Persia into northwestern India,"After being tutored by Aristotle (Christopher Plumber), Alexander (Colin Farrell) takes over the Macedonian throne in 336 BC at the age of 20 after his father is assassinated (Val Kilmer). Over the next 13 years he, amazingly, conquers the Persian Empire and heads into India before finally turning back. Anthony Hopkins narrates as Ptolemy in his old age while Angelina Jolie plays Alexander's snake-loving mother. Rosario Dawson plays his wife acquired in Bactria (in what is today part of Afghanistan).Oliver Stone's ""Alexander"" (2004) was a challenging undertaking and has many attributes despite not being as compelling as the contemporaneous ""Troy."" It's a colorful, entertaining epic with a great cast, awesome battle scenes, exotic locations/sets and a fine score by Vangelis. Naturally the storyline is not as one-dimensional as ""Troy"" seeing as how it involves a movable empire traveling across western Asia.Historically-minded critics complain about the sequence where Alexander's fatigued soldiers request not to push further into India in favor of returning to Macedonia to see their families again. Alexander denies their request and does something that paints him as an unreasonable tyrant. In real life Alexander pondered their demands for a few days before agreeing to turn back and didn't execute anyone, which showed what a compassionate, merciful leader he was. However, this dubious sequence was simply Stone's amalgamation of several mutinies during his conquests, which was placed at that particular point in the story for dramatic reasons. Besides, the movie certainly illustrates how Alexander brought the light of civilization to his foreign subjects and was accepting of their cultures, wanting to unify the many tribes under one banner, so to speak.The scenes with Val Kilmer as Alexander's father are entertaining while the ones with Angelina Jolie get boring after the first two or three. We get it: she loves snakes, hates her husband and thinks Zeus was Alexander's father. Half of the sequences with Jolie could've been cut with no harm done, which would've helped momentum.I didn't have an issue with Alexander's relationship with his childhood friend, Hephaistion (Jared Leto), since it's clearly depicted as platonic in the sense of David and Jonathan in the Bible (see 2 Samuel 1:26). In the film the two are depicted as having a loving friendship wherein they occasionally hug and that's it. I occasionally hug my best friend too, but I only sleep with my hot wife.As far as Alexander being bisexual, there's zero historical proof of this. Yes, the kiss between Alexander and Bagoas (Francisco Bosch) was mentioned by Plutarch who lived in the Roman Empire 200 years later but, assuming it happened, it doesn't mean much. Some cultures in history kissed on the mouth when greeting, like Russians; it's a social tradition and has nothing to do with sexual desire. To put it in perspective, imagine a filmmaker saying Trump was gay 2327 years in the future even though he had numerous women, marriages and children in his life. It's slanderous and can be attributed to Stone's catering to Liberal propaganda as opposed to historical reality. In short, he played the homosexual card to be 'hip' and give his movie Lefty 'edge,' but it backfired because it bombed at the box office. Still, the scene in question is brief and all it suggests is that Alexander experimented with homosexuality once after partying which, let's face it, is something Greeks are known for (although Alexander would argue that he's technically Macedonian, lol).If you can ignore that glaring flaw, there's a lot to appreciate in ""Alexander"" since Stone is unquestionably a top-of-the-line filmmaker. And the flick certainly inspires viewers to look up the real history.The film was shot at Pinewood Studios & Shepperton Studios, both just west of London, as well as Morocco and Thailand (it's pretty easy to figure out which scenes were done where).There are no less than four cuts of the film available: The theatrical cut runs 2 hr 55 min (175 min); the 2005 Director's Cut runs 2 hr 47 min (167 min); the so-called Final Cut from 2007 runs 3 hr 34 min (214 min); and the 2013 Ultimate Cut runs 3 hr 27 min (207 min).GRADE: B-",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
An over acted Movie !,"First of all, it is recorded history authenticated by the historical murals/bas reliefs and paintings of Hellenistic times, that Alexander the Great did not sport long hippie style hairs. It is a farce to depict him in such visage that does not hold true.Some of the very firm historical facts like Alexander died a natural death at Babylon, Mesopatamia by malaria or high fever have been distorted. Besides, established contemporary history makes no mention of Alexander fighting with Monkey tribes in India. During his Indian advance, the first major battle was fought with the Indian King Porus whose forces outnumbered the Hellenistic army. Howsoever, Alexander won, and magnanimously returned the entire conquered territory to the Indian king, much to the contempt and heartburning of his native Greeks. Besides, the manner, in which Alexander's mother Olympia is shown to connive in the murder of King Philip also does not conform to established historical evidences.The bottom line is that besides some improvement in the script, facial expressions concerning emotional intensity does not match to those of Charlton Heston as shown in BEN-HUR. The directional skills of William Wyler were definitely head and shoulders above those we witness in ""Alexander"" of Oliver Stone.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Great spectacle but poor everything else,"I do like epics, and while I am not a historian I do take an interest in it. But Alexander didn't work for me at all. The best thing about Alexander are the production values. The scenery and sets are very grand and lavish, and the costumes are wonderful too. The cinematography, editing and symbolism are nice too, but strictly speaking they verge on being too flashy and don't add anything.Production values aside, everything else simply doesn't work. Vangelis's music is disappointing, it does have its epic parts, but it overall is too grandiose and overpowering for my liking. The story benefits from a great idea and if explored wonderfully could have given us a thorough insight into Alexander the Great. However, the storytelling told in meandering flashback structure is stodgily told, and any parts that could have been so interesting are instead superfluously explored especially Alexander and the battlefield, and I would say the same for the sketchy characterisation too. The battle scenes are beautifully shot but uncompelling.Alexander also has some pretty dreadful acting, which is disappointing considering how good some of the actors are. Colin Farrell tries but is somewhat too effeminate and he does have too many moments where he is not charismatic enough. Angelina Jolie looks beautiful, and she actually has given some good performances despite what has been said about her, but she being too young is hopelessly miscast as is Val Kilmer, while the normally reliable(in many cases even wonderful) Anthony Hopkins is the only one who gives anything close to a good performance. I was really disappointed at how woefully underused Brian Blessed, Christopher Plummer and Rosario Dawson were as well. Worst of the lot is Jared Leto, whose acting and presence is so wooden and lifeless it makes a wooden plank much more animated.The acting and superfluous storytelling are big problems, but it is nothing compared to the script, which is toe-curlingly bad. There is also the cumbersome length, pedestrian pace and Oliver Stone's direction which is rather pretentious(a term I try to avoid like the plague but the term applies when talking about the direction here).In conclusion, it may have great spectacle but there are too many poor assets that made Alexander in all honesty a chore to watch. 2/10 Betahny Cox",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of the greatest Generals of all time,"I met Oliver Stone while sitting at one of my regular coffee haunts in southern California, when he asked about what I was reading. I said it was my favorite biography on Alexander and that it was for the the 6th or 7th time, that it was the only one I know of written by a woman, and it was by far the best one. I told him I had read 5 including 2 from the ancient sources, and I do not read biographies. That Alexander had been my only exception. While we were talking, it seemed that he looked vaguely familiar, but I didn't know who he was until hearing months later that someone was making a movie about Alexander.When I found out that it was Oliver Stone doing the picture, I just shook my head and smiled. We had been the only 2 people on the small patio of this downtown coffee house. Years later when I discovered he had donated 100k to the foundation (?) of this long dead Oxford graduate lesbian who lived in South Africa, whose writing seems to be generally disliked by classicists and scholars everywhere - I was certain it was him. At one point while asking me about the book, I told him no one had the balls to make a movie about Alexander. Not a real one. He must have taken it as a challenge. But then if you know his movies, someone like him would.I don't have time to go into all the error, misunderstanding and lack of well known and widely available historical knowledge by so many, of the same sex relations during the entire span of ancient Greek might. From Homer to the Spartan hegemony to 5th century Athens to the Empire of Alexander, almost everybody did it, they were all married - and nobody was gay. Such terms, the idea and attitude they convey, as well as modern societal norms did not exist in that society or at that time. It is a historical non sequitur to apply what we know and how we live to what they knew and how they lived. And that's coming from a Preacher, who believes every word of the Bible. I just happen to like Alexander, and have studied him for almost 20 years now.This film is highly accurate and well worth watching. But if you're not interested in Alexander - you won't be in the film. It's about one of the most influential men in history, but it is about a man. It's a great war flick also, but the action is incidental to the man. Not the other way around. With the exception of one movie with Richard Burton from at least 50 years ago, there are no other films about Alexander. It has a great cast with all giving strong performances, and Colin Farrell was perfect as Alexander.We're talking about a guy who named one town after his horse and another after his dog. Who gave lavishly to everybody, inspired lifelong loyalty and rewarded it. Who knew thousands of his men by their first names and had personally saved many of their lives as well as payed off many of their debts - with his own money. He restored many conquered rulers to their former place (under him of course), and tolerated to live many who he knew hated him and wanted him dead - both in Athens and in his own camp - when he could have easily had them killed and nobody would have said anything, but he did not. Arrian says of Alexander that unlike other Kings, he repented when he knew he had done wrong. Knowing all that will help you know the man a little, and I think help you enjoy the film more.I have read a fair amount by men who seemed to me jealous of him, and others who made the aforementioned non sequitur of judging him by the standards of their day instead of those of his own. It's also worth remembering that one of his boyhood friends and most trusted generals, Ptolemy, was the man responsible for the Hebrew Bible being translated into Greek - giving us the Septuagint. His son ( Ptolemy Philadelphus) finished the project. Giving us the very foundation for the Bible we have today.When Alexander became King of Macedon at a little past 20 years old, all that he had inherited from his father were a few gold and silver cups, less than 60 talents in the treasury and debts of 500 that he owed. Upon borrowing 800 more, he gave away everything he had to friends and loyal supporters, some would take nothing from him. The man who would become his second in command, Perdiccas, asked him""What are you keeping for yourself ?"" ""Hope,"" said Alexander, to which Perdiccas replied ""That I'll share.""Muchgrace.church.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Stone goes so far, but not all the way.","""Stay with me tonight, Hephaistion"". And with that line you know where you're at, and while Oliver Stone's epic never gets down and dirty with any boy-on-boy action, (long, lingering looks, a lot of bear-hugs and a kiss planted firmly on the lips of a luscious male slave is as hot as it gets), this is, nevertheless, a remarkably frank depiction of homosexuality, or at least bisexuality, for a mainstream studio epic. It's in that lack of boy-on-boy action that Stone fudges things; having gone so far as he does, you just wish he would have gone the extra mile. Did he really think that as it stands this would really play in Middle America? Or maybe by pulling the plug on the sex and concentrating on the violence he thought they just wouldn't get it? Still, it's certainly not the turkey I had been lead to believe. Stone draws parallels between Alexander's campaign in Persia and what is happening in Iraq. Alexander's empire could be seen as a thinly disguised America with a similar record in botched foreign policy. His heart may have been in the right place but massacring the natives wasn't going to win him many friends abroad.Not without it's little absurdities, (as if to compensate for Colin Farrel's Irish brogue, Stone populates the film with other Irish actors and even has Val Kilmer coming over all Oirish as his father), it is still an intelligent and potent piece of cinema. While it's two battle scenes are brilliantly choreographed it's essentially a talkative epic and clocking in at almost three hours is never boring.Farrel is surprisingly effective in the title role, Irish accent and all, and Angelina Jolie redeems her recent spate of mediocre performances with a nice turn as his mother. Unfortunately Anthony Hopkins as an ancient Ptolemy comes over too much like Richard Attenborough and none of the rest of a large cast are given enough screen time to make any kind of impression. But it's still well worth seeing and may well turn out to be the most undeservedly over-looked film of the year.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
See this movie and you won't regret it. It is totally worth it.,"Alexander was a good movie. I enjoyed mostly the first part of it, where they focus was on his childhood and early years. You are able to get a sense on what the movie is about as you watch the development of his unique character. Both Jessie Kammand Connor Paolo acted extraordinary well, living strong impression to the viewers.I have enjoyed the scenes with architecture and nature as they really unfold the past kingdoms as they most likely looked like. Few days ago I had a conversation about this movie with a friend and he told me that it was a bit commercial  the Hollywood style  but I did not notice such a thing while watching the movie.The music is well chosen, primary taken from the folklore of East European countries which seems to be a trend these days. Watch it carefully and you will see how the nature of the animals such as snakes, the eagle, the horse and the elephant is shown, in a way to give a more mythical look to the whole story.See this movie and you won't regret it. It is totally worth it.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
I Don't Think Stone Truly Directed This,"It seems as if the whole movie was restricted on different levels. Some of it looked totally spontaneous and wild and sometimes it looked totally restricted.The casting was horrendous here and I think it has nothing to do with Stone. Stone said his dream pick was Russell Crowe, so then why didn't he get him. Obviously the movie required a big budget so it can't have anything to do with money issues. This probably had to do with Warner Brothers Studios. Despite having a star cast the chemistry between the actors was horrible. Usually Stone does a better job of this. Angelina Jolie played the mother and she is a year younger than Farrell. This probably would not have been so big of a deal if the movie was better. Some of the most basic things were not accomplished in this movie and that probably has to do with in large part of wanting to make good money.The directing if there was any was horrible together with the editing. Everything seemed to be all over the place. No effort seemed to come out of the directing or editing. The battle scenes were horrible not having the slightest idea of what is happening. The writing was OK but nothing special and probably once again restricted.The acting was over the top. Colin Farrell just perfectly describes this. The role of Alexander was too big for him too handle. As previously mentioned before the fact that Farrell was picked for this is a disgrace. Everything in here seemed so over the top and cliché that it frustrated me. Especially with all these talented actors.I would not recommend this movie at all. It is clearly influenced by money and sponsors and is a horrible movie to top it off. This was made to make money not be a good film and that just sums everything up here and that is just unlike Stone who didn't write it nor did he produce it. The worst of it though is that there is no point or message whatsoever and that is definitely not like Oliver Stone.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Not bad,"I mean in was a very enjoyable interesting film, but it didn't half drag on. They missed out a lot of important battles, but still made it drag on. They should of cut a lot of it out. The battle scenes they did include were superb and easily rival LOTR and Troy. The acting was generally pretty good, and the special effects were magnificent. The music fitted in well, and it was good overall, if they just had a better editor then the film would've been superb. It is a very good film, and definitely worth seeing but it doesn't compare to LOTR, Troy or King Arthur. I also don't think it will be remembered as great film like a lot of other films of its type have been.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
wow.,"From the moment I saw the trailer for this epic, I was quite anxious to see it. I love Anthony Hopkins and Val Kilmer, Collin Farrel was fantastic in The Recruit and other films, and Oliver Stone was making it. How could it possibly go wrong? When it came out I was loathe to believe the reviews which slammed it and tore it to pieces, and finally I went to see it on the biggest screen I could find and I gave it the best chance it could have had. What a loser. This film, although just over three hours, feels like an eternity. The plot wanders all over and feels far more like a made for TV docudrama than a major feature film. After the first scene or two the pace slows to a crawl, but does pick up for a battle scene or two. However even these which are well realized and intense briefly, fail to resolve, and we leave the battle field wondering what the heck just happened. I don't care how historically accurate or inaccurate it is, it is a horrible story. Perhaps Stone should have found one event around which to base the film instead of trying to give a passing overview. The characters were completely non-empathetic and there was simply no chemistry or development of his loves, both male and female. The real Alexander the Great may or may not have slept with his male friend, but I somehow doubt that he was the feminine eye-shadow sporting, sensitive lad that this film portrayed him as. Or if he was, they shouldn't have made a major Hollywood film about him because the market of people interested in such an antagonist is a tiny fraction of the typical filmgoing audience. All said and done, the horse vs. elephant sequence was brilliant (appart from some odd and poorly justified colour alteration) but the rest of the film had me glancing at my watch every few minutes, hoping that I could leave this disgrace of a film.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Alexander Revisited is the film Stone wanted us to see.Bloody, beautiful and brilliant.","Perhaps my above summary of the final version of Oliver Stone's much maligned and previously much mucked about Alexander may seem over the top.If you've seen the theatrical version and/or the so - called Director's Cut, you ain't seen nothing'yet! I'm a great admirer of Mary Renault's Alexander Trilogy and Robin Lane Fox's Alexander The Great( the result of a lifetime's research by the Oxford history professor who was Stone's chief historical adviser for the film). If you think I'm overrating Stone's meticulously researched,wonderfully well acted and beautifully photographed movie,read Fox's review and article on Wikipedia's entry for Alexander The Great( links ). If you haven't read any of the Renault trilogy(for me she's almost clairvoyant in her uncanny ability to evoke Alexander and his times, especially Book 2 The Persian Boy ( the story of Bagoas, Alexander's eneuch - related as a personal memoir )I urge you to give it a try.It's far superior to the more recent trilogy by the Italian writer Valerio Manfredi, though the translators may be at fault here- but I doubt it. As for Alexander Revisited, please don't judge Stone's movie till you've seen this final 3and a half hour version for yourself.I hope you'll enjoy it this time around.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Alexander the Average,"The movie was long and there is no way around that. Yes, I have watched plenty of movies just as long or longer, but this one took more time to get to less places. And just to make it better, have the battle sequences use some less that appealing scenery and music for the mood.It is a problem if one of the best features of the movie was the love/hate passion scene between Colin Farrell and Rosario Dawson. It was a scene where Alexander's love overcomes his new wife's hate. But more people were paying attention to the nudity both were showing. And since Dawson is the lesser known, people surely got to know her great looks.I thought the story was OK. But for a historical epic, that is a problem. There should have more more about the battles he fought and less about his romantic escapades. And Angelina Jolie as Farrell's mother? That made no sense.Overall, it is mildly entertaining. But I wanted more action for such a long movie. ""C+""",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
It's not just the stupid masses who hate this film.,"People are blaming bad reviews for this film on 'dumb' audiences and film critics. Firstly, film critics do usually know their stuff when it comes to films. That's why they're employed as film critics. Secondly I'm one intelligent person who sat though this film and loathed it. Seated next to me was a friend of mine who is reading classics at Cambridge. She was bored out of her mind too.I've read Ovid etc. I know the myths. I dint like this film not because I was too uneducated to comprehend it but because it was dull. It may have been historically accurate but that does not make it a good film. It was repetitive and pointless. Most of the audience in the screening we were in walked out way before the end. When you make a film, you should make a film. If making it a good film means leaving out the occasional bit of history then so be it.This was like an extended lecture and I nearly fell asleep. It was not even saved by some admirable acting performances, particularly from some of the smaller roles. Jolie was on form but I'm afraid to say Farrel lacked the necessary charisma and energy for such a part as Alexander. Possibly a stronger actor would have improved matters but really, it was the long drawn out and flat screenplay which killed this one off. It was beautifully shot, but so are many other films. My advice is: don't go see Alexander just in an effort to prove yourself intelligent and sophisticated, avoid it like the plague.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
The movie emphasizes brain over brawn,"Don't go looking for three hours of blood and guts. The Greeks were philosophers and there is lots of talk, about everything from moral virtue to sin, to greed and hubris, friendship and love...you get the idea. People who liked Humanities and Contemporary Civilization in college will like this film a lot more than people whose idea of a good time is three hours of Mel Gibson causing bloody havoc. The battle scenes, while gory, are not as explicit as many blood-and-guts fans might be hoping for. Then, the male-male romance was tough on a lot of young guys on dates with their girlfriends. There were lots of nervous titters from young men. This film is ground-breaking, and for those who haven't come to terms with the fact of our universal innate bisexuality (re-read your Freud), it can be troubling. See this film in a trendy neighborhood with highly educated snobs, especially gay ones. You'll be a lot happier.",,Anonymous,Biography
Coulda Shoulda Wasn't,"There is so much cinematic potential in the story of Alexander the Great - and almost none of it made it to the screen. Mythic/historical gems like the Gordian Knot, the siege of Tyre, and it's all left by the wayside in favor of over-emphasizing Alexander's bisexual nature. After about the fourth or fifth reference to this, I felt like saying ""enough, we get it already."" Despite how much was made of the cavalry charge, that scene, along with many others, really felt as if Oliver Stone wasn't so much directing a new movie but borrowing heavily from others (Braveheart comes to mind rather readily, but there are similarities to many other films), and there were many other battles to choose from, much more pivotal and important, that would have also greatly added the character depth that was ultimately missing from this film. (I can't fault the actors for that, either, as blame rests solely on the people who made the decisions about what scenes went into the finished film.) For as ambitious as this film was supposed to be, it was quite a let down and again, that's as much from what was left out of the film as what was in it. As a gay/alternative lifestyle pride film, it works, and Colin Farrel's acting is grounded enough, but anyone looking for a solid historical epic should rent something else.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Not the greatest, but intriguing","I usually don't do stuff like this - commenting about the movie, but I kind of find myself thinking about this one. First of all, I could say, not a bad movie, not the great(est), like Alexandros was, but worth seeing. I liked some Oliver Stone's older movies, but for this one we really needed someone with more guts - let's say maybe Ridley Scott, someone who wouldn't let his scenes to be deleted or omitted. Then, I have to critique some other things, and good comments will follow, I promise. Hollywood is going into the wrong direction. Yes, they are scared to show male-to-male love, like that is something unknown to human kind - well, maybe to Roman Catholic church mainstream, but apparently not for Ancient Greece. The homosexual scenes were ,actually, shown pretty tastefully, maybe for an PG-13 movie, but not what I would expect from rated R. And yes, it is OK to show a lust between two men, but when we come to the true love - no, no - a big no, no - ridiculous! It is just a love! What are we all afraid of! That wasn't me being original, just a quote. Also, I expected more metaphysical stuff in it, after all he (Alexander) was a Aristotle's pupil (Aristotle started it, I mean metaphysics) - but I just got some epic saga, butchered at the moments, not very well directed! OK, good, things, as I promised. Battles - very well done, and not going forever with exhausting flickering - at the end no one knows what is going on. Not very many of them, so great, great, great! The hawk - excellent symbol!!!! Not going to comment on meaning - I guess that is all individual. And the last, but not the least - Collin Farrell, - one of my least favorite actors, but that was a great job. Worth of such a name as Alexander the Great (Megalos Alexandros)!

"Stone can't control his story or characters, and lets technical effects take over","What profit a man to gain the whole world but lose his soul? Such is the conundrum of Alexander the Great, one of the world's great conquerors and subject of Oliver Stone's film ""Alexander."" Alexander (Colin Farrell) is the son of Macedonian king Philip (Val Kilmer), a hedonistic ruler obsessed with his own legacy. His mother Olympias (Angelina Jolie) is a shadowy Lady Macbeth, filling the boy with delusions of grandeur and plotting behind Philip's back. Alexander is torn between loyalties to his father, a strict pragmatist who sees suffering as the reward for greatness, and his mother, who sees him destined to rule the world.With war looming against the Persian Empire, Philip is assassinated and Alexander assumes control of the kingdom. He goes to war with Persia, conquering a superior force on the fields of Gaugamela and taking the city of Babylon as his prize. Not content with the spoils of war, he pursues the Persian king Darius into the wilderness with his army, including childhood friend turned sexual interest Hephaestion (Jared Leto).As Alexander conquers more lands to the east, his power and legend grows. However, turmoil among the ranks of his soldiers who fear they will never return home along with foolish political movies such as marrying Roxane (Rosario Dawson), the daughter of a ""savage"" chieftain, strain his power to the breaking point. As Alexander becomes obsessed with bringing order to the known world, that same world seems ready to consume him at every turn.""Alexander"" has all the trappings of a great historical epic, but somehow it never comes together. The editing is disjointed, the narrative clumsily jumps back and forth between different eras, and the narration by Ptolemy (Anthony Hopkins) seems in place to explain the shoddy scene transitions to the audience rather than give insight into the characters. The gay aspects of Alexander's life are sensationalized and not treated with much realism. This isn't an epic; it's a monstrosity whose parts are greater than the whole.To be fair, director Stone gives it his best shot. The movie certainly looks great, and the two battle scenes are handled with expert precision. But Stone can't keep his art house flourishes out of the movie. He insists on having close-ups of the eyes of wild animals, screws around with the film exposure and color tint and loads the film with enough of his trademark conspiracy theories to make five films.Farrell gives a good performance, but he's still not right for the part here. The role of Alexander demands someone with more power, and Farrell plays the character with too many flaws to be believable as one of history's greatest leaders. That may be more the fault of Stone however, who co-wrote the screenplay.Jolie and Kilmer are more interesting as Alexander's parents, but their presence amounts to little more than extended cameos. Leto has nothing to do except provide emotion support and fawn over Alexander. Dawson comes the closest to making an impact, but her character is sadly designated to the sidelines in favor of sequences of women dancing suggestively and gradual breakdown of morale among the men.If even a quarter of this film is true, then Alexander the Great was truly a progressive idealist for his time, envisioning a kingdom of equal citizens of all races. However, the message in Stone's film ""Alexander"" comes off as too anachronistic and politically correct for the era in which it takes place. Like 2004's other ancient Greek epic ""Troy,"" the movie is an all-star special effects laden event on a quest for a better plot.Six out of 10 stars. Stone's film is certainly lively, but the editing is off, Farrell is too petulant to be believable as one of history's great leaders, and it all collapses under it's own weight.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
A beautiful portrait from ancient time which deserves your attention,"I liked this movie, a true masterpiece, I feel many people who saw it reacted to the movie the way people at Alexander reacted to his ideas, they just didn't get it, he was a man of visions, this movie is a visionary movie in a industry spawning typical stereotypical action heroes(Brad Pitts Achilles in Troy, Gerard Butlers Leonidas in the movie 300)Those faceless ""Heman"" characters when they eventually get deep they just get cheesy. What the auidiens get here is a deep but still ""visionary"" piece of art in the action scenes, the battle scenes against The Babelonians in the desert made me speechless, we see a flyover that is unique for this movie, still people complained, maybe they missed it when they concentrate to much in eating popcorn and candies while the movie go on, and there is also the fight in India when Alaxander(Xander we call him in Arabic countries)make a go for it against a armored elefant you feel the scene, not like in movies like LOTR Return of the King, where a bunch of silly confused video game elephants run around and roll on the ground.The quest for the world is like the red line of the movie, he wants to be legend and to do something to the world, something good, he wants to learn preserve admire, unfortunately most of his men doesn't follow, neither do the audience, so that leaves this movie a master piece but only for those that understand art and the BIG PICTURE. It makes people wanna see more deep historical movies, read more books read more history. I guess this film will find more and more people in time, its a mystery like the legend himself, Alexander the Great, he was indeed different, if only our leaders today had his ideas or understandings and respect for culture and preservation of history and national treasures, this Directors cut versions will give the people who missed it a chance to truly see it for what it is and the ones who saw it a new look at it and see it deeper.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Somewhat accurate review of Alexander the Great,"When Alexander came out in 2004, I never bothered to go watch the original theatrical release due to poor reviews and general lack of interest in the history based epic films. I had heard and read a little about him and his life, but never but much thought into it.Few weeks ago, a co-worker told me that Alexander is aired in local television network and he also said, I should give it a try. He generally has good taste in movies and so I gave it a try. I must admit, as a movie, Alexander is bad. I do not understand is it historical drama, adventure film, biography or just meant for entertainment? I certainly did not enjoy it and it did not gave me any enterainment.The battle scenes were probably meant to be the centerpieces of the film, but for me they were just dull, bloody and brutal. It is never explained how he planned to win the Battle of Gaugamela and what was his thinking behind the manoeuvres on the battle field. Other thing, the Macedonians are portayed as good guys while Persians and other are just some evil meat bags.Although, there are some very good scences. Acting is terrible and neither Colin Farrel nor Angelina Jolie fare well in their respective roles, but I think Stone actually tried to give a wider picture why Alexander thought and act like he did. Scenes with her mother show how from since the childhood, she made him believe she actually a son of a god, he is great and he will achieve much in his life. She also tries to turn him aganist his father and fathers relatives.Alexander is also shown as a adventurer and egomaniac, thinking that he is the one who knows what is best for everyone and he his fit to be the king of Asia and Macedon. His belief in himself is suggested as the main power what drives him to attempt to conquer all of the known world.After watching the film, I actually spent many hours of my spare time to read about Alexander the Great and it seems to me that although the movie in itself is bad, it is still worth watching because it gives at least somewhat accurate picture about Alexander the Great.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Is the glass 1/2 full or 1/2...?,"Yes, it could have have been better, but I did think it was an above ave. film. The bad: accents! All different types from all over the globe & I Don't mean the fact, Alex used men from all over His globe, either (perhaps that was Stone's point??). No ""to the strong goes the empire!,"" speech?! Unclear looks at the (especially from the bird-eye's view) big Asian battle scene (yes, I Know, Mr. Stone, it's dusty!). Breaking up the key speech, to go elsewhere, several times. (I don't like looking at entails, either!) Sir Hopkip's narrations, sometimes slow things up. The good: I liked both battles, over all; just wish there was a lot more of them, though! (I'm told he fought about 50.) The acting & casting, was excellent. I loved Jolie & Kilmer, especially. I'm glad they showed Aristotle; imagine having the smartest person Alive as one's tutor! The scenery & music are first rate, too. The ""gay"" references, to me, were as trivial as can be: please remember, this was Normal for pre-Christian times! So, in sum, I'd give it an A-.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
People complain about a movie they don't understand.,"Alexander is NOT your typical Hollywood epic. It actually incorporates slightly experimental film-making techniques. Oliver Stone took risks in making this movie into what he did, and it was driven by an artistic, NOT monetary vision.Good things: Angelina Jolie did work as Olympias. You see the way she interacts with her son as a child (who looks exactly like Colin Farrell), so the relationship carries over gracefully with believable acting.Colin Farrell was incredible. All the acting done in his face alone was incredible for an action epic of this scale. He internalized the character, and Stone graciously focused in on that. Colin Farrell deserves a nomination.Not so good: The first battle scene was terrible because there was no clarity in the action at all. The ending scene was interesting, and I'll leave it at that.Jared Leto as Hephaistion...I can't decide if this was under Stone's direction or if this is a casting issue, but I felt that he was attempting to seduce Alexander the entire time. That is NOT what Alexander/Hephaistion or the frequently-referred-to Achilles/Patroclus relationship is about! It's suppose to be about two boys who are childhood friends who grow up together falling in love. Playing up each individual's homosexuality was unnecessary. This year's Troy did a better job of sticking to love that develops homoerotically as opposed to homosexual characters.Rosario Dawson was miscast and did nothing for the film.Overall, this film deserves a few nominations. It was filled with passion from the director, the actors and the characters created, and many films lack that completely.Acting 10/10, Style 10/10, Narrative 6/10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

As a fan of many of those involved I was shocked at just how dreadful the acting was. I could not work out if they were all just having an off day or if the director had told them to do their best to end their careers in the 2 hours and 40 minutes that they had available. The majority succeeded.NO ONE came out of this movie with any credibility.I wanted to press stop on so many occasions but I had to continue watching in car crash mode just to see if there were any artistic survivors.

Theatrical Cut,"Much better than I remembered, although the first version of this movie I watched was the Final Cut, so perhaps watching the bulging 3 hour version with no context might have been a mistake.First the good: I was struck by how much I enjoyed Ptolemy's protracted exposition, wishing for more interludes, Val Kilmer's strong performance and accent, and the soft, human performance of Colin Farrell, enjoying (if it must be a non-Greek cast) the Irish accents throughout. I also liked how the film paces boldly by taking a while to bring adult Alexander in, building his relationships first, no matter how choppy and scene-y they felt.The bad: It looks horrific, the cinematography by legend Rodrigo Prieto is somehow simultaneously too plain, too saturated, too discordant and visually cacophonous, the sets are flat and cheap, and Oliver Stone's directing showed me how much I missed even the worst works of Ridley Scott in this genre. Jared Leto is conspicuously absent from much of the character development and he looks and sounds like a Pirate extra from Assassin's Creed: Black Flag.There's some nice oddball editing and some mixed bag music by Vangelis and some competent (although confusing) battles that don't appear too second unit-y by actually feeling quite modern and even heroic, as opposed to horrific, the way Ptolemy might have retold them.
On the retelling of stories, it doesn't care much to delve into Alexander's queerness or the more sordid and arguably more vibrant elements of his conquests and rule.It's decent, but none of it is clear enough, or has any cohesion; The theatrical cut of Alexander has got shape but the content is cloudy; motivations, history, culture, geography, all a little muddy, secondary to a fusion of some nice lyrical mock-historical dialogue and sort of realistic tone where lots is said, but rarely in very pungent or obvious movie lines, which makes it hard to track what's going on with any efficacy.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Soulless and Uninspired,"Seriously, this movie was just not well made. I can overlook the accents, I can overlook the bad acting, but.. Even the action sequences were badly done. Do yourself a *HUGE* favor and rent Troy or Gladiator instead; at least these either tell a story reasonably well or evoke an emotional connection to the characters. This movie doesn't do that; it feels like a Hollywood studio exec threw some money at some random well-known actors, and asked them to appear in a movie. Otherwise, it just doesn't hold together at all. My wife lasted 20 minutes into the movie; I managed to hold out for about 1/2 of the movie. It's just.. tepid.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Alexander, king of Macedonia, conquers the known world at 25.","Alexander has gotten a lot of bad rap, but if you give it a try it really is a great movie. Colin Farrell is spectacular as Alexander because he is capable of showing the many sides of the character such as his grief, his courage and his love. Historically it is very accurate and contains the great legends that surround the history of Alexander.Oliver Stone has hit a home run i think for this movie because he portrays the story of Alexander without ruining any of his greatness. Because if you look at all of the aspects of his life you could never make a whole movie. Using Anthony Hopkins as the narrator helps out because it helps you understand certain characters and fills in the history gaps.The supporting cast is wonderful, most notably Val Kilmer who plays Philip II, Alexander's father. He portrays both sorrow and anger in the character, one that is very believable. The settings of the movie are beautiful. From the hills of Greece to the sands of Persia, to the jungles of India, the backdrop is spectacular.This movie was also denied the Oscars in my opinion. Maybe not so much for acting, but it definitely had enough for costume, cinematography, director, and screenplay. My rating is 7/10 for this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Alexander proves too smart for dumb American critics,"The US reviews have been really terrible and the IMDb user rating is lower than KING ARTHUR, so I'm wondering if Europe has got a different cut, because the film I saw was excellent. Problems, yes, like Anthony Hopkins and Val Kilmer hamming away and Angeline doing a very odd accent. Farrell's not bad even though he doesn't have enough small moments to work with to shade the role: after Clive Owen's disgracefully bad performance in KING ARTHUR it's amazing that it's Farrell the critics are laughing at.You don't get involved in the characters as much as you should, but its an amazing flick, a real movie. It feels like it's been done for real not by a computer by someone as mad and vainglorious as Alexander himself. Not a total success, but the 80% that hits the target is really intelligent and ambitious and is worth more than a lot of pictures that work better, if you know what I mean.I think the reason Hollywood is so dumbed down now is when someone tries to do something different on a big scale like Alexander, HEAVEN'S GATE, REDS, ONCE UPON A TIME IN America, THE RIGHT STUFF or films like that is that the American critics who are always complaining about dumb audiences and filmmakers can't get them and tear them a new *beep*hole killing them off at the box-office.

As Great As His Name (DVD),"Trailers don't make movies: how many times good trailers are related to bad movies or, as this one, bad trailers concern excellent movies: As I watched the trailer, I got a feeling of ""Birdcage"" in Ancient Greece.

So, when you know that his trip passed by Babylon, that is to say that the West conquered then the future Irak, you got new perspectives for this past world and our actual one as well!Next, the locations are really culturally alike between Greece, Persia, India & artistically beautiful. This movie beats here several blockbusters!At last, the character is himself an outstanding one: his drive for the other (-land, people, relationships,) can be an inspiration! But, I watched the DVD with the director, Oliver Stone's commentary: He delivers such brilliant speeches about history, philosophy, film-making than it is more a voice-over for the movie than an casual commentary.

"Oh, Oliver, where did you go wrong?","I have heard pretty much nothing but bad things about Alexander, so I pretty much stayed away from it, but I noticed that it was sitting in my mom's movie collection and I just wanted to watch something new. I always like to give a movie a chance to see if I would enjoy it myself. Nope, I have to say most of the reviews on IMDb are correct, this is an over blown Ben-Hur wanna be. Not to mention, how in the heck did the casting director think that Angelina Jolie was perfect for Alexander's mother? Colin Ferrell, Colin Ferrell as Alexander?! Now I wanted to give this guy a chance, but seriously, Colin Ferrell?! Not to mention the strange film making, the constant story always twirling back into the question of Alexander's sexuality. I'm such a history buff, now if a movie isn't true to history, it does irritate me a little, but I just think, it's a movie, if it's entertaining, give it a break. Trust me, Alexander is just a bad movie and is an insult to one of the greatest warriors of our time.Based on the story of Alexander the Great, we see him grow as a boy who isn't accepted by his father, is admired by his mother, and is slowly learning the power of being a king, being a strong warrior. His father is murdered leaving him the throne and going into battle to conquer lands, own whoever he wants, make decisions that will effect his country, having to figure out who are his true friends, questioning his sexuality, discovering the true difficulty of being a good king to his people.I seriously had the neuce around my neck by the end of this film, I just couldn't believe how long it was, I don't mind long movies at all if they are worth your time and are very well put together but Alexander is just a mess. The film jumps time back and forth and gets you all confused. Not to mention, please, what the heck was with Angelina Jolie's accent?! Did she watch Bram Stroker's Dracula too much? Believe me, I love movies, I mean, I really love movies, I will always say if this movie is meant for a certain crowd, but trust me when I say that this just a plain bad movie, you'd expect better from Oliver Stone, but he went way over his head and really went overboard with Alexander.1/10",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
A GOOD movie,"Though many have had very negative things to say about it, I felt that it was a good movie. Watching that Colin, I forgot that he was Colin and started to see Alexander. Just for that I felt that this movie is of some worth. I have to admit some of the lines sent chills down my spin, but the movie on the whole was good. Historically this movie could not have been far off. Pertaining to Alexander's death, I liked how the cause was left ambiguis. Those that say that Stone butchered History in making this movie I find to be wrong. Though Alexander might not have been blond, why not by the way, much of what was portrayed went against common belief but true to what we have learned of the great conqueror. I guess summed up, this was a GOOD movie, I enjoyed myself, and was able to immerse myself in Stone's interpretation of the life of a GREAT man.",,Anonymous,Biography
Admirable attempt at capturing a turning point in history,"After a lot of unnecessary disparaging remarks about the portrayal of a bisexual hero which I quickly discarded, I was able to concentrate on some of the outstanding qualities of this epic tale.Firstly I admired the sweeping vistas of the lands that Alexander (Colin Farrell) conquered and enslaved. All credit to the set designers and the magic wrought by computerization. There was so much to watch in these crowd scenes.so many soldiers.so much action.Secondly there were the costumes for men and women, warriors and soldiers, rich and poor and royal families of different lands. So much research was required here. After all 356 BC was a long time ago. If you are going for authenticity, you must not let the imagination roam too far. I thought the overall effect of the costume design was fantastic. Congratulations to those responsible. You did your job well.Thirdly, the battle scenes were understandably chaotic. How else could you record hand to hand fighting? There were some graphic shots I will always remember. I am not sure why but the forest of spears in vertical position prior to the attack was a wonderful piece of cinema that sent shivers down my back. Also the elephants in India lunging forward through the tropical undergrowth like an unstoppable army was an inspiring sight.Oliver Stone as the creator of this mammoth project must have dreamed for many years about the portrayal of Alexander. I imagine that he had many sleepless nights. The result which hit the movie screens around the world is a digest of Alexander's unique life. It shows us that Alexander was so much more than a soldier. He was also a man who had his fears too...was prone to explode in a violent temper... and again break down and cry when things went bad.Colin Farrell in the title role had a gigantic task ( and did well) as the teenager who led an army (Can you imagine such an event today?) and went on to conquer the kingdoms of North Africa, Asia Minor and Persia. He made a striking figure on his favorite horse as he urged his men ever onward when all they really wanted was to go home to their wives and children. His eventual death at 33 still remains a mystery but wine spiked with arsenic is a likely cause. Alexander's mother with whom he quarreled frequently insisted he was the son of Zeus. While many mothers adore their sons even Alexander thought that this was going a bit too far.The main criticism I have is that old Ptolemy prattles on a bit too much in the beginning of the film. We are not all students of classical literature and it is a bit upsetting to have all these classical names thrust at us. But eventually we become engrossed in Alexander's antics so what goes before hardly matters.Just let this great epic flow over you and ask yourself has the world really changed that much!",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Second Worst Film Ever Made,"This is one of those films that are so bad, but so bad, that they become good! Particularly, Colin Farrell gives a performance for the ages, but not in the good sense (irony).This film tries to depict the life of Alexander the Great, possibly one of the most awesomely powerful individuals that have ever lived. But instead the film depicts a poor miserable creature that wouldn't be capable of conquering an ant.The battle scene of Gaugamela, however, is completely different and much superior to the rest of the film. Here we have the single most realistic depiction of an ancient battle in film ever made. Indeed, without this battle this film would have been even worse, possibly surpassing the current leader (Dune). I like to watch this battle on youtube, but always try to avoid the awful lecture Farrel gives",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Even Stone knew it was bad,"I'm here to say that I didn't care if Alexander depicted gayness or not. I know enough of history to know that of the Greek culture. I'm here to say the movie was bad. Even Stone knew it as he edited out scenes for the director's cut. The narrative rambles and jumps around constantly, all the characters stay at arms length, the battle scenes are very few and poorly done, and Alexander comes off as a tyrant conquering the poor ignorant savages for their own good while caring nothing of the lives of his men. His claim to have shared everything with his men comes off cold and his attempts to bolster his men's courage come off as patronizing. It may be just my personal dislike that the characters are all either boring or stiff, but the cut of the movie is horrid. From Alexander's youth to his teens, to the last battle with Darius (for all intents and purposes) then when you think another gorilla war will take the movie Darius is found dead. True to history, yes, dramatic? no! Stone seems to be jumping around trying to cover this and that with no idea how to edit down the movie to a dramatic core. Even when conspiracies are unmasked it rushes ahead to their execution. Every time the scene changes I wonder where we are off too. The past? present? future? Fans of this film need to stop blaming the right wingers for some anti-gay conspiracy. It's just a bad movie from a guy who can often cross the line between brilliant and awful.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Amazing yet also a bit long odd and pootly paced at times,"Really appreciated all the great things about this movie. However much like many of the epics from the days of old, it did feel a bit difficult to endure at times. I very much recommend it, but could not rightfully send you into it without that warning. Maybe play a turn based phone game during long winded scenes, while watching the movie.The movie is a bit...weird...at times too. I mean it can feel a bit awkward weird at times. I don't know how else to describe that.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Alexander the dud,"There is a scene between Alexander and his wife Roxanne in which Alexander violently rips off Roxanne's clothes against her will, she responds by putting a knife to his throat and things are only resolved when Alexander speaks some gentler words and they end up making passionate love.This, no doubt, is director Oliver Stone's (and his writers) view of Western involvement in the middle East from Alexander through the Crusades to Bush and their hopes for the future. The metaphor (simplistic and unhistorical as it is) may have worked, too had this whole scene not been shot as soft porn which tends to undermine its message.Much the same could be said of the whole film, an oddly constructed and badly written farrago of ideas, mostly non-historical. A lot has been made of the homoeroticism but that is somewhat more accurate than many other aspects of the film. Alexander is portrayed as the world's first multiculturalist, something which would surprise Arabs who still invoke his name to frighten children even to this day. Stone and his writers are more interested in Alex spouting platitudes about respecting the Persians ancient culture rather than his belief in the superiority of Greece over the barbarians.Alexander's wife Roxanne, when she is not required to do full frontals, contributes very little to the film apart from a few pouty looks. Since the story is light on females, Alex's mother, played by Angelina Jolie is drafted in, her contribution being to read a few letters written to Alex from Macedonia. It sounds unconvincing, and it is.Jolie speaks in an odd Russian accent for some unexplained reason and the whole matter of accents in this film is a strange one. The Macedonians are all Irish and the Greeks English. This is surprising but not the worst sin in this film.The main narrative thread is given to Anthony Hopkins to read in a an unconvincing voice over. This seems more designed to paper over awkward historical facts than to be organically part of the film. The whole thing seems choppily edited and directed with a mishmash of devices used to no artistic purpose. For example: at one point late on, up to that time completely linear (apart from Hopkins narrative), lurches back 8 years to see the murder of Alex's father. After this lengthy interpolation, which would have been better integrated earlier in the film, we lunge back to 'the present' where the remainder continues in linear fashion. A small point, but one among very many which leaves you to ask why the director has made the decisions he has.Despite all these devices the film is still inordinately long and slow rather like the constant snake imagery used through out (and which is clearly meant to be a metaphor for something. but what?)It is not surprising, given such a duff script, that the actors are reduced to giving a lot of meaningful looks reminiscent of daytime soap-operas.Bad.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Fortune did not favor Stone's bold film,"When Alexander was released on DVD, I was reminded of a joke Billy Crytal made when he hosted the Oscars: ""A new director's cut of 'Gigli' will be released which will run 2 hours shorter."" Audiences have the option of viewing the original theatrical cut of Alexander, and a new director's cut that is actually 8 minutes shorter. I have seen both versions, and there's not really much of a difference. Stone tones down some of the gay undertones in the director's cut, conforming to many criticisms. He also evens out the flashbacks a bit, which I think works better. It doesn't really matter which version you watch, if you don't like one you won't like the other, simple as that. Honestly, I only bought the director's cut because the entire movie fits on one disc. I liked Alexander, and it was by no means a bad movie.Stone explores Alexander The Great's personal life more than his battle tactics, which many believed to be a bad move. In a way, it was. Anyone who views the film alone would probably never get a grasp of what a brilliant mind he actually was. What I thought was very interesting though, was Alexander's unquenchable thirst to conquer new worlds, to push further, until it inevitably destroyed him. Ironically not dying in a battle, but in his bed, taken ill by bad water. So what drove Alexander? Was it to desperately win approval from his parents? Stone's vision seems to think this played a big part. While all the elements come together to make Alexander far more emotionally vulnerable than say, Maximus from Gladiator or Spartacus from...Spartacus, we're given an unexpected new kind of historical epic protagonist. I guess some people just didn't want to accept it, or maybe weren't ready for it.Alexander was not a bad movie. It is at times a little misguided, and there are some aspects that just didn't fly too well, but overall it was very good. Stone has given us a unique look at one of history's greatest figures. It did not do well financially, and some of its critics were absolutely merciless, but you'll never know until you judge it for yourself.My rating: 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
This is not Alexander nor is it Great,"This is a shining example of what a movie about Alexander the Great should not be. Yes, men in those times were all bisexual, didn't matter if it was woman or man, it was simply love. Yes, Alexander's personal life must of been tumultuous. But this is not what I want in a film about the possibly history's greatest military leader I want Alexander the Great, not Alexander the wimpy, oedipal crybaby. I want to see his tactical genius, his charisma, his bravery. I don't want to see him cry after Guagalamela, what should of been an uplifting and heroic victory. And another thing, why were there only 2 battles in a movie about a great conqueror? Where was Chaeronea, Granicus, Issus, Tyre? Where was the river at Hydaspes? And on that note, the Battle of the Hydaspes River was a thrilling victory for the Macedonians, not a bloody near-defeat, nor was Alexander wounded and his horse killed at Hydaspes. Bucephalus died shortly afterwords of weariness and old age And what's with this Oedipus Complex? Alexander didn't have incestuous tension with his mother, that's just prime choice, grade A BS! He conquered the known world because of his ambition and his will to be remembered for all eternity, like his idol, Achilles. Not because he was afraid of his mother! I don't need to know about Alexander's sex life, a movie about a man like this should be about his achievements, not about who he had sex with!

Divine!,"If there have been five films in my life that left the most indelible impression on me, holding me immobilized on my chair watching until the last credit has disappeared while everybody else is already leaving, talking to myself while going home, three of them were connected to Oliver Stone one way or another (Midnight Express being the first). Alexander is the latest one. Why Alexander is Great? Because it was made by a visionary about another visionary, because it is true to itself, to the legacy, to history, because it doesn't sell off, because it is not your typical popcorn blockbuster, and most of all because, steering away from creating a cartoon-like, hollow and fake ""Super-Man"" (Troy's Achilles) it focuses on the Man Alexander. The Hu-Man Alexander. Without concessions to what's popular, what's expected, what's commercial, what's understandable. This is a director that doesn't mince words or films. You can tell I am still under the spell. People mention the sexual orientation thing, either to complain about too much or too little. Don't judge the Ancient World by today's or yesterday's standards. Men in Ancient Greece had Friendships (albeit not necessarily platonic ones), not Relationships. People mention the accents. Alexander was born in Ancient Macedonia (not to be confused with today's Balcan state of the same name, please) and therefore would have spoken heavily-accented Greek, Olympias was born from Epirus, Roxanne could muster very little Greek since she was a ""barbarian"" (meaning non-Greek back then) and Alexander's soldiers came from all over Southern Balkan, Minor Asia etc. I found the choice of Irish over British or American (reserved to Athenians for instance) accent, and the use in the film of many different accents a particularly clever one. People dismiss the eagle's overflight. Read about omens from the gods, they were very important for the Ancients. People want full visibility during the battles (why don't you see a John Wayne film then, all the dead are hidden from view and the heroes are never afraid or confused), people want more battles or events (and yet complain about how long the film is), people want their money back. I could go on and on here but there is no use. See the film again. Read a book. Open your eyes. Ask questions. Undefeated yet mortal, great yet flawed, larger-than-life yet human, Alexander has left a mark in the histories of so many peoples for a reason, and yet, the film has no more chances to be understood by his viewers than the king himself from his soldiers and childhood friends. Typical and sad.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Not boring at all,"As expected from a 200M$ budget movie it looks absolutely clean, Hollywood style. Everything looks great and the cinematography is flawless. Now, there is a different between great cinematography and flawless since while the movie looks absolutely clean and good it had no memorial scenes and pictures. None. They showed Babylon in the most dreamy way they could and yet it felt so unreal and laughable. Looked like a stereotype. Too good which is bad. I didn't like it at all and it didn't match even abit the picture I had in my head for Babylon. And everybody knows that Actabana was the most beautiful city in the world, BTW. :DNow the acting and the script which are tied together like siamic twins was the problem. Everything was way overacted but it seemed like the only way that the script would work. It's written in the most horrible way! The script tried to show how Alexander looked in real life but forgot to show what is known to us. And between us, who really care about his relationship with his mother, his gay relationship with his friend and his failing marriage??? I don't! I wanted to see the glorious battles and the brilliant military decisions! And what did I get? Two great battles and more then two hours of absolutely horrible showing of his personal life. And as I said everything was so overacted that I was laughing out loud in several scenes. Thank god that here in Israel the censor everything gay so the 20 minutes of the gay sex that is probably included in the movie wasn't shown. Thank you god!But the two battles. As much as I would like to complain about how not quite realistic they were I still was absolutely thrilled of them. Both of them (in the start and the end) looked magnificent! And it's all due to the great direction of Oliver Stone. He did the best job he could with the battles and they came out absolutely different, absolutely symbolic (the rise and fall of Alexander) and absolutely thrilling. All the ""personal life"" and drama scenes were worth the watching because once they over you get the battles! And they alone make the movie worthy of watching.But I won't be fooling myself. At no time I was bored! Yes, the acting and script was bad but they wasn't boring and they didn't ruin too much for me. The only thing that ruined the movie is how too many key moments weren't explained in the movie. But then again, Alexander is interesting enough, so go and grab a book!",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Palace of Persia,"The biggest struggle in my head after watching this movie:History has it that when Alexander conquered Persia, he set the grand Palace of Persia on fire and nothing remained of it except for stones... as you can clearly see this today, judging by the remains of what is called "" Takhte Jamshid "" - Jamshid's Thrown - which is located near Shiraz. That was what I was expecting to see every minute for the first half of the movie. Maybe Oliver Stone couldn't afford it huh?! :D But the whole setting on fire thing is totally against the character which is presented as Alexander. U've watched it, would u believe he has done such a thing?!The other thing which is banging against the walls of my head is all the gay stuff going on in the movie. Was it really necessary? There was also a ""penis shot"" which I can't figure out what good does it do to the story.Anyways I watched it! But I wouldn't watch it twice.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Not as Bad as Critics Have Reviewed the Film to Be.,"I was pleasantly surprised by how entertaining Alexander is and did not agree that this film deserved the poor reviews I've read so far. I attribute this to some clever film editing in certain parts of the film, resulting in an evenly paced rendition considering Alexander kept going and conquering everything east of home. There have been two other historical epics that focused on ancient Rome and Greece that were released during the past five years and thought Alexander made TROY look and sound just plain dumb, Alexander having overall more intelligent and involving dialog. Also I felt Alexander was more rich, lush and honest in it's screenplay and art direction, and was impressed by the costume design. I must applaud Oliver Stone for not hiding the truth about Alexander's personal life. Like it or not, that is the way a lot of soldiers related to one another back then. Being honest in depicting Alexander's personal relationships allowed for more freedom in character development; had Stone ignored history, the film would have had a lot of the stilted feel of TROY. I feel that a lot of the bad reviews were not honest; the reviewers perhaps too afraid to say they didn't appreciate the portrayal of unrestrained intimacy between Alexander and his friends, and for the rest of the Army. So they deliberately searched deeply for flaws.Any film which picks me up and makes me forget I'm sitting in a chair in a theater is a pretty darn good film, and my involvement with Alexander was like a magic carpet ride in places; Stone hypnotizes in some scenes very well and in just the right places. Colin Farrell was just right for the role of Alexander; Angelina Jolie would have been given more credit had this been a premier role/film for her; instead she is so distinctive being herself that it is distracting - almost to the point of making me feel there was a commercial coming up soon. Further, the most annoying thing I found about the film was that Alexander and everyone around him all had heavy Irish, Scottish and English accents. Does anyone remember how out of place Ralph Richardson's accent was in DR. ZHIVAGO?I enjoyed this film overall, and plan to view it 3 or 4 more times. My thanks to Stone and everyone involved for historically accurate storytelling!",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
274  pupils for  R. Lane Fox,"Look at the three ""best"" reviews about Alexander. Each of them received 274 votes. Isn't it a little odd? As I am an University Professor too, I am a little malicious. Colleague Lane Fox has got a lot of pupils: isn't it possible that they gave their votes to the Professor who was consulted in order to write the screenplay of this movie? As regards me, I think that Alexander is an intolerably long and boring school lesson. It is no movie. There is no plot, no emotion, no decent CGI. It looks like an anime. The archaeological reconstruction is terribly bad, in any case definitely worse than in ""Troy"". And the acting is always exaggerated (I would save only Jared Leto).

Not bad at all,"I can't explain the overall 5.5.Maybe it was not the best movie of the year, but it sure showed to everyone who Alexander the Great was and what he has achieved. Especially for those people out there who do not have a clue about historical faces, this movie will help them appreciate the value of being a real leader, a pragmatic emperor, and of course which are the drawbacks of such a heroic and ultra optimistic figure.Very nice role playing by everyone in the movie.The only disadvantage might have been the ""overcoverage"" of his bi-sexual life (and that is why some scenes were cut in the Greek 'market') but OK.It's worth watching though, even if you are not a fan of historical/war films.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Not enough of what people really want!!!!,"First and foremost, Alexander was a soldier. Indeed one of the best that history will ever know. Oliver Stone seems to have forgotten that.What was it that made ""Gladiator"", the first of these historical resurrection movies such a success?? The BATTLES!!!!! It starts with the battle in Germania and then, every 15 minutes or so after that, Maximus is in the arena chopping off heads. It kept everything moving along nicely.It took 45 minutes of absolute boredom in Alexander to get to the first battle & that was Gaugamela!!! Straight to the main course, no appetisers in the siege of Tyre or the battles at Issus or Granicus, each battle which was both important and different from the rest in all aspects (besides the outcome, Alexander always won). Rather than the tedium of showing Philip II as a carousing alcoholic (well played by Val Kilmer though), it was Philip who trained the Macedonian army to be what it was, that would have made much better cinema. Darius' part was reduced to a mere cameo, yet he was the main antagonist (on the surface at any rate) for Alexander!!!! There was too many attempts at showing some sort of ""divine destiny"" of Alexander and not enough showing what Alexander was remembered as ""The Great"" for, for being the truly great battlefield general he was.I still can't believe I walked out of the cinema thinking ""This was about as good as Troy, and that's not saying much."" I can only hope that if Steven Pressfield's excellent ""Gates Of Fire"" is to be turned into a movie as has been mooted many times, that the producers learn the lessons from Alexander (& Troy) and concentrate on what really matters in history, the battles, how they were fought and who won.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Dog's breakfast,"This film moved me to register with IMDb just to say how awful it was. No, not because of the relationship with Hephaestion. That's historical. But because of the all-over-the-place direction. Platoon to the nth degree! right to the slo-mo encounter between stallion and elephant. Misdirected by Oliver Stone, ""Alexander"" spends most of his time either with his huge eyebrows slanted up in a worried direction, or bellowing like Joan of Arc in ""The Messenger"". Two basic expressions. Poor Val Kilmer gets to do a nice Oliver Reed impression. As far as history goes, we're provided with a quote from Virgil (70 bc or so) right at the start, which Alexander then repeats about 300 years earlier. (Virgil stole it from Alex, right?) Alexander was a truly amazing strategist. The first battle in this film was such a disorganized, overblown mess that this was hardly apparent. Also, the film made it seem as if that was it, one big battle, empire conquered. It was his continued consistent victorious streak against all odds that amazed people and kept his men with him for years on end. Yet hardly any of his other successes were mentioned. His continued brinksmanship with Darius was largely ignored. Where was the building of the bridge to the island? Where were the things that made him such a superstar of antiquity, such as the oracle from Zeus in Egypt, or the cutting of the Gordian knot? Instead we see him coaching his men with some new-agey pop psychology and multicultural idealism. (This didn't make sense either--on one hand he was all about the equality of all cultures, on the other he kept talking about bringing enlightenment to the barbarians) Not very likely for a Macedonian warrior, whose motives were more likely power, glory, and to outshine his father. I know it's hard to make a good movie, but this one was just a dog's breakfast.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
"I believe this beautiful, exotic film  will become a collectible much like ""Satyricon.""","This film presents an intense psychological investigation of the character of Alexander of Macedon. It is thoroughly immersed in the moral, political and philosophical climate of Grecian antiquity, In many ways it bears somewhat of a resemblance to Fellini's ""Satyricon"" of thirty-five years earlier. There is the similar re-appearance of the Cyclops-like characters, the shrew-like ""luna"" characters with their sensual but corresponding dark sides, a ""token"" love garden, the tinted filter/lens effect on specific scenes and the stunning ""pagan"" beauty evident in the set design. It also features male leads who share a code of honour and love between them. A love which in its ""highest"" spiritual form was representative as a means of transcendent personal growth and valor; ideas passed down from Plato to Aristotle. Chronological occurrences of Alexander's campaigns and political successes take a back seat as a result, disappointing many more intent on an all-inclusive rendering from this perspective. The variety of spoken accents form a type of ""primordial soup"" much like Fellini used in ""Satyricon"" as well; a curiosity thought by some to be symbolic of Jung and his theories of a ""collective unconscious"" wherein all language is simply an outward babbling to personify the universally shared life experience of all people. There were some cosmetic concerns, most notably Alexander's badly tinted hair and eyebrows. The excessive black eyeliner worn by Hephaestion is a look that does appear periodically on vases and frescoes. However, underneath all of the controversy lies the character of a deeply passionate man with his seemingly many strengths and weaknesses, attempting to grow and to love without limitation in accordance with his own perspective and level of understanding. Kudos to Colin for possessing the maturity and depth to present Alexander's complex personality and feelings with so much intensity and dignity.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Not as bad as people are saying,"While this is a disappointment, and about twice as long as it should be (lots of stuff that should have been cut) I can't call this a complete disaster. Great performances from Angelina Jolie and Colin Farrell. A lot of unfortunate choices like only showing two battles, and putting the death of his father as a flashback at the end, instead of showing it where it should be. Plus just some weird editing (like one part where the camera cuts to a Hawk a mile up while Alexander is in midspeech... da heck?). Still, while I have no interest in seeing it a second time, and might have felt ripped off if I hadn't seen it for free, I don't think its a bad movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Alexander the atrocious,"When director Oliver Stone announced that he would be making a huge budget film on the life of Alexander the Great, audiences, understandably, had high hopes. When the casting of Colin Farrell as Alexander was announced, these hopes were further stoked, by the fact that no huge name actor, such as Brad Pitt had been cast. Could it possibly be that Alexander might focus on talent, rather than the kind of big-budget mess that both Troy and King Arthur had turned out to be?Sadly, the answer is a resounding no. The project turns out to be nothing less than a massive letdown in the end, with surprisingly huge failures in almost every section possible. There are so many places to pick apart at Alexander, it's hard to know where to start. So it may seem easiest to start with the man in charge of it all: Oliver Stone.Stone has clearly stepped out of his element here - while used to dealing with political dramas based on the lives of past U.S. Presidents, he seems tied up with trying to make reference as much as possible to Greek mythology and tradition. As a result, Alexander comes off almost documentary style, with every character spewing pretentious , cheesy and mostly incomprehensible lines that seem straight out of a badly translated history textbook. How in god's name has Stone suddenly become such a terrible writer? Not to mention that any directorial influence seems totally absent, as the plot sways sickeningly between present and flashbacks in a confusing manner for no real purpose at all, except seemingly to confuse and disorient the viewer. The movie starts out far too slow, and with far too much talking, mostly just pointless glorifying of Alexander, and it doesn't improve much as it progresses through its painfully long runtime.Accents are all over the place here. While the same was true for Ridley Scott's Gladiator, it comes off as a much more glaring flaw here. Indeed, the characters seem to be from around the world, from Farrell's Irish, to Val Kilmer's blatantly American, to Anthony Hopkins' educated Englishman, to Angelina Jolie... who seems to have decided to make her character Transylvanian for some incomprehensible reason... Stone seems to have lost all control of his production, and given up on it, letting it spiral into disarray and confusion.Stone also seems to have left his actors entirely free to ham it up as they wish, as many of them give what could have been promising performances, had they bothered to tone it down a few notches. Farrell is the best example: he actually isn't bad in the lead, and indeed seems to surpass the overall quality of the movie, but he still fails ultimately to capture our sympathies and enthusiasm. In the end, we end up not really caring about Alexander, and his 'great' exploits, so, despite a valiant effort, he still fails to do the character justice. Angelina Jolie and Val Kilmer are similarly wasted as Alexander's insane and deranged parents, both overacting to the point of hysteria. Another bit of advice Stone forgot to provide for most of the film's actors: YELLING DOES NOT EQUAL DRAMA! Not to mention inconsistencies, such as the whole accent issue, and the rather disturbing fact that Jolie, playing Farrell's mother, is in fact a year younger than her 'son'. These are miniscule and unimportant, considering the more glaring flaws the film has to deal with.Other cast members, seemingly given full reign to do whatever they want, turn out equally unsatisfying performances: Anthony Hopkins comes off as a ranting old fool with no purpose in the story save to serve as a sort of narrator, bestowing endless praises on the film's 'glorious hero'. Jared Leto is given next to nothing to do as Hephaistion, Alexander's childhood friend who turns out to be 'more than a friend'. Rosiaro Dawson is similarly wasted, playing essentially a foreign sex object. Despite the fact that her character is pretty much that shallow, Dawson still manages to turn out one of the film's most impressive performances - which still isn't saying much.However, not all aspects of the film are as terrible as I make them out to be. The costumes and set design are magnificent, and, unlike the film, actually seem truthful to the time and age. Unfortunately, the music by Greek composer Vangelis (at least one influence on the film is actually Greek!) which accompanies it is one of the worst scores we have been forced to behold in recent history - painfully cheesy and overdone at every point. Rather than adding to the quality of the film, Vangelis' score only serves to remind us of how terrible it is.As you can tell, I'm not exactly providing a glowing review for the movie here. But it's not often that a film manages to insult my intelligence and provide so many additions to my list of things that annoy me as Alexander. Those only with a bit of excitement or historical inquisitiveness might tentatively want to check out Alexander, but for everyone else, I'd have to strongly discourage it. The film doesn't hold together in any sense, and the result is embarrassing. In fact, the one bit of insight in the entire movie is provided by Anthony Hopkins' Ptolemy - the fact that the character of Alexander is overly glorified through tales of his legendary deeds, and is, in fact, nowhere as great as it is said. So very true. And it can also be said that Alexander's film is not nearly as 'great' as it set out to be. Quite the opposite, in fact. Avoid at all costs. You have been warned.-3/10",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Recommended, for a very limited audience","I can recommend Alexander to anybody who likes El Cid, Khartoum and The Fall of the Roman Empire. I had problems with the movie. Let me count some of the ways. First, Angelina Jolie plays Alexander's mother. Talk about child bride  she's one year older than Colin Farrell, Alexander, in real life. There's (naturally) an incestuous relationship implied. And Alexander's father is Val Kilmer, who's only about 15 years older than Farrell. I don't think boys of that age generally reached puberty in ancient Greece due to a lack of protein.Second, in the beginning of the movie, Kilmer relates some Greek legends to Alexander the boy. This is glossed over much too quickly; the stories are really interesting and bear on the rest of the movie. They constantly refer to them, but unless you're really knowledgeable, most pass over your head. I guess Oliver Stone considered this only marginally important background. He had to cut something (the film's 3 hours as is) because he had to fit in endless, repetitive, boring homosexual stuff that's probably fictitious. As we know from many movies, all REAL men are as least a little bit gay. (I guess this is my third problem. I'll quit counting.)Next, in his first manifestation of the king and leader he was to become, little Alex tames a wild horse by, oh my God, whispering to him. Who'd have thunk that in addition to conquering the known world (more later), Alexander invented horse-whispering almost 2500 years before anybody ever heard of it. Was Robert Redford a co-writer? He didn't get screen credit.Next, while in northeastern Persia on endless pursuit of his arch rival, Darius (who looks like a Hollywood-ized version of some current arch rival of America who will remain nameless), Alexander marries the daughter of some local chieftain. Now you'd think that since they were so specific about where Alexander was when he married her, they'd get some actress who looks vaguely Asian. But no. This one must have been from that little-known tribe of Africans who lived in central Asia circa third century B.C. Naturally, she looked like Alexander's much beloved and hated mother. Oh well, she had a nice pair, so that settles that. On their wedding night, she pulls a knife on him which leads to some rough sex. A little S&M is always necessary. Did I mention she had a weird tattoo on her body?Too many spectacular scenes (Babylon, most of the battles) look like CGI run amuck. But one involved elephants, so unless you're a real Sabu fan, that's unusual. (By the way, Sabu owned a seafood restaurant in Monterey.) Of course, when Alexander is killed, it's in slow motion. Holy Sam Peckinpah! But like E.T., he doesn't die. He recovers! (Music swells as yet another movie cliché is checked off.) A plus is that the formulaic background music (Vangelis; think Chariots of Fire) and noise often covers a lot of forgettable dialogue that often is unrelated to anything in particular. In fact, there sometimes seemed to be little linkage between one sequence and the next. I don't think we saw an out-of-order print, but you never know.Of course, it was necessary that lower-cast Greeks have cockney accents. And the fact that I couldn't tell one of Alexander's friends from the other must be my fault. One friend kept showing up over and over again, never said a word, and was never referred to at all. Who was he supposed to be, another one of Alexander's lovers? An early version of Jesus? (Mustn't forget the evangelicals.)Isn't it a truism that one one-eyed character in a movie is enough? This one has two. You can really tell them apart: one is missing his left eye, the other his right.They constantly make reference to the ""known"" world, like ""I've conquered the known world."" I find this a little anachronistic, or do you think they knew more than we give them credit for? And Alexander said he wanted to unite Asia and Europe and - holy world brotherhood! He stopped short of reference to the United Nations. (Speaking of geography, the Mediterranean is referred to as the Middle Sea, but on one map it's labeled Mediterranean.)All in all, not the worst movie I've seen this year  that's Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow. Come to think of it, Angelina Jolie was in that, too. Maybe there's a message here. And in THAT movie, she wore an eye patch. By George, I think I've got it!Hey, nobody smoked a cigarette.",,Anonymous,Biography
Epic saga of a great leader,"Alexander,as the name suggests,its about the life of Alexander the great.It was a good movie so i couldn't understand why they are trashing it so badly.It was a well intented inspiring movie.The movie is like a tribute to one of the world's greatest military leaders.Every frame boasts of epicness and perfection.I loved its story which begins when Alexander was 5 years old.Its non-linear narrative was like a cherry on the cake.The movie showed the whole events in a manner which was not filmy so it looked very close to the reality.This movie mainly focused on the expeditions took by Alexander to conquer the whole world.He was truly a genius and ahead of his time.Many times he was blamed by calumniators who were only hungry for the throne and money and were worried as why he is donating money in poor.The movie was also very accurate historically.It also showed about the society where eunuchs were allowed.Alexander always fought for the benefit of public.The movie depicts everything in a grandeur fashion but the screenplay feels lousy.It was too sluggish in the beginning but picked its speed soon.The ending was poignant but confusing.In acting section everyone was OK except Angelina jolie.She was mind-blowing and essayed the role of a throne hungry mom perfectly.She proved again why she is one of the most talented actress.Music was nice.Visuals were good.The war scenes lacked enthusiasm but were grand.The movie also needed to be shortened as it was too long.Overall it was an engaging historical epic saga of rivalry,bravery,beguile and throne.Truly people remember only those who thinks and do ahead of their time and Alexander was one of them.

Oliver Stone's Alexander,"Given 5 hours I'm sure the Master would have vanquished complaints of time warp, blessed us with fewer monologues and more comprehensive character development. However, Alexander is what it is -- and somewhat less than it could have been. To convey the enormous reach of young Alexander's conquests, their impact on the conquered as well as the conquering, Stone uses monologue narration via Anthony Hopkins (Ptolemy) as he used him in NIXON, and Costner in JFK -- to array the facts, and ask the key questions. No one can create these larger than life portraits and still serve the facts and the gaps better than Oliver Stone. However, if one can't accept how Stone does his work, then they may as well pick another flick. But, if one enjoys feasting on spectacle, Stone's rendition of the battle at Gaugamela is astonishing, with his aerial shots, swish pans, stuttering cuts of an army of individuals, with the eerie guttural sounds of who-knows-what that make the gut turn and the skin crawl. All this said, even though Stone says that Colin Farrell ""became Alexander,"" he perhaps was too fine a rendition of the bi-sexual conqueror. He voice wasn't low enough. He wasn't muscled enough. His face wasn't fierce enough. And of course that's the point. But I needed to see a young Russell Crowe conquering the world on Bucephalus. Finally, Irish accents and Jolie's ludicrous lilt designed to clarify the distinction between Greeks and Macedonians wasn't worth the distraction.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
This movie proves that too many drugs will ruin even the most gifted filmmakers,"After watching this film, I came to realize that if the real Alexander the Great looked anywhere near as weird as Colin Farrell with a giant blonde wig, that was probably the distraction he used to stay alive in so many battles. I'm sure that soldiers everywhere dropped their swords in confusion when faced with the awkward blonde menace. I don't blame Farrell for being horribly miscast in this film because I didn't think Val Kilmer was realistic as Philip of Macedonia either. As a matter of fact, the only convincing character was Angelina Jolie as Alexander's mother, and she is probably younger than her on-screen son, Colin Farrell! I tried to find the message in this movie, I really tried. After sleeping... I mean sitting through all three hours of the director's cut, the best I could come up with was that it's cool to conquer the world. Alexander the Great's feats make for impressive history books, but the movie seems as shallow as the Hollywood setting it spawns from because of so little self-sacrifice and true meaning to Alexander's life. I guess I should give Oliver Stone some props for sticking with historical fact and giving Alexander a ""feminine male friend"" but I admit, my 21st century American bias made it difficult to accept that a man who led thousands of brave soldiers also enjoyed having his nails manicured by transvestites. Speaking of Oliver Stone, I think the biggest lesson of this movie is to stay off drugs. Stone made notorious headlines lately for his many drug escapades, and after watching classics like ""Platoon"" and ""Wall Street,"" and then viewing his contemporary stuff such as ""Alexander,"" it makes me realize that too many drugs will affect any brilliant mind.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Alexander, The Tragic","When you read about Achilles and Hercules, you read about heroes. Heroes that want no more than victory and fame. They get the fame. When you have read about those heroes. You have probably heard about Alexander The Great too. He was a hero just like them. But he did exist. That made him larger than life. For written characters like Achilles and Hercules are probably made up.While watching this film, I realised Alexander was pushed. I bet he didn't even know he wanted to be a hero. His father wanted him to stay humble, his mother wanted to make him king. His best friend Hefaiston made him king by shouting it through the arena.Alexander wanted to explore the East, he wanted to be allies with the Greek ""enemies"". And more and more his people start to doubt him. Because what are his intentions really? Does he want to make ""barbarians"" into Greeks. Or does he want to conquer the world and explore everything. His men know one thing: The are not going home soon. That's when they start to revolt. And Alexander loses his grip on his men.I think this movie really reflect the Greek way of thinking. And of acting too. I do not believe Alexander was really gay. But there seems to be a chemistry between him and his best friend Hefaiston. I think that is realistic. They grew up together, they fought together and they survived together. That grows a bond stronger than love. But gay or not. Alexander (as it shows in this film) is really just a mortal man. With nothing more than a boyish dream to see the rest of the world.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Awful Movie (Might Spoil Something),"My friends tell me I have a too pessimistic view of the world and overuse the word ""awful."" Well, they tend to be right, but there is no reason to be coy with this movie. It's awful. The worst part is that someone obviously paid a lot of money to have this movie made.First of all, let's start with the one thing that is front and center in this movie... Alexander was gay. It seemed to be Oliver Stone's whole point in making this movie. I don't care if he was gay or not, but why did it have to be so vehemently (I love using that word) piled on?Second, can anyone in this movie act their way out of a paper bag? Not Colin Farrel, certainly not Jared Leto, and most definitely not Angelina Jolie. I'm surprised Colin's eyes didn't pop out on a few of those takes. He certainly tried hard enough... Jared Leto was just too soft to add anything to the picture. Angelina was hideous. There was nothing to like about her character. She talked funny and she had an evil-ugly look to her. No one else really had enough of a part to make a contribution.Third, perhaps Oliver Stone has not heard of a script, because this movie might have been done without one. There is no dialog that sticks out, and most poignant lines are clichéd.Fourth, 3-D puzzles are easier to put together than this jumbled mess. The movie might have been better if I could follow it. Having to catch a good look at Colin Farrel's hair to figure out how old he was in each scene was just too difficult. I also have to ask... why did Oliver decide to use a circle wipe before the elephant battle? I replayed that four times and just couldn't figure out why that was in there. While I'm on the subject, what the hell was with all the red when Alexander got hit with the arrow?Simply put, this movie was a mess. I don't care how historically accurate it was, the material just wasn't delivered in an acceptable manner, and that's the main factor killing this film. If you're looking to see a bad movie just to see a bad movie, then go ahead. But it's a very long movie, too long to enjoy just because it's bad. As for me, I want that three hours of my life back...-Dave",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
the other thing wrong,"was that two out of five could only be 40% successful, and boredom filled the gap. So it beats the Scottish film by a factor of at least 30. Angelina Jolie again showed that all she needs is nitro fuel, and something round her upper left arm. As usual, I didn't like camera blur substituting for the ice-cold crystal-clear full-colour experience that is imminent death. There's little else specific that I can point to as being no good, other than the lack of Issus, Granicus and especially Tyre. The latter could have easily been done as a brief CG shot. There were, probably, too many words, some of which were not entirely germane, and oveall an attempt to do something high-minded which did not quite come off either.

Alexander,"Opinion on this film seems to have been hijacked somewhat by the definition and appropriateness of the relationship between Alexander (Farrell) and Hephaestion (Leto). It seems daft to try to apply 21st century social morals onto a society in which same sex relationships were simply unremarkable. Whether or not it was about sex, or love, or both isn't really that important - I think Oliver Stone was trying to involve us in a much more complex story of human nature. It may also be more of an Anglo-Saxon thing - men on Continental Europe from Scandinavia to the Mediterranean (and their N. American descendants) have a completely different, relaxed, view towards tactility amongst men. What this discussion does do successfully, however, is distract us from a pretty lacklustre effort at an epic. The film has grandeur and style but really does lack substance. It has all the grit of a beauty pageant. The script is wordy and weak, and characterisations way too shallow given we have effectively a blank canvas from which to work and an almost unlimited timeframe in which to tell the story. Inevitably, it does draw comparisons with Richard Burton and Frederic March's version from 1956 but not favourably; the all star cast here just doesn't really gel in the same way and the CGI isn't anywhere near as convincing as the real photography of the earlier iteration. Overall, a very well resourced missed opportunity to tell the tale of one of history's most enigmatic characters.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Masterpiece,The movie shows with excruciating detail the personal drama of one of the most influential characters in world history. Without Alexander there would be no western civilization since the Greeks liked keeping their culture for themselves only.This picture is not for the faint of heart since it depicts the flaws of a real person and the way he really lived. As for those who expected to see a Gladiator movie... Well they are not Alexanders... But nations like the American nation were built by founding fathers who had the heart of Alexander the Great.Kudos to Stone,,Anonymous,Biography
Beware of women... they are far more dangerous than men,"I base this upon the 168 minute version. Maybe that makes it the Director's Cut... I inquired the cover of the DVD(which came only with the film, subtitles and scene selection), and was granted no answer. Well, this has divided people. Whenever Stone decides to have at the ol' history books with correction fluid, he's got students failing classes and teachers pulling their hair out as if they've just decided that baldness would look good on them, and they haven't the patience to go and acquire a shaving apparatus. I'm of the opinion that you simply shouldn't go with, well, *anything* you're told in a piece of fiction as being truth before checking it with a reliable source(no, Wiki doesn't count), and I try to judge these based on how entertaining they are. With that said, for the handful of inaccuracies this has, it is quite authentic. The production values are rich, with great designs. We get some pretty attractive visuals. For an epic of this scope, and on such a grand scale, to be this bold is impressive. I understand that many have been angered by the homo/bi aspect... since there is evidence to suggest that being the case for the man this is a biography of, and, you know, the small fact that in ancient Greece, *it was seen as completely natural*, I remain baffled by that response. To those who claim that this is tarnishing Alexander... if something is going to give a bad name to anyone, isn't the instant jump to the conclusion that gay=negative a better candidate? And if it isn't, shouldn't it be? I wasn't surprised by Oliver having the guts, but Farrell(who delivers a rather strong performance) and Leto(who is also amazing... isn't he always?), I didn't know to expect the courage from. The relationship between them is convincing, which cannot be said of all the others. Kilmer does well for what he's given to work with. I like that the British accents represent upper class, and other English ones signal lower ones in this. With that said, a few of the dialects can be all over the place(is Jolie trying to sound German? I think she's the only one on the planet who knows what she was going for with that). The acting tends to be solid, including most of that of the kids. Casting is hit and miss, and talents are wasted by being given next to nothing to do, and the screen-time to match(also, Christopher Plummer ought not to wear a toga... he can not pull it off with any dignity intact). Dialog is fine, if a little of it screams ""look, we did our research"". This comes off as real, with no excessive CGI, and things tend to have impact. The battles are bloody, brutal and seen up close, you can tell this is the guy behind Platoon(you *feel* the deaths). No, you don't know exactly who's winning(it's not the level of Star Wars Episode III, though), because no one in the midst of that situation does, except for when it is obvious; instead, you sense the chaos of it. Think of the landing sequence from Saving Private Ryan. There is a bit of racism and a tad of sexuality and female nudity in this. I recommend this to those looking for an enjoyable retelling of his life... for an entirely credible one, look elsewhere, of course. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
An epic,"I made the mistake of reading the oversea's reviews before going to see this movies, When Troy was released and the fictional version of events was portrayed I was one of the people wistfully hoping for a factual version Alexander delivered just that - Often outside of the comfort zone factual but nevertheless an amazing movie the performances from the cast, Angelina Jolie in particular was outstanding perfectly believable despite the earlier scoffing over the believability of playing A's mother ,Jared Leto and Colin Farrell created in my mind what I thought an intense love story or as touted in the reviews ""companionship"" although there were several moments in the theater the audience dissolved into giggles ( the wedding night scene with the naked animal faces being the main culprit) it was a thoroughly enjoyable movie Not the slash and burn action sequence epic of troy but the emotion tugging drama which stays with you far longer than the vivid scene of Brad Pitt In his toned buffness my rating 6.7 /10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Alexander was Great, but this movie wasn't","Hmmm, where to start...Let me start at the ending. Anthony Hopkins finishing monologue was enjoyable and quite moving. He's just damn good at grabbing your attention, despite everything else. The music after that (and throughout the entire movie) was not grand which one might have expected, but rather pompous and therefore just plain 'big and loud'.Alexander's role (the older one), by Colin Farrell, was performed just about 'ok'. Some nice scenes here and there in the (long) movie, but overall, I must confess that during the battle (again, overly dramatic and pompous) where he is critically wounded, I simply couldn't care less what was going to happen to him. Not caring one bit is just about the worst thing that can happen to an audience, hence the low rating. It's not just that half scared, half surprised expression at strange moment that Colin's tries to share with you, it's the entire package of his lines, the scene cuts and several dialogues that somehow just don't seem to work very well.Annoyances: the bloody Scottish accent (what a completely daft decision that was!), the many time shifts going back and forth several years, the music in general and some of the makeup on the wounded men that was just too much and 'arranged in an esthetically pleasing way like a bouquet of flowers' for a 'convincing picture'... not! There are some moment where you can feel the movie could have been something rather grand, epic and moving, but overall, it just seems to hobble along for 167 minutes, with a surprisingly high number of moments where you go 'wait a sec, no way...'. All in all, rather mediocre.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
Worth Seeing,"This was not a bad movie, regardless of what you have read. On the other hand, it was not a great movie either. There was a lot more to Alexander than battles. I wish Stone had spent more time on showing the side of Alexander that really made him Great, the ability to make peace with those he conquered. To anyone who has read a great deal about him, they realize that Alexander was not a barbarian but more of an idealist about how things should be. I will avoid the entire bi/gay issue. My only comment is that if Stone had really played it the way most historians believe, he would not have been able to get major stars and distribution.My final comment is to do some reading about Alexander and then see the movie and appreciate it for what Stone did well.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Don't let the defenders fool you,"Don't let the defenders fool you. This movie is atrocious and it has absolutely nothing to do with Alexander's sexuality. His sexuality (questioned by many critics, I happen to believe he was homosexual) is one of the very few things about this movie which is well-written.The battle scenes are few and far between. The scenes we do get (Gaugamela and India) are haphazardly put together at best. The rest of the film seems to rest on the bizarre concept that Alexander is only conquering the world to escape his mother.Angelina Jolie (and why is she cast as Olympias??), normally the bright spot in any film, doesn't help the picture. She has been given the direction to use some sort of anachronistic ""Transylvanian"" accent that would do better in a Hammer Dracula movie than in this piece.Val Kilmer looks as if he wants to leave the film as soon as possible and the only real genuine emotion I felt during the film was pity for him.The blonde wigged Colin Farrell is far worse. He seems to jump back and forth from a caricature to an absurdity with great ease and lightning speed.Even Anthony Hopkins could not save this film.I give it a 3 because, after studying ancient history for most of my life, the computer generated scenes of Alexandria and Babylon are one of the few joys to be had in this film.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Ironically, despite advertising homosexuality this movie remains narrowminded","Oliver Stone said that he didn't intend to do a movie for the masses. Well, at least the popular names he intended to cast (Connery, Crowe, Cruise, Neeson, Pitt) beg to differ and the presence of Hopkins certainly refutes him.On the other hand he delivered such a confused, chaotic and slo-o-ow movie that even patient and informed viewers have hard time to follow, let alone ""the masses"", so he has a point, kind of.The only good thing I can say about the piece is that it's fairest to history than any other Hollywood history product to date. Which isn't much since all other were blatant falsifications. At least they are not making stuff up (a lot). But they're omitting or casting aside crucial parts of the story. That's certainly no way to accomplish an ambitious task of bringing Alexander closer to a modern movie-goer.The movie falls flat at its basics - the approach to the person of Alexander. Instead of presenting us qualities that made Alexander great, Stone opted for ""debunking"" the legend (like he tried to debunk lone-gunman theory). He went for an unoriginal, generic view on him as a frustrated, troubled tyrant. That translates to a formulaic ""common man overwhelmed by events"". Stone believes that Alexander's greatness is some sort of an ancient PR, or even conspiracy. He narrowmindedly misses the big picture, because despite his flaws, Alexander had to have certain ""something"" that made him the greatest conquerer in history. Ordinary tyrants weren't loved by the army, didn't conquer so much space in ten years and weren't welcomed and remembered as liberators in the cities they occupied as Alexander was. Almost everything he did was presented in the movie either as something he was forced into or something that just happened to him. Wrong!Stone didn't get it, he couldn't present it and Colin Farrell certainly didn't help. But they surely trumpeted homoerotic relationships like they were such a big deal at the time. Wrong again! Good movie on Alexander is yet to be made. Maybe by that time they'll even have the guts to make actors speak in Greek.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Boring Soap-Opera with an Awful Screenplay,"Having names such Oliver Stone, Anthony Hopkins, Colin Farrell, Val Kilmer, Angelina Jolie, Christopher Plummer and Rosario Dawson in the cast; a great theme; and a huge budget, I could never expect that ""Alexander"" could be a boring movie. However, the screenplay is simply awful, showing a long and very confused story that looks like a soap-opera, with many stupid lines. The characters and situations are not well developed, and the viewer is frequently surprised with actions or reactions without any previous explanations. The fight scenes are ridiculously choreographed, being a bloody and messy collection of blurred short images. The camera uses close-up most of the times and countless number of cuts. Angelina Jolie speaks with a ridiculous accent and I do not know what the intention of such behavior is. The free exploitation of gays and homosexual situations shows clearly the intention of raising a polemic theme to get the spots of the media and call the attention of the public in general.

A remarkable film captures the madness and genius of its visionary hero.,"Alexander is a remarkable film. It's sprawling, ungainly, and way too long. Yet not long enough, either. It should have been a mini series. Oliver Stone had to leave a lot of material out, and his strategy of cutting back and forth in time was sometimes confusing. But he conveyed the most enduring and important legacy of Alexander the Great: his vision of a united, multi-ethnic world empire, dominated by Greek principles but inclusive of indigenous cultural values. Alexander really was the first conqueror/leader to pursue such a vision, rather than merely trying to impose his culture on other peoples. It was an impossible vision to achieve, in part because of nationalistic prejudices and in part because Alexander himself was torn between genius and madness. This is what the movie captures astonishingly well, along with the rich visual tapestry of ancient life and the terrifying battle scenes. The film is quite accurate concerning the psychological dynamics of Alexander's relationship with his parents (and the parents' with each other). Too many movies, especially ""action movies,"" overlook the role of the parent-child relationship in the formation of character. I also applaud Stone's attempt to be true to Alexander's sexual relationships with his comrade Hephaistion and his eunuch Bagoas, though the film should have made that element more explicit. Viewers who liked this film might want to check out historical novelist Mary Renault's books about Alexander, FIRE FROM HEAVEN and THE PERSIAN BOY.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Oliver Stone should be imprisoned for creating this film...,"On one hand you can have a film like Troy. On the other hand, you can produce one of the worst films in history and call it ""Alexander""... The only thing worse than making a really bad film, is making a really bad film that lasts three hours...To be honest, it isn't the fault of the actors. However, the script is patchy and the plot jumps over vast, and important, aspects of the life of Alexander. It appears that the film attempts to make up for this with battle scenes that drag on forever and really aren't that interesting; the time would be better spent giving the viewer a more informative picture of who Alexander really was. And the portrayal of the main character was incredibly weak. It isn't an issue to show his homosexual tendencies, but in general Alexander is portrayed as something of a weakling. I highly doubt that someone as weak and soft as the character portrayed in this film could have conquered the known world.Otherwise, watch out for the (countless) moments when you'll simply want to throw up because the film is so bad...",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Stunning Achievement,"It troubles me that at this late date in history, our ""leaders"" have so effectively marginalized homosexuals that people feel comfortable writing so spitefully on this comments board.

Oliver the Unforgivable,"One hundred and fifty million dollars? Check. Notable cast? Check. Well-loved hero? Check. No wonder Warner Bros thought they were sitting on a sure thing with Oliver Stone's Alexander, what famous director could go wrong with that material? Had the crew at Warner Bros actually watched Natural Born Killers then there would have been less tragic premature celebrations and more MAYDAY MAYDAY ABORT FILM! WE HAVE A TURKEY ON THE 2004 SCANNERS!This film is reportedly the film of Stone's career. He stated himself during pre-production that it had been his lifelong obsession to depict Alexander the Great cinematic ally. The obsession shines through as the film suffers from trying to capture too big a story into three hours. The plot is disjointed and poorly paced, the chunks of plot that we see are awkward and without clear motivation. These two are the only real flaws of the film, but they add up in so many areas that they effect all aspects of the film. Otherwise, the bulk of the film -which is centered around Alexander (Colin Farrell) conquering the barbarians- is enjoyable simply because of the extraordinary production value. It had realistic and convincing battles, costuming and sets.However, I cannot see past the inclusion of the sequence of terrible narration scenes centered around an older Ptolemy (Hopkins). Older Ptolemy prances around in a courtyard full of earthly delights, recounting tales of his life fighting for Alexander and offering his views on what made Alexander the Great an icon of human triumph. These scenes are hammy and awkward; they are so artistically contrary to the constructed reality present in the bulk of the film that they are almost unbearable to watch. Stone couldn't think of a better way to express time passing and events happening than an old fart flouncing around a ridiculous set explaining what's going on from 30 years later. Logically, I can understand that it serves to link together the disjointed plot, but it takes deus-ex-machina to a horrible extreme; Ptolemy is so obviously a plot device rather than a constructed character that the scenes simply amplify Stone's poor vision and style. That Stone included these scenes is unforgivable; they embody a real nadir of film-making.Whilst Stone has been financially punished in the poor box office performance of Alexander, a lot of the influential reviews attack the film for petty uneducated reasons. The lazy pop media critics took the negative reviews of more educated reviewers and amplified the scathing comments to create a distorted persona of Alexander in the world press. No doubt you've heard media associated with the film with key phrases such as 'bad blonde dye job' and 'Alexander the Gay'. These comments are misleading; the screenplay of Alexander is frankly disturbing, and calls for more contempt and attention than the trivial subject of Alexander's hair and sexuality.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Very Disappointing,"It's such a gay movie. They didn't give justice to the role of Alexander the Great! Greek Homosexuality in the olden times was a reality but they kept rubbing-it-in. Each scene had to depict men kissing and splitting or male genitals showing. A waste of time and money. Troy or Kingdom of Heaven was a far more impressing film than this. The fight scenes were good but the strength of the main character wasn't shown in Alexander. The facial expressions of Alexander never commanded authority and confidence. It is full of self-pity, remorse and pain. In general, i found this movie a flop and something not worth seeing.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Some people just don't get it,"OK here is my review and also a few words on other peoples review of this film. I wouldn't class this film as an Action movie such as Gladiator or Braveheart, this is very different from them. OK it has Action sequences which are important when depicting a story of a man who won battles for a living. This film presents Alexander as more than a two dimensional character who is bloodthirsty and who is seeking revenge for something or the other. If this film was like that then it would be the same as all the other films of this genre. The film is more like a historic review of ancient times and how that society differs from that of today. The Bisexual issue comes up a lot and upsets a few people. In today's society people are led to believe that people with Gay tendencies are soft or melancholic. This is something that society has produced as a means to devalue someone if they don't fit into the norm. In past times these issues were not as important as they are today. The film actually shows zero sexual encounters involving two men. It instead depicts a different type of love, admiration or adulation that two men could enjoy in the past without society's rules condemning them.People complain that Alexander is indecisive or tearful and this again deviates from the notion we have that all great leaders are Gun ho and emotionless. Maybe the reason that Alexander was a great leader was his cautious and thoughtful approach, but of course that is far to hard for action movie fans to stomach.Also a few people are confused about his Macedonian origin, this has nothing to do with the modern Macedonia we know from the old Yugoslav republic.I don't know the exact details of Greek history as some people do I only know bits from school and documentaries but I believe the film depicts the events reasonably, far better than other films in the past.As for the rest:- Storyline - This is where people will find the most flaws as the film is more of a biopic of a man rather than a man involved in a Story that has a beginning, middle and end. Acting - Fine some parts can be wooden and others can be emphatic depends on the dialogue, Pace - for some people this film may be a bit slow, others will enjoy the history lesson and feel glad that they have actually learnt something new, Sets and Location - Brilliant its always good to see places that we can never see today even if its on a screen. Overrall - 7 Its not Breathtaking but it isn't a Bad film either. I might not watch it again but i'm glad I have seen it.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Alexander the Grate,"They took a thousand people into the desert for two years and had to justify the expense by putting together three hours of footage as a film. Unfortunately Stone used the wrong three hours. Somehow Petersen's Troy was watchable, and even brilliant in places. This was totally awful. Irishmen transplanted to Greece, with no explanation. Peroxide blond hero with dazed expression. Russian mother who is only two years older than himself. One eyed Dad whose motivation is impenetrable, and then who dies off screen. I gave up half way through the battle of Gaugamela. Despite Alex outlining his strategy using models at the beginning, it degenerated into the usual Braveheart / Gladiator style pell mell nonsense. The Macedonian phalanx was successful because of its discipline. Not for taking part in a chaotic mess. When will directors stop following Gibson's free for all style in battle scenes? It is just lazy and stupid. Alexander wouldn't have conquered the block around his own house if he had behaved like that. What came after this I don't know, as I decided not to waste any more time on this rubbish. Is this the same Stone who made JFK and Nixon ? Is he on crack nowadays ?",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Human behind the Legend.,"I went to see this movie last week after it came out. And I looked here for advice, even though most of the reviews didn't favor the movie I went to see it any way. Boy did I see something different then what they did. It was just a true story of a man, a leader of an Empire. It was all the things that I expected from it. There have always been major disputes over Alexander's intentions for what he did. I personally feel that this movie picked the true ones. He lived for the people; he gave himself for them, fighting side by side with them. Alexander was an inspiration for the people of a huge era.And for all of you out they're who say that his movie has nothing of a historical background I have this to say. This is taken from the World Book Encyclopedia. ""Alexander the Great (356-323 Bc) was the first world conqueror and one of the most remarkable men in history. He led his armies almost to the end of what was then the civilized world. Alexander was born in Pella, Macedonia, the son of Philip of Macedon, who was an excellent general. His mother Olympias, Princess of Eprius, she was brilliant and hot tempered. Alexander inherited the best qualities from both his parents. But he was even more ambitious then his father. Alexander's mother taught him that Achilles was his ancestor, and that his father was a descendant of Hercules. He also learned the Iliad, a story about the deeds of Achilles, which he carried with him everywhere he went. Achilles became Alexander's model in all things."" This is only a brief section about Alexander the Great. If you people would only pick up a history book every now and again maybe you would realize what you are actually seeing.Throughout the movie, which is meant to be biographical, you see Alexander in his life. There are exact quotes from his father such as, "" O my son, seek out a kingdom worthy of thyself, for Macedonia is too little for thee."" Also there is a close attention to detail, if you would notice during the night of his wedding, there was a dagger and a copy of the Iliad under his pillows. How can you sit there and bash a true piece of World History? It's not meant to be a movie about war scenes, how bloody does each side gets, it is a movie about a man. Who are you to dare a legacy that will live last past your own lifetime?The movie has amazing visuals, worthy of the Sun God. The acting was well done other then a few overacted and lengthy sections. The battle scenes were worthy of praise. Overall I would have to say that this is one of the best historical movies that I have seen in a very long time.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Indian Battle Elephants and then some,"I read the reviews saying how this was a bad movie, in fact I was surprised to see that so many critics were against it. How could a movie like this fail in so many eyes? If movies like Gladiator could do Good, why couldn't this?I watched Alexander myself, wondering if what I was about to watch was going to be as bad as everyone said it would be. And, after what I saw, I have to say that most people were WRONG! Alexander is one of the better movies this year. I was more surprised by what I saw in terms of Colin Farrell playing his role well, an interesting plot, realistic battle scenes(being Indian, I loved seeing the war elephants!!!) as well as the soundtrack which seemed to fit.There were some problems so I can't say it is as good as other movies I have seen recently. Angelina Jolie simply did not belong in this movie. Her character was more bothersome and the scenes that flashed back to her broke the momentum of the plot. If there was one downside to this movie, it was her.Many have complained about the bisexual themes in the movie. I think Stone held back, he could have done much more with the idea, and I think he should of for historical value. I understand why he did not, so perhaps it was good he didn't. Stone should be praised for allowing such a trait in his character though, especially since it is historical.I would say see this movie and ignore what people are saying.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Ocscar worthy,"Oliver Stone's attempt to give a realistic rendering of Alexander the Great's life necessitated a realistic rendering of his times as well, and the fact is, things were different then. Both death and sex were considered merely parts of everyday existence, unencumbered by modern Christian-dominated civilization's moral considerations. (This was brought home to me personally when I saw the paintings on the walls of homes in Pompeii. By modern standards, the images were pornographic, containing scenes both bisexual and heterosexual, yet they adorned the main living areas of the finest houses. Clearly those people had no more consideratins about sexuality than farming or hunting. It was just another aspect of being alive.) The Greeks of the 4th century BC apparently felt the same way, and Alexander was simply a product of his times in this regard, no more or less. That he was bisexual is incidental. Who he connected with, and why, is far more signifigant in the telling of his tale, and to my mind Stone did an excellent job of separating the important from the unimportant here. Of course, the on-screen violence was graphic, as befitted the violent nature of those times, and there was simply too much of it in Alexander's life to show it all, but I think Stone put a human face on a larger than life persona in an admirable way and successfully avoided many of the excesses a film of this magnitude would easily be prone to. ""Alexander"" is the height of artistic direction in my view.",,Anonymous,Biography
Why he failed to conquer...,"After reading several reviews, I think Stone's biggest problem, is the fact, he used a real person, rather than say Maximus of Gladiator (he could have been ""Bi"" with little or no controversy). 2) The places & facts, (sometimes in dispute or the simple fact, everything he did, wasn't included!), would not been factors. 3) Many of the viewers, are unable to place themselves more than 2300 yrs. in the past & therefore, place current paradigms on this film (several writers complain of how women of ancient life were treated...well in truth... it was much worst than the movie shows.)So, for good or evil, not only will this likely be Stone's last big budget film, it will also scare off many producers from doing historical epics, as well. (I went to this, knowing it was getting killed by the critics, but I Really wanted to support historical films & biographies.) So, fans of mass junk, you may have conquered the Alex the Great, but in doing so, you have supported the non-National Treasures. (Thank God for The Incredibles, though!)PS: That being said, the accents, (such as Irish ones!), should not have been allowed in a high budget film, so I will lower my grade to a ""B+"" now.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Enjoyable film,"I went to see Alexander. with my husband, I am very interested in history, my husband,NOT.My preferred reading is something in History, Faction, but not Barbara Cartland's style . Though I do not like Colin Farrell. I thought that he made a very good Alexander, I know that they always juggle with history in films, but I thought that they could have filmed in a more straight forward way. Jumping years, skipping whole chunks of his life, made it confusing, The idea of the young Alexander speaking with the same accent was good and getting his looks the same. The elephant V's the horse scene was brilliant. And Angelina as his Mum was a good bit of casting. I go to see films to enjoy them...I do not go to see fluff. Going back to the old films i.e. Ben Hur, they were all so clean. plenty of blood and dirt in Alexander, and more realism.......History is not neat, tidy, or clean......",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Spoilproof Alert,"I must first say that there is NO way I could spoil this movie no matter what I might write about it. Oliver Stone spoiled it long before I ever got to see it. This is the only movie I've ever seen where afterward I felt cheated enough to ask for my money back. I got it, too.Where to begin? Alexander the Great was a conqueror, but we only get to see two of the many battles he fought. Gaugamela began promisingly, but then the overhead battle scenes were all filmed during a titanic dust storm so that it was impossible to tell who was fighting...or even if anyone was fighting. The closeup battle scenes appear to have been filmed by a shaky man with a camcorder bouncing on a pogo stick during an earthquake accompanied by a slightly less dense dust storm. The second battle scene had a jungle obscuring most of the activity and most of it was shot through a bad red filter anyway. We get a LOT more footage than that suggesting that Alexander was really, really, really gay.Take away the conquering, and what do you have left? Nothing worth the price of admission. They gave the actor playing Alexander (who spent most of the time with a deer-in-the-headlights stare) a hair dye job that looked like a pile of old straw on his head. Having done that, couldn't they have done something about his thick, black woolly-bear caterpillar eyebrows? Every time he was on camera my gaze was drawn irresistibly towards them.Early on in the film we are treated to a CGI image of the great harbor at Alexandria over the shoulder of Hannibal Lecter Ptolemy as he begins talking about Alexander to a scribe. In the harbor can be seen two ships under way, one under sail, the other under oars. After THREE PLUS HOURS of mixed no-action scenes and windy Ptolemaic narrative, we get to see the great harbor again. Both ships are still there. Neither has moved a cubit. This could be said to be symbolic of the whole movie. At what I thought was the end, Ptolemy advises the scribe who has been assiduously writing it all down to just throw all of the pages away. Would that the studio had done the same with the movie. The ONLY thing that could have made this turgid lump of celluloid enjoyable would have been to see it accompanied by Mike Nelson and the 'bots from MST3K. More than one person walked out before the film was over. I wonder if they wanted their money back also?",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
S10 Reviews: Alexander (2004),"Alexander the Great (Colin Farrell  Phone Booth) was a man of great passion. By the tender age of 25 this Macedonian king had conquerored 90% of all the known lands of that time. By the time he died (of mysterious causes) at age 33, Alexander had shaped the very destiny of the world and became immortal like the gods of Olympus.""Alexander"" is probably Oliver Stone's (Natural Born Killers / Platoon) most polished film. A bit flashy at times, it lacks a bit of the manic intensity that be brings to many of his projects. Is it a bad film? No. ""Alexander"" is an exceptionally photographed film (the DVD really shines) that is very compelling and well acted. The Vangelis score was wonderful and as I stated before the photography was simply gorgeous. Although a fine cast (Anthony Hopkins, Jared Leto, Christopher Plummer, Val Kilmer, etc.) Farrell seemed an odd choice for the part of Alexander but after awhile he seemed to come into his own. One does wonder if Stone could have done better for his lead. I must admit that although Miss Jolie looked stunning as ever, she too seemed out of place. My only real quibble with the film is that we only get to see two battles but the battles were immense with superb sound design. ""Alexander"" is much better than Warner's other2004 epic (Troy) but doesn't hold a candle to the ""Braveheart's"" and ""Gladiator's"" of yore.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Oliver twisted,"What evil happened to Ollie Stone? I can admit that re-constructing the history of a great leader such as Alexander is not that easy for a modern filmmaker. But Oliver Stone seemed to be very self-confident about this matter...and I trusted him. Well, the movie started with an awful snake exhibition. Plutach tells us that Olympias, mother of Alexander, was fond of snakes as she followed the Orphic doctrines. But this doesn't mean leading us into a zoo. Alexander, as a young prince, is weak and ridiculous. No wonder: he is surrounded by such horrible paintings that we can imagine his nights are obsessed by nightmares. As a matter of fact...he dreams of snakes, always. Please, if you want to give me an historical movie, save me psycho-history...I'd like better seeing Hithcock's PSYCHO instead. If you want to give me an entertaining movie, give me Troy back. Because Alexander is intolerably boring. Keep Hopkins and Plummer silent, please, and give me some interesting images. But the worst of all was the battle against Poros, with all that red...lysergic acid? I would save Jared Leto, who at least is not laughable, despite of his marked make up (why nobody told Stone that Greek homosexuals HATED make-up?). But from a global point of view, the movie is a complete fiasco.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Alexander the confused, lonely and boring","Fact: Alexander the great set out to conquer the world, and he did. When he found out the world was bigger than he first thought, he wanted to conquer that too. His Macedonian army literally followed him to the ends of the earth and beyond.I would not follow Colin Farrel's Alexander down the road to the pub for a couple of pints. Sure he had problems, sure he was gay....but that is not what defined him.He was a warrior who was at the front of the charge, not a king ordering from the back.This is where the movie fails. It misses the point. It doesn't convince you in any way that this person could have conquered the world and inspired the loyalty of his people for so long and over such treacherous terrain.There were Greek speaking cities in India 200 years ago and in middle east his name is remembered reverentially.Basically a waste of time. Worse yet, Oliver Stone obviously doesn't trust or understand CGI, so most of shots of war look outdated and fail to capture the real situation.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
Definitely more appreciated by those who have studied the man and the culture,"When my father and I sat down to see this movie, I told him that whenever I shook my fist at the screen, that would mean they were doing something historically inaccurate. See, I was expecting this movie to make a blunder just as bad as _Troy's_ leaving Agamemnon dead in Ilion. However, I was pleasantly surprised; I didn't need to shake my fist as often as I'd anticipated. I don't claim to be an expert on classical culture or on Alexander, but I can say as one who has studied his life and times that the movie did quite a good job portraying him.There were, of course, things I would change about the movie. The three biggest annoyances (for me) follow: 1. Olympias was not shown frolicking with a snake in bed (at least not by herself before Alexander was born). The mythology surrounding this part of Alexander's background -- which explains why the marriage between Olympias and Philip was strained -- could have led to a much more complex relationship between Olympias and Philip on screen. 2. The movie was chronologically fragmented. I'm not a student of cinema, just of the classics, so I don't know what the purpose in doing this was, but it was fairly annoying. 3. Alexander's _Braveheart_-like motivational speeches certainly didn't add as much to the movie as they probably should have. If it were me, I would focus on his military tactics -- for example, the impressive strategy in the Persian battle portrayed on screen -- instead of the ""glooooooory"" Farrell keeps yelling about.I won't pick on little things forever... I'll leave that to someone else. I will tell, however, the three things I liked most about the movie: 1. The ""grey area"" relationship between Alexander and Hephaistion was wonderfully portrayed. If you don't understand the way two ancient Greek men were able to love one another, I suggest you go back to college and re-take the courses in classics you obviously slept through. You'll appreciate your new found outlook on western culture. 2. The Macedonian phalanx... ah, great fun to watch. 3. Alexander's many motivations -- his character was obviously complex, and Farrell seemed to do a decent job with it. From the obsession with Homer's Iliad to the alcoholism, we as the audience are given enough credit not to have to watch a one-sided Alexander on screen, and I really appreciated that.No movie is ever perfect, and this one isn't either. Every director/producer/whatever is going to take dramatic license with a subject, and that was obviously done here with _Alexander_. The History Channel does a great 3-hour documentary on his life, so if that's what you're looking for, tune into cable. However, if you're looking for entertainment, and you're well-educated enough about ancient Greek culture and the life of Alexander to be able to appreciate what's going on instead of getting hung up on certain aspects of the story, I definitely recommend going to see this movie.",,Anonymous,Biography
Oliver delivers,"Oliver Stone makes films I love or hate. 'JFK' is one of my favorite films: it shines in spite of the presence of 'Cavein Causesnore' in a starring role. 'Nixon' was great, as was 'Wall Street.' And then there were 'Natural Born Smellers' and 'The Boors.' Now comes 'Alexander', a film that hadn't premiered before factions picked sides about the portrayal of the lead character's sexuality. Additionally, an early summer medieval spectacular (What was that film's name: Coy, Foy, Poi?) crashed and burned shortly after takeoff. Even with those challenges, I felt that Stone's film deserved a look. To me, 'Alexander' is a surprisingly good film albeit with jarring portrayal flaws. Anthony Hopkins gets the unenviable duty to narrate: his scenes play long and his elocution is so arch it's more Richard Burton than Hannibal Lector. Val Kilmer reminds us that he can overact any part to death. Angelina Jolie is 'Mother from hell,' an unsympathetic role she handles with aplomb. Inevitably, the film rests on Colin Farrell's shoulders and Farrell delivers an unexpectedly human conqueror, a believable, sympathetic man; he is a man more at ease gathering nations under his wing than ensuring that he produce an heir for his kingdom. He accepts innumerable pleasures from exotic people without veering into loutish hedonism. The film never loses sight of this conqueror's most telling trait: he saved his trust and love for the one person he had known and loved since childhood. Alas, this film will vanish to make room studio-conceived blockbusters, perhaps 'Friday the Thirteenth, part 207' or, 'Surviving Easter.'",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
flawed,"I don't really know what to make of this film. But I do know one thing, it's far better than Troy (Bloody waste of time that was!)Oliver Stone(d) brings us a film that marches on that fine line that divides excess from pure camp, and it occasionally slips with 'unwanted' comedic effects as a result. But otherwise I have nothing particularly bad to say about this film. it's not Oliver's best, but it's far from his worst.The cast does a pretty good job (too bad their performances are choked by that annoying Vangelis score that only works when he brings out the percussionists) and the visuals are at times spectacular.I'd give it a 7 out of 10 ... and I am very curious as to what Baz Luhrman is going to do with the 'bisexual' tone of the film.ciao Stephen",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Laughably, unspeakably awful.","This film should be used as an example of how NOT to produce a film. Everything about it is hideous in the extreme - the grating Irish accents in ancient Macedonia, the unending awful, babbling dialogue, particularly from Alexander's mother and Alexander himself - one tooth-grindingly terrible speech to Hepheisteion springs to mind. The music often sounds cheesy and grating in the extreme, the lack of structure of the film - the constant shuffling between Alexander's current campaign and scenes with his mother and father, with no apparent reason or need to do so (I watched the Director's cut). The casting! Angelina Jolie, no matter how beautiful she undoubtedly is, is never at all convincing as Colin Farrell's mother, Val Kilmer's wildly over-acted turn as Phillip, Alexander's father. I could go on, but I may get too irate and end up smashing my keyboard... The first battle scene wasn't too bad though, it was just when they opened their mouths.......",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Lips and Nostrils,"""Alexander"" is a decent movie that does indeed suffer from a few flaws. As much as I love Anthony Hopkins, we could have done without that whole scenario. That left-handed guy transcribing his every word:cutting room floor material, Mr. Stone. A lot of scars in this movie. When the movie was over, I went to the restroom, caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror, and thought, ""hey good-lookin'."" A lot of one-eyed fellas in this flick. I do think that Colin Farell's nostrils should receive some sort of recognition from the Academy. Maybe his left nostril could be nominated for best supporting nostril, or his right one, or vice versa. They both seemed to play off of each other quite well. The same goes for Ms. Jolie's lips, which reached new levels of depth. But, when all was said and done, I left the theater entertained. Will I remember this movie three days from now? Of course not. Will I try to think before I flare? You betcha.'",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Disappointment Literally of Epic Proportions,"I really don't know where to begin to discuss what went wrong with this movie. Going into it, you would presume ""Alexander"" was in good hands with Oliver Stone and a sterling ensemble of performers. Before it hit theaters in 2004, the hype surrounding the premise was so overrated it was rumored to be a potential Oscar contender. After my first viewing, I could not comprehend the negative reception; all I came for was some history lesson and battle scenes. I certainly grew wiser about movies over the years since then so I decided to give it another go. Now, I have come to the conclusion ""Alexander"" is a bloated, lost mess even if superficially striking.The history of Alexander the Great needs no extensive introduction for his legacy and impact of world conquest lasts to this very day. As I am typing this review, US military forces in Afghanistan look at the same mountains and landscape the young ruler beheld in his life. Because of Alexander, Greek culture reached as far as Persia to India and fostered the beginning of a Hellenistic civilization. The film is a biopic of Alexander (played by Colin Farrell) and his campaigns but I'm befuddled how Stone does not go into depth the effect the man had made in history. Instead he studies Alexander's personal life, something I'm not against. However, I would like films about historical leaders to touch base on the achievements of an individual, the contributions to whatever society is at stake. That being said, this film mentions the influence of Alexander scarcely.To further elaborate on the protagonist, his intentions and motivations to conquer the known world become vague. At the start, Alexander justifies the Persian conquest as retribution; as he presses onward, he mentions freeing the people he encounters along his journeys. Then the objective becomes more idealistic and set upon glory. There was a point I wondered whether his mother Olympias (played by Angelina Jolie) served as a manipulator for Alexander's journey. The case I'm trying to make is Alexander never gives a clear, concise goal to accomplish and it only makes the audience feel isolated from the story.One of the more sensitive topics Stone brings up is the alleged bisexuality of Alexander the Great. The implication of the king having an intimate relationship with his best friend Hephaistion (played by Jared Leto) does not bother me; my concern is towards the point of making his sexuality a recurrent topic. Is it a conflict the king struggles with? No, not really. Even when he marries a bride, the subject of his affections is hardly examined; it doesnâ(TM)t warrant having a place in the plot. If a movie continues to remind us of a protagonist's sexuality, it ought to have a significant part.The performers are given a script with lines akin to a re-election campaign speech of President Obama. Elegant wording yet you've heard it all before, yearning for something new. Remember this is Oliver Stone who has penned fantastic screenplays from ""Midnight Express"" to ""Scarface"" to ""Platoon"". As for the performances themselves, it is a disaster listening to respected actors use varying accents from Colin Farrell's authentic Irish to Angelina Jolie's faux Russian. Jolie has the weirdest role of the cast as the snake fetish mother of Alexander whom she gives the impression of having an Oedipus relationship with. Accents aside, the speeches, monologues, and dialogues are either dull as Anthony Hopkins' narration or plain atrocious as Farrell's ""Braveheart"" address to his troops.Apart from all the faults, ""Alexander"" is, on its surface, pretty. The costumes and set pieces are appropriately exotic in Babylon while the battles fought are both kinetic and brutal. The Indian fight wages men on horses against opponents riding war-equipped elephants, then unknown to the Macedonians. Impaling, hacking, dismemberment, and stomping do not hesitate in this particular battle. While these bloody feuds won't be revered or remembered like the clashes in ""Gladiator"" or ""Lord of the Rings"", they will not disappoint the ardent admirers of warfare.If ""Alexander"" wasn't the worst movie of 2004, it was the most over-hyped one. Since then, it has undergone different cuts for the home release. I found the movie more disappointing than embarrassing to watch given the credentials of the people on board. The lesson of this review is simple: never prejudge a movie by its credits. Alexander the Great will always be remembered, Oliver Stone's ""Alexander""? Not so much.My Rating: 3/10",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
Farrell not that great in this and the plot was too big...,"even for a three hour film. The story of Alexander the Great is an interesting one, but Stone begins when he is a young child and tries to fit all he can in 3 hours. I thought it made the film too broad and hard to follow in places since there are quite a few flashbacks. It would have been better, if the story had been narrowed. Maybe begin just as Alexander was named King and then follow him as he conquered the East.One question I have after seeing this was did every man in 320 BC wear eyeliner? Was eyeliner even invented then? And Jolie is as hot as ever but was it possible for a woman to have flawless makeup at this time? I was also disappointed with the battle scenes. They were too choppy and not that great. The battles in Gladiator were much better. The blood was flying everywhere, but you just couldn't tell much about what was going on.And the acting was not very good by anyone. I thought Farrell was pretty bad and I've liked him most of the movies he has done. And why did Jolie even bother with an accent. And she was the only one who tried to have an accent. We know they didn't speak English at this time, so why bother with fake accents.FINAL VERDICT: The story of Alexander that Stone wanted to tell would have been better if it was a 10 hour mini series on the history channel. He tries to tell to much in 3 hours, which makes the film seem disjointed with a lack of a central story. I don't think it was as good as Troy, and that wasn't that great either, so I don't recommend this one.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Sadness because of Bad Reviews,"I'm quite saddened to see the negative reviews that surround this film. I am not a history buff, but I have read much on Alexander's life and this movie is not for the uneducated. Oliver Stone employs so much craft to create subtle moments that those who know of Alexander's life would understand. The transitions are fast, yes, but not impossible to follow. If anything, I'd think they'd inspire the audience to figure out more about Alexander and to use their brains and investigate into his life. This is not a movie that spells it out for you--the audience must be an active part and Oliver Stone expects his audience to come prepared. Even if you don't know anything about Alexander, there's no reason not to learn. It's not so confusing that you can't figure it out-just be alert and ready to take part in it. Not your cup of tea? Don't know anything about Alexander? Then don't go see it. But don't attack the film for asking you to use your minds.I've heard a lot of negative comments about the historical accuracy. Again, I don't know a lot, but the fact of the matter is that any time reality is placed down on paper (as a story, a script, a song), it will be changed from that reality. There is no way you can tell a story without changing it from the exact truth. Events are interpreted different ways for each person, moments in time are held at different levels of importance. Was this Oliver Stone's take on Alexander's life? Yes, indeed it was. But since when did artistic expression have to bend to the will of others? Since when did he have to create a movie that followed his vision in order to please you? Yes, Alexander is a historical figure, but he lived so long ago that every account we have of him has been changed by the person who wrote it down. That's why there are so many different opinions of him--because none of us really know for sure. This is Oliver Stone's opinion of what took place. You don't have to like it, but respect it as being different.Oliver Stone clearly loves and wishes to cherish the memory of Alexander, as does everyone working on the film. There is so much emotion and love poured into the scenes-Colin Feral himself speaks of how much he loves this movie. This is not a big blockbuster gunning for your money; this is an epic film that presents it take on a life to the best of its ability. The battle scenes are confusing, yes. But battles are confusing-there's no order in such a mêlée. Time jumps around sometimes, yes, but don't we all reminisce about things in our pasts? Thousands of movies have employed such jumps.Likewise, the homosexuality issue is part of a huge debate. I'm not going into it, because there have been arguments over it since the movie was announced. I would have loved to see Alexander and Hephaistion kiss, but I don't believe Oliver Stone avoided the issue. He wanted to portray their relationship as the purest and deepest love, which is so easily confused with sex. Also, considering the uproar that has happened from what is actually in the film, what would have happened if they had kiss? The reviews and feedback would be only about the homosexuality represented. Nothing else would be focused on, and that wouldn't be fair to the film. The film wasn't about Alexander's sexuality, it was about Alexander. For our sadly homophobic society, one kiss would have made it solely about that issue.I believe Oliver Stone followed his heart with this film, as did everyone who was a part of it. Money is never wasted on the arts or on someone's artistic vision. I loved this movie, for all that the Irish Accents were amusing and for all that the dialogue could be sometimes dramatic. It's different than how I ever thought of Alexander and his life, but I accept Oliver Stone's take on it, because it's his movie. I respect it and love it, because it is homage to a great man. We should be grateful for the fact that so much love and emotion and heart are still being put into movies, instead of damning it for being different. If you like Alexander, see this movie. See it with an open mind. Hell, don't listen to any reviews. If you've seen the trailer and you want to see it, then see it, no matter what anyone says (myself included). The worst that can happen is that you won't like it, won't like Oliver Stone anymore and will have spent 3 hours watching a movie you didn't like. I think we've all had that experience. But see it anyways if you even had a tiny desire to do so, because in the end, you deserve the right to formulate your own opinions.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Pro's and con's,"Alexander the Great is perhaps one of the most well-known historical figures. His life has been recorded in detail by so many historians, and his exploits legendary. Considered divine during his lifetime, conquering a vast territory unrivaled until the Roman Empire...living a life reckless life...dying under mysterious circumstances -- a larger than life character.Sounds like it would make a really epic movie, don't it? A perfect addition to the line of big-budget epics so prevalent in the early 2000s. Filmed in locations spanning three continents, featuring a cast that includes Anthony Hopkins and Christopher Plummer, costing over $155 million to make, and with the acclaimed director of ""JFK"" and ""Platoon"" -- it seemed like this would be the perfect film, a return to the glory of films like ""Ben-Hur.""And yet it was a critical and commercial failure upon release.What went wrong?One problem is perhaps the use of accents. They range from the Irish/Scottish accents of Colin Farrell and other actors playing Macedonians to the most lambasted of all -- the pseudo-Eastern European accent of Angelina Jolie. I understand that this is a technique by Oliver Stone to distinguish each culture. The problem is, it can be quite distracting. The accents perhaps aren't TOO bad as to ruin the whole movie, and can be ignored.Then there's the narration. Now, Anthony Hopkins is an excellent actor, and he is superb as an elderly Ptolemy narrating events from Alexander's life. His voice can be heard in this film a lot. However, ***perhaps too much***. There are some scenes where the narration is just not necessary or would be more effective without it. The old saying is, ""Show...don't tell."" This is a drama, not a documentary.Another problem is the way Alexander's story is told. It does resemble a cliché melodrama, from the gay romance between Alexander and Hephaestion to the soap-opera family relationship between Alexander, his parents -- these should have been handled more carefully. A primary antagonist would have helped. Some characters are worth expanding upon (Darius, Roxanne). I personally didn't feel for any of the characters in this film -- whether to root for them or not.And this brings us to another major problem in the film -- the portrayal of the main character, Alexander himself.This film does attempt to make him into an complex, three-dimensional character. One can admire the filmmakers for doing that. Here, he is portrayed as an idealist, seeking to unite all the peoples and cultures of the world under a reign of tolerance and diversity. In the scene where he conquers Babylon, Alexander benevolently shows mercy to Darius' daughter (""that's how you'll be treated - a princess""). He is actually likable in that scene.However, in trying to portray Alexander as complex, the filmmakers do go overboard with the soap-opera aspects. Alexander does seem like a wuss in some scenes. When he's criticized by one of his men, he goes into a temper tantrum (""Arrest him! Arrest him!""). Surely, a person of Alexander's reputation and esteem would sound more intimidating and commanding, not whiny. Such whininess reaches its peak during the death of Hephaestion scene. Alexander resembles a modern-day drama queen or emo kid.Based on what historians say about the real Alexander, this movie counterpart should have been portrayed more as a modern-day jock. There should have should more scenes that show just what made him Alexander the GREAT.These are what are perhaps the major flaws of ""Alexander"". But flaws aside, there is much to love (okay, LIKE) about this movie.The actors are generally good, even Angelina (never mind the accent). It was nice to see Christopher Plummer as Aristole. And even Colin Farrell himself is actually decent. He may not be Oscar-material like some of the older actors, and he may not be the best choice to play Alexander, but he is adequate enough in the lead role (never mind the blonde wig).There is some nice scenery in this film, like the majestic deserts of Asia lush jungles of India (actually, Thailand posing as India). The sets are nice, too. While the buildings in the Babylon scenes are clearly GCI and do look superficial, this movie has some excellent sets. The interiors of the Macedonian and Alexandrian palaces are beautiful, and the wall painting and mosaics are accurate. The sets and buildings in the Bactria and India, with their brown, earth walls and pillars, invoke the feel of that time and place.The costumes are also nice, and they seem authentic. The armor, helmets, and equipment of Macedian/Greek and Persian soldiers during the Gaugamela Battle are elaborate and colorful. This movie shows many cultures, from the Macedonians, Greeks, Persians, etc., and numerous customs from these cultures -- from the dance of Alexander's future wife Roxanne and their wedding scene, the viewer is truly transported into a different time and place.The battle scenes are very intense and pulse-pounding. Never mind that there are only TWO battle scenes, compared to the many battles fought by the real Alexander. The first battle depicted in this film, in Gaugamela, is very chaotic and confusing, and it has nice aerial shots. The battle in India is just as chaotic (even if the final confrontation between Alexander and the elephant may be bizarre and ridiculous).There's also the score by Vangelis, which (despite maybe sounding a little formulatic) does sound nice.In all, I was surprised to find out that I actually enjoyed ""Alexander"". Obviously, this is a flawed. Then again, it's not absolute trash either.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Don't Waist You Time,"This was one of the worst made movies I have ever seen. This is not a spoiler, but I must explain how the movie flows. First you start off with a date like 320 BC and then it jumps to 7 years in the future, then back to a date 322 BC, then 5 years ago, then it will say India, but your not sure what time in India but Alexander looks older. This goes on throughout the whole movie. The director could not find a method to put this movie together.Also, they really didn't explain how Alexander became so powerful. In one scene he is fighting a great battle and they were loosing. Then the next scene they role up and have concurred the land of the people they were loosing to without any explanation.Lastly, I watch a movie to be entertained not bored. If I wanted a history lesson, I would have read a book or watched the Discovery channel. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Nice cinematography - problem screenplay,"I appreciate the passion in the review of 'gest1969'. I've felt the same way about certain 'problem' movies. Yes, Stone's cinematography was spectacular.. and there's a lot of historical ground to cover. But the script just wasn't right. It's an old problem with movies of all sorts, but, surprisingly, all too common with big budget productions.There have been documentaries with or without re-creations recently (i.e. the History Channel production 'The True Story of Alexander the Great', and a fantastic British re-telling: 'In the Footsteps of Alexander the Great', both of which I recommend.) So, what went wrong?Stone's screenplay continually 'regresses' - the flashbacks are too numerous and lengthy. Maybe it was more of an 'editing' problem (the Director's cut DVD had no 'deleted' scenes) than a script issue? When you watch the 'deleted' portions in a typical DVD, you see some not-so-bad scenes that were, nevertheless, chopped, for the sake of pace or continuity. What did Stone cut from this one?Jolie and Kilmer are big names, but their roles in this flick were of a 'supportive' nature. yet, we continually re-visit them for repetitious information of limited value. Farrell (Alexander) looked confused. It became tedious. I had my hand of the FF button throughout the 2nd half. Anytime after his entry into Babylon, I was ready to pack it in. (well, I stuck around for the battle sequence against elephants.. decided that life as a Greek soldier wouldn't have suited me).For those who still disagree, try watching the other 'Alexander' productions (there's a ton of 'Alex' movies made in Asia, if you can get your hands on them, and at least one older Hollywood - 1960's?).Finally, there is 'gory' stuff (well, what do you expect in a battle for the world?) and some needless sexual content... not for kiddies.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Battle fatigue after three hours of heavy conflict...,"Alexander is an ambitious project, whatever one may think of its shortcomings. The script has a hard time pinpointing what makes the great man tick--and it's certainly muddled when it comes to all the conspiracy theories surrounding his youth and manhood. His mother is played by Angelina Jolie as a conniving temptress with an uncanny control over snakes--a control she has over him as well, urging him to become the great leader in battles.Colin Farrell does the best he can with the florid dialog, full of pomposity and Shakespearean grandeur, but it's not a part that he really embodies with any great conviction. He does a workmanlike job but never really becomes the character. Nor is his relationship with his lover (Jared Leto) ever given more of a hint than intense glances can convey, as if Oliver Stone was reluctant to let the homophobic aspects of Alexander's life interfere with the storytelling.The battle scenes are realistic but fatiguing after awhile, following the accepted strategy of other action films by interspersing fierce battles with the quieter moments--but never too quiet since most of the dialog consists of arguments between Alexander and his army of dedicated fighters.Val Killmer gives a vigorous performance as his father Michael, almost unrecognizable in his one-eyed make-up and red beard. Anthony Hopkins serves as a one man Greek chorus, narrating the tale in the manner of a bad DVD commentary. Christopher Plummer does a nice job as Aristotle, teaching the Greek youths about their mission in life.On the plus side, the background score by Vangelis is strikingly effective, as is Rodrigo Prieto's gorgeous cinematography. The look of the film is one of its strongest assets with authentic detail in costumes and settings. But the script is a yawner, going back and forth in time to fill in gaps that were intended to fill the viewer in on some missing points. It's a technique that tries the patience several times throughout the lengthy running time.This should find favor with a very limited audience of history buffs.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Shame on Oliver Stone!,"Shame on you Oliver Stone! This is the worst movie I have ever seen.The film fails completely to engage the audience. It's so bad in fact that your ""suspension of disbelieve"" never kicks in. I found myself struggling, squirming in my seat at the bad dialogue, the deplorable acting, the soundtrack that would often drown out the actors...I could go on and on and on. My suggestion is don't even waste your money or your time on the DVD.I sat tonight through a special screening of this film and many people got up and walked out. The industry people standing at the back of the theatre werefrantically asking people why they were leaving, suggesting to them that it must just be too long? Yes, 3 hours too long. Start to finish, a disaster.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Deserved Better Fate/Reviews but...,"I waited for the DVD to come out because of the overwhelmingly bad reviews - the reviews disappointed me so much that I just didn't want to think about the film. Of course, its always a mistake not to see a film on this scale in a theatre and I will never make that mistake again. I liked the film very much - loved the way that Stone mostly followed Lane's account, loved the presentation of Babylon but I did have the following problems: 1. Structure was a mess should have simply opened with Phillip's assassination. 2. Way too much Angelina Jolie. I didn't think that possible but man, that bad accent - didn't it seem like some kind of Russian, Boris and Natacha accent? 3. My biggest problem is that we never, ever get a real sense why Alexander was followed and is called Alexander the Great. Stone should have included his being made a god in Egypt and found a way to get in the idea that he might have even inspired Christianity. The couple of speeches in front of the troops seemed like bad ripoffs of Shakespeare or Braveheart. Stone gives us the guy in the flesh but we should have gotten some idea of the guys incredible personal appeal.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Do you know who was Alexander, cause Stone wasn't sure?","I like history very much and I think that Alexander is definitely one of the most intriguing historical persons. He ruled the entire known world and he was so young when he died (33) that it's impossible for us to understand how did he conquered everything and yet remain undefeated in battle. Stone's Alexander is boring. And the question is: how did Stone succeeded to make such a boring movie from such interesting character? I will give you as much answers as I can.Casting. It is quite amazing how none of the actors managed to fit his/her role.Directing. Stone is great director but he's lost in this kind of movie. Stone's ""Platoon"" is one of the best movies but after ""Alexander"" and ""World Trade Center"" I'm asking myself what is he doing? Other director is required for this movie.Music. Music is good but why we are listening it while the fight is taking place? At first major battle music takes place as priority and real sounds of battle are lost. Big minus.Length. The entire movie is so long. It just goes on and on. I don't mind sitting and watching something good for three hours but this isn't that case.Narrator. Stone uses narrator to tell us the whole story and his narrator is Ptolemy (Anthony Hopkins). If Stone didn't use the narrator the whole movie would be faster and some boring parts would be cut out.Fighting scenes. All battle scenes aren't impressive and this film is called spectacular. Spectacular for what? In what part? In this kind of movies spectacle is granted by big fighting scenes. But there are many elements required to make good fight scene. One of them is leading actor.Colin Farrell. Stone's first choice was Russell Crowe. Crowe said no and then Farrell got the role. From Crowe to Farrell. That's a large step. Crowe's strength and appearance vs. Farrell's weak and fragile look. Alexander was strong individual whose strength was his main plus. Do Crowe and Farrell look the same to you?Angelina Jolie. Why oh why? She's Olympias, you know the mother of Alexander (Farrell). But when I last checked Farrell had 31 and Jolie 32. Possible?Mistakes. I don't even want to talk about this part. There are so many mistakes. From years to changing scars on actors from one scene to another.Accent and language. Alexander is speaking English? Oh well Stone is not Mel Gibson (""Passion"",""Apocalypto"") but why his actors are changing accents? Olympias sounds like European in some scenes and Alexander has British accent.It's enough. I'm done, I don't want to think about this movie any more. If only the movie won some of the Razzies. Stone deserved it. Really disappointing effort for such established director.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
Good but Lacking,"I don't want to alienate anyone, because essentially there are many components to the movie that people on both sides of the spectrum disagree with. It took me 10 years to watch it again and really see something worth liking. And as such, I actually started to appreciate some parts of the movie. However, one must admit that some parts and components really take away from the focus of the film. To be honest I watched it only once in 2004 and didn't watch it until it came on HBO. One thing that really turned me off was the homosexual part of the film. It wasn't because I hate gays, but because the warriors of the film were presented as girly men. I have no problem with a gay story as long as the story is realistic. I thought Colin Ferrel did okay... But one must think of the age they are in, in which these are actual rough warriors and not cute stars that know how to fight in combat more. I view the type of warrior I was looking for as something resembling 300 or Troy. But the characters were not realistic and completely flamboyant for veteran/rough warriors. The gay component actually had an interesting part to the story because it was referred and compared to Achilles in The Iliad. And as such, reflects differently as a show to demonstrate passion guided by selfishness or that of brotherhood. The Aeneid also tried to compare the differences, which I thought was interesting to point out on this film. I also think this is the main reason why people dislike this movie. There are many gay movies before this that have been rated better, but its the fact that we have hardcore warriors who are girly men. So in that sense, there was a bad selection of characters.Another thing that took away from the main point was Angelina Jolie as his mother and Van Kilmer as his father being relived in his memory to explain his actions as a leader. Frankly, I thought the acting was poorly acted and most of the time unnecessary. I thought that this was a key reason along with the flamboyancy of the characters to distract from the main themes.There were some neat parts to the film. The budget can be seen with the accuracy of the make up and designs, along with the battle scenes. The battle scenes were definitely better than I remember and relatively accurate. The only problem is that at times it was kind of confusing to tell what was going on. The relations between Alexander and Hephaistus along with Achilles and Patriclus is also something pretty neat to explain the difference between how a great warrior can self defeat himself with is own passions as well as contrary where they can rule the world. The props and customs through the film are very accurate and realistic, and the only thing that prevents this form being noticed and appreciated is the acting and distraction from the major points in the film.I don't like acting single minded, however it does seem like this was a film that showed the biggest problem and yet folly of Oliver Stones career. With a great story available to him and a large budget, it shows that his creativity is to disorganized. I went from grading it originally from a 4 to an 8 because I really appreciated the military conquest more as well as the comparison with mythology. I also like the realistic approach to how his soldiers felt about over conquest and intermingling with other peoples. This is where the story really shines. However, for me the difference between a 7 and an 8 is usually opinion, which I fear may have reflected in my new decision. As such, I put it as a seven. It deserves over a 5 because it is entertaining, and even if you dislike the film, it still makes you watch at times. But there is also a good story there somewhere that was underdeveloped and deserved the 7.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
This Film is NOT GREAT!!!,"Possibly one of the worst films I have ever see. Absolute rubbish, a complete mess, backed by horrible acting. This film was a serious miss by Oliver Stone. It seems like its trying to feed of the success of other epics such as Braveheart, Gladiator, maybe even Lord of the Rings. The writers must have thought, "" what hasn't been done as a large scale epic? Alexander the Great!"" Colin Farrell? WHY? Nothing of value in this film. It's common for Hollywood to take a story with deep routes in history, and adapt it, changing the story, perhaps to the horror of historians,but still adapting it successfully into a blockbuster movie. This film was was a miss both as an authentic portrayal, and a historic action movie. I went to an advanced preview of this film, and about twenty minutes before the end, the screen meant black momentarily, and the audience cheered thinking it was over, and instantly made for the exit, when the screen lit up again, most kept on walking out. Occasionally I think what I could have achieved if I didn't spend those three hours watching this film. Absolutely no satisfaction in watching this film. Quiet simply, Alexander(the movie) WAS NOT GREAT!!!! VERY FAR FROM IT!!!",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
Why I enjoyed it and my friends didn't.,"Alexander is probably going to be one of the more controversial movies of the year, in that most people will either hate it or love it. It's all a matter of taste. As a drama/historical documentary sort of film, it's almost unparalleled. It's one of the first times I have ever seen a Hollywood film that is unafraid to show the ""TRUE"" elements of that time period. Anyone who is a fan of historical accuracy and is well-versed on the culture and relationships of that period will recognise that love between men was acceptable and is recorded in some of the most famous writings of those times; well, the uncensored versions anyway.I ventured into the film actually expecting another one of Hollywoods over-the-top exaggerations (ie, Troy...) but I was pleasantly surprised to find that this film actually seemed to portray the way things likely were with out major alterations on well-known facts. Yes, there were parts that were slow in the film, but the development of the characters and their motivations were thorough and precise. I for one enjoyed it.However, my friends didn't feel the same. I saw the film with five others. One walked out halfway through because he thought it was boring. One thought the film was generally okay, but a bit slow. The other three were some what icked out by the somewhat ""demonstrative"" homosexual aspects in the film. They didn't personally have anything against it, but I think they were ill-prepared for how blatant it is throughout, even though you never really see anything besides kissing, a few slaps on the butt, and hints of more. I doubt a Hollywood movie has EVER shown male-love quite in this way. I think many people will find it shocking to say the least. But again, if one is well-versed on that period, enjoys historical accuracy, and is fairly open-minded... I think that this can be overlooked.I'm fairly sure this movie will be a love it-or- hate it one. I personally loved it, and if you enjoy historically accurate films and are fairly open-minded, then I recommend at least watching this to know whether you enjoy it or not. Three hours of your time (and probably a bathroom break) and you might find yourself pleasantly surprised... or not. **shrugs** It's all a matter of opinion, now isn't it.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Not as bad as one would have you believe,"I don't know why so many rated this movie so bad but I shall continue with my honest take on this film.Kay, this is the story of Alexander the great as interpreted by Oliver Stone. Well we have our hero seen growing up instilled with the lovely values of conquest instilled by his barbaric father and witchy mother. Well after growing up he went right through to the conquest for himself working on taking over most of Europe surpassing the travels of the gods and heroes themselves into lands previously unknown. Things eventually catch up to Alexander and well I'll try and save the rest for your viewing pleasure.One of the issues in this film that I believe is responsible for some of the negativity relates to the whole gay sex angle. Well Oliver Stone wished to work on a historical statement basically saying that the people back then wern't as homophobic as we are now. He may have gone over the top but I don't think it was as overboard as everyone said it was. I didn't leave the film thinking ""ooh gay sex film"". I mean shoot people loved Brokeback Mountain and that showed way more in terms of gay relations than this film. Of course those of you who are major history buffs will not get to enjoy an exact history experience but I've learned since watching the Disney Version of Pocahontas that really a movie can be enjoyed without full historical accuracy.If you like movies like Braveheart or Gladiator you will very much enjoy this film.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Alexander: Theatrical Crap,"Alexander was the worst movie I have seen in the theater in a very long time. I was sad and disappointed. I thought this movie would be in league with Troy, not the best movie ever made, but with enough action and beautiful people to make it worth seeing. It was not. It was entirely too long, and I kept waiting for it to get better over the course of 3 hours but it didn't. I only stayed through the entire thing because I had spent $8.50 to see it and I was going to get my money's worth. Colin Farrell was absolutely terrible, crying and yelling and sending smoldering looks to Jared Leto. There is a lot of ""gay"" scenes, but they are historically accurate, he was bisexual. But the scenes aren't titilating or hot, they are just there. Jared Leto telling Colin he loves him, long embraces, smoldering glances, etc. Doesn't live up to the hype. Angelina Jolie was gorgeous, but sounded like she was Count Dracula's girlfriend. The movie had the feel of a PBS special, complete with a British narator. There was no point or reason for the movie, there was no motivation for anything that happened, it just did. Alexander wanted to see all of the known world, but why?! Just because, it seems. Conquered all those people for fun. Colin Farrell didn't make him seem interesting or intelligent or a man of any consequence, just some guy out to conquer the world. The battle scenes were boring and gory. Just a bunch of guys chopping at each other and getting covered in blood.

Too long and dull...,"Oliver Stone makes great movies. This isn't one of his best. It isn't as awful as some reviewers suggest but rather long in the story telling and acting. I had to endure the almost 3 hours of this epic and it did not make me feel the impulse to yawn or doze off and yet it did not hold you to the seat either. The lead choice was very poor as Colin Farrell was in no way look or act like a great General that subdued Persia and Western Asia. And who chose those kid actors? Ugh! The first 20 minutes were so excruciatingly detailed (about Alexander's history etc), you almost got lost if you did not listen intently to a very old and horrid Anthony Hopkins as Ptolemy. It seemed like a Greek history lesson and if you concentrated on the popcorn, you would surely have failed the test afterwards. And why doesn't Angelina Jolie ever age in this movie as her son does? The battle scenes were masterful and the cinematography of the magnificent locations stunning. With all the fuss about the homosexuality traits of Alexander depicted on the movie, the actual footage was strong but without graphical content. The only graphical love scene was the heterosexual element between Alexander and Roxane. Definitely worth seeing but in no way Oscar worthy.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

I want the three hours of my life back please.,"I was excited for a biopic of Alexander the Great. But this movie showed almost no redeeming qualities for the great king. The movie went way to slow, showed Alexander as a bitchy, spoiled king who just happened to be in the right place with the right title. I think the writing and directing are to blame. It seems like Oliver Stone thinks he doesn't have to work anymore. This movie proves that. Mr Stone, you cant light a bag of cow dung on fire and expect people to see it or like it because it has ""Directed By Oliver Stone"" under the title. The only thing that made want to keep watching was Anglina Jolie. Try to do better next time, there are a lot of better ways to spend a few hundred million dollars.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
"has it's moments of greatness, though surely not overall","The final product of Oliver Stone's decades-in-the-making epic on Alexander the great had me stunned walking out of the theater. Not because I thought it was particular great or masterful, and not because I thought it was a failure either. What stunned me was how there could be a few points in the film where I thought that Stone, like Alexander in a sense, reached heights he's barely gone to before, but then in other spots he boggled my mind with how he lost me.For example, take the second battle sequence, in which Alexander leads his weary army towards an Indian army, where Elephants stampede furiously against the troops on horses, and Alexander gets a bit of a shock (one which I won't reveal). After this shock, the rest of the battle scene is tinted, with a red glaze and form that gives the scene a complete, abrasive illusionment. I can consider this to include what is best and worst in Stone's talents as a storyteller - he creates this huge, massive sequence, using multiple angles and special effects. There is also an over-load of the kind of symbolism and melodramatic tendencies that have only popped up occasionally in past Stone films. The main focus being the significance of the bird in the sky (or King Phillip) to be used like the shaman in the Doors, only far too prominent to be easily desired. It's the kind of battle sequence I'd like to analyze shot-by-shot sometime, not necessarily because I'd like it more, but because it's the kind of sequence that you almost never see in major motion pictures.Like Natural Born Killers (which is one of the ultimate love or hate films ever made), Stone brings his unique, art-house sensibilities to a Hollywood budget and goes wild. The story he tells jumps around in revealing the rise and fall of the Macedonian. More than showing how ferocious and intelligent he was at battle (though that and other scenes of violence take up more than a third of the whole picture), Stone opts to get into his psychology via parents Phillip and Olympia (the sexy, sometimes frightening Angelina Jolie). This is where Stone makes some interesting ground, yet also, more often than not, doesn't know how to stick to something. A lot of the scenes involving Alexander's anger and frustration with his parents probably looked better on paper than they do on screen. And it's not necessarily the actors' faults entirely- the repetitive usage of close-ups, and the sometimes horrendous musical score by Vangelis, adds to it being less engaging.The acting, much like the direction, tips the scale to both sides by either fitting into their characters wonderfully, or not finding what is there at all and over-playing. Kilmer was impressive at playing a cretin of a father. Jolie was so-so. Leto's was one of the least impressive performances I've seen this year (I just could not see what affect Hephaistilon could have had on Alexander). Dawson and Hopkins were good, though somewhat under-used. Then there is Farrell, who for many who see this film may be what makes or breaks it for them. In most scenes, he finds the right notes and tones for his expression, the way he looks in close-ups. He does prove he can be a leading man in Hollywood. But what disappointed me was in how in some scenes he lost a grip on what he was doing with the character, and I saw less of Alexander and more of Farrell. Sometimes, I suppose, that look in his eyes would just vanish, the kind of look that has been in the major, Dionetic performances of Stones' films (such as Willem Dafore in Platoon, Woody Harrellson in NBK, and Kilmer in The Doors).Alexander, after a first viewing, is my least favorite of Stone's pictures - much of it goes to lengths with historical exposition that might have fared better to show (three battles, even if it was a small one or in montage, may have balanced out with the other major two) than to go on and on with. It doesn't make the mistakes of this year's Troy, but it doesn't fare much better. Simply put, Alexander the film is like the man himself- an ambitious, crazed man who ended up dividing his audience. Go see it, and know you will be challenged to love, like, or despise it.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
I want to see the reviewers that actually liked this movie,"Marshall University had a sneak preview of Alexander, so I snagged some passes. What can I say? Very inexpensive date. What I found was a bloated, inane, indulgent piece of film, falling far short from Stone's talent and ability. The dialogue is stale, and at points, even laughable (especially between Alexander and his homosexual lovers, which critically hurts the film). Battle scenes are few and far between. Historical inaccuracies are abound (a Stone trademark), so much so that playing a game of Age of Empires would give you a better sense of history. And worst of all, the film is full of long winded monologues bordering on the Gods and Generals level of absurdity. Two positive things came out of the movie, however. 1. Val Kilmer actually acts in this movie instead of playing Val Kilmer playing someone else. 2. Rosario Dawson's fantastic body is confirmed. Avoid this movie at all costs, even if it is free.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Missed chance,"I rented this movie on DVD yesterday and, to be honest, i really don't understand why there are so many positive comments in the reviews. I found it badly acted (Colin Farell, Angelina Jolie), badly casted (again Colin Farell is terrible as Alexander), badly filmed (with horrible sceneries) and way too long with too many bad conversations.It doesn't happen very often that i walk out on a movie but on this one i almost did. I am an archaeologist myself and i can't understand why the historian Robin Lane Fox agreed to this scenario, i guess it must be because of the small cameo he was given. The amount of crying that Alexander does in this movie is astonishing, and the homo-erotic emphasis is over-exaggerated (and i really don't have a problem with homosexuals). If you are expecting a movie about the great leadership of Alexander the Great and his unique achievements on the battlefields don't go see this one. He is presented here as a weak, whining and insecure softy and that's really not a correct way of presenting the facts. I can understand now why the Greeks were not amused by this movie.All the pretentious name throwing in the movie and selective presenting of facts is useless because 99% of the audience can't relate to it. They just come to see a good action movie. And if you want to know all the details go and read Plutarchus on Alexander. Without it, the movie could have had more action and speed and it could have been a lot shorter in length. Now I felt like a guest at a dinner table with too much bad food and too much bad company and no way to get out.My advice to Oliver Stone is to go and take some lessons from Ridley Scott on how to make these kind of movies. Both Gladiator and Kingdom of Heaven are very nicely done and very enjoyable. Stone was always high in my book because of movies like Platoon and Natural Born Killers but in this case the money could have been spent in a much better way.I really think this is a missed chance, it could have been a great movie with the right director, scenario and actors. It has replaced Troy at the bottom of my list and i never thought that it could be possible to make a worse antiquity movie than that. It gets a 1 from me, and i would like to propose that the horse that played Bucephalus gets the award for best acting in this movie for lack of acceptable human performances.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Yes, they had paper!!","Junkfishy mentions one ""flaw"" in the movie being paper which s/he says didn't exist until about 100 or so AD. Hmmmm, if that's so, how does one explain Egyptian papyrus and the Dead Sea Scrolls? Alexander purportedly carried a copy of Homer with him always. I'm sure he wasn't lugging around cuniform tablets! One of the saddest events in history was the destruction of the library at Alexandria--just think of what was lost! To point, perhaps the 10+ years worth of correspondence between Aristotle and Hephastion?Anyway, I thought that the papers (maps, plans, letters) were one of the finer mundane details in Alexander that attracted my attention and added to the reality of the setting. Great care was taken to make them look like papyrii--made of fabric with the lines and uneveness evident.",,Anonymous,Biography
Could have been great.,"Everything was there for this movie to be great.Collin Ferrel and Angelina Jolie were horrible choices.Both pretty faces with huge egos - this movie is scarred from the fact it came out during the brief bubble of their fame, before Hollywood realized neither are very good at acting.And the homosexual undertones didn't do it any favors, even if historically accurate.An 'Alexander war epic' is going to be geared towards males - and males are put off by homosexuality, like it or not.Everything else about the movie was great.There had to have been 100s of people who worked their butts off, disappointed by the end reception.Better movies have had more flaws.It's just the few flaws this movie made were huge in their own right, and proved to be terminal.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

I wonder why a great director such as Oliver stone should make such a cheap and false film?If he doesn't know about history,why should he intend to make a historical film?

A Waste Of Three Hours...,"This movie was a waste of three hours. The only redeeming quality is that Angelina Jolie, Jared Leto, Collin Farrel are attractive people. If you really want to see Roaario Dawson's body parts flopping around then this a movie for you. Just fast forward to that part. Other than that there's not much to say. The battle scenes were filmed well though. If there was actually a story line behind it the movie might have been OK. But nothing better. This movie was released too soon after Troy, which in my opinion was much better, and they were competing. Since Troy at least had a story line, it prevailed. Don't rent Alexander unless you have three hours with nothing, and I mean nothing, else to do. Cleaning the bathrooms would be a better option than having to sit through this again.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
A good work of art that deserves more credit and understanding,"Yeah, you can still hear Colin Farrell's Irish accent even though he is playing a Greek character. Yeah, there is less than a 1 year age difference between Angelina Jolie (Alexander's mother in the film) and Colin Farrell (Alexander). Yeah, its a little over the top, and most of the film lacks realism. But so what! :P.You have to understand the kind of filmmaker Oliver Stone is before you can understand his films. Realism, usually, isn't his goal. Creating strong visual tones and characters that make you respond in an emotional way is his forte. He is a master of creating 3-dimensional chaos and drawing you in for the experience.Alexander isn't Oliver Stone's best film, but its a lot better than people are giving it credit for.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Horrible movie!,"I just saw Alexander. The beginning of the movie, that is. After less than a hour I turned it off. It was just too much crap for me.The beginning of the film consisted of two things: Sentimential bullshit and fighting. Neither made in a good way.I wouldn't give much for the acting either. Angelina Jolie screaming in some weird accent and Colin Farrel trying to play a hero. Actually, I can't think of anything that was good with this movie.Lately a lot of historical movies have been done. First came The Gladiator, which I enjoyed. Then came Troy, which also was a good movie. Then came King Arthur, a bad movie. And now, finally, Alexander. The bullshit of bullshits.For all of you who haven't seen the movie: Don't; For all of you who have seen the movie: How did you bare it?Of course, these are just my opinions, but I don't understand how anyone would be able to like Alexander.

"But how did you like the movie, J. Edgar Hoover?","I kept looking for evidence of the 150 million dollars they spent on this picture. Babylon looked great, some of the interiors were smashing, but a lot of the statues and decorations looked cheesy and rushed out in a hurry. Remember the painted figure of Philip being pulled along in that procession? Cheap looking. The armor and weapons were fine, great horses and animal direction. One of my favorite parts was the soaring hawk over the first battlefield, nicely done. Suggested the spirit of Alexander, at the same time let you wonder what the hawk was thinking watching the carnage. Is it safe to swoop down and grab a limb, etc. Is there really another species as predatory as mine?

Dreadful...truly dreadful,"Truly dire. An example on how not to make a movie. Oliver Stone has over the years provided us with cinematic master-classes in suspense, black comedy, drama and innovative editing. This movie is a steaming pile of horse manure. Colin Farrell is even more abysmal than usual and the decision to make Alexander Irish has to be the biggest movie gaff since Dustin Hoffman signed up for Ishtar. 3 hours of utter garbage. Stick to the 1960s Mr Stone. Troy was fairly garbage but looks like Gladiator compared to this pig of film. A director's cut is the last thing we need (unless it includes a whole new movie without Farrell). RUBBISH RUBBISH RUBBISH",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Good is surprising areas, bad in surprising areas.","I just got back from viewing this movie. I was pleasantly surprised. After the swamp of negative ratings and publicity, I decided to drive them to the back of my mind and go in with meager expectations. Luckily Oliver Stone managed to keep me in his ancient world.First off, the sets and costume design were positively astounding. Babylon, though for the most part CG, was the most impressive ancient city brought to life, period. The armor and ancient clothes were lush and vibrant, with brilliant use of coloring and art.The acting was great all around, especially Farrell's performance which surprised me most of all. He gave Alexander's character power and vulnerability in all the right areas. And for the love of Christ everyone needs to drop the argument over his bisexuality. It's truth, get over it. Stone's handling of it impressed me most, with his tender portrayal between Alexander and Hephaistion impressed me. You don't need graphic sex or tongue dueling to convey love.Now that I've talked about the positive it's time to shed some light on what keeps this movie from greatness. The battle scenes must be named. Oliver Stone simply didn't do them justice. For all of his historical accuracy, his staging of the Battle of Guagemala was close to incomprehensible. His cutting and shots confuse more than immerse. Often you can't tell who's being killed or who's killing them. Return of the King proved how much energy a CG battle scene could have, yet no movie has been able to replicate it. Alexander's skewing the colors during the battle against King Porus' elephants was disconcerting in the worst way, varnishing what would have been the movie's physical climax.There are smaller concerns, namely Alexander's editing. The running length has nothing to do with it, I found each scene excepts for both battles to be both immersive and well staged. I felt like I was walking through the streets of Babylon at times, that's how good it was. But even Stone's trademark non-linear style fails him here. For some reason he skips Philip's assassination and then brings it back right after Alexander murders Cleitus.I enjoyed it, as did many among the American audience who viewed it. This movie is definitely not going to be loved by the younger crowd, who's patience is limited to mindless action it seems these days. But too many of the movie's faults keep it from being another Platoon or JFK, or even on par with historical epics like Gladiator or Spartacus.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Not as bad as made out to be,"The sheer scale of the historical Alexander makes it impossible for the complete story to be told in a movie. Oliver Stone's attempt is masterful in its production values, and some earnest story-telling. However, unless you are familiar with ancient history, the movie's storyline will leave you baffled and disconnected. There are simply too many places, characters and events to be absorbed by someone new to the story. Best is to watch it on DVD with sub-titles on. Vangelis' score is also brilliant, with his synthesiser music surprising apt for the movie. In fact, it is almost as haunting as atmospheric as what he did for Blade Runner.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
An honest review,"I just saw the new Oliver Stone film ""Alexander"" at a free screening at the University of Pennsylvania sponsored by Polo Jeans, and I honestly have to say that this movie was one of the worst films I have ever seen. I am usually someone who tries to find the good in any film, but this movie was so horrendous that I feel a moral obligation to the IMDb community...no, the world, to warn everyone of the monstrosity that is ""Alexander."" Everything about this movie is flat out horrible. I can't think of one thing the film does well, other than the last half hour, which is so unintentionally hilarious it almost makes the first 7 hours worth sitting through. In the theater I was at, people were booing and yelling out ""worst movie ever!"" and ""just end already!"" and someone even went up to the projector and started doing shadow puppets with their hands in the last few seconds of the movie, which was followed by everyone cheering. I don't remember the last time I laughed so hard. My friend was crying he was laughing so hard. People were walking out of the theater early.Please, do not reward the makers of this film by paying to see it. Oliver Stone should be shot (In the foot of course, nothing lethal). If you can see this movie for free and don't care about wasting 7 hours or however long it was (it sure felt like 7 hours), go ahead because it is worth the laughs in the end because it is so terrible.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
The film that will never end.,"One could argue that this is a two star film only on the acting, which wasn't bad at all. The writing and directing was horrible, and I can't believe Oliver Stone made this movie. What could have been the movie of the year was a waste of time.It presents itself more as a history documentary than an action/drama movie. Thus you have very little in the way of character development or plot. Yet it doesn't even give one a good grasp of the history. The script was just terrible. There is no clear view of what is going on at all times. None of the secondary characters were developed at all.The battle scenes were jumpy and not exciting. There was no overview of the battles so you can't really see what's going on. The action sequences were poorly made. Only the horse vs. the elephant had any presence and it's a long movie to watch if you're waiting for that.While one cannot blame the actor's for this movie, it was indeed a long terrible slow painful waste of time. Even Angelina Jolie actually put up a decent performance (although casting her as Colin Farrell's mother who doesn't age in 25 years is a little iffy), yet none of the acting in the world could have saved this movie.It's hard to offer a real analysis of this film because it had no real good points to work with. Just do not see this expecting well made battle scenes, or words that hit the heart, or moving drama, or anything good that can come from a movie. All is lost here.All in all, I knew it was a movie I had to see anyway. I have deep interest in history and Alexander and the mythology of the time. For me it was worth the risk, but this movie will never be owned by me or watched again. It doesn't even contain anything of little interest. It isn't what I would expect from Oliver Stone. It isn't a new interesting angle. It isn't the truth no one wants to hear. It isn't really accurate.ALSO The 2 Disc Director's Cut DVD features - VERY SPARSE! There are a couple trailers (which are well made and are not representative of the movie) for the movie and a documentary. The two discs is a marketing gimmick only. It could easily have fit on one disc and you'd still be disappointed in the lack of extras.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography

"In 12 words or less: It sucked.  A lot.  And I mean it really, really, really sucked.","* The is a great story. Alexander's story is a truly stunning, epic, and powerful story. Unfortunately, Stone completely screws it up.First, he makes the character of Alexander into a whiny, annoying, wussy, pathetic, unsure, and gay. Okay, there is no way on earth that the guy represented in the first five of that list was the guy who conquered the world. It's so completely and utterly unbelievable that you are never convinced or even interested by his character, just annoyed and bored. As for the last one, well --- it may or may not be true (there's no direct evidence that he was in real life, but no reason he wasn't), but it isn't interesting. I mean, seriously, so what? Who cares if he's gay? All Stone accomplished by emphasizing that was making a portion of the audience (including myself) uncomfortable.Additionally, his writing absolutely sucks everywhere else. The dialogue is absolutely awful. I mean, seriously, I can't think of a movie offhand with worse dialogue. Not only is it either cringe-inducing, boring, or hilariously bad (and mostly just the first two), but it doesn't accomplish much. Character-wise, the tragic flaws of Alexander are incredibly over-explained, while his good parts are completely unexplained and, in fact, don't make sense at all.And Stone's direction stinks. Every now and then he does a halfway decent job with the spectacle, but that's all he gets right. This is poorly filmed and either fake-looking or unenergetic, depending on the scene.I don't know whether it was as a writer or director he made this decision, but whatever he was thinking, it was dead wrong: he decided to put the movie totally out of order, like Pulp Fiction or something. Now, when used for a reason, this is a good device. However, here, it seems like Stone just randomly cut it into pieces and threw them back together. This means that on those rare occasions when Stone actually pulls everything together and you start to get involved, suddenly you're thrown completely out as it flies to some other time and place, and it's all lost. The movie has no momentum because of this and Stone's inability to give it any path to follow, just throwing random scenes in, so you aren't awaiting anything or even interested, and it becomes completely and utterly boring.The cast doesn't do much to help. Farrell is miscast, at least for what Stone does (and maybe for a good version of Alexander, but it's hard to say). He is never convincing and almost always wooden, although this has a lot to do with what he's been given.As for the others, well the usually brilliant Kilmer tries hard, and is really good when either his dialogue isn't so awful he can't find a single way of making it work, or he pointlessly attempts an Irish accent. Jolie is incredibly over-the-top and absolutely ludicrus, with the corniest Russian accent in history. (Russian?!) However, it's over-the-top in a fun way, so it doesn't destroy the movie because it's actually halfway entertaining. (almost as entertaining as how incredibly fake her old-age makeup looks) Plummer is good, but barely in it. Leto is a good actor who does absolutely everything he can in one of the crappiest roles in film history. Basically, Stone tells him to look at Alexander longingly and um, other stuff like that. He tries, but his dialogue is the worst of the film. Dawson is awesome (and not just in the looks department), but after her first ten minutes or so of screen time, basically disappears and occasionally reappears as a background object, and is greatly missed when she's offscreen. And, finally, you have Anthony Hopkins, who does the most shocking thing he's done in his entire career: he actually manages to give a wooden performance. No other cast member is worth mentioning.Even the battle scenes aren't so great. There are really only two, Guatema (the final showdown between the Greeks and Persians), and some battle in India. The former is certainly big, with lots of impressive special effects, but has no good buildup, and consequently no satisfaction or reason to care. It's also poorly filmed, with a pointless ultra-shaky camera and some very cheap looking shots. The latter has some great moments and is almost a brilliant battle scene, but misses the mark because after the cool slow-motion charge/elephant rearing/horse dying part, which really rocks, it shows everything through a very distracting red filter that makes it confusing when it should be dramatic.The 155 million dollars they wasted on this mess occasionally did show up, though. The special effects were usually convincing, the sets were big albeit kind of silly at times, and the costumes looked kind of authentic; all of this recreates the ancient world spectacularly, albeit unconvincingly. Vangelis' score has some absolutely wonderful moments, but also falls prey to the general suckage most of the time. While romance between Alexander and Haphestian is indescribably corny, there are genuine sparks between Alexander and Roxanne, begging the question once again: why on earth did Stone make Alexander gay? Also on the upside, besides some decent technical achievements, a few moments were very good, and, to give Stone credit, he did take a very ambitious look at an ambitious topic. However, any movie this boring, pointless, meandering, poorly written, and badly directed deserves to be ridiculed by the critics and lose an inordinate amount of money.Let me wrap up by telling the films biggest failure: it never adequately explains why Alexander wanted to conquer the world and then succeeded at conquering the world and why he's called Alexander the Great. If you can't even tell why a person got his nickname, you have failed at creating a good biopic.The sad thing is, big, sweeping epics are my absolute favorite kind of film. Of all people, I should have really found lots of redeeming things.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
"See it twice, just don't go to see it as an action flick","I have to be honest, the first time I saw it, I couldn't sit still and I wanted to get up and leave. I wanted to see an action movie with fighting and everything, which it had, but there was too much art stuff in it and it all got in the way. Even so, I had the feeling that there was more to it and it really was a good movie, I just didn't get it. You know? Like when you hear a joke and don't get it, but you know it's supposed to be funny?So, I went to see it again, but instead went to see it as a biography of Alexander. It made a huge difference! It really is a great movie and it does have a plot and everything. There's foreshadowing and you get it all more easily if you don't go there thinking it's an action movie.I think it is just that in previews, they threw in all the action sequences and made everyone think it was going to be an action movie, like one of Arnold's.

There are good spots,"Here we have the film version of the life and times of King Alexander III of Macedon, aka ""Alexander the Great"". It might be hard for moviegoers to swallow but the life of the actual king was more violent and betrayal filled than the film. He is known to have been a heavy and excessive drinker who was impulsive and had a bad temper. He also likely had a homosexual lover since boyhood named Hephaestion (the Jared Leto role). His mother Olympias was also likely more evil than the Angelina Jolie character here, once forcing a woman to kill her own child and then forcing her to hang herself. Nice family that Alexander had. Alexander was by reports an excellent general and an exceptionally handsome and athletic man who set a fashion for the clean-shaven, short haired look. He was also fiercely loyal to his friends and men. He enjoyed the arts too. Kind of a well rounded guy for a conquering despot who called himself ""Lord of Asia"". He is thought to have eventually died of either malaria or typhoid fever. In short, a lot of what goes on here is historically based on facts known to have happened. So what went wrong? Why isn't the film more popular with such an interesting character to portray? Lets examine the results on film.The general presentation of the film is more-or-less excellent, terrific costumes and sets (except the costuming of the Persian women have a more middle ages look to me). Overall art direction, editing, sound, music and stunts were all excellent. Cinematography was generally excellent except for a poor choice of infrared film in one battle sequence in India.I have to lay the blame of the story presentation and direction. The battle scenes were well staged but confusing in many places in trying to explain what was going on. And although the star, Colin Farrell, did an excellent job, I can't help but feel he was led a bit astray by Stone's direction. The way the story was told was hard to fathom for people I listened to also. That jumping back and forth just added to the confusion. It was a complex story best told in straight chronology or with more narrative such as that excellently provided by Anthony Hopkins as the elder Ptolemy. Overall I enjoyed most of the individual acting performances. I think a very great film was missed here by botched story telling which I can't fault the actors with.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Was Mr. Stone trying only to make money by putting some special effects and a good cast in a very bad story? Did he care to read about the great general and military strategist Alexander was? Or the fact that Alexander didn't demolished what he conquered but made it greater, like the library in Alexandria? The movie has so many whole. It didn't show his conquering of Egypt or the unification of Macedonia and Greece under one leader. I am so sorry I rented the movie. Please Mr. Stone, do not ruin history.",,Anonymous,Biography
Not a bad movie,"The movie made a good attempt to describe the life of Alexander the Great. He could have done much better though. The cynics who try to put Alexander in the same basket with other conquerors such as Genghis Khan - Mongol Conqueror, Attila etc, I think they could be wrong. Alexander's teacher was the great ancient philosopher Aristotle. He was a brave man with a child's heart. He did not go for gold or for power but for adventure and heroism as is depicted in his role models of Achillies and Heracles. The movie I think managed to exhibit this good trait of Alexander in a good degree. Alexander is an excellent example of what a humans can do if they have a dream and a vision. Nevertheless, Alexander may not have been a very happy man. Nobody explained to him what the real meaning of life is. Nevertheless he was a charismatic personality, a noble soul. He was the one and only Alexander, Alexander the Great.Fortune favors the brave, Alexander.""Dream no small dreams for they have no power to move the hearts of men."" - Goethe",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Too maligned,"I didn't think this was a bad movie. The problem that many people seem to have with it is, basically, that there was more history than entertainment in it. It was one director's honest, realistic and no-holds-barred interpretation of the life of a great figure from history, warts and all. Oliver Stone deserves kudos for this achievement, though I'll also say that the movie had a few problems.Most people - incl. myself, actually - had undoubtedly expected something more entertaining and action-filled. There certainly was action in it, but the action played second fiddle to the up-close-and-personal psycho-analysis of Alexander. We saw him as a very troubled figure. Not as much of a conquering hero, nor a character we could particularly care about. He had an interesting idealistic vision of the great cross-cultural civilization he would build, but we never really get into his mind about this. Instead, we see him worriedly trying to deal with a sea of troubles that beset him at every turn, mostly in the form of his Macedonian soldiers who don't agree with his conquering tendencies. This is all good and well, and a very valid and interesting take on what actually happened, but it fills too much in the movie, and takes away from the portrayal of Alexander the person; it undermines our chance to get a good understanding of the attractive sides of his ideas and visions. Possibly, Oliver Stone doesn't think Alexander's visions were that attractive, and possibly he's right. But Alexander is such an important, seminal and thoroughly adventurous historical figure that the viewer expects to see him as a confident, almost heroic, conquering pioneer. It's no fun to have him psychologically deconstructed. We have academic papers for that. The populace at large needs affirmation of Alexander the Great's actual greatness. This movie did not provide that. It was too serious; too ambitious. It kind of forgot that it was a big-budget Hollywood caper. But who knows, maybe sober posterity will look more favorably at what it was trying to do.The homosexual aspect didn't bother me that much, but then, I'm a tolerant person. The average movie goer, it seems, is not. Because clearly a lot of the bad rap this movie's gotten stems from people not being able to stomach the whole gay thing. Which really wasn't anything to make such a big fuss about. Before I saw the movie, I'd heard that there would be ""offensive"" homo-erotic scenes in it. There wasn't. Sure there were a few scenes emphasizing the orientation and such (and one where Alexander kissed a male member of the Babylonian king's harem), but there wasn't any unsettling gay sex scenes, and what overtly sexualized ""gayness"" there was, was quite tastefully done. (Of course, the boy who was raped at a party by some soldiers was an exception, but that was shown for the sake of realism.) One thing I thought was overdone, though, were the several shots of the male harem member (whom Alexander brought along on much of his journey of conquest) which had him looking down, bowing away, etc., emphasizing (particularly in the minds of the audience) that his presence was shameful. This shouldn't have been done, but it's a minor thing.Probably my biggest point of criticism is about the accents. I don't mind some of the actors using their own accents (like Farrell), but I mind some of the actors being given clearly artificial ""barbaric"" accents. This was not very consistently done, and esp. in Rosario Dawson's case it was very grating. And that's really too bad, because it ruined the whole atmosphere of many scenes.Overall, however, I thought the movie was pretty good - certainly better than Troy -, and there were many spectacular scenes of Babylon and great battles, which I really enjoyed watching. I would have been happier, however, with a movie that had emphasized adventure and entertainment a little more.7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
What a yawner,"** Since I didn't finish watching this movie, there aren't any spoilers in this review! ** It's a rare thing for me to not finish watching a movie, even a bad one. However, this movie was so boring that, after an hour of enduring this talk fest, I just couldn't see waisting another precious minute of my life on watching it. Being historically accurate doesn't mean you have to be so stilted in your acting and directing that the movie becomes a painful drudgery just to sit through to the bloody end. Besides, the movie wasn't THAT accurate, anyway.Half way into this movie, I realized that I had absolutely NO empathy for Alexander, or for any other character for that matter. The scenes, while rich in costumes and trappings, were devoid of anything that would've made me want to care what happened to Alexander. Even the battle scenes, which have been inexplicably lauded by many here, were actually quite ineffective, as well as inaccurate.For example, the defeat of Darius was the climax of Alexander's life. The Greek defeat of the Persian forces in the mountains above the Plain of Issus stands as one of history's greatest victories by a vastly outnumbered army. It did NOT play out at all in the manner that was portrayed in the movie. For one, it took place in a mountain valley, after both armies had realized that they had actually marched PAST each other. Alexander had the great luck to discover this fact before Darius did, and managed to trap Darius's army in just the right place (a narrow mountain valley). Thus, the size of Darius' army, which would've been a huge advantage in the sort of battle depicted in the movie, actually turned into a major disadvantage that Alexander used very effectively.This battle should've been the movie's climax, and should've taken a good two-thirds (or more) of the movie to set up. As it was, the crowning point in Alexander's life was relegated to a footnote, and was over in the first thirty minutes of the movie. After that, it was all downhill for this horrible movie.For an example of the CORRECT way to tell the story of a General-King, try Kenneth Branagh's rendition of Shakespeare's Henry V. Henry V revolves around one of history's other unlikely victories, that of the defeat of the French by the vastly outnumbered British in the Battle of Agincourt.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Like the morale of Alexander's troops, the film deteriorates with time...","AlexanderAlexander (Colin Farrell), the King of Macedonia, leads his legions against the giant Persian Empire. After defeating the Persians he leads his Army across the then known world venturing further than any Westerner had ever gone all the way to India.It's interesting to note that 'Alexander' is the second swords-and-sandals epic to be released in 2004, after Wolfgang Petersen's impressive May hit, 'Troy'. A obvious result of the monumental success of 2000's 'Gladiator', 'Alexander' at first seems to have the advantage over the spin on 'The Illiad' with Oliver Stone at the helm. Unfortunately, like the morale of Alexander's troops, the film deteriorates with its running time. Colin Farrell gives a very good performance (good enough to distract from the hammy work by Jolie, Kilmer and others), but it isn't enough. 'Alexander' is undoubtedly an ambitious project, but maybe Oliver Stone isn't the right man to take it on.~ 6/10 ~",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
This movie will make Alexander turn over in his grave!,"This movie gets 1 out of 10.Wow! This movie sucks. I mean really! It is bad. With a star-studded cast, a high budget, and a biography of a fascinating conqueror, you would think this movie would be great! Unfortunately it is not.The movie is about Alexander the Great, the Greek conqueror who conquered Egypt, Persia and up to the fringes of India by the time he was in his early thirties.I remember reading about him in my world history class back in school and being fascinated about his life and his exploits. I eagerly anticipated the making of this movie hoping it would measure up to my expectation but it did not.The movie was constantly going forward and backward in telling his life which made the movie chaotic. Maybe Oliver Stone was trying to be like Tarantino; if that is so, he failed.Stone skirted the issue of Alexander's homosexuality by not revealing his this issue openly. Alexander's homosexuality should not be a controversy because he was. In our time, homosexuality is a big issue but during that time, in Greek society, it was a big deal. In fact, the Greek ideal relationship is between a grown man and a young boy.In history, there has always been speculation whether Alexander was part of the plot to kill his father King Philip of Macedon because Philip had just taken another wife who had bore him a male child. This issue should have been more in the beginning of the story, but instead, it was shown in the middle of the movie.I could keep going on and on with examples but you get the picture. Moreover, the battle scenes, while good, was not great.Prior to the release of this movie, I saw a three hour documentary of Alexander on the History channel on cable television. It was fantastic. It literally blows away this movie ten times over. The story is told from the biography of Alexander, written by an ancient Greek and two Roman citizens. I believe one of the Romans only concentrated on Alexanders early years.Anyway, if you really want to know about Alexander, his life, and his exploits, then go check that out, or better yet, go buy a book on his life.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great Cast (for the most part),"I don't understand why everyone is so obsessed with the Irish accents. They certainly didn't speak English back then anyway, so I think it's kind of presumptuous to assume they should be speaking with a British or an American accent. It makes no sense to me, and I don't think it interfered at all with their great performances and the overall watching experience.The cast was incredible in my opinion. Jared Leto delivered a very strong performance, Collin Farrell was terrific, Anthony Hopkins was legendary as always. The only terrible casting mistake is Angelina Jolie (who is the reason I avoided watching this Film for so long). Her accent is horrific. I don't know what she was trying to be, she sounded like an evil witch from an unknown continent that spoke an odd mixture of languages. Seriously. The worst I've ever seen her perform.Overall, It was a very good film in my opinion",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Awful...just awful,"Wow. I watched the director's cut this weekend and was blown away at just how bad this movie is. I'm really surprised by the number of glowing reviews here at the IMDb. It had so many problems - poorly developed characters (pretty much all the side characters), bad dialogue, pointless jumps in timeline (sometimes this can be extremely effective, obviously, but in Alexander it served no purpose), lack of focus, and directorial overindulgence. I've read some of the threads comparing the director's cut with the theatrical release, and it seems that maybe some of the problems I had with the film, particularly on the character development front, are due to changes made for this cut. I hope that's the case. This film is convoluted, historically inaccurate, and more importantly, boring and self indulgent.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
An excellent film!,"I have read a lot of bad comments on the movie Alexander, and I find it strange. Of course opinions of movies is subjective to the viewer, but I couldn't believe so many people did not like this film. Anyway, I felt the acting was miraculous! Colin Farrell is Alexander, I think he proved that. I think Oliver Stone depicted the relationship between Hephaistion and Alexander tastefully. I've heard a few people say the film was nothing short of gay porn! Were they watching the same movie I was. That I can remember, Alexander only kisses one male in the film and the rest of the Bisexuality was depicted with glances and insinuations of relationships. This is the part that I feel Oliver Stone depicted tastefully. Angelina Jolie did an excellent job as Olympias. THe only complaint that I have about this film is that the narrating jumped around a lot and I feel that some of the scenes could have been kept in sequence to tell the story more clearly. But other than that, I thought it was brilliant.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""Alexander""'s dirty little secret","I watched the theatrical version of this film on DVD last night as I was very curious about all the kerfuffle. As it turns out, even though I am heavily prejudiced against Oliver Stone for the sheer mass of lies contained in his delirious ode to irresponsible homophobia called ""JFK"", and for hanging out with and glorifying small-time and big-time real-life homophobic tyrants like Jim Garrison and Fidel Castro, I must say his film of ""Alexander"" got most everything right. What nobody will tell you, of course, is that this ""Alexander"" is an almost scene-for-scene transposition of Mary Renault's novel ""The Persian Boy"" (Alexander's conquests as seen from the eyes of his favourite eunuch, Bagoas). The only thing that's changed is having Ptolemy act as the narrator instead of Bagoas (both dictating in Alexandria many years later). This, shall we say, ""borrowing"" of course explains why the film is so gay-positive, which, I suppose, is Mr. Stone's way of atoning for past sins. As luck would have it, Middle America was not ready for such frankness and Mr. Stone now knows what it is to be bad-mouthed for having ""gay sympathies"", by which he will probably learn a lesson. Or then again, maybe not, judging from the self-censorship job he pulled on his own ""director's cut"" from which every naughty bit was excised. But this does not distract from the fact that ""Alexander"" (the theatrical version) is a rather competent film that was obviously misunderstood by a whole bunch of Yahoos and Joe Six-Packs (Stone's regular public) who were lured into theatres to stare at Ms. Jolie's gazongas. And that is very sad for the future of film-making in America.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Movies can't get much worse than this film - unless they decide to make an Alexander II.,"After almost 50 years of paying, first my parents, then my own hard-earned money to see (..good!?!..) films in everything from flea-pits to plush, multi-screen cinemas, I can honestly say that this is the WORST film I have ever seen. It is appalling! Bad, ham acting, abysmal editing; crappy lighting; overdecorated and wobbly sets; and far, far more (and worse) that I won't bore the uninitiated with. From my own humble point of view the only good scene is the elephant rearing up onto its back legs; and even this would appear to be a direct infringement of the Fantasia copyright.I know that Hollywood is supposed to be overflowing with out-of-work actors, not to mention the hundreds of would-be hopefuls who are said to arrive at the bus-station every day ... but surely the producers could have found someone with even slightly more talent than the Irish actor who played Alexander (I can't even, and don't want to, remember his name. I'm also too lazy to check the cast list by scrolling back through this site).I think I have been overly generous by giving it a 1 rating - but they won't let us give negative 'e' numbers so I'll have to give it a moral raspberry instead and let sleeping dogs lie - 'cos this one should have died before it tried to bark.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography

I loved Angelina Jolie and Colin Farrell and how well they portrayed their characters and I loved the story and the effects...I suppose it's only one person's opinion but I really liked this movie...The story overall was a tad boring, but it made sense and captured Alexander the Great's character very well...and the battle scenes were awesome!",,Anonymous,Biography
Welcome to Bizarro-World,"The world is a confusing, chaotic mess, and in mankind's futile attempt to make sense of it he mythologizes those that came before in hopes of forgiving the transgressions of his forefathers and providing a sense of optimism for the uncertain future. It's this type of mixed message where leaders can turn from visionary hero to over-indulgent tyrant in the blink of an eye, combined with grotesque parallels to current geopolitics (care to take a look at Afghanistan and Iraq anyone?), and a discouraging moral relativism marked most prominently by the rampant bisexuality of these ancient marauders that has sent those critics and viewers who get scared by the gray areas of life all a flutter. Oliver Stone's 'Alexander' is a big, audacious, confusing, bloody mess of a film. During its entire three hour run time I was on edge, never knowing what type of over the top directorial flourish (witness the climactic infrared elephant battle royale), weird psychosexual subtext, or insane acting performance was awaiting us in the next frame.For all it triumphs (the creatively staged battle scenes, the opulent Babylon, the subtexts and symbolism, the passionate performances), there were a few damning distractions. The love story between Alexander and Hapheastion was as cheesy as the type of heterosexual romance you would find in a 'Titanic' or 'Pearl Harbor.' Also, while Angelina Jolie's other-worldly accent whose origins can only be known to her dialect coach adds yet another fascinating layer to her fine art of scenery chewing, the Irish and Scottish accents of the Macedonians and Greeks are ridiculous and lift you right out of the alien world Stone has placed you in. Still, I would take this all instead of the over-ripe dullness of this year's earlier and only mildly entertaining Greek epic 'Troy.' You see, in the bizarro-world of Hollywood, a monumental failure from the likes of an Oliver Stone still towers over the greatest works of a lesser director.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Sure, an' 'tis Alexandre, King o' de Grakes","This film got such awful reviews I skipped the theatrical release, but after reading IMDb reviews that suggested it's an overlooked classic I decided to give it a try.The good: It's an Oliver Stone, and has some fascinating ideas and glorious moments of spectacle.The bad: It's a weirdly pc-ized version of the young conqueror and the story is a rambling muddle, full of unintentionally funny moments. Stone hasn't successfully plotted a film about the charisma and tactics of a brilliant but often ruthless visionary, undermined by selfish politics. And those accents!!!Alexander (Farrell) is conceptualized as a multiculturalist questing to unify a world of tyranny and petty politics. Mom Olympias (Angelina) is an embittered victim of Al's lustful dad Philip (Kilmer), taking her vengeance politically. This might work if this was the saga of Phil and Oly, but a major focus is the dynastic/ethnic politics swirling around Al, so vengeful Oly - and her... Greek?... accent - just kind of confuses things.Stone's handling of the love and loyalty of men is also a major fumble, confused by the gay angle and lacking necessary buddy-ing between Al and Hephaestion (Jared Leto). Instead we get dumbth like Al soliliquizing when he should be riding to the rescue of Parmenion or grandly speechifying, to swelling background music, that his veterans should be embarrassed to go home and leave him - then going ballistic, executing the critics, and rolling on. And there are unintentionally funny moments, like Old Ptolemy (Hopkins) sententiously declaring that Alexander has captured the imagination of the world - by taking two more wives (and after the honeymoon scene with Rosario Dawson, Wife One, that really DOES capture the imagination!!!) and the hilarious scene of Al ignoring the death spasms of sick Hephaestion during a monologue on urban planning!?! The multiple accents, particularly Angelina's cross between Garbo and Elvira, are just frosting on the bundt cake.Anyone who thinks this is a subtle nod to Greek tragedy has confused Euripides with Ray Harryhausen. There is no chorus of self-interested shouters in Antigone, and anyway this is not really a parable of tragic inevitabilities or overweaning ambition; it's the opposite! In fact it would have been a better film if it had been straight-forwardly the tale of a young filmmaker bucking the studios and conquering greater artistic territory while jealous subordinates try to stab him in the back...",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Alexander the Way Too Long of a Movie,"The battles scenes made the movie bearable, but it isn't anything people haven't seen before. If you want to watch a movie with battles in them I suggest Braveheart, Gladiator, or Return of the King (which also has a battle with animals very similar to elephants).If you want to waste a perfectly good three hours of your life go ahead and see Alexander. The story doesn't focus particularly on one point of Alexander's life, but the whole damn thing and it just drags on and on and on. The audience is then bombarded with laughable dialogue (people at the screening were actually laughing at it and thankfully the score was so loud at some points you couldn't even hear what was being said). Several people actually walked out on the free screening. I just opted to take a nap.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Unremarkable potential...added comments about directors cut,"I will begin by saying that I have been a fan of Alexander the Great since my early teens. For the better part of a decade he has been my ancient history hero. I have read many books, seen every documentary and I had an incredible teacher walk me step by step through his incredible life. So knowing that I entered into ""Alexander."" The film is the story of the Great Macedonian Conqueror and leader Alexander. Son of King Phillip and rumored to be the son of a God. The film walks us through early stories of his childhood, his friends, and the major events that turned him into a man. Early scenes focus on his father played quite well, and remarkably unrecognizable by Val Kilmer. The film than jumps to Alexander's later years although he only lived to be 33. We see his first amazing battle against Darius, King of The Persians which in essence was his first and greatest victory opening gateways to the Eastern world and eventually his entire takeover of the known world. Throughout the movie we see major events that shaped him, changed him, hurt him, and made him stronger and eventually leading to his untimely death. Every character you would expect to be in the film is there, his mother Olympias, he closest dearest friend Hephastian, Ptolemy, Darius, Aristotle.The film really had so much to live up to in my expectations which makes it a difficult movie for me to watch. This film was one of my most anticipated of all times. However I do not believe I am being harsh on it because of that. I truly believe there were horrible mistakes made. However I also disagree on many fronts with the issues had by many other people watching this film. I do believe Colin Farrell had his best role in Alexander. His dialect was dry, and speeches unappealing but I don't chock that up to him whatsoever. His performance as Alexander was moving and dead on and I have never seen him in a more passionate role. I did buy Angelina Jolie as his mother because Olympias was rumored to be a conniving, evil woman who toyed with Alexander's emotions and was a twisted, young woman. Jolie plays twisted quite well. Kilmer was excellent as the overbearing, abusive, King.The cast was not the issue. The script played a heavy part on this film and the script and direction quite honestly sucked!! It hurts me to say that being Oliver Stone has delivered some of the most passionate and honest, politically incorrect films (that's a good thing) we've ever seen. JFK, NIXON, Platoon etc. Alexander had Stone's style, he held no punches and he battles the Homosexuality rumors head on, and in his perfect style leaves Alexander's death a complete mystery with a line of suspects and ways that he could have died...broken heart, assassination, disease. One of the biggest misfortunes of this film was the battles...oh I mean BATTLE..single....perhaps one and a half. You cannot do a grand Epic least of all about Alexander and not have each of his amazing battles and how he won them. Instead Stone recreated brilliantly mind you with all the goriness his one great battle. The rest of the film dragged and left certain aspects to the imagination. It's a disappointing film and Stone is unfortunately to blame for poor writing, and poor directing. The film does capture the essence of the Greek culture of the time and perhaps does capture the emotion of Alexander without ever showing his accomplishments. I understand why this film is bombing and I don't recommend it to anyone who isn't just a big history fan. 5/10**************New comments after seeing Alexander: Directors Cut***** I don't know if it was the additions and changes that director Oliver Stone hesitantly made to the DVD release of Alexander but it felt to be different in my second viewing. I still stand by the fact that the film has awesome potential that was left untapped. It's very true that some of the acting in the film was severely over-acted, campy even which for a big budget (HUGE) Historical Epic is rather out of place but I think everyone did what they could. I do think another actor could have grabbed onto the role of the young King Alexander better than Farrell did. I don't know if he has the acting ability to pull of this role but he does try damn hard!!! Unfortunately it does come off as a bit campy at times. I still stand by the fact that Val Kilmer's portrayal as King Phillip is brilliant!!! Razzies aside (I hate those awards!!) I give Alexander (directors cut at least) a bump in ratings because it's still very slow paced and the action is few and far between but I think it will become a classic and history buffs will enjoy it. I would just like to have seen a better time line, I don't think it was necessary to have flashbacks and it would have made the film fit together if everything was in chronological order. More battles were an absolute must. The two battles in the film were so brilliantly done than even one more in the middle would have been welcomed. This was the greatest general in history!! And I think Stone's attempt at being controversial was overused in the constant reference to Alexander's sexuality. It was good that he brought it up, but it was overused intensely!! I think in the directors cut too that they made it seem more suspicious that Alexander's death was the work of his own men and I thought the ending was better originally. Check it out for yourself!! It's not as bad as one might think. 6.5/10",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"to much is 'trop', as the French would say","OK Alexander was gay... everybody was gay in these times... but he did much more than just fight and love boys (and some girls). Why didn't they mention his library, schools and so much more. The movie really left me unsatisfied! This might just be the kind of movies that will give todays youth a wrong idea of history.OK there was much aspect for the psychology of Alexander and the reasons that have driven him to act in certain ways. But still, for a movie that long, they might have mentioned the other aspects of the 'heroes' life.The acting wasn't bad. Even OK. But I must admit that i had expected more from the director. Oliver Stone brought us masterpieces, but Alexander is a mistake that we must forget and forgive. Maybe the cast, legend and director, raised the expectations so high that the movie can't realize. Anyway, making a movie about an historic figure that is so well known as Alexander is always a risky business. Better luck next time!",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
Reverse Casting,"If they had cast Jared Leto (Hephaistion) as Alexander the film would have had a heart. Instead we get blood and guts.It is difficult to understand the motivation of Alexander if you are going to be half hearted about his love for Hephaistion. You either need to be explicit or leave it to those in the know. A modern American audience might find the former hard to take in a macho battle epic, but it would not have shocked the ancient Greeks. The relationships that drive Alexander are those with his mother, father and Hephaistion. You can hear the Studio shouting at the Director - cut all that gay stuff the mainstream audience will find it a turn off. Unfortunately they are right. So Stone tries to fudge it and fails. Where he succeeds is in the battle scenes. The movie is wonderfully shot and scored. But without a heart you cannot be moved.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Oliver Stone approached this film no differently than the rest of his polarizing films.

Europe will understand better,"A lot of the comments I heard coming out of the US were complaints that the title character was Gay, and that Colin Farrell had died his hair Blonde.Well, firstly, Alexander was noted for his blonde hair and his piercing blue eyes. Secondly he, and a sizable chunk of his professional army, was indeed bisexual. One elite unit being known as 'the Companions' was no accident.Bisexuality was encouraged amongst the ranks. Such an outlook could be viewed as practical in such a campaign as it lessened the rape of indigenous and conquered peoples and made their subjugation and acceptance of Greek rule easier. It also lessened the length of the baggage train, as fewer camp followers would be present.Onto the film itself, yes it's long, but when you enter a film directed by Oliver Stone, that's one of the things you expect (do 'JFK' and Any Given Sunday ring bells with people).I was a little disturbed at first to find the Macedonians sounding like an Irish Boy Band, but as the film rode on, it became more acceptable as it made Colin Farrell's job easier when it came to his driving speeches, added a unifying factor to this small central group of characters and made it abundantly clear (in a nice 'Show don't tell' way) the Angelina Jolie and Rosario Dawson were not of the same nation as the rest of the main cast.The battle scenes are few and far between for a film about the life of the man who conquered not only much of the known world, but also a large chunk of world that had only been viewed before as legendary. The director concentrating more on the personal events of Alexander's life the military achievements which made him famous, tearing down some of the myths and putting in a little of a more believable man, stressed by the power and responsibility in his hands and burdened by the respective desires of his parents and their use of him as a pawn in his early life.I had hoped for greater coverage of the battles in his campaigning life, but was not disappointed by the quality of those that were there, although they may have disappointed some who have marvelled at the Last Alliance, Helms Deep and Pelenor Fields in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, but Alexander is a tale of a real hero and not a fantastical vision of magic and beasts All in all a well conceived, acted and directed picture that has been subjected to unfair comparisons fantastical visions and a misguided comments from an uneducated audience.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Diplomatic, but honest","I have been looking forward to this film for a while now, even though I am not an Oliver Stone fan, I have always loved the story of Alexander the Great.The movie was not what I expected because I didn't find it to be a very ""Hollywood"" type film or an epic film. I found it to really just tell the story of Alexander and I respect Oliver Stone for that. Oliver Stone presents Alexander the Greats life as he found it to be through his research, and while it is laced with Oliver Stone's opinion, it is not forced. He does give you both sides of how things may have been (referring to lovers and his death)and that's fairly rare. I truly felt like I was being told a story about a legendary man. Alexander was also humanized instead of glorified in the film, which I also respect. We see his flaws, his trials, we understand why the people loved him, we see what made him a great leader, and we realize what made him fall.Now, with all that said, I found the performance to be inconsistent. At times I felt the actors weren't sure why they were committing to a line. But at times they were quite powerful. The one sensation that I took away from the film is what a passionate man Alexander was, about all aspects of his life. As for the accents, well they were all over the place and as off putting as that may be, it does not break a film, it hurts it.The camera work on Anthony Hopkins performances was distracting and awkward, but the coverage, angles and cinematography in general in the battle scenes I found to be very effective. The production design was stellar, but the score left me wanting more, a man like that should have had a theme as dynamic as him. All in all, I'm glad I saw it; I wish it was stronger all around, but compared to a lot of the junk that is in theaters these days, it's a fairly respectable film. I give it a c+.On a quick personal note, may I just say that to all the people who feel there should have been homosexual action I just have to say that you don't need sex to portray love. Love is portrayed in this film without a kiss, unless you're deaf and blind. For those who feel Alexander was not bisexual and are offended by the suggestion can just refuse to believe it and write their own film. This is Oliver Stone's interpretation, not yours and he was rather tactful with his suggestion. It's unfortunate that some rate the entire film by that notion.",,Anonymous,Biography
A Magnificent Waste of History,"""Alexander"" is no easy film to analyze, for it have many clashing elements. Stone wanted to film something about Alexander, yet he had no idea what he wanted to communicate.Examples. Old Ptolemy (Hopkins) begins the movie rather well, using proved narration skills to present the politico-geographical situation of the time (with a contemporary map) for the average viewer's benefit, yet the sequences with Alexander himself were more about his sentimental life, personal relations and superficially explored philosophy about establishing ""civilized"" hegemony. No history, no politics there, no word on his handling of the conquest itself. As if the scenes with Hopkins were done as an afterthought to cement the rest.Another one; In such a life rich with strategical genius, Stone chose to show only two battles, barely referring to some other ones. But the battles themselves were magnificent, having the scope of LOTR's mass scenes, coupled with grim, historic realities. He demonstrate that battles quickly becomes a form of restrained chaos, yet he is able to show strategy; You can follow Alexander's companions running for the breach in Darius' army as they race to catch with their own wing by looking on their faces. I don't remember a battle filmed as efficiently, as intensely (don't under-estimate Vangelis' score for that, neither). But the viewer will have to content for only two of these, Gaugamela and the Hydaspes River. The rest of the movie is largely devoted to boudoir scenes.The acting is admittedly a bit of a problem; I felt no respect for Philip of Macedonia, camped as a bumbling drunk with no principles. Jolie definitively had an annoying accent. And overall, Farrel, a good actor by all means, was definitely too small for the role, being far to emotional and whiny to portrait the leader Alexander must have been. However, supporting actors such as Gary Stretch (as Cleitus the Black), Rosario Dawson (divine as Roxanne) and Jared Leto (in the difficult role of Hephaisdion) light up the screen.On this subject, The bi-sexuality aspect was well-handled. maybe a bit over-focused, thought. It does show that this was not the taboo it still is today.But the thing that got me into this film was its magnificence. To enter Babylon, to see its suspended gardens. To live the Hydaspes River battle through the feverish, delirious eye of the wounded, the costumes, the makeup (the Persian warriors did have an over-developed sense of cosmetics) really are eye candy; We have no problem at all being transported back to these epic times.In conclusion, this is one of the best Antic history movie filmed these days, mainly because both silly ""Gladiator"" and over-indulgent ""Troy"" did not set the bar too high. This film is infinitely superior.It just lack a bit of focus.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Bushy,"Well, it was historically more accurate than Troy, King Arthur and the like, the story itself was fairly okay, that is if you do not really know anything except the name. Even the part about Alexander and Hepheistos being lovers. (Even though this fact is a controversy among historians, and some accuse him of being not only bi, but rather a pedophile.) The movie itself was enjoyable, no doubt, and the acting was fairly decent. I liked the battle scenes, as they were more accurate than in other movies. The average life span of a foot soldier (even into the late middle ages) in battle was about 10 minutes.Now let's get to the fishy part: have you noticed all this wild talk about ""liberating"" Persia? At it's peak, Alexander is in Babylon, mumbling about his father who could not bring that kind of freedom to the middle-east and so forth. Man, if I would not know it better, it would be as if the movie was about George W. Bush and his father, who failed in 91 with his little crusade in Iraq. If the movie is a mirror of today's political situation, it is really accurate. Look at it! You have a nation (Macedon) which conquers large parts of the known world, ""liberating"" the people from the oppression of its former rulers. Then Alexander gave the rule back to the people who lived there (in modern words having them elect their own leaders) and pacifies the lands from the Mediteranian to Inda. That sounds fairly familiar, does it not?The more I think about it, the more I dislike the message in the movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Alexander Minus not Magna,"I watched this film three times with three hopes. The first was that I could do some historical recounting and add to my knowledge of the Macedonian hero and his legend. The second was that I catch parts of the dialog that were hard (to my ear) to understand. The third was to give the film a chance, having been influenced by almost unanimous bad or indifferent reviews before seeing it.As a film and man of history, Alexander would have been better served by linear story-telling as opposed to retrospectives of his youth through the narrative of his veteran general, Ptolemy (sorry, Anthony Hopkins). Alexander's youth was more gritty than Stone presented. This kid never got dirty, his hair never messed - even after wrestling matches and horse-breaking. The boy Alexander looked uncannily like Oliver Twist, and his peers at court(and Aristotle's pupils) were the same golden haired Anglos out of the Dickens classic. True, the ancient Greeks (pre-Turkish) could be quite blonde, but give them some Hellenic attributes - somehow - beyond tunics and laurel wreaths. Stone went for the idyllic and the result was cutesy.Then you have the screenplay, which - please - with what they're paying for production - get some really seasoned writers on this - so much of the early dialog was heart-warming Disney-type jibe. There was so much excess verbiage that could have been trimmed and even if Stone did not compromise the overall length, he could have used that time elsewhere and more importantly. Likewise, the soundtrack by Vangelis did not go with this film. So much emotion was lost because of limp background music.Val Kilmer as Phillip was well chosen as the jovial, bombastic King of Macedon and likable in the role.When Phillip shows Alexander around an underground cave, describing the exploits of mythological heroes, I could not make out the mosaics - the camera panned to different sections of cave wall with black soot - and to what point? To have actually seen these epic figures would have had more impact on the narrative. This was interspersed with moments of lingering darkness which did nothing but give the camera a break.Angelina Jolie was stunning and an appropriate choice for Olympias, but her accent was displaced (as were the heavy Scottish brogues) - a distraction throughout this film. English is the language of Shakespeare, but could'nt they have neutralized the regionalism? ""I, Claudius"" worked perfectly with an entirely English cast.Stone leaves out Alexander's trip to Siwa (Egypt) where he is confirmed a god. Considering how Olympias went on (and on and on) about his Achilles blood line, this was crucial to the film. Visit some of his earlier battles, Arbela, etc. Show some background that way (some history) instead of this recurrent Ptolemy retrospective out of that Titans movie with Harry Hamlin (that's what this movie sometimes felt like). Having missed some of the more crucial engagements, intrigues and details of Alexander's life, it's off to Gaugamela.My first thought was, the bird has got to go. An eagle's flight permeated the film from Gaugamela as both a symbol (without prior reference) and for cinematic perspective (a device out of Hitchcock), but cinematography can give us a bird's eye view without the bird. Then later in the film Alexander looks into the sky and wonders where the bird went, thus giving it a character role. The close-ups of a waxen Darius, the Persian king, served no purpose - there was no awe in this recurrent camera perspective. Then they kept tossing around the camera for the battle scene(s), which was brain-rattling.The city of Babylon, the battle prize, was represented well (by computer graphics) and glorious to behold, but the harem scene (like a beauty contest) was silly. The women were too aggressive and trying really hard to be exotic. Babylon was beautiful, but I also wanted to see Pella (other than court-yards), Susa and other cities of the period.And so on, into far Persia and India (a mistake), mutiny and madness, until Alexander returns to Babylon years later, hated and plotted against until his death.What this film taught me about Alexander - he should have listened to his mother.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
Too much A-C-T-I_N-G,"God, who wrote the screenplay? Who edited this? Who wrote the DUH-ramatic score? Thousands of extras, and epic battles doesn't equal a story. I think that this might actually be worse than ""Troy"", which I thought would be hard to do.I think that they did a better job on ""Caligula"". This is porn without the payoff. Spectacle without the spectacular. It's really modern L.A. redoing itself in another historic disguise. Does this make me think? No, because nobody was THINKING when they made this, other than of money and fame.Sad. So many good actors and directors out there.

Bisexual but also qualitatively in the middle,"If this was Oliver Stones ""dream-project"" then I guess we were lucky that he was awake when he made his masterpieces like PLATOON or JFK.The brilliant and innovative camera-work of NATURAL BORN KILLERS seems ages ago when you look at the out-of-focus orgy here (yes, I went to the projectionist and complained). And not just that. There is no doubt that cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto has delivered beautiful pictures in AMORES PERROS or 25TH HOUR but it also makes sense that the cameraman of 21 GRAMMS isn't the right person to do shoot a blockbuster-epic. There are hardly any establishing shots and ever since GLADIATOR someone thinks its good just to shake the camera through battle-scenes so no one sees whats going on.Along with that, Alexander is like a play with a few characters showing only two of the hero's many battles which would be interesting but then the story is told much to fragmentarily and leaves way too many gaps.The great plus tough is that Colin Farrel portraits a bisexual hero and despite all the fuss from conservative Greek lawyers it totally works fine and is the rare example of showing a gay character not as either a funny sidekick, a wimp or a problem child but as a strong leading man.And the film definitely deserves credit for that.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Worst Movie this Year,"Top of the morning to you, now lets invade Asia minor. Yes folks before the Irish invented Whiskey they ruled Greece. The issue that I have with this movies is it didn't even try. Angelina Jolie with what I think was a Russian accent, the Greaks with Irish accents to cover up that Colin didn't try. The sudden push towards the end to prove that it was regicide and not a virus which did him in. This was an awful attempt and a good story. Yes the Greeks and the Romans were know to be gay, and thats fine, but most Americans hated this movie because it sucked from opening credits to the very end. The movie tended to jump around a lot and had to have subtitles to tell you when and where you were in time, since a base line in time was never established. The battles were long and drawn out and brought nothing interesting to the plot. Like Braveheart it was far from accurate, however Braveheart worked because you liked Wallace and hated the King. This movie you just hated everyone. They really should have re-title this movie Alexander: Now with less gay (still boring as mud)",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Mind-blowing.,"When I first went to see Alexander, I was extraordinarily anxious. After all, this film had the potential to be mind-blowing or mind-numbing. I was eager to find out which it would be. At four minutes short of three hours, this film did not disappoint me. It was nothing short of incredible.Oliver Stone, who directed and wrote the script for the film, did a superb job recreating the life of Alexander the Great. With so much material to cover--Alexander's noteworthy childhood, his tutelege with Aristotle, his conquering most of the known world--the director chose the most important points and highlighted them. Instead of filling us with three hours' worth of limb-hacking and gut-spewing, Stone built Alexander into a man with dreams, with weaknesses, into someone who was human, despite the legend surrounding him. The world of the ancients was recreated with tact, and all the gods, the rituals, the wars and the palaces were established to draw the viewer into Alexander's world. The picture abounded with colorful characters and settings.The most important people in Alexander's life--his crazed mother Olympias, his overbearing father, Philip, his best friend and lover Hephaestion--were cast well. There were relationships between the minor characters--the rivalry between Olympias and Philip, the affection between Kleitos and Philip--that made ther story real and believable. One could see how each member of Alexander's family and close circle impacted him, and how he felt about each of them. Most satisfying, however, were the passionate relationships Alexander had with his mother and Hephaestion. Although Olympias only appears a couple of times in the film, most notably the beginning, her love for her son, her hatred for her husband, and her greed are all palpable. Alexander's mingled love and resentment makes one pity him. Hephaestion, although a more constant presence in the film, is not prominent but for a few brief scenes. In these scenes, his conversations with Alexander portray his love and loyalty, and he--who knows Alexander best of all--delivers several important points that bring the viewer to a better understanding of Alexander. On the other hand, the viewer can also see clearly Alexander's dependence on his friend, his gratitude and his caring. Two specific conversations build such emotion that I felt close to tears. The sexual undertones between the two men may disturb some, but the sexuality isn't forced, it is very obvious that what Alexander and Hephaestion have is a deep, undying love, and sex is not necessarily a part of their relationship. However, Hephaestion does wear eyeliner, and it sort of make one wish that they would just get it on.The minor characters, Alexander's generals, and his friends, his soldiers, who may not have many lines in the film, perhaps portray most clearly who Alexander really was. Their admiration of him, their desire to make him happy and proud, and in some cases, the greed that causes them to hurt him, all show how Alexander was different from all other kings of the age. He felt the pain his people felt, and desired most of all to have one world, and one empire, where all would have peace and opportunity. Some resented this, and the racism of some of the characters--most obviously Cassander and Cleitus--makes the world more realistic. But for the most part, he inspired and undying loyalty in all he lead, and it is the fact that he so concerns himself with the common people, and allows himself to be so affected by them, that sets him apart.The plot, interspersed by narration from an old Ptolemy, moves quickly, and touches on the greatest victories and losses of Alexander's life. The battle of Gaugamela, the conquest of the Persian empire, the revolt of his troops in India, all were emotional scenes that underscored the humanity of Alexander. Stone wastes no time on lengthy battle sequences--although there are violent battle scenes, he does not show all of Alexander's conquests--and instead shows the politics behind Alexander's reign. His generals' names are memorable to even the most uneducated viewer, because each general has a unique perspective about Alexander. Their betrayals, of which there are a few, make some of the most heart-breaking moments in the film.My only regret is the short time Stone spends depicting Hephaestion's death and Alexander's reaction to it. While elsewhere in the film their friendship and love is well-shown, some of the most telling things about their relationship were in the way Alexander memorialized him after his death. Perhaps the large battle sequence in India could have been shortened to make room for Alexander's grief over his friend. After all, Hephaestion's funeral was the most grandiose in the entire history of the world, and Alexander spent close to thirteen thousand talents on the events. He sheared off all of his hair when the custom was one lock, and spent a day and a night lying on the body, until he was forcibly removed. The movie skips over most of this, and only allows a short fit of rage in which Alexander almost strangles his wife, thinking she has poisoned him. It then quickly moves on to Alexander's own death, and the controversy surrounding that. I regret the loss of such faithful and touching moments, and think that Colin Ferrel and Jared Leto could have had one of the best ""NOOOOOOOOOO!"" scenes in film.Overall, the film was engrossing and touching, with enough action for the men and enough romance for the women. I myself was enthralled with the passion and anguish that dotted Alexander's life, and appreciated the dedication each of the actors, down to the smallest extra Macedonian soldier, had to their character. Although lengthy, each minute has significance, and I encourage everyone to see it!Mind-blowing, most definitely.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Not good, very very not good","I really wanted to like this movie. I'm a die-hard fan of everything medieval. I'm a card carrying member of the SCA (But the garb WASN'T period) and I've read many many books on this period.After this movie was over (I think it lasted about 8 hours) I was so flummoxed, I could barely talk about it.First the good...some of the scenes shot are among the most beautiful I've ever seen. I don't mean beautiful as in Asian movie scene that never exists in reality beautiful. I mean really beautiful. Remarkably composed, engaging, pulls you to that place kind of beautiful.The acting is also pretty good. Angelina Jolie (who seemed to spend the whole movie in her bedroom playing with snakes and looking hotter than anyone human has a right to look) gives a very memorable performance. Anthony Hopkins (who in the movie looks about 200 years old) provides a voice-over that seems to last longer than Alexander's life. Farrell himself is unremarkable. He has some chops but isn't up to the action sequences. To his credit, I'm not sure anyone would be though, particularly the fight in India.Thats where the good ends.We can talk about the muddled plot line which was wierdly non linear. For some reason, yet to be determined Stone shows Philips assassination about an hour and a half after Anthony Hopkins tells you about it; it was to illustrate the dubious loyalty of a character that had maybe 3 more lines in the whole movie.We can talk about the hard to hear dialogue. There's a lot of it, and not all of it is hard to hear. But the dialogue that is hard to hear is at least 2 movies' worth.The lighting and set directions were competent but Stone seems to rely on extreme closeups (NOSTRIL HAIR!) to build character, shaky hand held stuff to relay chaotic battle scenes and annoying lighting to illuminate the story. He did this much better in Natural Born Killers (with a Woody Harrelson's face going in and out of focus while the word DEMON was lit on his chest).The other thing that I found exhausting was that there was little plot development, which is endemic to biographies but there was no dramatic arc. It was like Stone spent so many years developing Alexander that he couldn't decide what to get rid of. Being the heavyweight in Hollywood that he is (rightfully so in the case of many of his movies) I guess he decided that he didn't have to get rid of anything.The issue that seems to be the focus of so much media debate is that of Alexander's bisexuality. Its pretty unimportant to the movie that the love of Alexander's life seems to have been a male played by Jared Leto who is really really disturbing looking. They used an awful amount of eye liner on the man, really really badly and I cringed whenever he came on screen. That seems to be a theme for me with Jared. I haven't been able to look at him without cringing since Requiem for a Dream.The gay themes aren't important. But then again, neither is the movie.",,Anonymous,Biography
not a documentary but a film,"Alexander is not documentary, but is a film so it was an interpretation created by his director who choose some part of Alexander's history, the trouble of managing the power of an unimaginable empire and what were the meaning and the feeling of new conquests and discoveries 2000 years ago, and throw this mains themes there was a message that it compares Alexander to the other legends of that archaic world, and at the end we can say that maybe archaic history it was only an interpretation and an opinion of historians ideas. Maybe at the beginning we can think that the film left the beautifuler part of Alexander's formation and conquest of the power, we can have the feeling that the beginning of the film is discontinuous, but this is alone the result of the selection of the director that its fulfillment is concentrated on the more difficult part of the history. the way in which the Macedonians came to contact with new life shapes and new civilizations is incredible and Oliver Stone succeeds to decrease the same spectator in the wonder of the discoveries. i think that Troy in its it confronts is like a comic strip in the comparisons of a novel. thx",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Brief and unsatisfying,"After watching this film and subsequently reviewing the comments of other members, I have come to agree with a small portion of them. I do appreciate the extent for Hollywood's attempt to recreate a ""Laurence of Arabia"" production, but they lost some aspects historically speaking. However, the most significant problem with this film, like many other films is the authenticity of accents. Not only are they wholly wrong on many levels, but completely inconsistent within a characters development. At times, I felt by listening to the voices that I was in Ireland and others, that I was in Siberia Russia (are they not in Greece and from the same towns in some instances?). It is either this case or the lead actors, who are Irish, and are incapable of changing their accents--thus all other actors had to change theirs.In any case, if a film maker is going to attempt a film of any historical value, all aspects should be attended to or they will lose authenticity.Other than that, I appreciated the subject matter and allowed for some historical inaccuracies. Then again, most writers and producers are not historical scholars, but with this budget, keeping one on retainer would not hurt (ahhem...""Mona Lisa Smile"").",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Bad actors, bad writing, bad cinematography, bad movie","Any man that could conquer such a vast portion of the world in only ten years with the technology constraints of the ancient world must have been not only a great military genius, but also a genius of a politician and an extremely charismatic figure. Once he had established his uncanny skill on the battlefield, many cities throughout the world surrendered and joined his empire without even putting up a fight. After Alexander defeated Darius III, the Persians at Babylon greeted him as a god. Despite being one of the most legendary human beings that has ever lived, Oliver Stone astoundingly decided to focus the majority of the film on something as petty as the sex life of Alexander the Great.Oliver Stone portrays Alexander as moody, spoiled, weak, and alarmingly indecisive. If the true Alexander had acted even close to the way that Stone portrays him, there is no doubt that his advisers would have assassinated him before he had even set foot in Persia. Stone's Alexander actually screams like a girl and throws a tantrum at least twice in the movie.As for the battle choreography, it is probably the worst of a major film in the past ten years at the very least. It may not even have been revolutionary if it had been shot in 1960. The Battle of Gaugamela, one of the greatest victories in the history of the world, that left the army of Darius, King of Kings, completely annihilated and his empire open for free reign, is depicted by Stone to be remarkably slow-paced and anti-climactic.In short, it is inconceivable that the producers deemed this film worthy of investment, and it is a sacrilege to the great man and a stain on his memory that this travesty of a film was ever made.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Excellent, like an undervalued stock.","So, I have been warned to expect some sort of ""subtle homoerotic (however way homoeroticism can be perceived as 'subtle') scenes"" even before I crossed the newly polished cinema threshold. See, I read the papers and I know history, unlike explosive characters out there who bloody expected Alexander to be straight. Simply, I had an idea what was going to be shown before me.I entered that frosty theatre, bound to be coated in hard icicles since I forgot my sweater, intrigued by the well-known story of the film, driven by being a Farrell Fanatic, and anxious to see how Oliver Stone made this movie - liking his previous works. And I sat down.Dear God.What I think brought distraught to many, is the fact that Alexander's sexuality was played out in the open field. Silly, the bloody people of this earth. They were too held up in the controversy.Someone even mentioned that the movie made him/her see that men are better lovers and women are just for legal purposes - DUDE, that was 2,500 years ago. MAYBE, just MAYBE, those were the ways of their royalties.PLEASE, people, find it in you to consider the time gap. 323 B.C., OK?And funnier is the outrage that seemed to overflow within individuals concerning legalizing gay marriages of today. Seriously. Alexander lived way before Christ was conceived. Alexander liked women and men, not too much of a tumultuous reality in their times, now was it?In short, for the 'sex scandals', SO WHAT?!Really, the movie, as I realized it, was meant to portray the determination Alexander had in him to reach the end of the world. He wanted something and he went all those miles, literally, to go and get it. That's what Oliver Stone wanted to get thru. Though he seemed to have failed congregating the audience to follow his focus having put in the same picture Alexander's sexual preferences - or people are just plain stupid.But then again, I don't think it was too much of an issue, this sexuality of his. Again, so what? Open your minds, his sexual escapades were not the only reasons this movie was rendered hence it must not be the only thing you're allowed to notice (and bash).Oh yeah, the acting. To be fair, and as a learning actress myself, the acting was over done but fine enough. The actors had been able to convey their emotions and I'm sure, I felt the love and fear during the war scenes. Colin Farrell and Jared Leto proved themselves, as Angelina Jolie made herself into a whole of perfection.And the different accents. Yes, that was off-putting, but the acting made up for it - ADMIT IT, you conservative, over-underestimating, biased flock of human degradation.Behind the scandals, this film is actually laudable. It's a flow of the significance of why and how Alexander was able to almost conquer the world. And I think, in the bottom of everything, that was what should have been made to matter. And somehow, Stone was able to make us understand but in such a way that confounded the other masses.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Not Stone's best, but still a good film(The Director's Cut)","At first when I saw the movie for the first time, I didn't really enjoy it since there were too much chat chat and didn't really know what was happening. Then when the Director's cut came out, I decided to give it another chance and Stone has improved it a lot. It was more fast paced then the original. Usually my dad sleeps when he watches long movies, but he didn't sleep through this which means it doesn't get boring one bit. But what disappointed me was that it seemed like he cut out a few battle footage and made it less violent which was a bugger. I also wanted a few homo scenes to be cut out and only have maybe 1 or 2 scenes of them. Other than that, I really enjoyed more than the original.If you didn't enjoy it the first time, give it another chance, I'm sure you'll like it more.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Oliver Stone has finally ""lost it...""","Of course Mr. Stone can still sling a yarn, but previously one always felt one at least knew why he wanted to do the project in the first place; now he seems out of sorts, not really knowing what to do with himself. Clearly a lot of material had to be excluded for a palatable cinematic running time; maybe this would have been better as a mini-series on HBO or something. The movie's chief weakness for me is Irish ""heart-throb"" Colin Farrell in the title role; apparently Stone sees Alexander as a kind of ancient Greek Hamlet, and if there's any quality that Farrell doesn't exude very well, it's self-doubt. Farrell seems confused as to whether Alexander is supposed to be gay or straight or ""bi"" or whatever and is convincing in none of those capacities. (In the scenes with Rosario Dawson from ""The Rundown"" I actually worried about his physical well-being.) Also, to be convincing as somebody who had to keep pushing endlessly for new worlds to conquer, there had to be just a touch of lunacy lurking. Maybe Jude Law could have carried it off or even Ewan McGregor. But it's always fun watching Angelina Jolie especially when she's playing with snakes and/or doing an exotic accent, and a lot of the visuals are gorgeous, especially the Babylon scenes. But it's definitely time for Anthony Hopkins to retire, I mean seriously; after ""The Human Stain"" and now this, he needs to get knighted, settle down and write his tell-all autobiography...",,Anonymous,Biography
"Overly ambitious and uneven, but worth a look","People didn't like this movie mostly because of Alexander the Great's bisexuality. Frankly, I find it ridiculous, since in ancient Greece ""bisexuality"" was not only frequent, but also accepted. Moreover, there's only one actual sex scene in the movie, and a pretty laughable one at that, featuring Alexander's (Colin Farrell) tormented wedding night with his wife Roxane (Rosario Dawson). The incriminated moments, namely the Great's ""affair"" with childhood friend Hephaestion (Jared Leto), are very chaste, all based on looks, not even a kiss. Those scenes are a bit awkward, that's true, and you might think one such sequence would have been enough, but the ""gay scenes"" are actually the least significant of Alexander's many problems.It's easy to see why Oliver Stone wanted to make this ambitious film: like most of his work, it's a story of power, paranoia and conspiracies (JFK, anyone?). This is evident from the beginning, when Ptolemy (Anthony Hopkins), the movie's narrator, remembers Alexander's childhood (the film's most even section, albeit too short): the young boy is constantly prepared to become king of Macedonia, by practicing horse riding and receiving a proper education from the famous Aristotle (Christopher Plummer). Nonetheless, his life is far from happy, courtesy of his parents: king Philip (Val Kilmer, a riotous but underused presence) is a drunken, foolish tyrant who will even get married three times in order to make friends with the right people; queen Olympias (a scene-stealing turn from Angelina Jolie) is a cruel, manipulative woman, frequently surrounded by snakes and eager to get her husband out of the way. In fact, when the king is murdered, she doesn't mourn him at all (and conspiracy theorists will happily feed on this).With two individuals like those raising him, it's no wonder Alexander decided to leave his home and conquer most of the then known world, a masterful task he fulfilled before suddenly and mysteriously dying, aged 33 (the movie actually opens with that scene, played in slow motion). And it's in telling this part of the story, which occupies most of the film, that Stone exceeds in his ambitions, just like his subject did: the director feels completely at home when he's staging the massive, chaotic, gory battle sequences, but there are only two of them in a movie that's almost three hours long, and he fails to inject the same energy and enthusiasm in most of the scenes showcasing the Great's last years, when the almighty conqueror becomes a paranoid loner. It also doesn't help that Colin Farrell never fully manages to shake off his ""bad boy"" image (and his Irish accent), something that gives a ""camp"" feel to certain moments. This also occurs when Stone starts hinting at an incestuous affair between Olympias and Alexander, a suggestion that brings the mother/son scenes to the brink of the ridiculous, courtesy of excessive shouting from Farrell and too many ""evil"" looks from Jolie (Stephen Frears pulled off a much better job handling the same theme on The Grifters).Still, this movie is worth watching: it may not be Stone's best, but when he really nails it, he makes you understand what a fascinating and unique man Alexander the Great was.6,5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"The Dramatic Story of the Last Real Hero, A Man with Megalomania","First of all I would like to say this is an amazing movie! Oliver Stone succeeds to bring the Hellenic civilization back to life. People who say this movie is boring are so wrong!! This film has fascinated me from begin till end. Stone aims his eyes on nature, he films the sky/the woods a lot. The beautiful nature and cities (Babylon) are the best parts of this film. The two battles are certainly the best I have EVER seen! In the first battle is the eagle very cool, and the second, it is beautiful how fast the camera moves, till the Ucefallus-jump to that elephant! A Matrix Battle, but 2300 years ago... Emotional, this film is also GREAT! The conflicts between Alexander, his father and his mother, as watcher, you experience them all like you are in the room yourself! The nudity-scene is pure emotional and it shows us how it was, out there. Yes, Alexander the Great was g*y, but so what? What difference does it make? It was normal in that time, and I'm glad that Oliver Stone faces that...One of the Greatest ever! A Classic! Congratulations, Oliver Stone!",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
how the Irish conquered the world,"Although the producers tried to present Alexander and classical Greece as realistic as possible, they still went a bit overboard in a few important instances. I was surprised that they decided to present Alexander as more fond of boys unlike they did in Troy where Achilles was never seen in any of his famous homosexual pursuits, but it did add to the realism. I also enjoyed the antagonist motherly figure that was presented as the hidden force behind Alexander's glory and his weaknesses, but just like the homosexuality, it was a bit exaggerated and was taken too far.The Greeks that speak with Irish accent was definitely not necessary. I wasn't sure if I was watching some sort of a Celtic conquest adventure or a story of Hellenic glory. The attempt at making the movie more artsy and inverting color during the best battle in the movie was out of place as well. For me at that point in turned into a cartoon. Some scenes were cut and pasted in the middle of the movie when even though they were quite important to the storyline made no sense in the particular context. Most important conquests and exploits of Alexander (e.g. his first conquest and first few victories as well as the story of the Gordian Knot) were not even mentioned. This disjointness and selective development of Alexander's story prevented me from enjoying the movie completely, but I thought it was still a lot better at presenting Hellenic world than the Hollywood's last attempt with Troy.This movie is far from a masterpiece of even a must see. It is too long, sometimes too pointless and often more than not drags its own feet in a circle without saying much, but it's still not a terrible movie and is somewhat entertaining on the first run.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
I thought Alexander was a brilliant general:  stupid me,"In this film you wouldn't know it. He was in battles, but the battles seemed little more than two armies going at it. What I would have enjoyed was learning about his thinking about military strategy, his tactics, his philosophies, how he implemented his ideas on the battlefield.Instead, we get a (very boring) story of Alexander as being a mama's boy and as someone trying unsuccessfully to please his father. It is the story of a neurotic, not of one of the greatest generals of all time.There are a few great battles, but after awhile they too get boring. What was happening? All you see is the small picture (guys hacking each other up). You don't see Alexander planning, plotting, strategizing, analyzing, etc. He's just another guy hacking away.He doesn't come across as a great man.The decision to jump around in history is puzzling. It makes the film hard to follow and disjointed. We don't get a sense of change in him, or in the world, or in his leadership or his generalship. It's cute, but distracting.The film is as bad as most people have rated it to be. There is nothing about him that would make me want to follow him. Instead, I'd want to give him a hankie so he would have something to cry into.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
Mediocre - could have been a lot better,"when i first heard about this movie i was thrilled. It really sounded like it would be one of the greatest movies ever. But when i saw it, i was disappointed.I will make this as short as possible: this movie did not work very well because Oliver Stone turned a very complex historical character more complex and added a more complex storyline. That is the main flaw of this movie, and why it did not do as well as you could expect.Alexander the great and his empire and conquest of the world is a very complex historical piece. This would be hard to translate to the cinema. Oliver Stone then adds a very complex childhood and father-mother scenario to the film. In its own, this would be a very cinematic piece. But when it is added to a complex storyline and a complex main character the movie kinda falls apart. The whole part of Alexanders Bisexuality is also a thing Oliver Stone could have toned down or just not included in the story. It combined with all the other complex element makes for a movie, which is not that well suited for cinema. This movie should have been half as long. It should have been centered around the conquest of the world, and not Alexanders bisexuality.The battle scenes, music and pictures are very beautiful and well made in this movie. This movie could have been so much better, if they had just made a VERY simpler storyline and much simpler characters. Oliver Stone could then just have included the cinematic release on the DVD only, and released a simpler version of the film.That is my critique. I was disappointed. This should have been an epic war-movie, but it became a weird art-movie instead.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Really really bad,"I knew this movie got bad reviews, but I rented the DVD anyway in part because there were so many good comments on this site, which I usually find pretty reliable. Not this time, guys. After seeing the movie (the parts I could stay awake for, anyway), I'm shocked that there are so many reviewers who gave it a 9 or 10. I guess I should've paid more attention to the average score, which reflects the opinions of those who didn't want to waste any more of their lives thinking about this movie to write a review.And all of you trying to convince people it's worthwhile really shouldn't give away the fact that you don't know what you're talking about when you say the story is historically accurate.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Saga well done , but far too long!","This film featured the best and worst for any audience, the worst being it was dragged out for too long and was very wordy - particularly the Anthony Hopkins parts (he was brilliant, as usual, but far too verbose!) - the best were the brilliant scenes of battle, the scenery, and I am delighted to say that the acting was very good. Colin Farrell was a big surprise as Alexander - he did very well (even tho he sometimes fell into his own accent!), while Val Kilmer was unrecognisable, Angelina Jolie was beautiful (but her love of snakes disturbing) and Jared Leto was very effective. How true to History, I do not know, but that is somewhat irrelevant to me providing it is entertainment, and this was that on a grand scale. There is no doubt that Alexander the Great was one of the finest Soldiers of all time, but somehow this was lost a bit in the telling. I do recommend it, as I consider it a very worthwhile effort that must be seen on the big screen.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Worst movie ever.,"Why, Oliver Stone, why? This movie made me actually consider never watching another period piece ever again. This is also the first movie to ever make me seriously consider getting up and leaving the theater. Oliver Stone even said this movie was schlock. He wanted to do it because the story is one of the greatest ever told. However, that being said, a lot of people want their hands on it. Oliver Stone (Natural Born Killers, Any Given Sunday, Platoon) was not allowed to make the movie he wanted. I know he produced it, and co-wrote it, but it must have been the execs that screwed him over here. Casting choices are unbelievably stupid. And the way the story has been edited does not fit together sensically. Okay, so Rosario Dawson and Anjelina Jolie are hot... but why do they sound like Nosferatu?? I won't go off on Colin Farrell, but honestly he cannot stop that accent! He's Irish... NO, he's American, NO... he's SOMETHING THAT ISN'T MEDITERRANEAN! Now, how was this Irish kid born from transylvanian Jolie and American Val Kilmer. By the way I think Val Kilmer's performance was pretty good,keeping in mind that NO ONE'S accent made sense. And I know there are so many aspects to this story, you could make a ten hour movie,but they should have picked one part and told it. I just don't understand why at the END of the movie, they would choose to go back and show Blondie's coronation. Through the whole movie, I'm wondering why in God's name is Alexander king already? Where's his father? At least they cleared that up, but they spent about 5 minutes on it. It's a crucial turning point to the story, don't you think? Out of a 3 hour movie, it's amazing to me how much they downplayed actual historical events and filled up all that space with painful unneeded schlock. And that's why I'm going to stick to books or comics when there is a great story at risk of being butchered by terrible casting, editing, acting and really anything else that can go wrong with a movie. Example? Alexander. The worst movie I have ever seen and ever expect to see.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
What strange accents!,"I went to see Alexander and - even though I had no high hopes - it managed to be a bit of a disappointment. The story line was rushing from one battle to the next with some ""emotional"" acts between them. There was no clear message what kind of a man Alexander was. And then the accents: Alexander's mother would have been better cast in a James Bond movie as a Russian spy and there were a lot of Irish accents around. Very strange. I would have preferred no accents or only sticking to one. The battle sequences were okay although most of the times it was not clear how the battle progresses until suddenly one side won. Even a bird's eye view could not compensate for this. The sets were fine although at some points it looked like they didn't construct windows but only painted windows (especially in the set where Alexander first saw his wife). The music was terrible. Music by Vangelis is not appropriate for this movie! It reminded me too much of Chariots of Fire. Bad choice that music. Colin Farell was not very convincing as a man that was suppose to rally a whole army to fight an overwhelming enemy. The movie may be historically accurate but I had better hopes for a movie about Alexander the Great.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Alexander could have been great.,"I really did not really feel that strong an emotional link unlike other movies of this type like Gladiator. In movies like that you somehow sympathize with the main characters through their sufferings and victories.In terms of storytelling there were a lot of events that I wish the filmmakers could have done better. The battle scenes were too little considering the area the actual man had conquered. Also there were a lot of areas during the battles were I got confused. It was really hard to see what was being done and how it affected the battle.There were also some scenes which I though could have done in a grander scale considering how events in the history books described it. Events such as the crossing of the Hindu  Kush, as well as the battle with Darius.I thought the props and visual effects team did a good enough job in setting part of the tone of the film. The make-up team did a good job in transforming the soldiers as the effects of many battles were clearly shown.I thought this was one of Colin Farrell's better acting performances. He did a fine job in portraying the passionate general of old. I also thought that both Angelina Jolie and Val Kilmer did a good enough job. I was just a little hard to imagine them being parents to Farrell.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Not Great at All,"Whee-oo! A genuine stinker! It's amazing that a major director with a vast budget and mostly great actors can make such a terrible movie. It's almost as amazing that some reviewers liked this film! Takes all kinds, I guess; that's what makes the world go round. Oliver Stone misses the boat entirely in depicting a great man. Instead, he gives us an unimposing, doe-eyed, teary, sexually-confused and preoccupied wimp (maybe some viewers relate to this in our world today) in the form of Colllin Farrell. Aside from my opinion that Farrell is badly miscast, it is just unbelievable that this character could conquer anything, much less the world! The film is way too talky, spends way too much time on Alexander's emotional and sexual soul-searching  which all comes off as an indulgent waste of time in a bloated film that cries out for major editing. The plot wanders, the viewer is subjected to LONG stretches of dialog that go nowhere, and one is left shaking their head and mumbling, ""THIS was Alexander?"" Stone got lost back in there somewhere, and forgot that however flawed, any man as great as Alexander had to have been epic in some fashion. This movie never gets there. And get a good helmet! This film is a bleary, indulgent, neurotic waste of resources.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Not Oscar worthy but not that bad,"A lot of people including myself saw previews of this movie and thought Oscars immediately, until i saw the movie itself. You see great previews with amazing sets and the potential of a great film but it falls short. The acting was good, but not excellent. The costumes and scenery were excellent though, and truly made you believe you were next to Alexander in his world. The major problem though was plot. It concentrated too much on Alexanders passion for men, and not his conquering nature. It had only 2 battles in the whole movie, each about 20 minutes, which I felt was not enough when telling the story of the greatest conqueror of all time. It lost my attention and just wasn't interesting enough for the epic it could of been. If you appreciate scenery and costumes, then see Alexander, otherwise wait until video. Too bad too, with all those actors and Oliver Stone at the helm you would think great movie for sure, but just wasn't that way. Only 40 minutes worth of battle if that and the rest plot, with plenty of boring parts that didn't go anywhere. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Alexander the great?,"A historical epic like Oliver Stone's ""Alexander"", depends on its lead actor. Colin Farrel was just a complete mistake! His Irish accent, too obviously bleached blonde hair, it really killed the film. Angelina Jolie, one of my favourite actresses, fares no better, why on earth does she sound like a Russian countess! The film has its moments, but the miscasting brings it down.The entry into Bablyon is magnificent and the last battle in India is right up there with Stone's best stuff, but it cannot make up for the terrible acting of the leads. Only Val Kilmer came off well here. Vangelis' score is evocative and moving and the photography is first rate. Why after seeing the dailies didn't Stone realize how wrong Farrel and Jolie were? He has enough clout to recast his movie even once its in production. A real shame as Alexander is a fascinating figure. Even the slow-moving '55 version with Richard Burton is better entertainment than this. The cast just bombs out here, even Rosario Dawson, usually excellent, is supporting a mysterious accent that makes her unintelligible. The best acting was done by Alexander's horse Bucephaelus! A real shame, don't torture yourself, rent ""Troy"" instead.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
Excellent costumes and good battle scenes,The costumes in this film were excellent - probably the most accurate I have seen in a film set in the ancient world. The Macedonian phalanx was very well done as well. They actually seemed to try to stay in formation during the battle rather than turning into an armed mob as in most films showing ancient battles. I was also impressed that the film correctly followed the general thrust of the historical story (though with a lot left out).I also though that the acting was no where near as bad as the critics made out - much better than in Troy for example.For me the main problem was trying to compress about three films worth of material into one film. This probably means that if you don't know the history very well it is hard to understand how all the episodes fit together into the overall story. It may have been better to concentrate on a shorter period rather than to cover the whole of Alexander's life.,7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Alexander, a good idea poorly executed","Alexander had the potential to be one of those sensational epics that explore the nature of a renowned historical figure. Instead it was a mishmash of accents, bad wigs & time jumps which left the audience saying ""wtf?"" OK so Hephaistion was pretty hot, and Angelina Jolie at least made the effort to sound Greek, but we have no idea why Val Kilmer felt that King Phillip needed to be Scottish for this one - was it just an easier accent than Greek? Or was it so he sounded more like the rest of the apparently Irish/Scottish/English ""Macedonian"" army? I swear one of these men said ""Aye"" with a decidedly Scottish brogue in the middle of an important speech and said he wanted to go ""Haeme"" (Or Home, for those of us who aren't from the Northern portion of the United Kingdom). It seemed very much that huge and important chunks of the Alexander story were jumped over and the film relied heavily on historical knowledge that some people just don't have to fill the gaps. On the up side, I think the way Alexander's relationship with his friend Hephaiston was handled did not warrant the public uproar that it received. What is more, some of the sets were truly beautiful, particularly Babylon, and it was great to have something so lovely to look at while trying to figure out what was going on and whether Alexander was secretly Irish. Our recommendation - don't see Alexander unless you like watching long, apparently pointless, battle scenes with motivational speeches that make you wonder when Alexander is just going to come out with ""They may take our lives, but they'll never take our FREEDOOOMMMM!""",4.0,Anonymous,Biography

Drag's On Throughout Which Lets The Film Down.,"From all the reviews I had heard for this film I didn't know what to expect when I eventually got around to watching it, but what I can say is that I found them to be all completely bias. (If Colin Farrell let's this film down, What the hell did Clive Owen do to 'King Arthur'?) The film to me was of a good standard.Jolie puts in an really good performance as Alexander's scheming mother as does Farrell for the hero himself, Of course Farrell did receive criticism for his Irish accent but I ask those certain people to remember that it is only a movie, At that time I don't think they would have spoken English anyway! Another factor to point out was the battle scenes, which may I say were done brilliantly even though there are only two major scenes throughout the whole film. As with every film it does have it's problems, In this I'm afraid it's Anthony Hopkins and Val Kilmer who do tend to ramble on a bit when it comes to them.Overall, Alexander is a definitely a film for those of a more mature nature who don't mind sitting through a lot of dialogue before getting to the action but if you are one of those who get bored easily Alexander is totally not the film for you.*** Good",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Epic Disaster,"If Oliver Stone is ever charged with murder and wants to plead the insanity defense, he can use Alexander as Exhibit A. Alexander is a three hour train wreck that may rank as one of the biggest bombs in movie history.Alexander was one of the greatest military leaders in history and by the age of 32 he had conquered most of the civilized world. None of his military genius or the inner drive that made him the terror of the ancient world, however, is explored in Alexander. Instead, Oliver Stone focuses on Alexander's sexuality and on his insane, snake-handling mother, played by Angelina Jolie, with what sounds like a Transylvanian accent.Colin Farrel is spectacularly miscast as Alexander. The slightly-built actor sports a ridiculous blond wig, and looks more like a surfer dude who would have a tough time beating Jolie in an arm wrestling contest, than the ruthless conqueror of nations (think Leonardo DiCaprio as Patton). The acting is universally awful and scenes continue endlessly with no apparent point. There are only two battle scenes in the entire movie and both are so confusing it is tough to tell what the hell is happening.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Gods-awful picture!,"Never before would I have dreamed of submitting a critique of anyone's work, especially here. But after my experience last night I couldn't rest until I got it off my chest! I had to turn this bactrian banality off once Farrel/Alexander got to India and before I dropped off in a catatonic stupor from watching the title actor sleep walk through his lines or stare past the camera like an imbecile. When the script did give him something to bite into he simply raised his voice and made spittle fly off his lips: this is acting?? How did such a great adventure turn into such melodramatic mush? The photography and sets had great potential but ended up looking like snapshots from my Uncle's last Wyoming trip. The flahsbacks and story structure must have had the Titans spinning in their graves under Mt Olympus for the complete lack of story telling ability.Its obvious that either Stone lost complete control of this picture early on or he simply is an overindulgent hack who lucked out with a couple of good production teams early in his career. I could see Gilliam turning out this kind of crap if he was over medicated with anti-depressants. Consider this: if Peter Jackson (and I think he's just a lucky, big budget craftsman rather than a creative filmmaker) had made Alexander, wouldn't it have been a hell of a lot richer, more textured, much more well made and plain old more watchable?? And believe me, that's not really a homage to Jackson! Oliver Stone blew it on Alexander, big time!",,Anonymous,Biography
"By the cast and by the great and competent director, could be so much better.","Alexander undoubtedly must have been a disappointment at the time, because the film had Oliver Stone in the lead, who made one of the best war films in history, Platoon, which is my favorite portrayal of the Vietnam War, Colin Farrell, Angelina Jolie, Anthony Hopkins, Jared Leto, Val Kilmer, Rosario Dawson, Christopher Plummer and etc in the cast, and between the years 1990 to 2005 we had more or less epic movies, the spectacular Braveheart, the excellent Gladiator, the assiduous Troy, the controversial The Passion of Christ by Mel Gibson, the weak King Arthur, and many others, I did not put Lord of the Rings that is spectacular, because it is a fantasy film, Alexander has positive points besides the cast, the photography is good, the costumes are Good, the battle scenes are good, the script is very problematic, the film is very long, has 3 hours and 20 minutes, and the script does not support and the film gets tiring, and Oliver Stone has to do good jobs again , Because he is an excellent director, Alexander is not bad, it is a regular movie, it could be much better for the director and the great cast.

Alex,"I like epic movies especially when it involves history and human greatness. You have a topic here that qualifies however if one is to believe the movie, the subject matter namely Alexander was deeply flawed. The dysfunctions that he suffered from actually supplied the power and drive to do what he did i.e. to conquer and take over that which had never been done before just because he could. having cruel parents who specialize in crazy-making allowed his inner demons to flourish. The movie shows that after a conquest, he liked to return the situation to a status quo and one wonders why he bothered to in the first place. He lived a life of excess, irresponsibility, absolute power, sex-centered, alcoholic fueled daily existence that in the end contributed to his self-destruction. He set himself up to die so to speak. Why? He had no depth, meaning or purpose. Just an empty drive to succeed. He surrounded himself with people that supported his vanity and ego-centric comings and goings. He was not rare in that respect for history shows that all great men have peculiarities. The movie delivers these observations and more. The director comes from abundance when putting a story together which I consider a good thing. The actors each had good screen time to pitch their trade and did well. One thing though. I always notice that in certain movies like Braveheart, Return of the King, The 300, Troy and this one, the leader gives a speech to thousands of men and they cheer him on but for the life of me, how can they all hear what he saying? Only those within earshot get it which means about 100 at the most. Do the rest just do a ""wave"" and go along with the front group? I also had trouble with Alexander not taking the time to have many sons of which he had access to do. Again, this contributes to a self-sabotage theme for this conqueror. Oliver Stone did different versions of this movie and it gets confusing keeping track of it all. Was I glad I watched it? Sure. However, it is not something one wants to see again for it lacks the must see again scenes and has a lot of don't want to see scenes again in it as well.

What went wrong?,"I was as pumped to see this movie as anyone when this came out, in spite of the negative reviews. I was thinking it would be a movie like WINDTALKERS, which got totally slammed, but was a fun retread nonetheless if not taken seriously. When I finally got to see it, I found out, yeah... it is a huge mess, and uninteresting as the main actors - Farrell and Jolie, are absolutely dull and out of place. They're akin to casting DiCaprio and Cameron Diaz in GANGS OF NEW YORK. These young hipster actors just don't work in historical epics. Maybe Billy Zane or Christian Bale would work... but no more Orlando Blooms. Who can take these seriously? In 50 years when people look back on this, how is a young Colin Farrell going to stack up against a young Marlon Brando or Richard Burton? Will anyone even remember Farrell? There are diamonds in the rough to be had though... Vangelis's music is among his best in recent years, grand and orchestral tough retaining a little of his trademark soaring synthesizers. It works very well in a period piece. Brian Blessed and Christopher Plummer have welcome (if too brief) cameos... and the scene where Alexander attacks the elephant with his horse (though overblown) works fairly well.The rest of the movie is (to put it in English) utter pap. Stone did such great work with JFK, PLATOON, and arguably NATURAL BORN KILLERS... what happens when you stick him with a lot of great genre actors and Vangelis? How did this go wrong? Oh yeah, Farrell and Jolie... not to mention a mishandled story from page 1. At least they never made the Alexander movie Baz Luhrman was planning for so long to star Leonardo DiCaprio... THAT would have likely been even worse.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
"a noble, inspired film","Oliver Stone's film is as impassioned as Alexander, himself. Alexander(Colin Ferrel) begins to tame his fear by overcoming it. Beginning with the taming of Bucephalus, the wild horse, He sought his destiny, by overcoming his fear. His aim; To match the glory of Achilles. His father(Phillip) teaches him that there is no glory without suffering, and that greatness comes from loss.He would go on to conquer Asia, Southeast Egypt and be declared the ""true son"" of Zeus.The battle sequences in the film had a wide area of weapons and the above shots gave an overhead scope of the battle. Even, a little J.F.K was referenced with ""back and to the left"" being said during the battle with the army of Darius.He sought to unite Macedonia and Asia and in doing so sought to overcome the prejudices against both Greek and Asian, by uniting his lineage with Roxane(a very sexy Rosario Dawson). The climactic battle in India with horse backed warriors against soldiers from India on mounted Elephants was epic. Stone using red film stock switches to emphasize his vision of battle. With some premonition, Alexander sees his death in the reflection( of Medusa) of the wine he's about to drink. During this time, men abandon him, as he sought conspirators within his camp. Great performances by Colin Ferrell, Jared Leto, Val Kilmer, Anthony Hopkins and Angelina Jolie, who displayed impressive range as an actress(by playing a woman older than she really is).Oliver Stone delivered a condensed, impassioned film about The Greatest Alexander of all.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Gay problem of an ancient!,"I hoped to see real historical film with great battles. But instead it i saw gay problem of an ancient rather than historical plan.

Especially in dying scene and when Alexander was riding. What was Andgelina Golie doing in this film i can't understand. She performed like Alexander's mother but she looked like his wife. In every time when they were approaching i was thinking that now they are going to kiss. And eventually they did that. Enough critic now time complements.

Highly Entertaining - even if it is Oliver Stone,"Cinematically, I give this movie exceedingly high marks. The primary characters in this movie didn't grab me, it was the outstanding supporting roles, including that of Alexander's horse. Cleitus was hands down, my favorite character and met the most tragic, undeserving end one can imagine from such a faithful and devoted man.I thought Val Kilmer did a great job, as did Sir Anthony Hopkins. Angelina Jolie was strong as well, except for that bizarre accent, which sounded more like that of someone who just got off the boat from Montenegro, not Macedonia. Colin Ferrell did a very respectable job in this role and it appears as if he's just not come into his ""avante guard"" own among the US critics yet. He did a fine job and turned in a more than worthy performance.There has been much mention made on this site about the use of Celtic accents in the movie. This was obviously intentional, inflicted for the sole purpose of giving the film a Shakesperean tragedy feel to it. If it was acceptable in a series as brilliantly produced as I Claudius, why is it unacceptable in this medium? That wasn't bothersome to me at all - Jolie's accent was atrocious. The only accent that bothered me was the heavy Scots accent during a dispute between Alexander and one of his oldest generals - I couldn't understand a freaking word the guy said.This movie would have been a nice cinematic history lesson, were it not for Oliver Stone's incessant need to constantly interject conspiracy theories into every single movie he creates. He is very tiresome with the never-ending rubs he throws in there, the evil, racially intolerant generals, liberal vs. conservative nuances, which of course, ends in a lesson being that the one who supports diversity is the martyr, regardless of whether or not the espousal of such a notion during that period in world history was catastrophic. The inference is that Alexander was poisoned through treachery - in reality, it took Alexander 12 days to die - there was no known poison of the period that took more than 1 day to claim its victim. Perhaps this is why the critics didn't like the movie - historically, it is dishonest. Perhaps I am not the only one who's grown weary of Oliver Stone.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Too Much Talk - Not Enough Action,"I saw Alexander at a screening last night and it's perfectly awful. There's a historic war and costume epic somewhere smothered under dense declarative text where the actor reads and reads till your eyeballs dry out. A less-is-more attitude in the cutting room would have made this a better filmic experience. Stone planned, shot and edited the great battle sequences crisply, and they are convincing, authentic in feeling and appropriately gory and violent. Other good things: costumes, sets, photography, sweeping scenery, Vangelis music, reliably seamy-faced Brit character actors. But an excess of stagey speechifying dominates the drama. A good cutter would also hack gratuitous folk dancing, Felliniesque orgies, and the endlessly lingering, smoldering, longing gazes by Alexander's pretty boyfriends. OK, boyfriends. Move on. Casting: Colin Farrell is a fun guy but he's no fun at all here. He doesn't have the voice, the physical or psychic presence to command in this epic role. They also couldn't get him a decent peroxide job, and dark roots are a constant distraction. Val Kilmer: lousy role, latexy makeup, costume-shop wig, puffy, too young. He has bad lines and uses them. Angelina Jolie: has the looks to fill Sophia Loren's pouty-lipped, cat-eyed sword-and- sandal position, but instead plays a domineering uber-Jewish mother to Alexander  she would have to be pregnant at 8 to have borne him. Poor Rosario Dawson throws herself physically into her role as Alex's wife, taking this as a serious-actor career boost, and she's gorgeous and pitiable. Her scenes with Farrell are about the best other than the battles  but you know you're going to end up with Angelina soon enough, chewing the paint off the scenery, or gratuitous flying-eagle symbolism, or Anthony Hopkins blathering his way through a history-lesson narration in a tiny garden jammed full of 'Greek-style!' statues that you might find at your local Armstrong Garden Center (I kept looking over Hopkins's shoulder for a St. Francis of Assisi).",,Anonymous,Biography
"A Kinder, Gentler Alexander","Having seen the Richard Burton version of Alexander's biography, I waited for the ""Director's Cut"" DVD/VHS release to see what the newer film did.On the plus side: Philip and Olympias. Philip was an alcoholic, and Olympias did dig snakes (""Keeping real snakes in the house of an alcoholic is not a good idea. It just complicates matters."" -- Will Cuppy). (Possible spoiler) That Olympias didn't seem to age could underscore her potential ""supernatural"" reputation, as presented in the film.On the minus side: historic detail. Not only did we learn little of Alexander's military strategy (rather than seeming to know exactly what he was doing, we just see him as impulsive and headstrong). Further, prior to his battle with Darius, Alexander was overmatched in manpower by Darius, but Darius had troops up all night roaring defiance at the Macedonians to unnerve them. But that also exhausted his own men, leaving them to go into battle sleep-deprived. This was all overlooked in the film.The movie jumped around in time, and thus we're deprived of many of Alexander's conquests, such as Egypt (which explains, as the film doesn't really, how Ptolemy became Pharoah). As a general, Alexander was a military genius, and this isn't clear in the film.The epic of Alexander, as has been noted, included the fact that he could be as brutal as a velociraptor, but only his good side was shown. More's the pity; he was complex.Nonetheless, as historical fiction, the film entertains.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Why the Irish accents ? (and other points..),"Several points:1. Why are all the actors (except for Angelina Jolie) using *IRISH* (or even some Scottish) accents? They could have tried for a neutral American or perhaps (gasp) even a fake Greek accent, like Angelina Jolie did. I think the choice to instruct the actors to use *IRISH* accents is a terrible one. Like it or not, the Irish accent has no place in ancient Greece. This isn't Braveheart. It just makes the dialog laughable and unwatchable.You can't have ancient Greeks speaking in Irish accents. It's ludicrous. You might as well have them use a German or French accent. Hell, throw in a few Jamaican, Haitian, Trinidadian and Bangladeshi accents too just to mix it up. Oh and a Swedish would be fun. ""Svedish meatballs ja ja, conquering India ja ja.""If you want an example of what a movie *should* do accent-wise: The movie ""Troy"" did a better job with accents. Not a single Irish accent in ancient Greece. Either they used a neutral British or a neutral American or even a fake Greek.At first I thought perhaps the majority of the actors are Irish. However further investigation revealed that even Actors that aren't Irish, like Connor Paolo (who is a native New Yorker) has a slight, annoying, brogue. *It doesn't make any sense whatsoever!!* Unless the idiot director told them to do it. In which case it's highly idiotic.2. Why is the acting so bad? Even Anthony Hopkins' performance is lackluster. This must be due to terrible directing and a pretty mediocre script.3.

Worth Watching with all it's flaws,"I find myself agreeing with almost all of the reviews here, from one star to ten stars. This could have been a great movie, with a different writer and director and star... However it is pretty close to an essential movie, so I recommend that you watch it. The extended wedding night scene on the Blu Ray release between Alexander (Colin Farrel) and Roxanne (the spectacular multi-ethnic Rosario Dawson) really crackles.Stone missed on almost as many points as he hit, even in the Blu Ray ""Final Cut"" release, but it is an honest effort at a big topic. One may nit-pick it to death, but only after you've seen it.I have watched it 3 times and do not regret those hours. That cannot be said of many movies watched only one time.My first viewing was with Stone's commentary rather than on-screen dialog. It helped. The third was with the commentary by Oxford Professor Robin Lane Fox. Fox is author of a book on Alexander and on-set historical consultant to the film. They let him be one of a thousand extras in a big battle scene.If one watches the included documentary by Stone's son, you get insight into Stone's relationship with his own parents which will give some significant insight into how this movie came to be what it is... as much about Oliver Stone as Alexander the Great of Macedonia.The movie may seed your interest in Alexander, or give you glimpses at fairly good recreations of the art and architecture of those times. Love it or hate it, watching this movie is worth your time.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
awful film,"i thought this movie was one of the worst films i've seen in a long time. oliver stone really went beneath his potential, when he took on this film. the first thing you notice as the film begins is that all the people seem to have Irish accents except for Alexander's mother. very poor choice in casting on that aspect, since the characters were suppose to be Greek. the acting was very over dramatic. it seems like very few minutes someone was screaming about something. the war scenes were gruesome and unnecessary. Collin Ferrel gave on of the worst performances of his career. he was unconvincing. the rest of the movie dragged and i lost interest. don't waste any money on this film. avoid it at all costs.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Colin F. gives one of his best performance ever. Best picture for 2004.,"I've read books and books and books on historical events. Especially the one of Alexander the Great. I was intrigued and fastinated by the drama of the movie. This movie is great, ... but, could've of been alittle tiny bit better. The movie was kinda rushed into the battle scene. The storyline and plot was great, It made sense to me. The battle scenes were great. One of my favorite battle scene was when Alexander fought in jungle mist of India. Overall all, I just wanted to put my thoughts on this movie and be heard. For all you wandering if ya'll want to see it or not, I think the money is very worth it. I wouldn't miss this movie in theaters for the world.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Good efford, lack of momentum to create a masterpiece!","I don't know...
Perhaps the Hollywood film-makers needs to hiring A LOT HISTORIC advisors and stick on their advice/suggestions. I believe Stone did that too, but he could hire few GREEK HISTORIANS to help him to create a truly MASTERPIECE for the greatest King of King, Alexander the Great.I'm Greek. And I'm proud of it. And I've said too many times, that there are 3 men I would follow to the fires of hell without any question: Jesus... ""Che"" Gevara... and Alexander the Great.So, you understand I have A LOT LOVE for our notorious ancient ancestor, the young king of the Greek kingdom of Macedonia. Btw... ""Macedonia"" was a VAST HUGE land covering all the present Greek Macedonia region, Bulgaria, FYROM and even half of Kosovo! So... the ""modern Macedonians"" (FYROM) they're ""claiming"" the entire ancient kingdom for themselves.
Well, I feel sorry for them, they don't own history and they trying to ""borrow"" some from Greeks, but the Macedonians were A GREEK KINGDOM, they were speaking GREEK, they were worshiping THE GREEK GODS, etc.Now... the film.
Stone trying to cover Alexander's CHARACTER mostly. He wants to portrait the man, not the legend. Which is fine by me... but hey pal, that ""man"" became GOD, truly... seriously... he did it, he became A LIVING GOD for centuries till our days!!! So yes... ok... portrait him like he was a mother's boy (so tight to his mother), he was in love with his best friend Hephaestion,... but damn it, he CONQUERED THE ENTIRE ANCIENT WORLD! GIVE US SOME of it!The casting could be better.
Most of the actors were wrongly chosen. As many wrote it, Stone needed a lot stand-men... but c'mon, almost all were... Scottish and Irish with VERY specific accent!And where is the damn action??? Just half of hour to one hour battle scenes? Why the hell for?Stone could have done a MASTERPIECE, but he failed to do so.
I'm giving 7 stars for the music, the photography, the amazing accurate costumes and few very well done scenes.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A very poor film,"Like other reviewers have stated, there was a real desire to sit down and want to enjoy this epic. I really did. Honest. But the moment Colin Farrel opened his mouth and an explosion of Irish came out I knew then the ride was going to be pretty painful. And boy was it! I have no issue with the 'look' of the film. It is pleasing to the eye in terms of costume, location, battle scenes and the presence of the old great actors in all too short roles. But, and it is a big but, the dialogue! Whoever sanctioned the script by Stone/Kyle and Kalogridis should be shot! The script bears a resemblance to that parlour game where someone writes a sentence, hides it, passes it on to someone else for another sentence, hides it, passes it on.....and the resulting story is, well, need I say more? I can't get into the various arguments regarding the supposed sexuality issues, and how Stone was brave to tackle the topic, it matters very little when your ears are screaming for the dialogue to get real! No, when you have been spoilt with Gladiator and Troy, this is a very poor third.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
I liked the Movie...,I think the movie was pretty long and I guess it could've been cut down a bit but I liked how we all know Alexander to be this crazy war lord and to show a more compassionate side of him was nice. I think he had something going with creating everyone free and equal (well almost equal) He was looking to unite everyone...yes under his rule but the point was to unite and educate everyone. I think Colin played the role of Alexander very well aside from still sounding Irish. Angelina Jolie was great. I think the casting was OK...Jared Leto and Colin Farrell's relationship in the movie at first was a little hard to follow...I wasn't sure if the relationship was open and everyone knew or they hid it. But aside from the almost all male relationships and the very weird battle scenes the movie was pretty good and opens your mind...maybe Alexander had something going...why should everyone fight when we all could be one??,,Anonymous,Biography
Spectacular battle scenes - some great acting - but flawed,"I was looking forward to watching this film. Oliver Stone has known conflict and handles the battle scenes well. The sense of fear is seen in the eyes of the protagonists. The horror of the battlefield is seen in full detail. Not for the faint hearted. Colin Farrell is convincing as Alexander from boy King to full battle hardened General. The usage of an Irish accent to mark the Macedonians against the English accents of the Greeks was distracting at first but I soon got used to it. However this leads to too many parallels with Braveheart for my liking. Oliver Stone admits that little is know about Alexander. I suspect a little too much of the Celtic fighter from Scotland was allowed to guide the hand of the director. Angelina Jolie is competent as Alexanders mother, Olympias. Val Kilmer is over the top as his father, Philip. Still very enjoyable. If you like your sword and sandals long this is the one for you.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"pretty fantasy, but excruciatingly boring","Bad, but not bad enough to be funny (unlike Troy, which was so bad one had to laugh). Bad mediocre. As a movie, it flops from lack of an overarching story, sluggish pace, and plain lethargy. Maybe broken into 28-min bits it might work, a sort of ""Look what happens to Alexander"" weekly series. Alexander is a legendary man of mythical stature, yes human, but also a hero remembered to this day throughout the lands he razed and conquered. What, then, to make of this man that can barely carry his armor? And what of the awkward flashback device, generating flashback-within-a-flashback moments?And then there is the homophobia. Why is it okay to show 5 minutes of sex with Rosario Dawson, but not okay to show one kiss between Alexander and Hephaistion? This says more about the calculations from the director and producers than about the motives and emotions of Alexander. As with other recent movies (Batman Begins comes to mind), the fight scenes are too confusing to deliver a punch. Yes, maybe that's what soldiers actually feel like. But this is a movie, not boot camp, we're supposed to feel moved (or claustrophobic, or frightened) by the battle, not frustrated to the brink of walking out. The accents are grating and, depending on one's point of view, Angelina Jolie is either an embarrassment or the comic relief that makes the movie watchable.And for all the historians out there, the library of Alexandria was not founded until Ptolemy II. Cleopatra did a better job at re-creating the site. Kudos for the Macedonian lancers, and for the gates of Babylon, though.In sum, not worth the time/money of this viewer.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
Worst Movie I've Ever Seen,"Horrible. The content could have been really interesting. The direction and acting drove this movie into the ground. Some points to ponder: - I didn't know all Greeks are Irish. - The structure of the film was confused. The pattern of the movie was set early: each 'act' was announced with a subtitle saying 'N year's later' and a long, boring sequence followed. Then, about 2 hours in and for no reason I can understand, there is a flashback to an important event in Alexander's life; the subtitle says '8 years earlier' or some such. What happened? No dramatic tension was created. Terrible. - I didn't know Alexander's mother was Elvira's little sister. - The Greeks believed that what we classify as homosexuality was one of the expressions of love. Since they also believed that women were inferior, the logical conclusion is that the best love one can have is between fellow men. Fine - I don't really care one way or another. The thing is , they were men who loved men for being men, not for dressing up like women and acting like women. Alexander's love for his friend struck a sour chord throughout the show. - Staring with anguish at the camera is not the same as having the intensity of purpose that Alexander must have had.As I post this, the user rating is 5.5 I'm shocked. This is far and away the worst movie I've ever seen - though I did miss Battlefield earth.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
I can't believe this is from the same guy that did Platoon!!,"""Alexander"" is by far one of the worst movies i've ever seen. And i've seen a LOT of crappy movies. I went to see it for free at a university; so I expected some level of college-maturity-level-heckling. This movie deserved every last cackle, jeer, moan and groan. Although I can go on for days about all of the problems with this movie, I will only highlight 3:1. With the exception of Angelina Jolie and Rosario Dawson (both of whom sounded like they were from Transylvania), everyone had a half-arsed Irish accents. The only logical explanation for this is that Colin Farrell, the title character, could not manage any semblance of a Mediterranean, Greek, or Macedonian accent. (any of them would have been acceptable)2. At least 45-minutes of the movie was dedicated to homo-erotic-innuendo, which wouldn't have been a problem since Alexander the Great was definitely (or at least) bisexual. However, the way it was done made it look like a mild version of ""Caligula."" I was literally waiting for Colin Farrell to name his horse as his 2nd in command. One would think that the portrayal of such a heroic figure (that was the point, right?) would highlight something like Alexander's sexuality in a respectful manner. It was completely tasteless.3. The battle scenes terrible, point blank. Yes, I understand the first fight was in the desert, but i would have like to SEE some of it. The so cinematography was so chaotic that you could not follow any Alexander's ""strategic mastery."" And the rally speech was a shameless ""Braveheart"" rip-off.P.S. What the hell was Collin Farrell's lion growl about in the near-rape seen of his wife?",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Don't let the critics keep you from seeing it!,"It definitely deserves to be seen on the big screen. While there have been a lot of harsh reviews of this movie, it is more than worth the price of admission. This is far from a perfect film. But what a fantastic story. The movie is like 2hours and 50 minutes long, and yeah probably 15 of thost minutes sucked.The opening and the closing are boring. Anthony Hopkins narrating a history story special. I didn't know that much about Alexander the Great. Just what I remembered from school millions of years ago. I also didn't care. I think the movie tells a great story all on it's own. I understood enough about what was going on. This is NOT a history channel biography of Alexander the Great, but rather an artistic telling of a historic story.

underwhelming result,"Yet another proof that when the cast is too attractive, the film turns out to be disappointing... I'm left with a mixed impression of this Oliver Stone's work, which offers beautiful moments, but also endless boring passages.First of all, Colin Farrell as Alexander, although a good actor, didn't convince me (because of his peroxide-blonde hair, perhaps?). Then there's his mother, who looks about the same age as him. Although Angelina Jolie is beautiful in it and gives a breathtaking performance, once again the veracity isn't there. On the other hand, I loved the subtle and moving Hephaistos/Alexander relationship, with a touching Jared Leto whose lines sound true and sincere, as well as Anthony Hopkins' character whose intro gives an interesting narrative.But for me, this 3-hour film remains a collection of battles that are meant to be epic, but whose linkage, relevance and strategic spirit are not always understood. Similarly, the complexity of certain characters is skimmed over, such as Roxanne, Alexander's father (whose villain traits are very caricatured) and even Olympias, whose spirit of revenge mingled with love for her son would have deserved further development.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Ranks high in my top 10 worst movies ever.,"There have been great films. There have been bad films that entertain. There have been awefull movies. There have been films that should have never been produced. There have been films that don't even deserve to be mentioned. Then there was Simon Sez, and then there was Alexander. This failure of epic proportions begets questioning Hollywood's vision of the sixth art.When I first heard of Olivers Stone's ""Alexander"", I got very excited. The previews arose great expectations among the public. Little did we know that it was all a scam. I've been an admirer of Mr. Stone as a director. I honestly expected a film like ""Braveheart"", with ""Any given Sunday""'s style. The life of Alexander The Great is one that could have been enough material for a truly transcendent film. Why did they have to focus on the details that don't matter? Why is the movie based on his love life instead of his great accomplishments? In the previews you can see more action than in the whole movie, and not once they mention anything about homosexuality. Why? Because they knew that if they showed what the movie was truly about, no one would have gone to see it.The acting is laughable, (a lot of people laughed a lot during very serious moments, mocking the stupidity of the situations, and the poor acting) the casting was also awful. The battles are as bad as they could possibly be.Overall, my recommendation is to avoid this movie at all costs. I will repeat this: AVOID AT ALL COSTS. I think the movie would have been a lot better if the casting had been as follows: -Alexander - Dennis Rodman -His Father - Van Damme -His lover - Chuck Norris -His mother - Shaquille O'Neal (dressed as a woman) At least like this it would have been a better comedy, if their sole purpose was to mock this great story. I am looking forward to renting the DVD because I cant wait to see the ""making of the movie."" I bet Oliver Stone was naked and drunk when he made this movie. I bet they were all laughing and making fun of the movie while filming it.Save yourself some money, do not watch this.",,Anonymous,Biography

Awful,"I had my doubts about this movie but rented it anyway. I should have followed my first instincts. I can't believe Oliver Stone was involved in this. After reading some of the inconsistencies, Stone who is usually a stickler for detail sure did blow it on this one. The battle scenes were poorly choreographed, poorly filmed and it was almost impossible to tell which side was winning and which side was losing. The fact that they had the various parts of the armies in different dress didn't help. The aerial views of the battles were obviously shown very distant to save money on how many extras they had to pay. The Irish accents didn't help the credibility. Finally I think it was a real waste of talent (not Colin playing Alexander). I don't know how much they paid Angelina Jolie and Anthony Hopkins, but it wasn't enough to have such a stain on their resumes. Lastly Colin Farrell cast as Alexander Irish accent and all, was a colossal bit of miscasting. Good luck to those who ignore my review.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
Was it really all you could say about the main things that happened around Alexander?,"Dear Mr. Olievr Stone! I would like to ask you was it everything you could talk about Alexander and his time? was that all by what happened in the battle with Persians? why do did you try to satisfy what the public opinion was about the comparison of West and East? Makedonian and Persian Empires? Why did you forget that it's written in the history that Persian had the first and the most structured, symmetric, organized and magnific army? was it really like the reality in your historically supposed movie? I'm sure you know that Persian were not dressing Arabic costume, but why was it like that in your movie? Dear Mr. Oliver ! I'm sure there was much more to say about Alexander and his life story than insisting on the idea that he was a homosexual. how many shots did you spend to clarify that he was a gay? yes ! we understood your point by the first scene and it could be enough! you could explain much more serious things. or maybe this was more serious since the Hollywood commerciality must be considered. Couldn't explain more accurate about the most important battle of the movie. Makedonian and Persian!? Alexander won the battle, when a Persian queen betrayed the Persians and fired the most glamorous palace of the time; Pasargad. don't you think it was more fascinating to show these stuff, instead of making wrong impression that after the battle Alexander conquered Babylion. No Man! he conquered Pasargad and the battle happened close to that Place. He also visited the tomb of the first Persian King, One of the first and greatest kings of the world, Korous! he wanted to fire the tomb, but as he entered the room and read the memorial stone of the tomb as this: ""I'm Korous! The king of the Persian empire! whoever you are, you are welcomed to my land. respect this land and it's people as I respected your land and your people! Daer Mr. Oliver!

A Thinking Person's Film.,"Sometimes you go to see a movie and just want to be entertained without having to really think about anything too deeply. This movie is not in that category.

Phenomenal Battles Drowned By Boring Scenes,"Alexander is one of those movies you'll either hate or love. I actually partially enjoyed this movie but it does have many flaws. First off I have to say the battle scenes were excellent-a lot of action, blood, gore etc. However only two battles actually took place in Alexander disappointing a lot of people who wanted to see something like Gladiator, Troy, and Braveheart.I honestly could only watch this movie by forwarding the majority of the film to get to the battles, however I loved to watch the battles again and again. The acting in this movie is for the most part pretty good but could have been better in some of the characters.The story was a bit confusing and a lot of the times I was wondering what was going on in the film. My advice to anyone who wants to see this movie is to not expect something like the other epic war films you've seen before and prepare for a lot of non-fighting and in my opinion awkward scenes. I do advise that if you are watching this movie for the first time to have a little patience because the battle scenes are pretty impressive and use decent CGI.The main reason this movie isn't as highly-rated as epic war films like Gladiator, Troy, or Braveheart is that you will probably find yourself forwarding most of the movie to get to the good parts.My Rating: 6.3/10",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Somehow, ""tedious"" isn't quite harsh enough","""In you lives the light of this world. Your companions will long be shadows in the underworld, when you will be the one, forever young, forever inspiring - never will there be an Alexander like you - Alexander the Great."" Well, those are the words of Olympias, Alexander's mother (Jolie), but if this movie is any judge, then he should've been called Alexander the Boring. Or Alexander the Tedious. Perhaps Alexander the Way Too Talkative? You get the idea.Folks, this movie is 3 hours long, and it makes sure you know it. It's been a while since I've wanted a movie to end so badly. I lost interest at the hour and a half mark and was near tears when I thought about how it was only halfway over. Still, I trudged forward, thinking the action would pick up a bit. ""There are bound to be a few more fight scenes coming up,"" I figured. Should've used the calculator on this one because I figured wrong.Alexander conquered 90% of the known world, right? Well, I guess I just assumed that meant the movie would explore why he was such a great leader and warrior. Silly me. I wish I'd been warned that instead, this movie is about all the boring conversations he apparently had between battles.There are only two battle scenes (the Battle of Gaugamela and the Battle of India). TWO! Many historians feel Alexander possessed the greatest military mind of all time, so two small battle scenes is unforgivable. The Battle of India was pretty cool with the armored elephants, but other than that things were really too fast and chaotic to get a grasp of what was going on. The bird's eye view was pretty cool though, and that's about the best I can say regarding the movie. Pretty sad, really.What makes the movie so bad? Let's examine just a few details.* The dialogue is embarrassingly bad at times. Anthony Hopkins actually has to use a line in which he states that Alexander never lost a battle except to Hephaistion's thighs. Or something like that. It's a reference to them wrestling as teenagers, but it's horribly awkward dialogue. Absolutely laughable.* I don't care how realistic it is, but teenage boys wrestling in big diapers look ridiculous. The fact that we can see Alexander's big diaper under his army skirt is even worse.* What is up with Alexander's hair? He has bad hair in every stage of life. It looks extremely fake, especially the bad dye job. The worst was the mullet. For a minute there I thought I was watching David Spade as Joe Dirt.* A lot of controversy has surrounded the relationship between Alexander and Hephaistion (Leto). I don't know if Alexander was actually bisexual, so I'm not really gonna speculate. I simply haven't researched the subject enough to know. But everybody involved with the movie claims that the relationship isn't really meant to be looked at in a sexual manner. Could've fooled me. The sappy dialogue between the two is painfully embarrassing, as evidenced by the theater audience's laughter. They hug, pledge their devotion to each other, use mock poetic language, etc. When Hephaistion told Alexander that he was the sun to him and that he was jealous of losing him to the world, all while undressing him with his eyes, I started to wonder what gay soap opera I had accidentally stumbled upon. Sorry, but that's not exactly what I want to see in what is supposed to be an epic war movie.* Oliver Stone somehow failed at character development, despite the fact that he had three hours to work with. It would've been nice to know what exactly drove and inspired the characters. For example, Alexander sees Roxane (Rosario Dawson) dance and then the next thing you know they're getting married. Why did he choose her of all the women dancing? I don't know, nor will you after watching the movie.* The love scene between Colin Farrell and Rosario Dawson is very strange. I kept expecting some wonka wonka porn music to start playing. When Farrell let out a little cat-like growl I shook my head and started to look around the theater for the exits.* File ""Transvestite-Looking Men Belly Dancing For an Extended Period of Time"" under ""Scenes I Hope to Never See Again in Life."" Then to make it worse, Farrell kissed the guy afterwards. Sigh. Three hours, folks. Three hours I'll *never* get back. I'm WARNING you.I could on, talking about the over-the-top acting, the messy editing, the lack of story cohesion, etc., but I've wasted enough of my time on this movie.The biggest failure of Alexander is that after the credits rolled, I was left with the question, ""What exactly was the point of the movie?"" What exactly was Stone trying to accomplish? The subject is Alexander the Great, so why, after three hours, does Stone not give us any real insight into his military mind?Why was Alexander so great? Stone just doesn't tell us. The movie gave me no reason to root for the guy. Anthony Hopkins' narration tells us his accomplishments, but the movie itself doesn't really show us what made him such a great conqueror.Stone claims to have a great awe and respect for Alexander. If this is true, then why does he leave us with the impression that Alexander was a boring whiner? Why are we left scratching our heads in amazement that Alexander conquered the world?I would say ""nice try,"" but I can't even give Mr. Stone that much credit. I doubt even Alexander himself could sit through this.Rating: 2 (out of 5)",,Anonymous,Biography

""Alexander"" is another pretentious, over done, piece of garbage from a director who clearly has lost touch with the movie going public, not to mention reality.What could have been a great epic about one of the world's most celebrated and mysterious warriors, becomes an indulgent probe into the great king's psyche and inner torment (blah, blah, blah). Even the battle scenes are boring.Logic would dictate that it won't take too many more of these flops for Stone to fade away.One can only hope.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
About the accents:,"About the accents:I think you really have to be a genius like Mr. Stone to make the dialogue with so many accents like in Alexander.To be honest, when I see the trailer when Alexander says: ""Conquer your fear, and I promise you will conquer death,"" I said to myself, Oh--- no, yet again another so-called historical epic and how can I be convinced to see a King/Hero of 2300 years ago to encourage his soldiers in modern English. (Didn't notice the Irish English yet.) But yet you can't let the movie to be played in ancient Greek or other period languages. (It has been already floppy enough, what do you expect it will do in a language almost every people need to read the sub-titles!!??)Here comes the genius way of Mr. Stone of handling the situation: - He let people conduct the dialogue in different accents compared to the Standard English as the characters would have been actually speaking Greek (or other languages) according to their origin compared with classic ancient Greek.The Macedonians weren't at the center of Greek civilization. In this way, don't you think it is really clever to hear them speaking English with an Irish accent? (Compared Ireland to England/America as Macedonia to Spartan/Athens.) What a thoughtful approach!!! Audience more careful would have noticed also that the Athenians in the movie speak with quite an American accent and other soldiers groups have their comparable accents, too. The Persians are none English native speakers. Aristotle speaks standard English and Olympus' strange accents is just magnificent to emphasize she was considered ""Barbarian"" by Philipus. Anyway, by hearing these different accents, one realizes how multi-nation Alexander's empire was.The one who criticizes the accents fails to see the true meaning of this revolutionary approach of film dialogue.The one who finds it difficult to catch up please be patient and realize there are more than just Americans and English who speaks English. And we shall always be respectful to other people's accent by trying to understand it instead of rejecting it.The one who doesn't like it please take it this way: Imagine the movie was originally made in ancient Greece and was dubbed into English for us to understand it better. In order to keep the authenticity of the dialogue and considering character's origin, Mr. Stone did us a favour by adapting them with different accents.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Alexander,"watched this movie over the weekend. the special effects were very good, the film is very violent in places. the general part of the film that that i found disappointing is this - why are the entire cast speaking with an irish accent when they are all supposed to be Greek. I know the film is made for the American market and that any non American accent is acceptable for that market, given that all English accents sound the same to them and especially after Dick Van Dykes sorry effort in Mary Poppins. You would think that with such a vast budget, they could run an English speaking Greek speech tutor. The film was however enjoyable after one had got used to the accent and historically, i guess that it was true to the story.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Where the heck was the vocal coach?,"This movie was panned by critics and movie-goers alike, and though many people put a lot of time and effort into explaining why, the truth is that 90% of the blame can be attributed to one simple thing: The unbelievably bad 'accents' of most - if not all - of the main characters. Just as the audience is having some success in suspending their disbelief, trying not to notice that the settings look like bad CGI even when they aren't, getting over the fact that Alexander's mother (Angelina Jolie) doesn't appear to age over the course of 25 or 30 years, and accepting that the story is totally historically inaccurate, one of the main characters opens their mouth and speaks in some totally bizarre accent that reminds them that this is a movie, and a badly-done one at that.Oh sure, at first it's okay - Anthony Hopkins' accent is a standard 'British theatre' kind of accent, and Christopher Plummer's Aristotle is in the same vein. But then the young Alexander starts migrating to some kind of inconsistent Scottish accent. At first you wonder why, but the answer soon becomes clear: Colin Farrell, who plays the grown-up Alexander - apparently can't manage a British theatre-type accent, and so delivers his lines in a slightly toned-down version of his normal Scottish-accented voice. Because Farrell can't get rid of his Scottish accent, the kid playing young Alexander has to use a Scottish accent for consistency's sake. On top of which, Alexander's father (Val Kilmer) then has to speak in some kind of bizarre hybrid of 'British theatre' and 'Scottish' accents in order to demonstrate how Alexander ended up with a Scottish accent! Angelina Jolie's accent is similarly atrocious: She seems to be using some kind of vaguely Eastern European or Russian-type accent, for reasons known only to herself. I think it's supposed to reinforce the fact that she comes from a different background than Alexander's father, but it's not only a bizarre choice (Russia and 'eastern Europe' didn't even exist at the time) but Jolie's delivery is so bad it's like watching a teenager in their first high school play. I thought her British accent in Tomb Raider was reasonably well done - why didn't they just let her use that, instead of these amateur-hour rolled-Rs? As we've seen with other Oliver Stone films, even the most far-fetched, historically-inaccurate plot and the most schlocky dialogue can be redeemed by decent 'delivery' by first-rate actors (and, whatever else you might say, Hopkins, Jolie, Farrell and Kilmer are all recognized as 'serious' actors). Hopkins, Jolie et all have been in the business for a long time - so why didn't one of them speak up and say, ""Hey Oliver, you need to get us a vocal coach, dude. We are totally sucking here."" More importantly, why didn't Oliver Stone recognize that their accents were ruining any chance he had at making Alexander successful at the box office and with critics?",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Borrowed,"Cyrus and Darius knitted together the largest empire known before or since. Their method was innovative, to allow local control preserving the culture and gods. What they added was infrastructure: roads, a universal set of laws (the first case law) weights and monetary system.The system was perhaps the least corrupt of any complex government before and since. Gathered in Persepolis were scholars tasked with collecting and synthesizing knowledge from the entire world. Darius knew that any oaf can conquer, but only a statesman  a concept he invented  can govern.300 years later the system had devolved, and various component states no longer saw advantage with the Persian federation. Into this, a bold and athletic thug moved. There were some spectacular battles of course, but most of the conquering was a matter of showing up in force.When Alexander reached Persepolis he committed the greatest sin against knowledge known: he destroyed the great libraries, killed all the scholars and burned the entire place to the ground.The one great invention of the Greeks was the principle of retrospective narrative, what we call history. Since they wrote the history, they get to choose the narrative. Their spinning is masterful, complex and rich. But all the components are borrowed, not original.Now Stone makes a movie depicting what he thinks are key elements of the story. Stone has no original cinematic vision, all is borrowed from giants who went before. What he brings to the table is the ability to spin it together with some deftness, some craft. At least that once was the case.Two narratives, the original and this pale child. Borrowed, but this doesn't have the typical Greek riches. It doesn't have the introspection either, despite the many cinematic tools available (and some from Greek theater as well).Hopkins continues his slide into the embarrassment of pure mannerism.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",,Anonymous,Biography
It Could Could Have Been a Contender,"Oliver Stone's ""Alexander"" had the potential to be great. Unlike the films protagonist, who in history realized his potential by conquering most of the known world, this film's steed stumbles and throws it's hapless rider to the ground. The casting was extremely weak on just about every level. Colin Farrell does not have the presence to play a character of this magnitude. He appeared very out of place and small at the head of his Macadonian hoard. This character needed to be a little more, for lack of a better term, ""larger than life."" And what's with the heavy Scottish brogue.....""Alexander, we luv ya! We'll follow ya ta the ends of the earth laddie."" Com'on man! Not to mention Farrel's Irish lilt and Angelina Jolie sounding like Count Dracula's mother. What was Stone thinking. Well...he wasn't. He was too wrapped up in getting every word of his boring laborious dialog into the film. Battle scenes...good, costuming and set design good. If Ridly Scott had directed this, perhaps we would have had an ""Alexander"" at full potential.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
Oscar Caliber Acting Lends a Helping Hand to an Otherwise Tedious Movie,"At times this movie seemed little more than an outrageously expensive History Channel documentary with an A-list Hollywood cast. However, Colin Farrell did an excellent job at portraying Alexander, he has definitely proved himself to be a deeper actor than many thought he could be. This type of role is definitely out of the ordinary for him, and i think this Irish actor proved himself more than worthy of it. At times, this movie lacks the female touch, but this is understandable because Alexander was at war much of his grown life, where women were typically not found. Angelina Jolie, however, gives a top-notch performance, actually making Alexander's life away from the battlefield worth focusing on. Her character demands to be noticed every minute she is on the screen and she blends just the right amount of sinister evil and motherly love to keep you guessing just how honest her intentions are. Val Kilmer, although barely recognizable underneath scars and a hefty stomach, also gives an excellent performance. His role as Alexander's father puts him in an awkward position to audience members as we recognize that he is mainly a negative impact on Alexander's training as opposed to a father figure. Although I would have liked to see more of a warrior from his character we can not fault the actor, but rather the writers for this omission. Although Farrell gets most of the screen time in this movie, the supporting actors are oftentimes what keeps the audience watching from one scene to the next.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Probably the worst film ever made,"What can I say about this movie? It is the worst film ever made.. It should be named Alexander The Gay and not the Great. Oliver Stone doesn't present us the Greatest leader of all history at all as a leader or a conquerer. He just shows us Alexander as a gay character, the film had only one battle.. I wonder where did the 120 million dollars went? Alexander was a philosopher, a commander, a killer, he had thirst for battle he was beloved as a God and still is until today by many nations. I am a proud Greek because my country except from the lights of civilization, gave birth to the greatest leader of all time... shame on u Mr Stone. I have nothing against gay people.

review of Alexander - 3 out of 3,"I liked this movie a lot. In fact I am still thinking about it after watching it for the second time last night. So, in analyzing why I really liked this movie that all the critics seems to be bashing I've come to these conclusions:The acting was spot-on. Colin Farrell did a good job. He looked great! He is one sexy man with a sexy voice. He is my new favorite male actor. He should at least get an Oscar nomination. I was impressed with his skills as an actor. He portrayed a man of history that accomplished many feats. Needless to say, I'm convinced Alexander was a conflicted macedonian. Angelina Jolie was gorgeous in this movie. She did a good job despite the strange slavic sounding accent. I would like to see her in a more villainous role. Mr. Kilmer had an interesting role that he did well in. He did a good job portraying a 3 dimensional character.I caught all the symbolism the second time around and appreciated the angles in which we saw the battle scenes, the lighting variances, etc. I was impressed with Babylon. The scenery in Babylon has shifted my view of wicked biblical Babylon from dirty, haggard, open space image to splendid sprawling city with tall buildings, which made more sense when the Bible always referred to Babylon as a city. The eye candy was splendid. The array of accents used by Alexander's generals, mom, dad, wife was interesting to hear but then that also makes sense since everyone represented more than one race. Perhaps it is far fetched to hear all the macedons and greeks sounding UK, but does that mean they couldn't find enough arabs or greeks to play critical roles? Probably yeah.I don't understand all the bad reviews this movie is getting. Oliver Stone's perception and representation of Alexander as the man and understanding the horrible, cruel and wonderful things he did is interesting, intelligent - something I can relate to.Boycott critics. Watch for yourself.I give this movie 3 out of 3 stars. I'll probably buy it on DVD.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
It's a good movie--Don't believe the negative hype,"OK, the movie was pretty good (6 or 7 out of 10 max). I like those historical type movies, and if you do, you'll probably like it too. Don't go in there expecting a cookie-cutter Hollywood action film that's like all the other action films that were ever made, because that's not what you're going to get. It is more of a historical movie than an action film.Although I really wanted to see this movie, I was half convinced not to go see it by the negative press. Fortunately, I didn't let that stop me and went to see it anyway.Good points of the movie: Nice historical portrayal, good costumes and cultural content, overall a good movie, and some good acting on the part of Val Kilmer, Angelina Jolie, Jared Leto, and Colin Farrell.Negative points: The first 20 minutes or so are a little slow, and there is some hokey dialogue.A word about the negative press: People are totally blowing this bisexual thing out of proportion. I have got to say, there is very little gay material in the movie, in proportion to what people are saying about it. I was half-expecting 10 nude homosexual scenes, after hearing all the hype, but it's just not true. It is tastefully alluded to in the film, and there's really not that much of it! There is a lot of the film to like that has nothing to do with bisexuality. (My husband and I saw it together and enjoyed it, and we are not gay.) So, let's all be adults and get over it. Let's face it, homosexuality and bisexuality have been going on ever since humans have been in existence, and that's not going to change now, just because some people are upset about seeing it in a movie. Let's not judge how people love each other... make love, not war, right? I hope you see the movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Alexander the not so Great Movie,"Alexander the Movie though not bad failed to impress me. Collin Farrel does not portray Alexander as a unflinching brilliant warrior who is raised from childhood to battle, but rather a young unexperienced man conquering the world partly because he is running away from something. The movie is not historically accurate and skips major points in his life. The camera in battle never gives you a sense of the awe of the battles and the amount of men involved. It seems they focused more on the drama rather then the battles. however the costume designs are quite impressive especially for the Persians. in general a descent movie but nothing compared to Braveheart or Gladiator. I don't think this movie shows the real man Alexander was. you don't leave the theater wanting to be him, wanting to go kick some butt, and thats what we all want(at least i do). his movie should be as spectacular as him its only deserving. Because its Alexander, the man who conquered the world and never lost a battle doing it.",,Anonymous,Biography
A true hero and leader of men,"I have always been a great admirer of Alexander, a man of great talent, fortitude and charisma. I have read countless books on the man and feel that if you look at his life as a whole this film covers about 5% of his life. Whilst most people feel that his relationship with Hephaistion was not covered fully, I feel that it concentrated too much on this relationship along with his relationship with his mother. Agreed this is what made him the man he was but this could have been covered in about 20 minutes of the film. The man lead a nation to greatness and all we can talk about was his sexual preferences, WHO CARES!!! homosexuality is a 19th - 20th century word, back then it just was.Anyway I digress where was the talk of the relationship with his generals? They cavort as though old friends, I know why but the film does not show the length to which his generals / friends went to to stay together during his exile a point which so easily could have been added thus showing the esteem and loyalty he gained from his men. At one point in his life it seemed there was nothing he couldn't achieve, I felt nothing of this from the film.I felt like I waited forever for this film and felt cheated. Alexanders feats and achievements deserved so much more.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

when will it end,"I was gob-smacked. Was I supposed to really take it seriously? Unable to use the magic of film to construct a story, right from the start we have to be subjected to a very old fashioned device (not even listen!) of Anthony Hopkins narrating a story with backdrops reminiscent of Cecil de Mille films. I was expecting a film that although would satisfy Hollywood audiences would also somehow project the greatness of Alexander. What came across was an unverifiable account of a man struggling with his own adolescent neurosis, some Black Beauty bonding with a horse, some mixing of myth with reality and no clear indication of his motives to push East. Was war the only realistic solution he had to expand his empire? Was the decision to stop further advances really based on a near fatal injury endured in war? It sounded like the logic and reasoning of a spoilt brat not a statesman! The death of the beautiful Ephastius was as predictable as it was cringing. Hinting at the birth of the Suez canal? I was half expecting Alexander predicting the discovery of the Americas and the founding of a city called New Alexandria!! Admittedly some parts were stunning, the final battle scene, the Baudolinoesque advance into the unknown but one grew tired of the guilt ridden uneasy glances which pointed out the conspirators, the snakes, the never ageing tomb raider mother with a Lithuanian accent. I came out of it thinking that this Alexander was rather small.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
One more time Americans ruin History,"Like TROY, Alexander lacks of historic truth. The bad thing is that he was one of the greatest Leaders of history of mankind and he should be treated like one. If anybody studies a little bit of history he/she will see that homosexuality in ancient times was a part of every day life. Alexander wasn't a homosexual but probably a bi-sexual like everybody that days. For that, the film-makers -because of their need probably to gain the gay-community and of their lack of creativity and talent- shown during the whole film the love between Alexander and Ifaistionas... For that the film should be titled ¨Alexander and Ifaistionas: a fairytale of... great love¨. As far as the battles concerned, apart from the last battle in India (which had some good moments) it was poor. The scenario also was weak having in mind the true history of Alexander which was great and rich and difficult for these filmmakers to reach. As a historian and a Greek i was really disappointed.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
What homosexuality???,"Hello all,Well I quite enjoyed Alexander. I can't believe everyone got so upset about the homosexuality, for a start very little is actually shown in the film, secondly, as Oliver Stone did so much historical research with Oxford professor Robin Lane Fox, doesn't it seem likely that he's got this part of the story accurate??? It's well known that the ancient greeks were commonly bisexual, I just can't understand the fuss. I think Stone is depicting the most accurate portrayal he can (considering it was 2300 years ago!). I myself reckon the relationship with Hephaistion was probably more physical than was shown, it's possible Stone was holding back in order not to create yet greater offence. The only really stupid thing about this film is the Irish accents, I can't imagine what Stone was thinking here, has he done anything like this before?? Since they would all have been speaking Greek anyway the choice of accent in English would seem immaterial, but the Irish just stood out too much as being totally wrong. Should have gone for English (like Troy), American or just let everyone speak in their own regional accents and be done with it. The Irishness just made it seem comedic. I request - everyone doing their own accents and more boy on boy sex!",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
A film as bad as its accents,"Apart from the very good and gory battle scenes, Alexander bored me senseless. Trying to keep up with Hopkins's ramblings which apparently kept you up to date with the story was too much for me. Why did most of the characters have Irish accents? Presumably because Colin Farrell couldn't do any other accent. Why did Alexander have an Irish accent while his mother sounded eastern European? Perhaps because Angelina Jolie couldn't do an Irish accent. Why did we only see two battles when Alexander fought in over 50? Maybe it was deemed more interesting to focus on half-hearted homosexuality and yawnsome story-telling. All in all it was a tedious three hours that I can't believe I sat through.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
Alexander THE MAN...,"I'm sitting here still astounded at the critical and audience reaction that this film has suffered. The film is just flat out great. Especially compared to recent sword and sandal epic Troy. Stone's Alexander goes on an entirely different route an overly realistic portrayal of a confused young man manipulated by the people around him and seduced by the power in front of him. The film's excessively large 150 million dollar budget could have been taken down to a mere five million to tell the intimate and personal story of it's title character. Just as confused, direction less and lost as the film seems it represent it's title character to the core. Hollywood took a big gamble on this one the film stands as a true work of art especially with all the gay undertones that are important and emotionally relevant to telling the story. There are many reasons why people will have a problem with this film. Narrow minded unintelligent people. And others just may find it somewhat drawn out or boring but every single scene is necessary so that you may feel it's emotional impact. Angelina Jolie gives a surprisingly reassuring performance as Alexander's manipulative mother and gives us reassurance of why she took home the Oscar that night. Jared Leto and Collin Farell make the hottest gay couple of the year sporting killer bods and amazing tear inducing acting. But the film fares less than perfect. Although quite an accomplished, original and thought provoking film it also sports a lame score and some slightly corny dialogue that induced slight laughing amongst the audience. But besides a few moments of okness the film overall represents a huge cinematic overhaul coming our way. One of intelligence and desperation. Of Heart and passion. Wheather Alexander scores big or flops(which it will most likely do) it will inspire many members of it's true target audience to excel in life.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Not a spiffing historical epic, but OK.","Alexander didn't do great in the world - lots of people laughed at it and gave it bad reviews, the acting and accents were generally bad, there were only two action scenes in the whole film and it should have been more intense. Old Ptolemy, who told the story, was just a boring old git who tried to make it sound like he actually cared about Alexander, but knew deep down he didn't really.But one good thing about this film - it definitely deserves to be called an epic. Though there isn't much action in the whole film, the battle scenes are done beautifully and with great visuals - Alexander himself actually fights like he wants to. There's lots of blood, and it's better than anything Troy or Gladiator have to offer, though they both are generally better films in most other aspects. If it had had more furious battles, I would have liked Alexander more, though it is mostly boring and hard to watch - it tries to build up character, but fails. So, two hours of the film are wasted, generally speaking. But the death of Alexander's father was pretty well done.On the whole, Alexander does not have the makings to be great - the acting is wooden, the script isn't great, and most of it is pretty laughable. If you must, rent the DVD and just watch both main battle scenes - they are truly great, and show that Oliver Stone can direct well. But this film has marred his career, to be honest - I am wanting to see his latest film, World Trade Center - let's hope that is better. Not great. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Eastern European or Irish?,"When I went to watch 'Alexander' I was expecting to see a really bad film. Usually when you expect to see a bad film it turns out to be quite impressive. That was not the case this time. In fact, my disappointment was far bigger than I expected it to be. I decided not to ever comment 'a film like this one' and the only reason I went to see it was because this film was supposed to represent my history and culture.Anthony Hopkins had the worst character make up ever! I could not believe that was actually him. I think make-up artistes had quite a fun deciding how many people will have one eye missing because if you did notice; nearly every second actor did not have one. Angelina Jolie did not age in twenty years; all she got was a bit of a grey hair. Colin Farrell had a bleached blonde hair and his dark roots were extremely annoying as the real Alexander was natural blonde I believe and people did not bleach their hair in 323 B.C. I believe that black eyeliner was supposed to make him look exotic I have to admit I was very impressed by the way Persians were presented. The costumes and the interior design of the palace were beautiful. I could not stop laughing when I realised Collin Farrell was using his Irish accent. Why Angelina did not use it as well, instead she tried to sound like Eastern European but it turned out quite poor. If it's too difficult to learn how to speak Macedonian why just don't speak English. Trying to have eastern European accent is worse because people at Alexander's time did not speak English with various accents.I was quite impressed by camera-work and lighting.

"It was good, but I was hoping for a more in-depth historical account.","Although I enjoyed this movie, I felt that too much attention was placed on the relationship between Alexander and his parents. Too many of the mythical, and historical events that made Alexander such a controversial subject in history were skipped. The first major battle against Darius (Battle of Issus) where Alexander proved that he was a brilliant tactician, was not even mentioned. There was no mention of Alexander's unorthodox solving of the Gordian Knot puzzle (supposedly anyone who could untie this massive tangle of knots would rule Asia; Alexander untied it by cutting it open with his sword). What about the capture/burning of the Persian capital of Persepolis, or the scaling of Aornos (a mountain in modern day Pakistan) to squash rebel resistance? I don't know if the issue was budget, or a rush to release the movie at a certain time, but I feel that a much better job of telling the tale of one of history's great military commanders could have been accomplished in about 4 hours. I failed to see the need of switching between present day and the past to show Alexander's mother preaching about treachery. This movie fails as did the version with Richard Burton in that it focuses too much on events in Macedonia, as opposed to Persia where Alexander accomplished his greatest feats.On the plus side, the movie has a great cast. The battle scenes are entertaining, but fail to exploit Alexander's genius in battle. I recommend that people research the life/accomplishments of Alexander before watching the movie or they will fail to grasp how great his accomplishments were.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Oliver Stone should have stopped while he was ahead.,"This movie was ridiculous. There was so much talent on that screen, and they were acting their hearts out, but for what. A blown out of proportion epic that never left the ground. Stone tried too hard to make this film a ""historical documentary"" type as well as an epic and it just didn't fly. The movie is spastic and one can never figure out what the director is trying to say. I felt nothing for any of the character since no effort was made to make the audience empathize with them. Angelina Jolie was a stand out amongst this droll film though, pretty convincingly playing Alexander's jealous and conniving mother. Anthony Hopkins as ""narrator"" was odd and felt disjointed with the rest of the movie. It would have felt more natural if they just let the movie tell its self instead of making it like a ""story book"" film, I just don't feel that it was that type of story.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
Good...but could have been amazing,"From the moment I heard the bizarre mix of Irish Macedonian boys to the Russian enchantress of Ms Jolie, I just felt embarrassed for this film. Non of the serious bits of dialogue (which in content themselves don't' score above average) could be taken seriously, not only because I was laughing at the voices but at Colin's 80's Dj hairstyle and the complete wimpy girly ""hardmen"" hanging around with him. It's hard to imagine an army of thousands of Persians running from a guy who's hair looks like He-Man's or any of his skinny mates in skirts and eye-liner.The whole gay-thing of Alexander, while maybe historically accurate, is more in the forefront of this movie than an actual plot. Why go conquering? What compelled Alexander to drive into the unknowns of India? The film just tries to cram in to much while one theme which would give it more of a plot.For plot and acting (apart from Farrell and maybe Jolie) the film scores a cringe-worthy 3-4. However THERE IS A DIAMOND IN THIS ROUGH! THe movie looks amazing. The costumes, the sets but most especially the battles are on a scale that makes TRoy look as dated as Hammer Horror movies. The battles are something else with dust, dirt and blood making them claustraphobically real. The city of Babylon also lights up the screen. For me the battle in India is one of the best I've seen (apart from the mental red tree bit at the end!?) and Alexander's horse dying created the only moment of emotion in the film. Therefore, despite a less than average plot and poor casting outside the leading man, the battles and sets raise the score of this to a fair 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Oliver the Megalomaniac...,"There are too many things that look ridiculous in this biopic of Alexander the Great: 1) Mr. Farrell looks more like David Beckham than like a tough and unmerciful conqueror. 2) nobody would actually believe that a woman like Angelina Jolie can be the mother of a twenty-odd years old guy. 3) What about Oliver Stone's insistence on giving that ultra-gay touch to all the male characters? were Alexander and his crew nothing but a bunch of sissies?? I don't think so. And well, I could have overlooked all those facts if it wasn't because you can just remark a couple of scenes (the war ones) and the excellent photography out of the 3 hours of the movie.""Alexander"" is a slow movie, superficial and boring, that contributes with nothing to the figure of Alexander the Great (looks more like a caricature of that man). The only megalomaniac in ""Alexander"" is Mr. Oliver Stone.*My rate: 3/10",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
It works!,"This movie is a nice surprise; after all horrible Hollywood trash about Ancient World (like 'Troy') we are getting a film which is relatively honest with history - at least, it doesn't have any obvious glaring mistakes. It is anti-war - yet battles are very impressive. It is, in short, about illusions and how people lose them - the main illusion being Alexander's idea that he can 'free' - liberate - the whole world. Very American, and very naive - and that's exactly what the director wants us to understand. The rest - 'gay' relationships with friends etc is, a) immaterial - they just help to show that the her is not happy, which is natural for a king; b) historically true. Alexander is shown as a week, troubled, but personally charming and charismatic human being: no stupid pathos or attempts to idealize him, which is nice. Colin Farrell is VERY good - in fact, despite his Irish looks, he manages to look like Alexander on his existing portraits and also to look very Greek - as some genuine statues and mosaics. He also shows good complex acting - his Alexander is a man with problems andnot just a cartoon. Yet - no hamming or OVER-acting, which is a credit to young actor, too. Val Kilmer as Alexander's father is splendid. Angelina Jolie is not so good, and there is too much of her. A very good film - long, but not boring, sad, but not tearful. In short, it shows that great director and fine actors can make even film about Alexander the Great work - a fact which never yet happened in movie history (just for comparison, see 'Alexander the Great' with Richard Burton - and see just how bad it was and just how good Colin Farrell is).",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
3-hour...Gay....Fest...Enough said.,"Does any one agree that this movie is a complete waste of 3 hours. Watching this was more amusing than painful. Watching Jared Leto sweet talk Colin Ferril doesn't interest me much. I almost broke out laughing out loud in the theatre more than probably 5 times watching this movie. As accurate as it may be on Alexander's life, there should have been a limit to Oliver Stone's free spirited excessive emphasis on Alexander's homosexual tendencies and more on his conquests and life, not just the homosexual aspects. I sat for 3 hours, watching Alexander's conquests be blinded by his homosexuality. And on top of that, there were only 2 battle scenes, and they both were boring to the point where I was yawning. And another question, did anyone else think that Anthony Hopkins's character was completely useless, and the cuts between Alexander's life and Anthony Hopkins's story-telling to the boyish scribe were really annoying and interfered with he movie's flow. Maybe I'm being a little over-the-top, but come on, Alexander's life is supposed to be a great epic, not a 3- hour gay soap opera.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Oliver Stone, you're fired","Okay first off, what the hell Mr. Stone, come on now?I haven't seen many of Oliver Stones movies, but the one's I've seen are awesome. I remember leaving the movie theatre like WOW!!! I felt like I been somewhere and threw something. But this, was, corny, fake, terrible, bad, horrible, all blended together with a bad script and a bad movie score.If a director wants a narrator then have one, Anthony Hopkins part was completely unnecessary. I also think it was miss casted. Why is Alexander's mom like only eleven month's older then him. And I didn't even like the fight scenes, they took too long, and the repeating shot of the eagle. And why was Alexander always lecturing, his long and boring speeches kept coming, and they were about the same friggin' thing.Also if the writer wants to hint bi-sexuality, then do it, but don't give these boring scenes between two men saying how happy they are to be with each other and then embrace. Have one scene where Alexander's just kissing a guy and that's it.Music bad, didn't match the battle scenes at all, I'd rather hear a wanna be Gladiator theme then some off tune orchestra. Mr. Stone, you're a good guy, but for this movie you're fired!!!Antony Lopez",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
I believed all movies had *something* to offer...,"... and I'd never been proved wrong, until now. The script/dialogue, casting, accents, character ""development"", selection and development of themes, plot and tome of this movie are an utter mess.I hold no previously established distaste for Stone or any of the actors, and I'd read no reviews going in. I enjoy challenging movies, and I promise any other reviewer who claims my dislike comes from an unwillingness to think is wrong. My distaste for this movie comes from the sheer horror I experience when I realize millions of people are about to be tricked into seeing this atrocious film.If Alexander had been the person Stone portrays him to be, he would never have accomplished all he did. I am not referring to the fact that, as a Macedonian living circa 350BC, he probably had carnal knowledge of a few men, and that the movie works with this probability. That's just fine. Ferrell was the wrong decision for this part, and the script never lets him have a backbone, much less the god-like drive that historians credit Alexander with.Jolie's accent is odd, (I know a number of Greeks and Russians. Her accent resembles the latter.) but at least she stays with it. Ferrell pops out a brogue every now and again. The shaky character development is further highlighted by this breaking of illusion. The pervasive inclusion of modern-day American clichés in the dialogue further shatters the illusion.Stone's choices about what pieces of history make the cut are odd. This fact, coupled with cheesy soundwork, bad, negligible and tangled character development and a seemingly anesthetized Jared Leto with too damn much eyeliner made me empathize with the soldier's sentiment near the end of this three-plus hour movie. I was completely worn out by Alexander.",,Anonymous,Biography
What a waste,"Stone's ""Alexander"" tries to tell the story of one of the great military leaders and conquerors of all time who is to this day, some 2300 years later, is still studied in military war colleges. Unfortunately the film tries too hard to do too much resulting in three hours of jumping around in time trying desperately to show us the man and his human story while carrying on great expeditionary campaigns at the same time. With insufficient didactics, overzealous theatrics, and the esoterics of the time, the film becomes nothing less than a numbing mess. Listening to Stone's director's cut one gets the impression he had a clear vision of what he wanted to accomplish with his well researched historical epic. One also gets the impression he made the movie for himself. Lacking in coherence, muddled and messy, ""Alexander"" is a classic example of what happens when one ventures too deep into that creative territory where less is more resulting in a spectacular flop.

Expectations ran high...,"Alexander is, without doubt, a breathtaking movie. The scenes depicting the battle of Gaugamela can be used in any presentation dealing with warfare in classical times. But somehow, the script starts losing itself after the triumphal entry of Alexander in Babylon. No doubt there will be viewers who'll disagree with me. But in the course of the movie, the central figure Alexander loses more and more depth, while the surrounding ones, including his wife Roxana, gain it. It could well be that Stone tried to convey to us the feeling of loss of direction overwhelming the Macedonians, but to me it felt particularly unsettling. At one point, I even grew tired of the many homosexual escapades of Alexander, wondering what essential elements that number actually did add to the storyline. I have to say that it did not.Maybe it's because after seeing so many spectacle war movies with special effects, like Gladiator, Pearl Harbour and King Arthur, I am wondering whether I am supposed to look at the horrors and butchery of those times, or to learn more from the central figures. I long for the drama and the depth of older productions of the same kind and could even stand a bit of old-fashioned morale embroidered in the story. Enough of that crude hyperrealism embellished by smart special effects. Please have mercy and give us normal movies again!",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"From another ""Close Minded American Idiot""","I've read through quite a lot of comments of this movie, and as per usual to movies of this type, the common feeling seems to be ""if people didn't like it then they were obviously 'ignorant' or 'homophobes'"". While the movie had scenes that would make the ""Average Joe"" squirm awkwardly in their seats, there is more that can be attributed to that reaction then the homosexual erotica.As you might tell from the low score, I didn't like this movie. Perhaps the only reason why it got such a ""high score"" out of me is because I enjoyed every second Val Kilmer was on screen. He made that movie just a little more bearable. But his talents (as well as the other actors apart of this project) were wasted in a movie that felt more obsessed over artistic, jerky camera angles, muted colors, and taboo subject matter then the actual fascinating life and legends of Alexander the Great.I went into the movie with high hopes. The trailers looked promising and I believed that the movie was very well cast, but I walked out more disappointed with this movie then I should have been. For a story that should have been treated with a bit more of a linear perspective of Alexander's youth to his death (and everything in between), it hopped around like a suicidal jackrabbit in the middle of the New Jersey turnpike. Changing position without warning and begging for something to quickly put it out of it's misery.I think a lot of historically significant moments in Alexander's life should have been there, not just because they would have been cool to see, but because I think they help frame his character for the audience to make him more real. Not event the battles that made him legend were treated in any sort of way that would make them understandable. Unless you were a history or war tactics major of some sort, I dun think there was any way of knowing the tactical genius going on through the dust and shaky cameras. And what might have been a memorable and uplifting speech for the first fight in the movie was traded in for a literal bird's eye view that didn't help to further the plot in any way at all.I'm all for 3 hour movies, but if they *feel* like 3 hours, it's time to get a new editor. Long, drawn out, and uncomfortable dialog accompanied by non linear scenes that stunt any kind of character development is a bit hard on the average movie goer looking for an action packed, historically epic hero's journey.Atop of those problems, it felt like the director was *aiming* to make his audience uncomfortable. Perhaps it's an artistic attempt to observe people's reactions. But there is a right way and a wrong way to get reactions out of people based on taboo subject matter. Alexander was a wrong way. With the main character as vapid and uninteresting as the plot-less plot, throwing in a couple scenes of hardcore sex and overly suggestive homo-erotica, it begins to feel less like a movie, more like a cheap peepshow. Every single thing felt disjointed, inhuman, and full of void. If you like that kind of thing, more power to you. But I didn't appreciate it.By the end of it I found myself not caring to know any more about this historical juggernaut. It's sad really. This movie certainly proves that you're better off listening in history class or reading a book to make your own movie in your head, because this movie certainly did not live up to what it had to deliver. If you want to learn about and be amazed by the story of Alexander the Great, read about it, watch documentaries, and maybe there are some worthwhile made for TV movies available. If your looking for an overly and unnecessarily artsy Hollywood film that's supposed to be about Alexander... go right ahead.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Good Film,"I liked this movie and could criticize it until tomorrow, but since I lack the time I want to put one positive and one negative thing out there:1) Watching this with a lot of knowledge on Alexander's history it makes me wonder why the producers chose a guy who looks nothing, and I mean nothing, like the true Alexander did.Firstly, it is a common misconception that he was blond when in fact he was actually dark featured, with dark brown hair. The actor doesn't have any phenotypes of a Greek man either (the aquiline straight nose is missing, he looks entirely British) which kinda ruins the vibe of connecting the actor to the character Alexander fully.I could say this for the rest of the characters as well but they are not as important as the casting of the main character, which should've been much much better researched considering the amount of money spent on this movie. There must be a million Greeks who could've played the part way better suited.2) I liked how they included the possibility of his death being by poison because historians actually still debate this till today.The directors also showed his progressive ideas quite well which was also very nice to see in a non-documentary like movie.Other than that it was a long and overall good movie that represented him quite well and was nice to watch. I might be missing some stuff but I really can't type too long so I'll leave you with that :).",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Simply Awful,"For once, the critics are right. This movie is not good.Don't get me wrong. It's not the homosexuality that bothers me. It's not that I find this movie boring, either. What bothers me is the acting, or lack thereof.None of the actors were any good, and throughout the movie, they consistently spewed out corny lines such as, ""Conquer your fear, and I promise you, you'll conquer death!"" Not to mention, such lines as ""You love him?"" Not only were all of the accents overdone and obnoxious, if they weren't involved in some cliché monologue, they were spewing lame one-liners.While the action sequences were decent, they were few and far between to justify giving this movie more than one star. It would be one thing if this movie was only one hour and a half, or maybe two hours at most, but this was three hours of brutal overacting. Quite honestly, it was a pain to watch.Now, onto the matter of the accents. While some people have noted that they would be speaking in Greek, and not in English, this does not change the fact that when Greeks speak English, they talk with a rather noticeable accent. They would not be speaking in an Irish accent, and they wouldn't be speaking in a Russian accent (Angelina Jolie). It wouldn't be too bad, but they were all over the top. The accents helped to make the movie quite tedious.It's the only movie I've ever seen, that made we want to run out of the theater screaming. It's a movie I would never see again. In fact, it's a movie I would rather never see. Period.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
I have seen many epic's in my time............but only one colossus,"The one-dimensional (mostly American) view on this film aside, this film is not breath-taking, it isn't inspiring and it isn't beautiful to look at. What it is however is the strongest, heartfelt look at a land that time forgot. About a man who was so ahead of his time that he was frightened to discover the depths of his ambition. I went to see this film early in the morning so there was only one other guy in the cinema. I couldn't see other peoples reactions so it was all about me and the film. Val Kilmer is captivating, Angelina Jolie is mesmerizing and Colin Farrell.......Colin brings out such grand feelings and emotions , that I'm sure he's never actually felt on such a scale, out of nowhere its hard to believe that he hasn't killed thousands of men and gone to the ends of the earth. Its true he brings the 21st century wild boy image to the role(and it was easy to see that at times he felt over-awed by the scale of the film) but nevertheless being 16 myself in our era i would have it no other way. That raw intensity that young men feel nowadays is essential to such a gigantic role. The story packs so much history and love into its 2 hours and 55 minutes that i never felt bored...EVER. Most of time when colin cries you cant help but well up too. Everyone thought Gaugemela was great (which is was) but i loved the guerrilla sequence that the second battle brought with its erratic battling, shifted color scenes which were simply cool and of course the grand face/off between Alexander and Bucephalus and the Indian king and his elephant, its simply magnificent with the big animal noises, direction and grandeur. I know I've concentrated more on the character of Alexander himself rather than anything else but thats what i thought made the movie myself. I wont address the bisexuality thing, to me i didn't know what the big American deal was about it, a few hugs and a kiss pssshhh whats the deal? i thought there wasn't enough myself and there's not a gay bone in my body. Iwant this film to go well but sooner or later in years to come it will be recognized for WA t it truly is a, which is simply a massive canvas of historical art, and Stone has the paint brush splashing reds, blues, yellows etc.. wherever he like creating a masterpiece, bravo Oliver!

I wish they'd focus more on the story of the Macedonian King and less on pointless drama and romance. Other than that it is quite a nice film.,"""Alexander"" needed to be polished before its release and I feel that the director overlooked a lot of things. I do not consider this film as a faithful representation of the Macedonian King's life. However, the movie is entertaining enough to keep me glued to the screen for its 3 hours length. The costumes and the locations are wonderful and I enjoyed the general artistic direction. The battle scenes are dynamic, gruesome and compelling: the director immerses the audience by taking it inside the battlefield, showing the emotions of the soldiers that are fighting. I liked the narration provided by Ptolemy, explaining the long and difficult journey of Alexander. It really shows that he had big dreams about his empire and wanted to push the boundaries of the known world back then. The film highlights the huge differences between cultures that the king wanted to unify, but never really managed to do so, because there was no integration politics at play. He just wanted to expand his territory but he did not know how to actually organize it.Unfortunately, there are also many weak points that made this film not quite as good as it could be. The director focused too much on pointless drama, and there are many scenes that could be easily cut out from the final cut, bringing down the runtime significatively. It is okay to dedicate a few moments on the personal and romantic life of the macedonian king, but I think that it took too much space and at times I was wondering if I was watching an historical colossal, or some kind of cheap soap opera. The acting is overall good: there are a few cast members that shine such as Colin Farrell, Jared Leto and obviously Anthony Hopkins. Very disappointed by Angelina Jolie who portrayed the mother of Alexander and that for mysterious reasons she had a Russian accent, instead of a Greek one. Luckily she had a marginal role.I would recommend this movie because there are in fact many interesting moments, however there are many other historical flicks that found a good balance between dramatization and the narration of historical facts. ""Alexander"" unfortunately is not there. With that being said, it is not as bad as people say and in my perspective it is a solid 6 stars out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"not the worst but very, really very bad",after I watched this movie I had to ask: why O. Stone did not make a good movie after Natural born killers? And in the first place: why O.

Stone does.some notes: This is not film about Alexander. C. Farell perhaps can't act or he had not opportunity. Almost the most stupid idea was that in this movie acts A.

Don't get me wrong, Oliver Stone has one of my favorite directors for years, but I don't know exactly what he was trying to accomplish here.

Pretty thorough historical story but is unfocused.,"There's a ton of material here but is missing the main story of Alexander the Gordian knot. This one story is the theme that is missing in the entire story. When faced with this puzzle Alexander uses brute force and clarity.

Face it you don't want Colin to kiss Lido as your main love theme in a film unless you're gay.

Besides all the homosexual behavior, the movie itself wasn't that great to begin with.I've never really been a fan of Oliver Stone anyway, in case the summary doesn't clue you in.Overall you can't really take my opinion to heart since I really really don't like Oliver Stone.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
A stunning work on a difficult subject,"Despite the huge budget and tremendous scope of Oliver Stone's labour of love, he has crafted a film that will be of interest only to a specific audience. There is a stubborn passion for his subject that precludes an audience unwilling to share it.The wonderful film-making quote ""a hundred patrons will see the same film a hundred different ways"" is particularly pertinent here, as out of those hundred, I suspect only a handful will see 'Alexander' close to the way the director intended. Put simply, it's a historical figure brought to life as accurately as dramatisation allows, and those who don't care to spend time with Stone's deeply flawed, legendary conquerer, or wish to consider the (un-Hollywood) nature of what made him 'Great', are likely to be bored for three interminable hours.I found the movie to be wholly engaging. Incredible battles aside (of which there are two: visceral and brutal), the performances of Angelina Jolie and Val Kilmer are larger-than-life and memorable, the narration by Anthony Hopkins (as Ptolemy) compelling and the visuals nothing short of stunning. I would say one has to be interested in the subject beforehand to properly enjoy Stone's interpretation, but as a screenplay it is both penetrating and eloquent.And lastly, Colin Farrell as 'Alexander' puts every last ounce of passion and skill into his portrayal. Despite what many have said, he is to my mind the only actor of his age possessing the mercurial quality required to play a man of such extreme contradictions. He is terrific in a phenomenally difficult role.The makers of this film should be proud. At a time in which people seem to have declared the end of the 'historical epic' cycle, what a shame that America's maverick has suffered the backlash of modern critics' obsession with the here and now. As if a depiction of ancient times needs first to be processed through our trite and brittle sensibilities.""Fortune favous the bold.""

"OK, are we talking about Alexander the Great here or a gigolo philosopher?","WOW, it was a long time since I felt like getting out of the theater as soon as possible and buy a ticket for the next Chucky film! OK, I'm exaggerating, but what is definitely true is that this film was the most boring one I have watched in awhile. Was it really 3 hours? It looked like 10! Boring, boring, BORING.I'd rather see a ""dumb film"" that entertained me than this monologued crap full of trash philosophy. I couldn't stand the last hour of this thing, and it doesn't happen often, really. Is it true that the director wanted to made this film as historically accurate as possible?

What the HELL was that? Who the HECK thought of portraying him as blonde in the first place? A super-production with such a bad make-up is just offensive, and Collin Farrell is just not up to the task. His ""leadership"" was totally unconvincing, along with an overall bad acting and, yet again, his dyed hair just made me laugh (and all the people that came with me). Ah, and let's not forget the Jolie mother who looks like his younger sister (with dark brown hair????). Collin, stick to the bad boy thingy, please!If I should know that I would spend 3 hours praying for this mumbo jumbo to end, I should have read a book about the REAL Alexander and actually LEARN something about him.Nothing else to add.

Could sink like a Stone,"I had awaited this movie eagerly: the story of a man who conquered most of the known world by the time he was 25 is truly epic; I have recently read one of the many new biographies of the Macedonian warrior; in his time, director Oliver Stone has produced some fine work; and here he has spent no less than $150M, making it Europe's most costly film. One could not fail to be aware of the panning given the work by the critics, but I figured that it really couldn't be that bad. But, believe me, it is. ""Gladiator"" showed what an epic should look like and ""Troy"" was a good effort, but Stone - who, at his best, has given us such impressive work as ""Salvador"", ""Platoon"" and ""Wall Street"" - will be fortunate to survive this plodding and pedestrian debacle. The first hour is utterly tedious and one cries out for the sort of battle sequence which opened ""Gladiator"" while, towards, the sprawling end, we seem to be revisiting the manic ending of ""Apocalyse Now"" without Brando's style.So, when did it go wrong? Well, seemingly at every stage of the production process. First, Stone - and his producer Moritz Borman - rushed the whole thing in order to beat a rival production (now unlikely to reach the screen) planned by Australian director Baz Luhrmann. Then the script - co-authored by Stone himself - overdoes the theme of Alexander's bi-sexuality which is death at the US box office and becomes somewhat histrionic for the rest of the world. Some of the casting is odd - most notably the choice of Angelina Jolie (only one year older than Colin Farrell in the eponymous role) to play Alexander's mother. Next we have the appalling decision to have most of the lead actors deploy incongruous Irish accents just because lead Colin Farrell (who can do other accents) hails from the emerald isle. The whole structure is a disaster with a boring, and largely redundant, narration, confusing flashbacks, and a total bum-numbing, mind-bending length of just under three hours. Finally the editing is all wrong, as Stone made three major cuts to slice away close to an hour, but slashed too little and disjointedly. The essence of cinema is storytelling and this work utterly lacks a compelling narrative which, given the heroic feats and complex character of the man, is a special kind of achievement.Surely the film has some redeeming features? Well, the two battle sequences - the defeat of Darius and his superior forces at Gaugamela and the encounter with Indians and elephants at Hydaspes in India - are genuinely large-scale and exciting, although it is difficult to follow Alexander's tactics. The Moroccan and Thailand locations are exotic, the richly-designed sets are grand and the CGI creations, especially of the glory of Babylon, are well done. The attention to historic and military detail is commendable and thanks to Oxford academic Robin Lane Fox who gets to lead the battle charges as a reward. Angelina Jolie has the best accent (not Irish) and gives the best performance. But this is far from enough to justify the price of a theatre ticket. Can the work be rescued for the DVD or is it destined to sink like Stone? Often the DVD offers us a longer version of the movie, but this time we need a shorter, reordered account with a linear narrative, less talk and much more action.",,Anonymous,Biography
unfortunate,"Considering that Aexander the Great is one of the most fascinating historical figures as well as a brilliant commander in and off the battle field, it is a great pity that this film gave no depth to the man who accomplished so much in so little time or to his genius battle strategy. I expected the movie to be reasonably bad from the reviews, but I was still disappointed. Recently Kingdom of Heaven came out, and that is what Alexander could have been; a movie with clear historical context and narrative, a clear vision of the strategy and development of the main characters. Had Alexander been drastically cut: the battle simulations eliminated and redone with narrative and clear visuals, the relationship with his mother less about filming snakes... then maybe this film could have had a little more impact.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
What A Mess,"I just finished watching the so-called 'Director's cut' of this film. I have a degree in history and have always been fascinated by Alexander the Great. I have read many books speculating as to who Alexander really was. What an amazing man he must have been. Needless to say I had anticipated this movie for some time.Boy was I sorely disappointed.Colin Farrell was a complete BUST as Alexander. Smirking at Angelina Jolie while he was delivering his 'son to mother' lines was bad enough. But after listening (and cringing through) his great 'speech' to the troops before Gaugemela, I was surprised that the men didn't retreat in a panic and/or commit wholesale suicide. Farrell is not believable AT ALL as Alexander, nor is he in any way believable as a leader of men. He is simply not a good actor.This movie is hopelessly schizophrenic about Alexander. Oliver Stone makes Alexander out to be a 'shoot from the seat of the pants' wannabee who runs around the ancient world acting petulantly and disrespecting his colleagues and looking rather childish in nearly every scene he is in. This is then juxtaposed with scenes of Anthony Hopkins blathering on in the library at Alexandria about how incredible Alexander the Great was. Wait a minute. Are we talking about the same guy here? Or is Stone making the brilliant point that reality and myth are not the same? It's almost as if Stone is intentionally TARNISHING Alexander's legacy.I also must confess that I didn't realize how much eye makeup people wore in the fourth century B.C. Everybody wore a lot! I was also surprised at the lack of dirt on anything in those ancient cities. Spotless.Did I mention the special effects were poor?IN SUM: THREE POINTS: Casting Farrell was the kiss of death, but had the movie somehow survived this inexplicable casting decision, the script would surely have killed it, and if the movie somehow lived through those two traumas, then the director's decision to have the Macedonians speak in a Scottish ACCENT (I'm not making this up)would surely have proved fatal.Don't waste your time with this piece of rubbish.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
one of the worst movies i ever saw,"Well this movie have pseudo-intellectual options,because everything is around Alexander sexual options and his problems with his family,the action is ultra slow which means the dialogs are dumb useless and sometimes out of the story i mean there isn t any action in this movie. The fight scenes are ridiculous,i mean you can t see any work made by the actors only horse races with very few guys fighting. Colin farrell isn t the man for this i think nobody understands what a small man and very poor actor like him is doing in this film,nobody can see this guy as someone great but only as a supportive character,the man doesn t have talent and charisma for big roles. The sadest part of this film is watch actors like Hopkins or val Kilmer in pain trying to make make a good work and give some soul to the movie,but they failed.This is a very arguable recreation of Alexander life,if you think you can watch an adaptation you are wrong,this doesn t have a script it is an historical work more a documentary concerned in telling us an ultra arguable vision of Alexander personal life forgetting the military part which was the main part of Alexander life because he was a conqueror.Avoid this like plague if you think this is some kind of Braveheart.This isn t a movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great Weak Alexander,"I don't know why a lot of people against this movie. I'm surprise when saw its rating is 5.5. It's better than King Arthur, which rating is 5.9, 100 times. How about Troy? Alexander has a great battle. Troy's battle is just a big CG scene (look like we watch the Troy animation). Of course, Alexander is not great as I hope (and u too, right?). I really disappoint with Ptomely (Anthony Hopkins), who talks too much, talk and talk and talk, seem like Oliver Stone afraid that the audiences can't understand what he wants to show. But, Colin Farrell is great. He shows a weak side of Alexander so well and heroic side also. Maybe, when making a movie about a great hero, and that hero has weakness, like homosexual, cry so much and love so much, people think ""Man, it's suck"". I don't know. I think this movie is great. I know more about a life of someone who conquered the world. Someone loved and died for love. Someone that lonely...In the end, when Alexander died, his last vision haunted me. When i come back home, i still saw what he saw... This epic is the best epic of this year, to me!",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Alexander the lame,"This movie had no basic attributes to make it entertaining. I left the movie wondering what happened to that time in my life. I am not an overly critical movie goer this movie was just simply bad. I did not care about any of the characters because they they really did not do anything to evoke any kind of emotion, entertain or serve much of a purpose. The actions scenes struck me as simple confusion and gore with nothing dazzling at all. Through out the movie there seemed to be numerous instances of male on male affection that seemed to be simply thrown in for no apparent reason.I can see a movie and appreciate it for what it is if there is anything to appreciate but with Alexander there was nothing.",,Anonymous,Biography
A monument of monumentality - and a freudian nightmare!,"To keep things short and simple: this is without the slightest doubt the worst movie I've seen in the past years. It's truly monumental in its failure and when Theodor Adorno said (in his ""Theory of Aesthetics"") that art of greatest dignity is the one that is ""un-identical"" and offers no possibility to easily assimilate it - this must be art then! Never in my life have I seen a movie with such horrible acting (alone to speak of Angelina Jolie! the postmodern nightmare incarnated! a model that only lives off it's grotesque visible proportions and thereby functions like a screen for all kind of regressive projections) and such a bad, bad dramaturgy - it leaves you, the viewer, outside the story from beginning to end. or should i mention the anachronistic concept of ""myth"" and the omnipresent, cheap and dull Freudian symbolism? Or how about homosexuality in the movie which is treated with the same Hollywood-esquire fear as always? It's grotesque! When we see Alexander fugging, he does it with a woman - when he loves men, he treats them like brothers ... Or how about the amateurish cgi? The battle sequences which were about as dramatic and epic as the ones in ""The Mummy"" (the recent version). Holy hell - the longest 3 hrs of my life! I could go on for hours, but it's really not worth it. A true monument of what Hollywood has become - cheap, dull, lame-ass, below average, recycled, eclectic, normative, idiotic mass-consumption.

Crap-tacular Flambe,"I went into this film with a prior knowledge of Alexander's sexuality, and having an open mind like I do, it didn't bother me at all. The movie was supposed to be about Alexanders great conquests of lands unknown, but that whole idea got ensnared in homo-erotic stares that ate up screen time. It got to the point that I wanted them to screw and get it over with so we could resume the conquering(or lack thereof). Overall the movie left a bad taste in my mouth, something that other Oliver Stone movies have done before this. The fight scenes were nonexistent and the camera work of over dramatized. Brilliant scores accented scenes of horse races that ultimately ended abruptly with Alex and his gang camping in the mountains and complaining about going home. The narration was unspecific and confusing at best.The final battle against the Persians was somewhat entertaining, but did not make up for the previous two hours of my high hopes being trampled under gay tension and witless banter.I must say that besides Colin Farrell, the acting was superb. Val Kilmer brought his A game as always, and Jolie was extremely hot despite her unforgivable Russian accent.If you are interested in seeing a good Oliver Stone film, look elsewhere. Cut your teeth on Born on the Fourth of July or Platoon if you are truly interested in his work.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Don't Hate,"It is obvious that many people would dislike this movie from the minute it starts because they are not going to want to hear that Alexander the Great was GAY. Yeah, he liked to bang guys but this is as factual as ancient history can be. I graduated as a history major, and if there is one thing i have learned about ancient history, it is that facts are a very grey area. You can only go by what you have to interpret an event. As for the film itself, i thought it was excellent. It follows the genre of epic historical films (like Braveheart, Troy, Spartacus...etc) and does so with some conventional wizardry.The dialogue was beautiful and elequent, the flashbacks were not boring and easy, but challenged the audience, which i liked (God bless the A.D.D. audience---you prolly slit your wrists!) I enjoyed Anthony Hopkins as Ptolmey, and was Surprised at Colin Ferrel's acting ability. I enjoyed his performance, which is the only thing i feared going into the film. I also enjoyed Oliver Stone's citation of his own work (Scarface) in the dialogue ""The World is Yours"". I thought the Gaugamela battle scene was intense, and the presence of the Eagle in that scene took my breath away. What the feeble-minded miss in Oliver Stone's pictures is his keen sense of detail when dealing with culture. 10 years ago, someone making a film about Alexander would have left out ANY AND EVERYTHING homosexual. Also, i feel that he tended to the Grecian Pagan religion very well... (Instead of them saying Oh God...they name a God they would prey to for the situation. Stone is an excellent filmmaker and proved it many ways in this film, so much so that I could write a book about it.It was an excellent film, i give it 4 out of 4 stars and i will prolly go and see it again.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Very difficult to find value,"There aren't many attributes which are worth analyzing in this movie. The script is terrible. ""you break my heart, you men, afraid"" wow. compelling. There are segments where bickering breaks out, yet there is no repartee, just people yelling -- oh, and swelling music.fact there are so many voice overs throughout the movie clearly indicate there are some serious problems with storytelling.As far as I can tell, there is no continuity. Not with the scenes or dialog or emotions they attempt to portray.The thinly veiled sexual confusion present in the characters is embarrassing.The wigs are fantastically terrible, and so very confusing for ancient Greece. The accents are strange and variable.There is no feeling that it is even attempting to portray the any sense of the period, except for the presence of Greek mythology in some of the dialog. The movie isn't quite epic, though it probably cost as much as an epic film. Even though it is lacking in historical value and reference, I thought it could have been fun as an epic. Alas no.I had heard it was bad, but I was willing to give it a chance. I feel I can marshall preconceptions to some extent, but this film was impossible to see any other way.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
It doesn't get any worse than this,"I was able to see this movie for free the other night, and though I hadn't had any special plans to go see it before, I decided to give it a shot and go. I had no great expectations, really. I thought it would be a blockbuster in the classic sense, in which I'd be fairly entertained either by acting or grand battles or possibly both. I also imagined that it would be heavier in drama than most epics, as the story of Alexander's life isn't all peaches and bunny rabbits.After seeing it, I wish I had demanded to be paid for the three hours of my life I'll never get back.Where to start? The dialogue was horrendous. Cut and pasted from the past five plus years worth of films, it was the Frankenstein of epic dramas. For example, rather than Gladiator's line of ""Shadows and dust"" we are treated with ""sun and shadows.""I was seated in a theater with more than four hundred people, so I know I'm not alone when I say that a majority of the battle scenes, inspiring speeches, and heart wrenching tender moments were outright laughable. The audience cracked up at nearly every important moment in the film, including the imitation Braveheart/Gladiator rallying speech and the various Hephaestion/Alexander moments meant to show us the inner turmoils and fears of the protagonist.And this doesn't even touch upon the various accents the actors used. I realize the filmmakers were likely trying to make the point that Alexander's army was a mix of different people, including many different kinds of Greeks and Macedonians, by utilizing a variety of types of speech. Still, Irish, Scottish, and English accents accidentally modernized the film and made it even more of a mockery. Angelina Jolie didn't even bother with any of those, but instead opted for an accent so fake that I expected her to list ""Moose and Sqvirrel"" amongst Alexander's enemies.Since the drama had clearly fallen on its face early in the film, I kept hoping for the battle scenes to redeem it. Once again I was disappointed, to put it VERY lightly. In three hours we're ""rewarded"" with only two major battle scenes, which is odd in itself for a movie about a famous conqueror. The majority of both consist of shaky cameras filled mainly with shots of Alexander's army at extreme close-up, or Alexander in slow motion. Phalanx shots are obscured by layers of dust (if we're not watching their marching feet) while the heart of the chaos is cut too fast to watch any one amazing, or even vaguely interesting, battle between individual opponents.It cannot be argued that it was merely displaying the chaos of real fighting. A movie should have some narrative thread even in a battle, and the absence of one left me feeling separate, an outsider, rather than engaged in the action. There was no suspense. Battles were outright boring, even when the filmmakers tried to shock the audience with massive amounts of blood.I don't have to room to point out the problems with the terrible score, nor the almost painful-to-watch acting we were subjected to. And considering just how bad this film was, I think everything I've said so far boarders on being too nice.I will give the movie credit for only one thing: the scenery in Babylon was pretty neat. And for what he was given, Val Kilmer at least managed to pull out an OK character from the mire of this film.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Oliver Stone's Another Masterpiece,"I had the opportunity of watching the film this weekend on one of the major movie houses here in Manila, and I was happy to know that it was on SRO (Standing Room Only) and did good in the box office. I just observed that Filipinos have come to understand and have become mature in dealing plots that are controversial and have become more intelligent in the type of movies they watch.This film has again proved that Oliver Stone is one of the top-caliber directors in Hollywood, therefore proving 'Fortune favours the bold'. I loved the film and I intend to purchase a copy soon and add it to my collection including 'Heaven and Earth' and 'Platoon'.Colin Farrell did good in this movie and has exceeded our expectations for his portrayal as Alexander.

Great actors, huge budget and a hero's bio to work with, how else could this movie have been thrown in the trash?First, let's talk about some of the good things about this film. 1) Great CG effects and battle sequences. Maybe a little too graphic, but great for people who are into bloody war sequences. 2) Somehow kept me watching, although I hated it.Now for the bad things. Well - there was a lot. 1) the cast. Paid the wrong people to do the job. What was up with there accents? I would have rather seen a subtitled version of the movie. 2) If you've read any of the passed reviews, you would already know about the terrible chronology. Someone stated it perfectly, ""It's like watching this movie with the reels all mixed in the wrong places."" Wow, what a disaster. 3) Although the homosexuality of the Greek culture is true to history, that's not what Alexander the Great was about. He wasn't ""Great"" because he was a homosexual or whatever the director was trying to portray. He was great for a lot of historical events that the director chose not to include to fit in boring, useless homosexual sequences.There are worse things about this movie, but I'm not going to waste my time.

Simply Awful.,"More evidence that Oliver Stone continues to provide over-the-top crap. Way over-dramatized, over-acted, and overdone. Factually inaccuracies can be put down to artistic license, but Stone's love affair with pomp & ceremony just get ridiculous in this poor attempt at an epic. From the very opening minute to the end of Anthony Hopkin's final soliloquy, Stone seems at a loss as to how to make this work. Perhaps that's unfair: not the opening minute - Brian Blessed's performance as the 'Wrestling Trainer' was one of the few stand-outs. How Oliver Stone manages to realize such histrionic performances from such storied actors is truly testament to his lack of vision. Given the strength of the actors that are involved in the production, one can only assume that the blame lies squarely with Stone's direction. If you feel the urge to watch this movie - Do yourself a favour, just say 'no'.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography

a little respect for a sincere film,"Having seen this film almost a month ago i wouldn't have bothered to add my comments here if i weren't extremely offended by the continuing critics'(filthy?) attack on it.I was naive enough to believe that the really nasty criticism should be kept for the film rubbish.Awfully bad or silly films have been treated mildly by the critics whereas in ""Alexander""'s case we have a definitely serious piece of work torn to pieces with inexplicable rage.I don't claim that ""Alexander"" is a masterpiece of cinematography or that Oliver Stone is Eisenstein's reincarnation but i feel that there was a peculiar rush to condemn this film and ridicule its intentions.In Greece, where i come from, Alexander the Great is a part of our tradition,an everlasting legend,a symbol.Having grown with this legend,almost from the cradle, i have searched for him for many years through the primary historical sources and the most recent historical biographies.My conclusion is that ATG is one of the most elusive personalities in history.So i believe that there is enough space for any serious artist (or thinking person for that matter) to approach ATG from many different angles.Oliver Stone chose to look for the man behind the legend.To ponder on his dreams and his fears,his demons and his ""divine"" madness.O.S.'s Alexander isn't the mighty conqueror or the invincible son of Zeus not because his leading actor fails to fill the shoes of such a hero but because Stone isn't interested in making another epic about an ancient superman.This film was made with a lot of love and respect towards its subject.It is passionate and strange and difficult to understand as Alexander himself is.It has many flaws that actually originate from its creator's obsession with Alexander the Great.Nevertheless it is an honest attempt to tell ATG's story with a lot of poetry and a lot of madness.For my part i have to thank Oliver Stone for his descent approach on Alexander the Great and Colin Farrell for his passionate and extremely human personalization of my hero.I believe that the critics have already lavished their praises on the next mediocre product of the film history that came along.As for ""Alexander""?

Alexander should of been played by Kevin Sorbo, and Roxanna could've been Lucy Lawless or Tia Carrere. I fell asleep during the first part and had to fast forward thru to the spot i left off. I could not watch it again. It is on right now in fact as a type this because i am so mortified by the terrible acting and cheesy battle cries, that i cannot finish. The only decent scene is the full frontal by Rosario Dawson, but that is ruined by the unnecessary showing of Colin Farrel's gooch(spot in between male sex organ and rectum.

Is Hollywood ruled by talentless protégés these days?,"I do not even know where to begin... Such is my deep disappointment with this movie. I suppose that every history buff shares this emotion, and not surprisingly the movie tanked at the box office.The dialog is very simplistic, barely touching the level of complexity of the unfolding events. For example could you understand why he decided to execute Parmenion? Virtually none of the characters was really introduced, and so numerous of the palace and gathering scenes appear out of sequence, and it is not obvious what and whom they depict. Imagine you would open a 2000-page book randomly here and there, read from it, and try to make sense of such random fragments. This is how I felt while torturing myself through this malaise.Aside of the unnerving style of jumps back and forth in the time line, the entire Persian campaign of Alexander was compressed to mere one battle with Darius. Not ""Darayas,"" pronounce after me: Dar'yoos. Of course depiction of a battle itself is not an easy cinematic task, and here the makers of the movie showed their real deficits. They failed completely to explain what exactly happened at Gaugamela, and foremost, how it came to Gaugamela. Shaking cam substituted staged scenes with honest stunts, split second snippets were cut together into a visual blur without sense. Bombastic, too loud music, yelling with British/English accent completed this cinematic disaster.The storyline misses completely the fact that Gaugamela was not the beginning of the struggle with Darius III. It was the climactic battle indeed, yet just one in a row of great battles with the Persians. The first meaningful battle was the one of the Granicus River, 334BC, in which he defeated Persian general Arsames, and so called Darius III himself to the scene.Many famous events happened in between Granicus and Gaugamela. For example, at Gordium, Alexander untied the presumably unsolvable ""Gordian Knot,"" he defeated Darius in the Battle of Issus in 333 BC, and later on, he commenced the famous siege of Tyre. This event marked the end of Phoenician independence and of over 1000 years of their culture and history as a nation. Do not look for even mentioning of any of these events in this so called ""movie about Alexander."" Do not look for the equally dramatic aftermath of Gaugamela either, foremost for his march on Persepolis and the (in)famous burning of Xerxes palaces and of the city. Do not hope to see his stay in Egypt and spiritual pilgrimage to the desert, the creation of the still existing city of Alexandria and of the Ptolemaic dynasty, which lasted to the equally famous Roman civic war and the death of Cleopatra and Marcus Antonius...Shall I go on? Movie makers made of him a gay maniac, yelling and screaming, troubled man. In a sense he was troubled, a man of military genius, but lacking a political vision. A man who won everything, did not realized that and pushed his army to an epic, and yet senseless march toward India, caused a great deal of suffering and destruction. I never understood why do we call him The Great? As much as such opinion may vary, do not expect an answer from this movie. As I see it, Macedonians were only a footprint in history. Not long after Alexanders exploits, they were beaten every each time by Romans, and forced finally into becoming a Roman province. End of the game.Hitchcock, please raise from the grave, show these young Hollywood crowds how to make a good suspense. They all lost their minds and their senses.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography

Oliver Stone's fiasco,"I always thought that ""Cleopatra"" is the example of bad epic movie.

Happily, these times were soon over... till today. I'm not saying it's too bad, I think Hollywood just needs to live through another crisis to become better again. Braveheart, Gladiator, Troy, King Arthur... I never could understand what's the meaning in these movies. But when I saw Alexander I thought for the moment - cinema is dead.

Alexander the grating,"I didn't like 'Gladiator' much, and wasn't too enchanted by 'Troy' either, but 'Alexander' makes them look like epics. The acting isn't desperately bad (although I could do without seeing that old ham Hopkins again for long enough), the film is fairly loyal to historic facts (at least to those events it shows), and the costumes are splendid. That's all the good points. On the debit side are appalling direction, a complete absence of plot, and Colin Farrell's ludicrous hair. If the purpose of the film was to show how, or why Alexander became the greatest warrior king in history, then it didn't get off the starting blocks. If it's purpose was to bore you rigid (even with the unintentional comic asides - ""Roid, Macedawniyins!"") then it succeeded big time.The critics aren't always right (roight??) - but they are this time.

disjointed and a missed opportunity to make an epic,I am staggered that anyone could find something amazing to say about this film. I sat for the full 3 hours and was very disappointed that a story that could have been turned into an epic was so disjointed that it became confusing. It was rather like watching a decorator putting up wallpaper without having a clue where it is supposed to go and at what angle or what colour in the confusion it becomes a distorted mess. I was looking forward to the battle scenes in the anticipation that they would make the film worthwhile sitting through the rest of the dialogue but sadly again a missed opportunity. The battle scenes didn't save it either. Unlike Gladiator where you could understand why Maximus takes the course of action he does to win a battle and demonstrates his leadership; or even more recently TROY where Achilles demonstrates why he was deemed a god and shows his leadership. Sadly in Alexander- Alexander states his intentions much to the surprise and shock of his generals- states what he intends to do but then we really cannot see how he achieves this. When flashbacks are thrown in during the film without a clue as to there relevance at that time it takes on epic proportions instead of becoming an epic for the right reasons! How Oliver Stone never took the golden opportunity of making this into an epic and taking a leaf from Gladiator and Troy in making it thus is beyond me. I am no super director but I am sure I could have made a better effort on the budget available. My only praise is for Anthony Hopkins who narrates well and makes an attempt (probably without his knowledge) to piece this disjointed effort together.,3.0,Anonymous,Biography
Very average and too long,"Alexander the Great was a leader of men, and a great conqueror of nations. In his short life, he conquered around 90% of the then known world, creating the largest empire known. From the Persian's and Babylon, to the gates of India, he seemed unstoppable in his conquest. This film focuses mainly on the epic campaign, but with some history about the man himself, and those around him.Many harsh words have been spoken about this film, with critics deriding it a truly terrible film. This is not really fair, as there is a good film here, just it is buried amongst some of the worst film-making decisions ever. Let's start with the good points.The cast are all really passionate in their roles. Farrell, an unlikely choice for the lead, surprises by being powerful, emotional, and brutal to an amazing degree. The support cast around him are mostly brilliant (the exception I will get to in a bit). Stone directs with a wonderful vision, capturing the beauty of the settings, and the bloodiness of battle, although the occasional ""wobbly camera"" does irritate. The 'swooping eagle' view of the battlefield in particular is breathtaking. The general story is strong, and engrossing to a degree.Where the film suffers are in some ropey factors such as the accents, the extrapolation of plot, and the truly dull voice-over. Accents first, with Farrell in the lead role, for some strange reason the decision was made that, as he is Irish, everyone around him should be Irish too! Why this occurred I have no idea, but you are left with a load of terrible accents ruining some strong lines (and turning some comical). None are worse than Kilmer, the weakest link in the acting on screen. A worse accent hasn't been heard since Heath Ledger in Ned Kelly! I don't' recall this being done for films with Sean Connery in (an actor notorious for being Scottish no matter the role). The rest of the Red October crew didn't try to be from Edinburgh. By making everyone Irish, Stone has distanced the film from the 'historical accuracy' he claims he wanted to depict. It looks even worse when you see that no-one seemed to tell Angelina Jolie about the idea, so she tries desperately to put on a Macedonian accent.The plot seems insistent on hammering home some factors. One example is Alexander's love for his best friend, Hephaistion. Every 10 minutes we are reminded of their undying love by a minute or two of gazing. After the first few times, you generally get the point and the later interruptions (which get longer still) just break up the rest of the film. Overall there must be around 30 minutes of film wasted in this manner. With the Anthony Hopkins voice-over telling the story, it is surprising I managed to stay awake! The first ten minutes consisted of him droning on about something or othersorry I lost interest as he really tell the tale in the dullest, most boring way imaginable! Only once the film itself kicked in did I spark up and take note. Every now and again, Hopkins would waffle on to tell us what we missed, and the mind would wander whilst he did so.The biggest flaw in this film, however, is the decision to suddenly skip the story from his exile to him being King. I thought I had fallen asleep and missed a huge chunk of plot, and for 90 minutes was wondering what happened to his father, what had I missed, when did he come home, and why is he fighting everyone! Then, 40 minutes from the end the missing scene is shown as a flashback. It served the film no purpose placing it late in the film, and in fact served to the detriment of the end result.As I said, there is a good film in here somewhere. I reckon around 1 hour 45 mins of good film. It is just that it is muddled in with 1 hour 15 mins of bad. Seems like a decent ratio, but you need to ask yourself if you really want to spend 3 hours watching an average film?",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
Fortune favours the bold...,"When I saw the first trailer for this movie I knew this was going to be a must see. When it arrived in theatres in the US and I saw the awful critics appear on this website, I knew for sure that I needed to see this film. I mean, Americans make no sense (in general that is). Movies that shouldn't do well such as the acclaimed masterpiece of Mel Gibson, 'The passion' are through the roof. Obviously, this film was amazing for the land in which God is bigger than common sense, and therefore it made a lot of money. As if God himself would punish you if you didn't see this film. With Alexander it's somewhat different. Since Americans seem to have forgotten that their civilisation is founded in Europe they have should be interested in what is shown in this amazing film. If you don't like history on school, which by the way is perfectly understandable, check this flick out and be amazed by the gained wisdom when you'll leave this theatre. I for one, did not hate history, in fact, I was rather interested in discovering why we are what we are today. And this guy, Alexander, has played a major part in our becoming. Colin Farrel plays probably the role of his life. A stronghold on screen no doubt about it. He delivers with great passion, not as Brad Pitt did in Troy, but I'm talking about genuine heroïsm and character. Angelina Jolie, indeed talking with a strange accent, is simply amazing. Not only the way she looks, but also what she says and the way she brings it just blew me away. I have to admit that I love this kind of films, but this one can easily measure up against Braveheart. It's twice the movie than Troy was and kicks Gladiator's ass big time. A great epic, which is to my regret, misunderstood or totally not understood by the most ""civilised"" part of the world, USA.

Do not watch this movie,"I am a ancient history graduate student and my focus is on Alexander the Great. This movie is about as historically accurate as the Flintstones. They make the greatest military leader in the history of mankind out to be a indecisive bumble head and just for those who don't know Alexander III was NOT GAY. This movie is Queer Eye for that Alexander Guy, they had Alexander and Hephaistion all but pick out china patterns. Hephaistion was his best friend from childhood, not his lover. Alexander III had seven wives and over 10 children. This movie is three hours long and does not cover no where near the story of Alexander III of Macedon. He took a 40k man army and conquered 2/3 of the known world. He won several battles where his army was out numbered by more than 10 to 1. The movie covered next to nothing of his time in Egypt or his experience with the Gordian knot. This movie is one of the worst creations in the history of the world. AVOID AT ALL COST... YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Not entirely without value,"This film is truly terrible, in almost every respect.It does highlight a major fault with the IMDb rating system, in that one star is far too generous. If I could give it zero stars, I would. If I could bill those behind this film for my time wasted, I would.The sum contribution of all the people involved in the making of this film, however, cannot be dismissed quite so easily. They have found a cure for insomnia orders of magnitude better than temazepam. A warning though - I didn't get through a lot this film, and it may be possible to overdose and cause severe damage to your neural functions.Overall, best avoided.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Was Macedon populated by the Irish?,"From many of the comments made here, it appears as if some of the low ratings are due to viewers disagreement with the portrayal of Alexander's relationship with Hephaistion, Bagoas, etc. Having a keen interest in Alexander throughout my life, I am aware of the details of history and Alexander and don't have a problem with this aspect of Alexander's history. I found the movie itself to be flawed. I don't care if Oliver Stone is beatified by the Pope; he has become enthralled by his own techniques and is a legend in his own lunch box. The constant shifts in time - present-10 years earlier-present-nine years earlier-present-nine years earlier, for example...with apparently no motive other than to provide some vision or memory for Alexander was just plain silly. The seaming together of certain scenes with Anthony Hopkins' rambling was just plain silly. And aside from the blurry, fast-speed, playing with colour battle-scenes, the thing I found most ridiculous was that many of the characters, the Companions, young Alexander, and even Philip/Val Kilmer (who's American for heaven's sake!), spoke with a kind of Irish/Celtic accent. Why is that? One could barely understand Rory McCann in his only speech. I know he can speak plainly, because I've seen him in other work. Stone, or the screenwriters he works with, has a penchant for characters who hold long diatribes and speeches full of sophomoric-metaphors. This medium is called MOV-IE for a reason. There must be action. If I want to hear a lecture, I'll go back to university. I could say more; however, those who agree with me know what I would say, and those who disagree with me will have long ago stopped reading. My 'recommendation' is see this movie if you aren't familiar with the history, but if you want entertainment with your Alexandrian history, read Marie Renault's excellent series on Alexander or even the several excellent nonfiction books on this remarkable world-maker.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Better than I expected, doing some justice to his feats","Having seen countless documentary movies and animated battle stories on his feats and life I was eager to watch this film. Despite that it had a low rating and I expected nothing of it - I thought I'd have to use my imagination to make Alexander's life come to life.Oddly enough, very little of that! If anything, this movie had me gripped and fascinated for the the entire length of it's play except the odd little too CGI'd up battle scene (elephants, I say no more).Alexander does a good job in compressing and dramatising some of the more memorable events in the figure's life. The battle scenes are intense, chaotic and of sufficient scale. The backdrops varied and wonderful, although prime attention goes to the people who star in front of the landscapes, certainly.When I reed negative feedback on this movie I cannot help but think that people misidentified the less sophisticated, more dramatic or unexpectedly dry acting as old fashioned or poor skill/choice/cast. What I saw was a direct throwback to how the Greeks and Macedonians themselves told these stories - who ever has been at a play of such events will recgonise the acting style. I think it helps put the viewer more in the spirit of the time.All in all unexpectedly enjoyable, if you take the CGI for what it is : 2004, and not the best of it's time.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Alexander the not so great,"The movie is about Alexander the Great, the Greek historical figure who conquered over a 100 regions and built an empire that stretched from Europe, North Africa, and all the way to India. The movie however does not focus on what Alexander is most known for, but rather focuses on supposedly his personal life...I think? Although he conquered so many places, the movie ""Alexander"" shows only two battles, and really does not make them seem that epic or exciting. The movie has a great cast, but unfortunately, do not act very well. Colin Farrel overacts, acting as if this were a Shakespearean stage play. Angelina Jolie looks younger than Colin Farrel, and is supposed to be Alexander's mother. She speaks with a Russian sounding accent, but I thought she was supposed to be Greek? Anthony Hopkins, one of my favorite actors, manages to lull me to sleep as he tells the ""GREAT"" tale of Alexander. The chronology of this movie is all out of sequence. One example, in the beginning of the movie, they mention Alexander's father was murdered, but they don't show it until the end of the movie. The movie was confusing, poorly acted, and most of the scenes were Alexander yelling about how no thinks he's ""great"", people telling Alexander how ""great"" he is, or everyone lounging around in palaces getting drunk. The movie is almost 3 hours long, and does not make it worthwhile. The documentary on the History Channel about Alexander the Great was so much more interesting.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
My review,"Well, I didn't expect much when i rented this DVD in the first place. Needless to say, that's pretty much exactly what I got. People who are expecting to see a film made on the life of Alexander the Great, emperor of Macedonia will be sadly disappointed. Colin Farell, perpetual Bad-Boy of Hollywood, tries (and tries hard) to justice to this role but somehow..... fails. Don't ask me why director Oliver Stone ever thought he would be appropriate for this role. The film starts off weirdly enough: Angelina Jolie with child Alexander in a room full of snakes where she warns him (in an accent I found to be French) that people are like snakes- they can turn on you. Original. Most of the film is historically incorrect- check out the goofs section of this movie. Although I appreciate that fact that the movie makers were essentially trying to tell the story of the man behind the battles, they screwed up. As for the characters themselves- you begin to get tired of Alexander and find yourself wishing he'd hurry up and die at the end. The relationship between Alexander and Hephaestion (Jared Leto) has been... well... all right they're supposedly gay. Now I have no problems with homosexuals at all, but the way it has been shown in this film you begin to wonder whether Alexander was just plain lazy to fall in love with a woman. They don't seem to have highlighted the fact that maybe Alexander and Hephaestion had a relationship beyond sexual desires. And when he does eventually get a girl- Roxane (Rosario Dawson)- there's as much heat in that relationship as in the peaks of the Himalayas. One bedroom scene and that's all that there is to it. Kinda like a relationship with Colin Farell. They tried to show many facets of himself but somehow ended up showing Alexander as a confused king- he wants power, doesn't know why he wants it and doesn't know what to do with it. He has a love-hate relationship with his mother, a respect-hate relationship with his father. He seems to be gentlemanly enough, and then suddenly there's blood lust. That's all fine, but the transition between these emotions isn't very smooth. Overall, the movie seems hotch-potch. Certain scenes are too overworked- most of the lines sound corny and don't have the effect it's supposed to have. Don't expect to go see a classic- you're better with ""Gladiator"" and Russel Throw Tele- I mean Crowe.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
Not worth the way to many hours it takes......,"I think its a unbelievable slow film, with an Alexander, that you never really believe in...... He doesn't ever look like a man who could conquer the world, and the film is so filled with clichés, that I almost puked! Then the director adds extra scenes, so we can see how visionary Alexander was, how human he was etc. But he makes them so simple, that a 6 year old boy could get the morale, unless he is both blind and deaf!Beside the battles doesn't add anything new to film-making, except trying to make them look very blurred with no way to get a grip on whats happening (perhaps war can be this way, but I've seen a lot of movies that showed it in way better ways). Oh and a copy of henry 5th's famous battlespeach in France...... And did I mention there are 2 battles, which aren't very long, as if the battles didn't really play a role in Alexanders conquest. But its fine if a movie wants to focus on the human nature of a great man, but there must be a more subtle and less boring way than this!!!!!!!I almost fell asleep, and I never do this..... Very bad film!!!!",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
A great retelling,"My husband and in-laws are Greek, and we are all huge fans of ancient history, so we went into this a little wary. It was surprisingly much better than we anticipated, and a pretty thorough retelling of ancient history. The scenes are beautifully done, the action is good and epic, and the relationships between characters true to history (unlike Troy, which turned Achilles' lover Patroclus into a cousin and whitewashed their relationship). And yes, Alexander was known to be fair haired, so that's accurate as well. Greeks are not all dark and dark haired.My only complaint is that Angelina Jolie was laughably bad, and she used some indecipherable strange accent. Very poor casting. But the rest of the cast was great, with a special nod to Jared Leto as Hephaistian, his acting has always been amazing and under the radar.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"My god, Oliver stone, what were you thinking!","I'm watching this film on TV right now, and it's so bad that i felt compelled to look up the review on IMDb rather than continue to be tortured by this awful awful production.Firstly, Why do so many people give this 8-10 stars? I am seriously confused. Do you people like long winded pointless diamonologue? Do you guys watch movies to be bored to tears? Why does everyone have an Irish accent???? (except for Angelina Jolie who performs the token European twang) I know there are some Irish actors in there (Mick Lally, Milie from ""Glenroe"" take a bow) but I'm pretty certain that Val Kilmer doesn't hail from south county Dublin.The battle scenes are amongst the worst I have ever seen. They make no sense. There are scenes where the cavalry are charging relentlessly towards the enemy (in the distance) but in the close up shots there are infantry keeping pace with the horses on foot. How fast can these Macedonians run? When the armies eventually meet each other it is almost impossible to figure out who is fighting who, which side is winning, or even follow individual soldiers through battle. After the first big mêlée I, and everyone else in the room were confused about who actually won the fight, and we certainly didn't know how exactly Alexander managed to defeat an army more than 6 times as strong as his.How can any film have so much talking with such a bland story? Oliver Stone's direction is to blame here. Every single scene is over directed and over acted. There is no light relief to be found anywhere in this 3 hour long film. Its just overly serious scene after overly serious scene.The only slightly humorous scene in the whole film is where they encounter the monkeys, and that is a sideshow less than 30 seconds long, and barely raises a smirk.If it wasn't for the narrator, the story would make absolutely no sense. It gets so bad that all of the story is told by the narrator. The bits when the actors do any speaking are just filling in the exaggerated and unrealistic emotion (always sombre and overblown)",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Oliver Stone ruins what could have been a fabulous movie,"This may be one of the most boring movies I've ever had to sit through. OK, I knew it was directed by Oliver Stone and so the history would be spurious at best and the direction ho hum, but it's a great cast! I knew the reviews were bad -- but it's a great cast! How bad could it be I thought, after all -- it's a great cast! Amazingly Stone has managed to take one of the most interesting historical characters around, combine it with a fabulous cast and turn out an absolute yawn of a movie. It isn't even bad enough to qualify as being greatly bad. It's just...incredibly, mind bogglingly boring. There's no bad acting, just flat acting. I didn't mind the jumping around in time, but it added no interest. There is nothing here that is remotely worth anyone's time.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography

Pretty Bad,"Where to begin... first of all this story of Alexander, took place before Rome became powerful and before Julius Ceasar. Why do I mention this, because all the written works of Alexandria, was burned in a fire, where as per Julius Ceasars orders, were to burn the ships in the harbor, which unfortunately set fire to the great library of Alexandria. Which makes me wonder, where in the world did they come up with such a bad story to be made into a movie?? Now lets talk about the cast. It is always a pleasure to see Angelia Jolie, she is a good actress. Anthony Hopkins always is great to watch. We all know Val Kilmer chooses his roles wisely an always gives a good performance. Colin Farrel has his good moments, but in my opinion, did not sell the role of Alexander. Maybe it was because of the director, Oliver Stone. What in the hell was he putting in his coffee?? As far as battle tactics, it was a pure joke. In the fist battle, you have infantry running along side of Alexander and his calvary. What did Alexander give his men before the battle,, JOLT Cola?? The second battle was just as bad as the first. What was Oliver Stone thinking of in the last battle???? We all laugh when Alexander fell in battle and later his men carried him on what looked like a large shield,,, with the spear still in his chest,,, please give me a break.!!! Collin Farrel did not have what it takes to be in a part like this,, sorry. Least we forget, Alexander's sexual desires,, I think, it was played on a little too much. Hell, with watching this movie, I can see where the country of Greece got such a bad reputation. I gave this movie a 3, mainly for a few actors that played their part well,, Collin Farrel was not one of them and with honorable mention, Alexander's horse gave one hell of a performance. I hope there is some director that could do a better job in the story of Alexander and find a better leading man to play the part.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography

Boring and liberal to the max,"Why does Hollywood continue to spoil history by injecting it with liberal political themes? Much like the anti-war movies that fail, this movie paints bizarre behavior as acceptable, using snakes and gay attractions. The scenery is fairly good, but the mood of the movie dampens one's enjoyment. The fight between the army of Darius and Alexander goes too fast and seems to slow down only when it wants to show gory killings. The dialog is long and boring, and the push to make homosexual behavior normal and a main theme spoils the glory of Alexander in actual history and in the movie. It is no wonder that one can buy a NEW copy of the movie for about two dollars on the internet; a price that is ten times too high. In one word, the movie is ICKY.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Complete Mess,"I could not wait to see Alexander, even with all its bad reviews. Unfortunitely it lives up to these reviews rather well. Oliver Stone maybe my favorite director, he at least was before Alexander. Watching some of my favorite actors such as Anthony Hopkins make fools of themselves didn't really feel good as well. Oliver Stones direction is more awful than imaginable, one of the worst jobs of direction ever, by one of the best directors. The screenplay is awful as well, the dialogue wooden, and everything else simply confusing. The visual effects are sometimes great, but usually they look so fake. The costumes are the only truly great thing in this picture. Do not watch if you value your sanity!!!!!

Poisoning the Legend,"Oliver Stone is a guy with chubby hands, and a sure lot of strength. That's what I imagine when seeing his movies: he is everything but delicate, and when he gets his hands on projects he squashes the narrative like porcelain.Sometimes he does it right (Platoon, JFK).But Stone is slapping Alexander the Great's myth on here. Instead of going to portray a leader, a strong man, a conqueror he makes Collin Farrel (who's not ready for a role that big) whining and whimpering like a sensible homo. It's great to show the Human Side on every figure; but Stone went for a myth, for rumors. Alexander was bisexual and half the movie he flirts with companion Jared Leto.What a chance to ruin a legend. Then cast a ridiculous make up team, in which the passing of time means nothing to them. Combine battle scenes with a dreadful music, like torturing chellos. Cast also some extras that will laugh during the movie, and make Alexander go for corny, lengthy speeches with no final message but to fill the movie. Let it be 3 hours.Im giving this movie a 1 because of what It could have been. I was bored, I was historically shocked.

Alexander Revisited (director's cut) - worth revisiting!,"I saw the theatrical version a year or so after it came out, and while I thought it had been somewhat unfairly critically mauled, it didn't make a huge impression (a few shots/scenes aside). But having got more interested ancient history recently, I thought I might seek this film out again - especially since I'd heard about an (allegedly) superior director's cut (or three...!?). So after tracking down a German-issued blu-ray of the 'revisited' version (which isn't actually the 'final' cut - but was closest I could find and cones in at 3h33m long) I finally sat down to it tonight - and enjoyed it thoroughly!It's obviously not perfect - but the cut I watched was a grand retelling of Alexander's adventures - and certainly stands up as a decent historical epic. What I found refreshing was although the two main battle sequences which bookend the film are decent, they're not it's raison d'etre and it thrives and entertains as much in between. In many ways, from the revival of the historical epics that ran in the late 90s to mid 2000s (led by Gladiator) this is probably the most 'historic' - since while it doubtless takes liberties (as all films do and must) it at least seems to stick fairly closely to what is (thought to be) known about its subject and period.The cast are solid - if not spectacular. But a lot of the annoyance people might have found in some of the casting (or accents) on release has probably mellowed now. I particularly enjoyed Jolie's performance this time round.Some viewers may find the homosexual elements uncomfortable - but if that stuff makes you squeamish, you better steer clear of ancient history altogether!Anyway - if you're either interested in Alexander the Great - or if you were ambivalent about it on release and are curious about whether the longer cut is worth it; I strongly recommend seeking it out.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A story that let us follow Alexander on his way to conquer the world,"I've seen Ukranian movies better then this one. it was so bad i cant believe it. first of all it wasn't any powerful opening scene, it took almost an hour before we got to see some action, which was really bad action. only close ups when a sword or a spear penetrated an arm or so (you never saw the body that the arm belonged to) or views taken 3000 feet up in the air. it wasn't like gladiator when you saw two horses and a chariot crashing in over 15 guys and the camera is 100 feet away. this movie had nothing exciting to show for. sure Mr Farrell is a good actor and all but he doesn't look like a powerful leader nor speaks like it. i mean nobody can say that he looks the slightest powerful. its not like Russell Crowe shouting ""what we do in life, goes on for eternity"" and then a big fight that really gets you going. when I watched this movie with my brother and my father, my brother fell asleep after 15 minutes (no kidding) and my father said ""do we have to suffer any more? please turn it off"".",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
And you thought Hollywood quit making epic clunkers,"Oliver Stone finally did it. He made a boring movie.Any screen writing book will tell you the first basic rule of writing a good script is show, don't tell. But Stone decided the best way to tell Alexander the Great's life was tell, don't show.No matter want you thought of Stone as a filmmaker and storyteller, his movies never were dull. Even his lesser works, ""U-Turn"" (1997) and ""Any Given Sunday"" (1999) had energy. Not ""Alexander."" Clumsy, overblown and leaden, this three-hour exercise in banal, mind-numbing exposition should have been an exciting and intriguing epic adventure about one of history's most fascinating and enigmatic figures. Instead, it's a tedious, laborious soap opera.Stone reduces Alexander's exploits to Ptolemy's (Anthony Hopkins) narrations and shows us just two battles - at Guagamela and India. We hear of Alexander's other advances, but see none. The two battles aren't spectacular. They're so disorganized and confusing that Stone relies on Ptolemy to tell us what happened after one battle. When we get to the film's big moment - Alexander facing up to a warring elephant in India - it has no impact because we've lost interest in this clunker. We're then treated to what seems like an acid flashback.""The film takes a bold, honest look at Alexander's life,"" its Web site boasts. Poppycock. Stone wants to emphasize Alexander's bisexuality, yet doesn't have the guts to give us an honest depiction. The love affair between Alexander (Colin Farrell) loves his commander and childhood friend, Hephaestion (Jared Leto), is limited to laughable glances, an occasional shoulder rub. Give me a break! Not once do these lovers even consider a peck on the cheek. They do hug a lot, though. That's about as bold as Stone gets.Vangelis' overbearing score gives the film more dramatic weight than it deserves. From its opening - a ""Rosebud""-like moment - ""Alexander"" plods along, never once finding the right mood or tone. The story whizzes all over the place, jumping from one scene to another without clarity or purpose. There's no passion or pathos anywhere. Instead of being touching, a scene where Philip of Macedonia (Val Kilmer) teaches a young Alexander about Greek legends - Oedipus, Achilles, Prometheus - drags on because neither actor can summon any enthusiasm.Colin Farrell does not make a convincing Alexander. He's more Alexander the Adorable than Alexander the Great. He whines and mopes rather than inspires and threatens. Though, Alexander never seems to have a bad hair day.Farrell makes no attempt to hide his Irish brogue and, with an international cast, the smörgåsbord of accents quickly turns absurd. At one point, when Alexander argues with one of his commanders, one actor sounds Irish, the other like Sean Connery. It's priceless.Farrell's woefully miscast. His Alexander lacks passion. There's no madness to his method. Farrell's limited acting range becomes clearly evident in a scene when Alexander rallies his troops before a battle. Stone means to draw comparisons to Shakespearean Prince Hal's famous battle cry. But watch Farrell fall flat and then go watch Kenneth Branagh's mesmerizing Crispin's Day speech in ""Henry V"" (1989), and you'll realize Farrell's limitations as an actor.Leto proves yet again what a wooden performer he is. Though, the poor chap's given little to do other than to make goo-goo eyes at Alexander. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers barely registers as Cassander, and Kilmer staggers about as if he's still playing Jim Morrison.With various accents pummeling the screen, it's surprising Angelina Jolie decided Alexander's mother, Olympias, should have some weird, mock Transylvanian accent. It makes it impossible to take anything she says seriously. Never mind Jolie's just a year younger than Farrell, she never ages even though Alexander, at one point, ages from 4 to 19.Just when you thought you couldn't hear a more ridiculous accent, along comes Rosario Dawson as Roxanne, Alexander's Bactrian wife. The first time we hear Roxanne speak, she stumbles on to a ""tender"" moment between Alexander and Hephaestion - they're about to hug, again - glares at Alexander and asks, ""You luvf heem?"" These women's accents make Kate Beckinsale's preposterous Eastern European tone in ""Van Helsing"" seem genuine.If a silly accent wasn't embarrassing enough, poor Dawson then engages in a love scene where Alexander actually growls. At least, she looks magnificent in the nude. Too bad there wasn't more of that and less of everything else.Of course, no Oliver Stone film would be complete without conspiracy theories and allusions to contemporary politics. Alexander conquers Persia, part of which is now modern Iraq, because, he says, people want change and to live free. There's also mention - because showing us would make sense - of a guerrilla war the Persians waged after Alexander took Babylon.The film's packed with so many pointless scenes you wonder if Stone left anything on the cutting room floor. There's an unbearably long, terribly written shouting match between Alexander and Cleitus, needless cuts back to an older Ptolemy and a superfluous moment involving Aristotle (Christopher Plummer).A prime example of Hollywood excess, this dud cost $150 million. Just think of how many wonderful, worthy smaller-budget films could have been made, instead. And don't tell me there aren't countless terrific scripts floating around Hollywood not being read because the writers don't have the right connections.Greeks shouldn't be upset that Stone depicted Alexander as bisexual. They should be outraged he turned Alexander into a gargantuan bore.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Laughable,"Alexander was closer to Clash of the Titans than any of Oliver Stone's typical films. Casting, acting, editing ... they were all sub par. Colin Farrell wasn't at all convincing as Alexander. He seemed more like a child demanding attention than an emperor to be. Angelina Jolie sounded like Morticia (was that her name?) from Rocky and Bullwinkle. Her scheming was mildly interesting, but each time she spoke it was hard not to laugh. In fact, it was hard not to laugh throughout the film, but more importantly, it was hard to be drawn into the film when every actor seemed like they were playing pretend. I always wonder when I see a movie this bad whether the actors knew it while they were making it. I get a sense they might have had an inkling early on. Something went wrong with this production, and it showed up on film. We gave it a 4.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography

One the point is made in Babylon this becomes predictable.The bisexuality - or even homosexuality - no shock if you understand the values and morals of the time but the poignant glances between Alexander and a variety of males were overdone.As for his greatest achievement - conquering the known world of the time - it gets lost amongst the bickering of foes, flickering of eye lashes and politicking of his rivals.I found myself losing interest early and had really lost the will to live after an hour.All in all very dull, very tedious and very slow.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
Save two and a half hours and read a book about Alexander the Great,"I'm a big fan of movies and will watch almost anything, from beginning to end. However, this was one of those movies that really tested my resolve. I cannot believe the ""star power"" involved in making this movie (Anthony Hopkins is among my favorite actors). The movie tried entirely too hard to become one of those critically acclaimed ""Epic"" films, and fell significantly short. I did not see the theatrical release, only the Director's Cut on DVD. Unless Oliver Stone significantly reworked the time-line of the movie for the director's cut, I can imagine that the theatrical release was just as confusing (not to mention, longer). The movie jumped backward and forward in time several times, and not in a linear fashion, making it a bit confusing to know what happened when (especially when you're dealing with a time period in the 350± BC era). There were also at least a couple of historical inaccuracies. At one point, one of Alexander's contemporaries used the British slang term ""sod,"" and it stuck out like a sore thumb. At another point, in Babylon (Persia), a woman was sitting with a domestic Persian cat on her lap, petting it. While domesticated cats MAY have been present then and there, having a Persian cat in Babylon seemed a little too convenient and I think the film could have done without it. If you are an animal lover, there are major portions of this film you won't want to watch. While I did not stay until the end of the credits for the Humane Association disclaimer for confirmation, there were several minutes worth of horses and elephants being speared, shot with arrows, trunks being sliced off, etc. While this may be historically accurate, is it really necessary in today's modern film-making? You can get the point across without so much gore. Shame on you Oliver.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
A great example on how to ruin a good story.,"I have a History degree. I have read numerous books about Alexander. I have watched several TV documentaries about the character, including the one about the making of this movie. Even with all this background I had a terrible time just trying to figure out what was going on in the movie. The director took what could have been a GREAT story and muddied so badly by leaving out important events in Alexander's life while emphazing the idea that he was (perhaps) AC/DC over and over and over again. Colin Farrell did a superb job of acting and made his character very believable. As far as the other actors, I've seen more empathy on a High School Drama stage. The director completely ignored the action of Philip conquering Greece, and Alexander's command of the calvary as a desicive part of that battle. He ignored the great battles with Darius prior to Galgameth. He skipped over Alexander in Eygpt. Even the battle scenes, which were very elaborate, were ruined by the director's camera angles, special visual effects, and stop-start filming. If Alexander had not himself described what his plans were in the battle against Darius, the viewer would have had no idea at all what was going on (the famous ""gap"" that happened in the Persian lines was invisible in the scene). I looked forward to viewing this film ever since it was first announced as going into production. It was a huge disappointment.",,Anonymous,Biography
New way to Spell Awful,"Oliver Stone is a director that you either love or hate, there is no in the middle. I happen to be one of those people who enjoy Oliver Stone films mostly, though, I agree he is excessive with his vision. This is one of those movies that is excessive. Alexander is a huge Roman epic that falls on it's face. I never felt so cheated by a movie as I did when I left this one. I am willing to testify that this is one of the absolute worst movies I have ever seen. I'll give credit to Colin Ferrel and Val Kilmer, I do think they did a fairly good job, but this movie about a great conqueror is undeniably weak. It has the slowest and most exhausting battles sequences, AND THERE'S ONLY TWO! A movie about a warrior and it has only two battles in it that aren't worth a grain of salt. For as many people that chastise Michael Bay, he could have made this movie something interesting. I mean Stone didn't seem to care too much about audience interest in the story, so we might as well have some good action in this film. Stone seemed to want to beat it in your mind so that'll you never forget that Alexander was gay. We understand this when we see Alex's eyes following the men and how close he is to Jared Leto's character but that's enough. It was like every other seen involved some sort of homosexual activity. Stone wondered astray with this movie, losing sight of what Akexander was historically (in the sense). Don't wast your time. Alexander is nothing more than a 3 hour snuff film that is as exciting as watching a worm and a snail race. My apologies to anyone who likes this film.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Oliver, Oliver, why have you forsaken me","I go into every film with an open mind. As someone who is going to be bold and sometimes cocky enough to express their opinion on film, you have be objective. When I was in transit to see the new Oliver Stone directed film Alexander, I was incredibly optimistic. After all Colin Farrell, Angelina Jolie, Val Kilmer, and all coming out when the Oscar funny season begins, come on! So there I was in line, ready to hand out a five star rating like a large sized chocolate bar to the cutest kid on Halloween. Here's how it worked out.Standing in line awaiting the theatre opening and watched the trailer for the movie on the various television screens that greet the paying customers  Five Stars.Before movie began, Six (count 'em SIX!) commercials. One for Radio Shack, two car commercials, one for movietickets.com, one for Playstation 2, one for a rather large Mr. Big bar. Knowing that the movie was already just short of three hours and that I still had countless trailers to sit through, I was already getting perturbed. Minus ½ Star. Total = 4.5 Stars.Credits roll almost 14 minutes later. See Oliver Stone's name and remember only his good films like Platoon, JFK, Salvador and Wall Street. Add ½ Star. Total = 5 Stars.Hear Angelina Jolie's Elvira accent for the first time and it was enough to have me chuckle. Kilmer and Jared Leto's not much better. Minus ½ Star. Total = 4.5 Stars.Watch as the young Alexander grows up and becomes the man that is played by Colin Farrell. Seeing Colin in the blond hair makes him look like a big Toy R Us doll. Minus ½ Star. Total = 4 Stars.First 45 minutes spent telling us the history of the Alexander. His relationship with his mother. His budding relationship with his gay lover played by Leto, and his level of comfort around snakes. Lots of snakes. By the time the movie was over, I realized how drawn out and milked the Jolie was, how unnecessary towards understanding Alexander's motivation that the Leto character provides and how the snakes were probably brought by Ms. Voight herself just to get her to agree to play the role as Olympias. We see young Alexander tame a wild horse and are expected to believe that not only did he do this in sheer minutes, but it was also a sign that he would be a great ruler. Whatever. Minus one star. Total = 3 Stars.First battle scene about to start and Alexander tries to rally the troops with an excessive speech. The speech wouldn't motivate me to shake my friends hand let alone lead me to lie down my life for a purpose. Thought back to Braveheart and how William Wallace's speech was inspirational. Longed for Braveheart. Minus ½ Star. Total = 2.5 Stars.The opening of the battle scene takes an eye view from a hawk in the sky. Incredible scene. Had me think of the trend setting Stone of yesteryear. Got heart pumping and ready for what was expected to be a bloody and lengthy battle. Add one star. Total = 3.5 Stars.The battle begins and bodies and blood flow. People get stabbed, impaled, gauged, hammered and shot with arrows. But battle scene is under cloud of sand dust and the two sides are too hard to determine. People yell at each other, but couldn't figure out what they were yelling and trying to relay. Didn't know who I was rooting for. Battle scene was lengthy and well choreographed, but when the smoke cleared and the bodies lay on the battlefield, I still couldn't tell who lost more men. Add one star for the battles bloodbath, but minus one star for not knowing what was going on. Total = 3.5 Stars.Alexander goes into Babylon where he takes a wife played by Rosario Dawson. She has a nude scene that made the final cut for one reason only. When the three hours were over, Dawson's character is one that I could have done without  or at least toned down to save me on crossing-the-leg-time (referring to trying to refrain from using the 'facilities'). Her accent too is casting couch-ish. Liked Dawson in The 25th Hour and thought she was rising talent. Uncertain of my previous judgment. Minus ½ Star. Total = 3.0 Stars.Movie then goes back 8 years. BACK! Maybe inspired by Tarantino, Stone plays with the timeline for no apparent reason. The storyline tells us how his father was killed. Again, another 20 minutes that could have been shown in either a dream sequence or within the timeline in about 5 minutes. Thought it was out of place when story looked like it was getting momentum. Like playing snakes and ladders, we just hit a snake. Minus ½ Star. Total = 2.5 Stars.Listen to Colin give speech after speech. Don't really understand (or care) for his motivation. Can't really tell if his people are for him or against him. Beginning to get bored. Minus ½ Star. Total = 2.0 Stars.Get to India and another battle scene about to take place. It's in the jungle and I remembered how well Stone did last time he was in a jungle shooting (Platoon). Adjusted myself in my seat to get ready for the fast and furious. Battle begins and it is worse than the first. I have no idea who is stabbing who. I know the ones on the elephants are not on Team Alexander, but that is about as far as my referencing can go. Battle scene fought in red tones. Whaaa? Incredibly frustrated even though fake blood keeps hitting the camera lens. Minus ½ Star. Total = 1.5 Stars.Excellent scene where Alexander and his horse go on hind legs against an enemy and elephant doing same. Arrows fly, spears are thrown and Alexander falls. Scene is slow motion and was very memorable. Add ½ Star. Total = 2.0 Stars.Alexander falls to ground and has one of Stone's dream collage sequences that were so out of place in Nixon and U-Turn. Don't get it. Don't need it. Don't want it. Minus ½ Star. Total = 1.5 Stars.Alexander is not dead however. Heals and becomes strong enough to make more speeches. His male lover lies dying in a bed and this seems to be the perfect time to star out at the city and talk about how great everything could be. Felt like I was being talked down to. Leto's character dies in the background and I don't care one bit. Minus ½ Star. Total = 1.0 Stars.Movie finally concludes with some overacting by Jolie. Anthony Hopkins who started the movie with a narration ends it with the conclusion to the Alexander saga. Was actually surprised that the movie did not feel like its 170+ running time suggested. For having me not look at my watch constantly, I reluctantly give it an extra ½ Star. Total = 1.5 Stars.On the ride home now and thinking of how I am going to write this review. In no way would I recommend it to others, but thought that my 1.5 Stars was a little harsh and try desperately to get it up to a two star rating. Can't. Final tally = 1.5 Stars. For the love of Zeus I didn't enjoy this movie.www.gregsrants.com",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
Alexander,"After seeing the movie, I just couldn't relax, I was totally lost in ecstasy. I have read a lot about why Americans didn't wanted to see the movie... something about their moral (funny, because Americans does not appear to have any moral, just look at Abu Graib in Iraq).I cannot understand why people get upset, in the time were Alexander lived it was normal for two men to have sex, bisexuality was totally normal to old Greece but also in the old Roman Empire... it is the Christians who forbid it... before Christianity almost all men in Southern part of Europe had a lover of his or her own sex...The movie has one problem and that is, that it shows Alexander s almost total GAY, which he was not...But thank you Oliver Stone for the best historical movie since Ben Hur (my opinion)",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
YOU SUCK!,"This movie was horrible, an abomination upon mankind. The movie moved very slowly, half the scenes were pointless. There were no relationships established between characters, all i got out of it was Colin Farrell wants to take over the world. There are only two battle scenes and they last about ten minutes and the camera doesn't stop shaking. For a movie about war and conquest they did a very poor job of displaying it. Also, there was some guy that looked like a chick that followed Colin Farrell around the whole movie, whats up with that guy and why does Colin keep kissing him? Some things i will never understand, like how does Colin keep getting work? Why Val why?!? The three hour sit was very painful it made me want to kill myself. Also, In the beginning there is a snake wrapped around the arm of Angelina then when we turn away to look at the kid when we look back...its gone. Where the hell did the snake go?? yeah thats right this movie stunk.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Why you should wait and rent it, to be shown on TV, or spend your time on something else.","This is not a historical movie. You can say it's an epic, or a somewhat entertaining movie. But it misses too many things to state it was a faithful movie about this character or what he did.Reasons and spoilers, below.The main problem here, is that if Stone really consulted any expert, he certainly didn't pay attention to the part where the erudite told him why is Alexander an important character in world history. And if he did, he obviously ignored it, being rather delighted to show the audience what his sexual preferences or psychological traumas were, as if rejoicing to show he was a human and not a myth. And even when those things are needed and definitely add an important depth to the character, it's not because of that that he's remembered to such an extent these days. And thus, valuable movie time was wasted, basically repeating the same scenes over and over again.All of his military feats, brilliant political decisions, his amazing leadership and way of acquiring and holding the people he ruled's loyalty are reduced to just a bare mention by a distant Hopkins in the background along with an Indiana Jonish map, or to some speech or two where instead of showing the personality of the natural born leader he was, Alexander actually looks like a child in a tantrum that leaves us thinking how he could actually get at least a guard to pay attention to him.He mentions and shows, time and again, how much he liked men, like saying ""hey audience, did you know Alex was gay?"".. then some Olympia's shot ""and he had some pretty nice traumas, too"".. and then again some Hephaiston and Alex scene so he could say ""but look, he was *really* gay!"" then the camera switches to some horses riding, some arguing with his officers, just to come back again to say ""but look, if you didn't believe me yet (cause I consulted some history experts!), now I'll show you his homosexuality even further with this gay dance and even more, you'll see his eyes pop outta his face when the dancer spreads right in front of him!!!""...""Oh and by the way, yes he was in the military I think.. a general or something, here, look at him leading this 5 minute battle... sorry if the battle was sorta confusing, I left that part to my assistants, I had to be paying attention to some other scenes, lest the audience walks outta the theater without knowing Alexander the Great liked men..""The movie says absolutely nothing/ barely mentions/ totally lies about:-The Gordian Knot: Not only a tale, but something that actually happened, that would've shown more details about his personality than over 80% of the movie.-The battle of the Granicus.-The battle at the Pinarus.-For God's sake, the conquest of Tyre!! Couldn't Stone have spared ourselves a bit of the sexual preferences/ family issues and showed instead at least 5 minutes of this mastermind designing not only this, but any other of his brilliant plans? Nah, don't say there's ""something"" before Gaugamela, cause that pathetic chessboard scene looks more like a mad scientist trying to convince his friends about something he just came up with than an already by then known military genius explaining the plan.-Not so important, but definitely more important than some crap they left in: Darius mother, wife, and two daughters were taken prisoners after the battle at the Pinarus river, off of his camp. Not off of some Babylon's harem after Gaugamela.-Alexander didn't meet Darius for the first time in Gaugamela, as the movie shows. Darius was present at the Granicus, and also according to Plutarch, he even fought hand to hand with him at the Pinarus battle. Darius also lost his chariot and bow there.-Etc..We're talking about some important details here, not just some nerdish nitpicking. This person conquered the whole known world by then, and that fact's barely mentioned in the movie. And it's not like there're so many Alexander movies out there in a way you could say: ""oh but wait, you don't understand, Stone wanted to portrait another side of Alexander with this one"".. If you advertise the movie saying you've been advised by experts and saying you're going to show the life of this genius in such a complete way as they did, you simply can't miss or ignore so many facts. Case anyone still needs a spoon-fed clarification, no, I don't have any problem with the director showing his sexuality neither with it, I just don't think it was needed to devote so much time to it. Anyone would've gotten the point with just a scene or two. He exaggerated so much with the time spent describing those things in a way that the character simply doesn't make anyone believe he could do what he did, nor can it consistently be seen.Pretty much like doing a movie about Walt Disney, without saying how the hell did he come up with Mickey Mouse, or a movie about Christopher Columbus, where after three hours of describing what he liked for dinner, some voice in off says ""oh, and by the way, he discovered America""...Props to Hopkins, however.",,Anonymous,Biography
A Multi-Million Dollar Science Project Gone Horribly Wrong,"Given the release date, it appeared that there was high confidence in ""Alexander"", however it appears that no one, save for Stone himself, was actually looking at the finished product. The editing was finished mere weeks before the release date, and in hindsight, it seems that a lot of the project was based on blind faith. Unfortunately, Oliver Stone has really fallen off the top, his glory days far behind him. This was an idea that seemed terrific on paper, yet the final movie is awful in execution.The main problem with the movie is structure, and when a movie exceeds three hours, that is equivalent of a death knell. Overlong, potholed, and disjointed, Alexander stumbles from one scene to another, with no honest sense of direction or pace. In addition, the final scenes seem very tacked on, due to the damaged reels during the initial production stages. Given Oliver Stone's negative attitude towards digital filming, this seems all the more ironic.The movie does have its strengths, however. The battle scenes are exhilarating, and in a year of disappointments such as ""Troy"" and ""King Arthur"", it's welcoming. The acting isn't quite as bad as many people make it to be, and the score is commendable. Still, ""Alexander"" fails to revive the swords-and-sandals genre.3/10",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Long, Boring, and makes me want to barf.","Let's get things straight here. This movie absolutely does not deserve anything over 5 stars. It's very long, very boring and extremely confusing. There are only two good scenes in this movie while the rest are a conglomerate of disjointed sequences plagued with confusing dialogue, over-acting, bad editing, atrocious music, mind-numbing cinematography and distracting effects (circle wipes and red filtering that do not support the scenes). I recommend that you do not rent or buy this movie on several levels. It is long so it will waste a lot of your time and it's not horrible enough for you to laugh at with your friends. Also, if you think that you'll see a plenty of be-headings and other awesomely violent acts like in Braveheart, you'll be disappointed. Save yourself from watching Ancient Greeks with Irish accents; Colin Farell's annoying puppy-dog eyebrows (and his dong and balls which unfortunately were in the movie) and Angelina Jollie's stupid accent and nasty collagen filled lips.Alexander the Flop is NOT worth your time.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of the worst films ever made,"What was Oliver thinking? An interpretation of Alexanders life is not what we were looking for. The move focuses on Alexander being Bi-sexual. they're supposed to be Greek? Colin Farrel's accent in this movie is clearly Irish. Angelina Jolie (Alexanders mother ???) has a German accent. The movie is not historically accurate, the battle scenes are too confusing. The camera is shaking around and it's all blurry. They say, ""It adds to the realism and intensity of warfare"" while really it's just an excuse for poor visual effects. There is also too much dialogue(not that good I might add) and the movie is like 3 hours long. There are only two battle scenes in the whole movie. They make it out to be an action movie which it hardly is. The only thing that was good in the movie was Val Kilmer.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Much Better than I was led to believe.,"Okay so this is not a perfect movie, Alexander did so much there were always going to be things that would be left out. Cutting the Gordian knot for example and his early battles before Darius. But what is there is pretty accurate, for more so than the farcical and insulting Troy that came out early last year, Alexander does not shy away from either his bisexuality or from using the language of its age. The Production values are very high, and once again the people choosing the Oscars haven't the faintest idea what they're doing. Alexander, whose costumes were accurate gets overlooked, while Troy which uses costumes from completely the wrong era gets a nomination?!?!

Stinkfest to the MAX,"This is close to being the worst movie I've ever seen. I'm not quite sure whether it was worse than Battlefield Earth. There seemed to be no rhyme or reason as to the scenes they showed and those that were merely narrated by Hopkins; for most of the time it seemed like an over glorified documentary because of the awkward narration given my Ptolemy. When something finally wasn't arbitrarily skipped over by the filmmakers, the ensuing battle scene was so boring and drawn out I fell asleep. The casting was questionable-I didn't really understand the selection of Rosario Dawson as Roxanna (she's fine as an actress but wasn't she Eastern, even ""Caucasian"", not African). Also, Angelina Jolie's lack of aging for the ENTIRE film, and her Russian accent were terrible. I hated it. Its only value is as a film so bad that its worth seeing again to laugh at.

I wanted my money back,"Instead of being realistic (as I assume was the goal) the jumpy filming during the battles scenes just made me so motion sick I had to leave for a few minutes, And the historical inaccuracies where while not to huge, enough that any one who has studied their history and the philosophies will simply shudder. Not to mention the length of the movie is torture in and of itself. The acting on the whole was passable, but I also kept getting distracted by the fact that it seemed like most of Alexanders army and even his father (Val Kilmer; whom I usually adore) for some odd reason all seemed to have Scottish accents.My over all recommendation is to avoid this movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography

Sets the lowest possible standard for the next Alexander movie,"After I saw the movie I was terrible upset with Oliver Stone. How can somebody do such a piece of trash just for money? I cannot find another reason for the totally awful realization for the astonishing life of Alexander. If he wanted to shock his audience with his movie, well he succeeded with me, but not in the sense he wanted; this is a piece of total garbage. When I look at a movie about Alexander, I really want to see a movie about that. The costumes, the relations with his parents, the depiction of his wife, the time-line, the death, the strong accent on bisexuality, all was changed. If to be bisexual was normal in Alexander's time, why was accentuated in the movie? Just to shock the viewers, so commercial purpose.

Brilliance.,"Just came from seeing the movie with my little daughter. I was, considering the overall demographics of my town, surprised that the theater was full. I feel that although necessary Anthony Hopkins' narrative may have proved to be too long for folks not truly interested in ATG. This can tune folks out.Hephaistion's character seemed too shadowed. The scenes between Alexander and Hephaistion were wonderfully portrayed. I have to agree Collin Farrel was not the best orator when it came to battle speeches but his depth was fleshed out in other aspects of his portrayal of such a difficult and tragic character.The combining of battles and events was needed. ATG fans will just have to suck it up like the LOTR's folks did and the Lawrence of Arabia folks did...you can only fit so much in. Besides most of the viewers have no clue what's been compressed anyway. The battle scenes were well done. I only wish that ""eagle eye"" shots of Gaugamela had shown a closer view of Alexander's tactics since the battle was brilliantly executed. Oh well. The common movie goer wouldn't know anyway. I'm not trying to say that all this attention to detail should be replaced with absolute historical fabrication but in a movie time is limited.I especially liked, and feel it may be the most poignant, the ending where the generals are actually fighting over Alexander's body, actually climbing on him. It gave such a picture of the complete collapse and degeneration of all that Alexander tried to build. In death he is being raped of his accomplishments by his own men. From ""goat herders"" as he referred to them, to rulers of Persia and beyond and back again to a group of ""barbarians"" fighting over the still warm corpse of their king.No it is not ""Lawrence of Arabia"" but it is the tragic tale of brilliance run horrible amuck. Of genius burning so brightly that it can only in the end extinguish itself just as one would use dynamite to blow out a raging forest fire. Alexander didn't really make it home, Lawrence did but fled into virtual obscurity. Alexander's dream began to die with Hephaestion in the movie and possible in reality. Lawrence's may have died with the death of Dahoum and his refusal to play along with the politics of ruling.There will of course be detractors both on the scholarly side and the average wanna see some nice battle scenes side but I enjoyed the movie for what it was and feel that with such a huge topic to cover it was overall pretty well done.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

One of the best movie's i've seen so far....,"Hello there.I am not normally commenting on movies i have watched, even if i am deeply touched by the movie. I saw ""Twister"" four times, Titanic four times as well (and own the DVD)and now there was ""Alexander"". I watched it when i returned from a stressy visa-run to the camboadian border, being quite tired upon return to Bangkok and my boyfriend (yes i am gay, 29 years old caucasian btw with thai boyfriend) asked me if i want to watch ""Alexander"". No problem. I had no clue about how long it would go, so i got the tickets while waiting for him to show up.After about 10 Minutes i was glued to the story. To your info, i am not a fan of ""historic"" movies in general (no i have NOT seen ""Troy""), but here was a movie with a somewhat ""gay"" content, and that alone kept me interested. Now, i watched.The picture was just great, i loved it! I did only once, at the scene with the ""eagle's view of the battle"", detect obvious signs of computer animation, the rest of the movie was just great filmed. Sure, i also tought ""why do they have these irish accents"" except Alexander's wife who i think spoke with Russian accent. Funny. I was totally kept with the love story between Alexander, Hephaistion and (after the battle of Babylon) Bagoas, whom i personally admire very much. So from my point of view, i have been watching a love story, or ""love drama"" (excuse me i am not a native English speaker, so i may use wrong words). And this love story to me was the best one i have ever seen. It was a ""gay"" love story, yes, but not overdone, and it makes me wish to turn back the time for some 2.300 years and let me live in a time where i can be just ""me"", not having to be branded ""gay"" for loving my boyfriend. True at that time it was just normal, and nobody gave a damn if you loved men or women, or both.After the movie was over i sat for a little while, thinking, letting it ""re-run"" in my head. And since i spent countless hours on the internet to dig REALLY deep into the history and the background, and ki think that even from a historical view, this movie is just great because it tells the story as true as it is. I have since watched ""Alexander"" a second time and next weekend i will go again. I am sort of in love with ""Bagoas"", played by Francisco Bosch. His tragic story would deserve a movie on it's own, and i am about to get a book about his live with Alexander.I give ""Alexander"" a ""10"" rating, my reason is that the story was delivered in full truth, excellent photography and handling of a sensible subject in perfect way. Now i can't wait for the director's cut DVD to become available, i hope it will include a scene involving Bagoas which was cut in the cinema version.Kind regards from a German guy in BangkokThanh",,Anonymous,Biography
read a book,"Read a book. ""The Search for Alexander"" by Lane Fox, Robin. 1st ed. 1980, Little, Brown & Co. (Canada) Ltd. ISBN 0-316-29108-0. Oliver Stone probably did so anyone wants to challenge his view could at least start with one book. My vote is awful not based on historical accuracy or Stones interpretation but just the way the film was made. In my humble opinion poor dialog, soap-opera acting and bad cuts/editing. All resulting in a low budget presentation that doesn't do justice to an epic story. Troy perhaps wasn't entirely faithful to the Iliad but didn't purport to be grandiose.

Avoid this film at all costs,"I would like to warn everyone to avoid Alexander like the plague. I was very disappointed, i had heard the rumours about this being an epic and the battle scenes alone being worth the watch, this is not the case. I was sceptical about Colin Farrell as the lead and unfortunately he proved woefully inadequate. The battle scenes were shot in such a way that you couldn't tell what was going on, which is probably very realistic but does not make good viewing. The film drags on and on for 3 hours and i think is one of if not the worst film i have ever seen, the acting is weak, the script poor and the accents laughable, there is not a single thing about this film that redeems it. Please take my advice and avoid seeing this film, life is too short to waste 3 hours.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Truly Awesome,"what a truly amazing film! i really cant comprehend all negative feedback it seems to be getting. the only thing i can think of is the fact that Alexander is portrayed as being gay/bisexual. this however is not a problem for me as i think Colin Farrell is hot and some of the scenes are just to die for. the only other thing with the gay thing is that they should have not included it at all, or they should have thrown themselves whole-heartedly into the matter. but as it stands there is the whole feeling of is he isn't he... but never mind. Jolie's role is fantastic and she is veeeeerrrrry sexy although i am not quite sure about the whole Slavic (spelling?) accent that is being put on. Farrell has an Irish accent even though he is supposed to be Greek, and so does Kilmer randomly...? can anyone explain this? the casting was superb, and the young Alexander looks so much like Farrell its disturbing.the only negativity i feel is the length, although again i didn't notice this and i thought it could have been even longer. The homosexual subtext which really isn't 'sub' at all, and i could see how this could offend people... (but, u no... get a life dear) and lastly some of the dialogue is prolonged and slightly too dramatic.but there, everyone should go see it because it is FANTASTIC",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Worst Movie I have ever seen.,Alexander would have to be the worst movie I have ever seen. The story itself was long winded and boring. And No it was not due to the gay image that Stone tried to portray. The credits couldn't come fast enough. I would of rather watched an Olsen Twins movie. This movie was 3hours to long and could of been shorter. This is 3 hours of my life that I just wont get back. The fact that I have to write at least 10 lines about a move that i can sum up in one is sad enough. For an Oliver stone movie I would of expected more but I can but this on the don't bye the DVD list along with Ai. Yet like other bad movies in the past I am sure that it will win every Oscar it doesn't deserve.,1.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Banal, extremely slow, cure for insomnia","The best way to describe this film is banal, too long and a cure for insomnia. As a history lesson it gives an insight into the life and times of Alexander The Great, but as a spectacle it is extremely slow and boring with a diabolically bad script. Anthony Hopkins is totally wasted in his role and Angelina Jolie is also miscast as Alexander's mother. There are some good action scenes, but they're few and far between. It was fairly difficult to remain alert and I had one eye on the clock thinking ""When is this ever going to end?"" Fortunately it eventually did end, but only after an excruciating two hours and fifty three minutes.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Ouch,"I don't care if some of the accents were off. I don't care if Jolie may have been too young for her role. I don't even care whether or not Stone is 100% faithful to history. But you must hold my interest. Even a terrible Ed Wood type movie can be interesting in its badness. But Alexander is not even memorable in that category. And, no, homosexuality does not bother me. Sorry to disappoint you- I realize that screeching about people's prejudices can sometimes be a nice way to indirectly pat yourself on the back. But I'm afraid you won't have that opportunity, here.Cheesy dialogue. The ""controversial"" sexuality basically consisted of Leto and Farrell surreptitiously glancing at one another. The sexuality was not explored at all. Overblown battle scenes which drag on forever. The battles feel like you're just watching hundreds of random people riding horses and slashing at one another, with no great sense of who's winning or what progress is being made. To me the fight scenes are no more elevated than a big budget American Gladiators, with a hokey bird flying overhead. Battle. Rousing speech to build troops' morale. Battle. Wash, rinse, repeat cycle. Haven't we seen this stuff before? The scenes felt stapled together. Reading a Cliffs Notes synopsis of Alexander's story would have given me more emotional impact than this movie.Now and then characters manage to spit out something mildly interesting. Alexander at one point angrily and humbly asks about the conquered people ""And what makes us better than them?"". Another reviewer here seemed impressed that Alexander at one point asks ""am I divine, or weak?"". Hmmm.Hardly profound. On second thought maybe there wasn't any good dialogue. I can appreciate that a lot of time and money and hard work was put into this movie, but it just didn't do it for me. If you want a decent Oliver Stone movie, I think you should check out Talk Radio instead.And I've noticed a few pompous folks from other countries snorting that Alexander is too smart for Americans. I'll be the first to agree that most American movies are terrible. But when taking a multiple choice test, even a fool will sometimes pick the right answer. And I think that's just what the American public did in this case. This movie will NOT be remembered.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
What are these people talking about? Alexander is a really good film.,"I was really frightened at this enormous quantity of bad reviews from almost all critics and here on IMDb. But anyway, this morning I went to a theater and watched this film on premiere screening. And now I simply can't understand that all these people are talking about and. Is Alexander a film horrible or bad? Definitely NOT. Is Alexander a good film? Definitely YES. Is Alexander a great film? Quite possibly. It is different and possibly controversial film but at the same time very intelligent and inspiring. It is incredibly difficult to describe this film so my review will be short. It's a three hours highlights (from childhood to death) of the life of the Alexander the Great. There is many dialogs or even monologues in this film, possibly too many for typical action film even for typical epic film. But all of these dialogs are wise, philosophical and inspiring and the most important they are so I don't see any reason to complain about it. Cinematography was excellent. Ancient Babylon and Alexandria were shown so impressive and splendidly. All landscapes and locations during the all filmwere incredibly well selected. There are not too many battle scenes in Alexander but all of them (including elephant battle) were very well made with strong emotional core. About acting. I think here is the best Colin Farrell performance. He is very good as strong but flawed character. I'm don't so sure about Angelina Jolie but anyway it was her best performance for several years. After a miserable Lara Croft films she once again proves her acting ability. Val Kilmer also good as Alexander father Philip. But one of the best parts of this film was soundtrack written by Vangelis. The music was well selected, fresh and original. My grade 9 out of 10. I see here nominations for best picture, best cinematography, best original score and, of course, for visual and sound effects. Definitely I'll see it again after a few days.I can't understand why so many people hate this film. I can find only two possible explanations. First: many people were offended by the fact that Alexander was shown as bisexual and his love to Hephaistion . Personally, I don't care was he a gay or not and I haven't found any offensive scene in this film. And the second possible explanation. There is a some conspiracy against this film. Only a month before most of critics and the studio said about possible awards and nominations and about the greatness of this film. WB moved the release date to November, 24 due to their high Oscars expectations. And suddenly all has been changing, the critics wrote these annoying C or even D reviews and people complain about the things that they don't even try to understand.Thanks for reading and sorry for my bad English.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A miserable failure of a movie,"This movie was awful. It was long, boring, and focused on the side-show of Alexander's life instead of his adventures. The acting was unconvincing and soupy. The story was tedious and long on speculation and details about Alexander's sexual proclivities, yet mentions almost nothing about his philosophy or strategising other than some vague desire for a multi-cultural empire. That ""multi-culturalism"" seems more a commentary on Oliver Stone's vision of a utopian world than anything Alexander tried to achieve. I'm not surprised the Greek government refused to co-operate with the production of the movie. Instead of letting viewers see the history and glory of Ancient Greece, this movie gives an introspective look at a bunch of characters who look, sound, and act more like Celts in Greek attire.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
What a mess of a movie,"This is such a mess of a movie. Oliver Stone has somehow become a respected director (a mystery in itself), but this movie is worse eve than his average piece of natural fertilizer.He has a cast of competent actors, though there seems to be no good reason for Angelina Jolie to have a Russian (Serbian? Slovakian?) accent. Colin Farrell reveals to the world that Alexander had badly bleached hair with long dark roots. Couldn't they afford a wig?With a better script (staying closer to the historical record) and a better director, this could have been a decent movie. Instead, it's Oliver Stone's ""Alexander.""",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Bad, bad Mr. Oliver Stone!","Shame Mr. Oliver Stone. Shame. This was a horrible, horrible movie. Despite desperately trying to keep to history as well as maintain some entertainment value, the serious homoerotic overtones and the first battle scenes are the only redeeming factors in the entire movie. That, and Colin Farrell's pretty, pretty face - which cried entirely too much! He didn't need to find the ocean to take him home, the amount he cried alone...anyways. The homosexual plot lines were entertaining (there are two), although when he kissed his mother and the Persian boy I believe the entire audience spontaneously freaked out. The one kiss actually MISSING from the movie was him kissing his friend Hephaistion, but I shall leave that for another time. Altogether, bad acting, bad directing, bad plot lines, but camel warfare.

What were they smoking?,"I figured they all sat down and said....well if John Wayne got away with it then Colin Farrel should be able to.......there are times in Hollywood when you wonder what got into the water...this is one of them.....this has got to be in the top ten for the worst movie of all time......it can only be described as a gay,maniacal shouting,all the time crying, too much eye shadow, bad costumed, what the hell are they talking about now, who spiked the wine porn movie. It became almost embarrassing to watch Rosario Dawson pretending to be a black woman even though she is one and Angelina Jolie doing a cover girl lipstick ad all the time. I turned the movie off 3 times as waves of nausea swept over me. It seemed the more I drank to deaden the feeling about seeing this garbage spectacle, the more it began to make sense.Colin Farrel is a bad actor at the best of times and lord knows we have had enough of Irish actors trilling like leprechauns and ruining some perfectly good movies but to think this knob could portray a historical figure of so high a calibre is to believe Obama is really a good president. It became obvious that Oliver Stone had finally become senile as the movie unfolded or as I like to say, threw itself up onto the screen along with the viewers onto the floor, and the movie rapidly became a mish mash of who is doing what to whom with Angelina Jolie pursing her size 12 lips and smirking at anyone who wanted to be smirked at and Colin Farrel looking like he forget his hemorrhoid suppository. Between the outlandish gays flitting around on the screen(did they go to war with him or were their swords for home use only) and the horrible close ups of a pasty faced Dawson and all the screaming and confusion, the whole movie became a where's the remote blur and I was wishing for the days of sitting in the front row at the theatre watching a Transformer movie and the out of control sights and sounds making me pass blood in my urine.

An excellent film that has been torn to pieces,"""Alexander"" is not perfect. Maybe it could have been. But it remains the best work Oliver Stone, Colin Farrell, and (especially) Angelina Jolie and Val Kilmer have done to date. People have virtually crucified this movie, mainly because Stone had the guts to show that the title character was bisexual. But try to flesh that out in a movie, and suddenly you become a bad person because modern audiences still can't handle it. I was glad to find out that that aspect of his life was not cut out, as the people who made ""Troy"" refused to acknowledge Achilles' homosexuality. Some moments are over-the-top, especially in the father-son relationship between Kilmer and Farrell, but the battle scenes are much better than anything in ""Troy"" or ""Kingdom of Heaven,"" and it is awfully fun to listen to the accents done by Jolie and Rosario Dawson (who gets the delicious line, ""*You* love *heem*?!"")

Hard to Believe,"I have never been a world conqueror nor am I even well read on the subject. However, I felt cheated in this movie. To be sure it had its good scenes and may still be worth watching. However, I did not think it met with common sense on what I would expect from a world conqueror.If Alexander the Great did conquer more than half of the known world, one would expect him to be a reasonably tough individual. And yes, perhaps one that would also seem a little mean at times to some people. Driven people who conquer other nations I believe are tough individuals. In this case, Alexander just seems too soft. One is led to believe that people wanted to be conquered. Sorry, that is just too far fetched. Instead of a tough individual such as Russell Crowe in the Gladiator, we seem to have instead the ""Stay-puffed marshmallow man"" as depicted in the movie ""Ghostbusters"". Sorry, too hard to swallow.Yes, driven people at times did try to conquer the world. But I would like movies to be fair and treat all of these conquerors as they should - tough individuals. It is now hard to find a copy of the old movie El Cid in DVD form in the US. However, in it, a warrior leader named Ben Yusef tries to conquer Europe. Now this portrayal is anything but the ""stay-puffed marshmallow man"". Ben Yusef scares me. But one also thrills to the terror of his forces and his leadership. Likewise, Shaka Zulu, in the movie of the same name, also clearly was not someone to be trifled with. I think those examples are what a world conqueror would really be like.

A movie which has 99% of the facts wrong.,"Please be aware that this movie doesn't reflect the Real Alexander the Grate.There is mistakes in the movie about his father, mother, the Hellas Empire (by the way, there wasn't any Greece 300BC...remember that). Today's Greece was common states, and they fought with each other always. Why does Oliver Stone portrait that Macedonia and Greece was enemies? They where al enemies, you had the Spartans, the Athenians, Crete's etc. And by the way, there was not any Greece 300BC, so why did they have maps on the movie showing today's Greece? Why do Oliver Stone mix up Greece (that was not Greece at that time) with Macedonia? He has mixed it upp so many times that people gets confuses. Aegean's.. was another name BTW, if you wanted it to be at least a little bit correct. They where al Hellenic Civilization my friends, that fought each other. For you FYROM people, as you can see in the movie Macedonia is a part of Greece, and insides there boarders. Sorry to say, by that is one of the correct facts, besides that the name shouldn't state Greece. They spoke the same language, worshiped the same Goods, used the same alphabet. So far so good, but otherwise the movie is a total disaster. Oliver Stone even made Achilles a gay!The war with the Persians is also wrong according to numerous facts, how Alexander got hurt also. How he got hurt in India.Many things is more or less fiction from Oliver Stone himself.There is also a lot of bad acting, long monologues....To you Oliver Stone I can only say: It is your responsibility when making a movie about a well known person in History to make it true. It is your responsibility toward the world, and not only your pervert mind. Do not go and see this movie, it is not worth the money. The only good is the music in the movie.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
action at its slowest,"The DVD copy I watched had a commentary from director Stone and it perhaps explained the slow pace of such a potentially exciting film. He talks at length of the collaboration with European producers and the 1950s ""Toga and Sandals"" feel comes through really strongly. The most telling comment was that we know nothing of the man Alexander other than some comments put down three hundred years after he died. So this movie is a characterisation based on a guess.Stone seems to let his actors ramble on and use whatever dialect they like to give them authenticity. Angelina Jolie's mock Greek-accented English is a failure and detracts from her performance.I look forward to this story being told by a better director and acted by better actors with some hint of historical accuracy.

I, on the other hand, think it is a dramatic but bloody good film, giving us insight to what these ancient battles could have been like.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A huge disappointment, as battle and historic movies goes","I can hardly understand how it could go wrong with the movie considering the director and theme, but it was a huge disappointment.Firstly, the movie shows few scenes from the childhood and young age. There is a few shots of an insecure looking boy. But they do not build up the character so that it is believable. They seem like disconnected scenes. You don't really get to understand this person, what motivates him. It is narrated, but it does not seem real - you don't feel for the character or understand him. Still there is some drama in the beginning and you hope it can turn out a good movie.But then there is suddenly a jump in the story line after these few scenes. Anthony Hopkins rambles on about what happened between the boy and his father, and then you are suddenly immersed into a battle situation. You follow discussions between Alexander and some of his generals or aides. Also, you see him talking to the soldiers before the battle. But again it does not come over as real. It seems like scenes acted out by amateurish actors. I will say that it simply does not seem like the actors believe in the story, including Collin Farrell.The above is in sharp contrast to great battle movies like Braveheart and Troy which delivers the merchandize with believable heroes, brilliant acting and fascinating plots. Alexander is the total opposite. Whereas Anthony Hopkins narration makes us anticipate the portray of a charismatic leader of men - almost like a god to use his own words - the actual scenes makes Alexander seem weak, indecisive, confused and over indulgent. Why does the movie focus on so many of his faults, so much so, that the greatness of the man disappears?Now, Oliver Stone may think that he is historically very correct, wanting to give the movie a documentary dimension. From my history lessons I had the expectation of a great leader with drive. This movie portrays him as too insecure and confused in many situations, and as a lunatic in some of the battle situations. Despite what psychological problems the real Alexander might have had due to his upbringing and tense relationship with his mother, I do believe that he must have been much more determined and strong than that weakling from shown in the movie. Otherwise he could not have attained as much.As for the battle scenes, I found many of them claustrophobic and confusing with too many close ups. There is also too much blood and gore, which can be okay but only when it supports a good and believable plot. In this movie it just seems confusing and like it has been put into the movie just to have it there. The battle situations seems somehow disconnected from the main movie, like they are something added because they are expected to be there. You don't really get any feeling for each characters achievement in these battles which would have helped to build them up as believable.In general I would say that there too much focus on jamming as many scenes and events into the movie as possible, with the effect of chopping up the plot and having characters that one does not get to really know, the result being that you cannot really identify with them or feel connected to the story.Of good things in the movie I can mention are Angelina Jolie as the mother of Alexander. She is very convincing with her disturbed, dark personality and intrigues. But hers was a minor role. Also, some of the filming and visual effects were very nicely done. But these things cannot save the movie.I am so very irritated with this long movie. It was a waste of time and I felt like leaving several times. I have rated it 3.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
Worse movie ever by Oliver Stone... wait for DVD if that,"This movie is not only long and horribly cast but the story is so utterly dull and chopped up that one is better suited watching the History channel Alexander story that is at least correct historically. Colin F. does an okay job with this TV miniseries overbudgeted film but besides Val Kilmer and Angeline one wonders why Oliver even made this movie, what was his message since the main character has no arcs that holds any resemblance to being entertaining. And i love most of Oliver's movies but this is just on the realm of being a movie one wants to walk out of esp the tacky cgi scenes that look like something out of a 50s or Japanese godzilla movie, not to mention the gay scenes that lack any substance resembling any depth so at the end of the movie one is left trying to root for the main character because no other character is developed besides his crazy mother who you're not sure if she is medusa, a witch or a demented mother, and the last funny issue is how many characters have lost an eye in this movie that you wonder if they are a part of some macedonian fraternity. I can not stress how this movie is not worth 8 dollars and i debate if worth 3 for rental comparing it to Troy which at least had redeeming characters and a story with a decent flow and fight scenes that made one believe Brad Pitt was capable of fighting.. there is not one scene where Colin shows what motivated him to travel over 10000 miles and over 10 years or what his genius or skills in battle with a sword or hand to hand combat were except a few vague horribly shot blurry quick scenes but ill just leave by saying Oliver please please next time hire some decent writers that know structure, character arcs and a better cgi company.. i mean bablyon looks like a cheap vegas which by the way was burned down by Alexander in a drunken spree which you never put in the movie.... no wonder the greeks are ashamed of your trite movie... just think twice next time when you decide to make a movie - what is your message, and what is the point for wasting one year of your life and eons of money that could have been used on at least 10 independent films but this is an embarrassment of a movie that should have been shelved if you didn't spend so much money and peoples time and money at the theatre.A Big Thumbs down.. and i went in with low expectations.. and i still came out disappointed sitting thru 3 hours of what could have been told in 2 hours or less.... ps. next time hire an independent editor with some sanity.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography

Very good,"It is not easy to defend a film that is criticized wildly by many. But in order to understand Alexandre's controversies, we must first turn to director Oliver Stone's filmography. Whenever he made a film based on real events (Nascido em 4 de Julho / The Doors / JFK / Nixon / W. / As Torres Gêmeas), the director always sought to put more emphasis on his opinion on the subject than simply show the facts. It is difficult to say who Alexander the Great was. Some will say that he was the greatest conqueror of all time. The greatest military general. Others will say that he was simply a tyrant. There are also those who will say that despite his arrogance and brutality, Alexander was a dreamy and visionary man. For Oliver Stone, Alexandre was all of that and more. Lasting 3 hours, the film shows unapologetically the relationship of Alexandre (Colin Farrel) with his parents, Queen Olympia (Angelina Jolie) and Filipi (Val Kilmer). The relationship between the three is explosive, but exciting. The film follows the style ""Ascension and decadence"", and immerses us deeply not only in Alexander's victories and defeats but in his personal life. It is not really an easy to assimilate film. Many, they will say will call the film exaggerated, shameful, but in reality it is an ambitious film and very, very brave.Film seen on the 25th to the 26th of March 2020",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Interminable, ponderous, absurd, occasionally hilarious","Reading these reviews -- well, some of them, I don't have all day you know -- it seems folks either really love this film or really hate it. I find absolutely nothing to love here. The movie is far too long, the plot has no cohesion at all (strange for a historical epic), and most critically the star is utterly miscast and over his head.I don't know what Colin Farrell did to deserve top billing in a $150M project. He's a perfectly fine actor, but perfectly fine actors are a drachma a dozen. ""Alexander"" needed a big swinging dick to fill this role. Farrell looks like a guy from Duran Duran. Angelina Jolie is certainly A-list material, but her role is too fragmented and, quite frankly, her performance is so ludicrous that it supplied the only real enjoyment I derived from this whole mess. To see her literally covered with snakes and intoning absurd lines like ""My son you must face your glorious destiny"" with an out-REG-uss ack-SENT that was once the sole province of James Bond villains. The fact that Jolie and Farrell can't be more than a few years apart in age completes the fiasco.Another point of hilarity, this time courtesy of Stone: during the Gaugamela battle scene, Alex is heard to order his troops ""back and to the left!"" not once, but twice.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
Just pathetic,"I give it a star for the Battle of Gaugamela and a star for the scenery. The rest of the movie sucked. I couldn't believe how slow it was. Just about nothing happened from Gaugamela to the end. It was incredibly long and as boring as anything could be. The fake accent by Angelina Jolie was appalling and stupid as heck. The worst part of the movie were the narrations by Anthony Hopkins. He explained all the parts of the movie that were too hard to act out on screen, because Oliver Stone wanted to fill up most of the movie with mindless disputes between Alexander and his men. I mean, the whole point of a movie is that you are told the story visually. But in this movie, you see a bunch of guys riding around on horses as Hopkins explains what is happening.A little inaccuracy that just about made me gag from idiocy was in the last battle when that guy gets impaled on the elephant's tusk.

But some of them had fake Persian accents.A half hour is spent taking a conversation to climax. Insert action? Nope.Anthony Hopkins gives you the short version of what went down as the next event is already being played. Those of you who saw the movie will remember this example: Alexander makes one of his lengthy rah-rah speeches about continuing over the hills through India.

Alexander was Great!,"I don't know why this movie is getting so much bad press. From complaints about the 3 hours plus running time, to assertions about wooden acting, I went expecting this movie to be a waste of time. But after watching the history channel's History or Hollywood, I decided to take a chance, since, apparently, this movie is very accurate-given the little that is known about Alexander's private life and thoughts.I found that this movie is, first and foremost, for those who are into history and other cultures and especially Greek mythos and culture. The ethos and peoples of that time were, of course, different from those of our time and-specifically-our culture. In a thousand years, others will look back on our culture and time and find them very alien to theirs with few similarities.Beyond that, this film shows the genius and humanity of this great man and what situations and experiences made him who he was. The bulk of the movie is couched between two great pivotol battles, the first against the Persian Empire and the second against India. Although I found these battles to be highly realistic and amazing, given the strategy that these peoples employed, the movie is less battle and more about character. If you go for blood and guts without substance, you won't like this movie; it engages the mind and emotions more than anything else. But the acting, I thought, was quite good; especially from Colin Farrell, Val Kilmer-not usually a favorite of mine, and Angelina Jolie-who has disappointed in the past. But decide for yourself, it is, after all, only my opinion. By the way, for me the 3 plus hours flew by pretty quickly. And all this from a guy who really prefers women.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

I mean come on the guy was gay we get it, don't throw in a he-she every few scenes... I only stayed hoping, telling myself that there was going to be another battle pretty soon, because it was made to look like that from the trailers. But nope, I was dissappionted again. And it is THREE HOURS. That is important to know, because after two hours and your legs start to go stiff and your butt hurts. After that you will know that it wasn't worth the money you paid.I would have to say that there was too much gay, not enough fighting for a ""war epic"", too long when it could have been a lot shorter, and most of all, been more actual movie than ongoing conversation.And a tip to those who are forced into going by a girlfriend or family or are just going because you have nothing better to do, I would highly recommend a cell phone with games or a cd player and pillow.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
"It's so out of focus, you don't remember he's great until you're told!","This film is flawed from start to finish, though it has admirable moments. The images that are flashed before you are often beautiful, but you are rarely afforded a meaning behind them. Alexander is rich with emotions, but as an audience member you don't experience any of them, and are almost unsure why the actors are feeling them...The main thing that this film lacks is any sense of direction, and a clear picture at what we are to be expecting when it gets to its destination. Scenes are thrown together is seemingly random order, though the general movement of scenes is in chronological order. When jumping from scene to scene the viewer begins to wonder just what purpose that scene will play in the larger picture, and in most cases the answer is none. It seems as if the battles displayed in the film were picked merely because of Oliver Stone's desire to shoot them, though the battle for Persia was quite possibly the most important victory in Alexander's campaign. Of course the film fails miserably in stressing that fact to the audience. Several long and arduous scenes seem to have no reason at all for being there. It is not that they wouldn't play well to showing the effects of Alexander's actions on his popularity amongst the world, it's that fact that Oliver Stone fails to display these effects at all throughout the movie. We are told that Alexander is more or less loved by our ever active narrator, though we are never shown it.Maybe the worst flaw of the entire movie is the disproportional focus of the picture. We are shown countless numbers of scenes in which Alexander reveals his dependence on, and love for Hephaistion. Not only do these scenes become more and more uncomfortable as time goes on, they do nothing to further the story. We simply see nearly identical dialogue played out while the characters embrace, and we are once again 'introduced' to the idea that Alexander was likely a bisexual. In fact, this ever boring tale of ""I love you. I still love you. If you died I couldn't go on. You've died, I can't go on!"" takes center stage over Alexander as a person and over Alexander's achievements.In the final moments of the film Anthony Hopkins, our beloved narrator, tells us in finality that Alexander truly was great; a god amongst men in fact. It is in that moment that you realize that after three hours of film, you're pretty much going to have to take his word for it. Even at that point, you would assume that if the message of the entire film had been lost in a muddled mess of an ever unchanging tale of male companionship, that you would have at least had an interest in it. Truthfully, the viewer is never given any reason to care about what happens to Hephaistion at all. His character is almost used exclusively as a vehicle for displaying the homosexual nature of Alexander.Overall, the film ended up being the failed vision of a director who clearly put a lot into the film. The unfortunateness of the whole affair is that the viewer never really gets anything out of the experience.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
There is Nothing Great about this Alexander!!!,"I have never actually written a review about a film in this site as I don't really believe in Film Criticism. It's all a very subjective matter. However, after watching Alexander I felt compelled to do so. Alexander the Great is one of the Greatest Historical figures, he is not a myth, not a Hollywood hero. The portrayal of his character and his amazing achievements demand not only respect, but a profound knowledge and understanding of his persona and the historical context of that period. I was devastated when I saw this Alexander because there is really nothing great about him. I cannot even say the words, ""It doesn't make justice to Alexander the Great"". Colin Farrell played the role of a warrior who was brave in battle, weak emotionally, not really beautiful, not very gifted as a leader, not to mention a king... with a mother who spend more time with her snakes than with her own people and a father who behaved like a drunk viking. His poor horse was short legged and looked inferior to the Arabian horses in the battles and all his generals spoke English with a different accent and who all in all were only interested in slicing flesh and getting drunk in orgies. So it is mentioned that he founded a few Alexandrias here and there and that he reached the ends of the world where people fought on four legged giants called elephants. Well, so what? If this were really the life and work of Alexander the Great I am convinced that he wouldn't have been called Great and he wouldn't have marked the world history the way that he did. Alexander the Great was so great because he was truly gifted. He got the best education, he was taught how to respect all knowledge, how to love the human and the divine. His intellect and spirituality together with insightful and progressive way of thinking made him so wise for his age and so successful. The aura that surrounded his persona was magical and intoxicating. So many thousands of warriors, Greeks and ""savages"" followed Alexander to the ends of the world because they admired and respected him, because they believed in his vision and because they loved him like a God not because he was their king, but because of who he was.The cultural Heritage that Alexander the Great left behind for all civilizations to come is immense and cannot be counted by the battles he won, or portrayed in a three hour film. However, it is sad that with a subject so rich, so Great that what we see on the screen is so poor, so superficial and so commercialized! This Alexander is an insult to one of the Greatest kings history has ever had! I am sorry, but Mr. Stone, you could have done at least a little bit better!",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Bad writing, bad acting, bad directing... the perfect cocktail...","This may contain spoilersFirst of all, the movie starts really bad. Acutually, the beginning of the movie is so boring. just an old man walking around and talking, nothing else, just an old man saying bad lines. and when the man stops talking and we see Alexander for the first time as a kid, O God... that was one of the worst parts. Angelina her accent was so bad, so, so bad. I wonder why these actors agreed after they have read the script. I am not going to review the hole movie. If I would do that it would take me ages to tell how bad it was.Do yourself a favor and don't go and watch it, I had to because they made me watch it in class.

A true and worthy adaptation of Alexander's Life,"This review is for the Alexander Recisited: The (Unrated) Final Cut. At over 3.5 hours long, this adaptation is more of a true reflection of the real History of Alexander than the theatrical release. There are more (and unapologetic) allusions to Alexander's bisexuality in this version though nothing truly overtly sexual is filmed (excepting one scene with his (new) wife Roxanna. Students of Alexander and his history should be somewhat mollified at this adaptation. Military tactics and uniforms are accurately rendered, often not scene in such biographical films.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Pretty good up through the first battle.  Then leave and come back--maybe.,"Alexander taming Bucephalus, then the effective use of the phalanx are great. As the phalanxes marched up and faced Darius, I found myself grinning and nodding. Particularly good sound. But after that, I spent a full two hours wishing this dude would just croak. This film was shot in only a year, and they seem to have left out the last month of editing. Many, many brushes around the gay theory, much screaming and arm-waving, but they kind of missed Egypt, Syria, the entire geopolitics of 332 BC. The first time Alex gets his guys cheering and thinking he's great in the whole second half of the movie is when he decides they can quit and go home. He's unlikable, but in a way that made me keep saying ""so what?"" If the story has a moral, it's ""never attack an elephant on foot."" Way, way too long for the points it makes, way too artifically dramatic, and I'd love to know how they figured out what kind of accent everyone should have--Angelina Jolie sounds like Natasha in Rocky and Bullwinkle.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
"It may be as historically accurate as you want, but it's just plain boring","It seems, as many reviewers in this section rave about, this film is surprisingly historically accurate for what we are used to in Hollywood epics (although not enough for some!). In that respect it is quite didactic, and I thank Oliver Stone for informing me about the life of a very relevant historical figure who, I admit, I didn't know well enough. But taken as a movie, and not a history lesson, I'm sorry guys, but it is boring as hell. And, before you start, I'm not yearning for less ""talky"" scenes and more battle scenes. In fact, I found that even the few battle scenes (specially the second battle) became a bit boring in the end. I don't mind large amounts of dialog in a film, in fact I enjoy it (my favourite movie of 2004 was Before Sunset, which is nothing but a dialog), AS LONG AS IT IS INTERESTING TO LISTEN TO! And that's the problem here: much of what is said is just not interesting, because it is too convoluted, or too obvious, or too irrelevant, or too repetitive, or too arid, or too obscure, or too adorned, or just doesn't make any sense. And when you have to listen to this kind of dialog for three hours, you just get bored. Stone has fallen into the same trap as in Nixon: he doesn't know when to stop, when to cut, when to just hint instead of giving you speech after speech. In the end, his biopics become farragos, too arduous to follow. I prefer his lighter films, like U-turn, which may be less profound, but much, much more entertaining.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
dO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND SKIP THIS one,"There are numerous people commenting on how Alexander is a ""great"" movie and that those that don't get are simply too ""stupid"" to understand. No, this movie just doesn't flow and plainly sucks. This was probably the biggest disappointment that I have had at the movies in years. The movie itself does not even now what it is trying to say about Alexander's life. There are a handful of gorgeous shots but the rest of the movie is pretty much gaytacular. Stone had numerous shots that instead of being serious were just uncomfortably funny. The movies dialogue is so benal and superfluous (this is a feat in itself). The movie does a fantastic job at making the audience feel absolutely nothing for any of these characters. When they die the only sympathy you will feel is for yourself because you have now sat through nearly three hours of the most boring show of the year.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
Biggest mis-casting of a major role in movie history.,"For the budget and amount of money that must have been spent on this film, it was ruined for me by some horrendous mis-casting.Who thought that Colin Farrell who must weigh about 9 stone wet through, looks like a warrior. He is totally unbelievable as the commander of men and armies and seems to spend the whole film with terrified looking expressions on his face leading seemingly aimless charges from one part of the battlefield to another.The battle of Gaugamela seems to have been exaggerated beyond anything any Greek Historian could come up with, history now shows that the numbers were a little more equal than the Greek version, and given that the Parthians and Sassanid's subsequently saw off 6 Roman invasions I tend to believe the revised version, that Alexander after defeating a minor border kingdom was forced to retreat from India, when an army nearly ten times the size of his own was on its way.Where the film Troy for example delivers in both acting and plot, this film is such a disappointment on so many level. The only highlights were the narration and the use of a birds eye battle view camera shots which I thought was inventive.Farrel wearing uniforms and armour particularly helmets that looked several sizes too big for him, made poor Alexander quite comical at times I'm afraid.Whowever cast this movie should be sacked, next time do not cast an actor who looks like Mr Puniverse, and then allow him to look terrified throughout the whole movie as someone who is supposed to be a man who other men would follow to the ends of the earth.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
Good movie; criticisms incorrectly labeled,"After being bombarded with terrible reviews, I decided to see this movie for myself. I enjoyed it, and thought it was well-done, if the storytelling felt funny in some parts.I did not think this movie was worthy of the horrible grades given to it by 'professional' movie critics or IMDb users. I believe that these criticisms are entirely caused by the portrayal of Alexander as bisexual or homosexual in the film.Throughout the movie he is most assuredly portrayed in this manner, and you shouldn't see it if this is going to irritate you. If you get tired of shady beckonings by Colin Farrell to attractive young men, don't see the movie. If you don't like the idea of the conquerer idolizing Achilles and the hero's love of his friend Patroclus, just don't see the movie. But what you should definitely not do is go onto internet forums and say the entire movie is terrible.I feel most of the criticism to this movie comes solely from a section of society that fears homosexuals, and is afraid this movie will somehow promote homosexuality. It doesn't. It's just the same as any movie that portrays a hero in love with a woman. But some people seem urged to write the movie off and make sure others do the same just for its hero's different tastes.Bottom line: A good movie, but don't see it if you will be bothered heavily by any hint of homosexuality.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Not recommended,"They wasted a lot of money making this epic? film.I don't know whether it was bad acting, a bad script, or a combination of the two, but it mostly didn't work. Then there's the fact that the historic Alexander was blond, and Colin Farrell isn't. During the first part of the film, his blond hair looked like nothing more than a really, really bad wig. Then, in the scenes in Babylon, when his hair was long and parted it was better. Unfortunately, the many close-ups of his face revealed a heavy black shadow, if not stubble. This was a serious distraction. In a few scenes, he was clearly recently clean-shaved, and looked okay, but only a few THey should have hired a real blond to play the role.I won't even waste time on the overly long battle scenes. They could have done so much better with a lot less money.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
Wrong Emphasis on a Legendary Person,"When doing a biographical movie of a person, writers and directors need to emphasis the right parts of the person. They both need to show what made the person great in comparison to who they were as a person. A careful balance is needed between the legend and the person. And Alexander fails this test miserably. With only a few battles and a vague showing of Alexander's diplomatic abilities, this movie primarily focuses on who Alexander was as a person and his style of life. And although this is important, it was overplayed and greatly overshadowed what made Alexander Alexander the Great. And, while it is important to point out, and actually emphasise that Alexander was bi-sexual if not gay, it is even more important to show that Alexander was first a conqueror and second a human. Because when talking about Alexander the Great, he is larger than life, a character that is infinitely rare. Other problems with the movie was the battle in the forest in which Alexander is wounded and the artistic value of contrasting the colors with a shift failed to do whatever it was meant to do. The end of the movie dragged on, making the last 30 minutes seem almost painful. While historically accurate, which it most likely is, the movie fails to show Alexander the Great and ultimately fails do to the one thing a movie is supposed to do, entertain.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
So bad. I'm speechless.,"I was just able to catch another Oliver Stone film, this time it was Alexander. Let me just say, I want 3 hours of my life back. I can't begin to explain how pitiful Alexander truly is. It is just cinema and Hollywood at its worst. It was like watching a horror film. It just shook me up but not in a good way. I was told before hand I'd be stunned. I was stunned, stunned that Oliver Stone directed this piece of garbage, totally inaccurate film that I was told was better then Gladiator or Kingdom of Heaven.The film is suppose to tell us the story of Alexander the Great, one of the greatest military commanders and kings to ever exist. The film follows from young prince to death. We are taken across Macedonia, Asia Minor and Asia. We see the major battles of Gaugamela and Hydaspes. We also are taken into a mental look of Alexander. All is fine and well when this is read on paper but when you see it done on screen, its awful.Everything is way overblown. I know they are fighting in the desert at Gaugamela but for God's sake the audience wants to see the battle not just a giant dust cloud. The acting reminded me of watching a silent film from the 1910's with every character reacting overly traumatic to an action. The sets are so unbelievable. Yes this was the golden age of the Macedonian Empire but nothing was built or looked perfectly as Stone wants us to believe with every set shown.Colin Farrell is not a bad actor when given the right material. He is, however, a terrible Alexander the Great. I believe it is more of the character Stone wanted him to be, not Farrell himself. There are so many changes in personality for Alexander, from gay to straight, quiet and naive to inspirational and powerful, to scared and upset to determined and all mighty that eventually you start taking bets on what his next mood swing will be and what side he'll show. Now I'm sure the real life Alexander had some personal problems but if he saw how he was portrayed in this he'd probably be drawing up plans to invade Hollywood.I've lost almost all hope in Oliver Stone. His films are gradually deteriorating into boring and overblown pieces, nothing like Platoon was. Everything looks to fancy and neat. The costumes are too new, the people are too handsome, the battles are too choreographed. Stone's dialog is bland, boring, and thoughtless. There is either no emotion behind a speech or too much emotion. I can't begin to count how many times Farrell goes to the verge of tears when talking to someone.I honestly have never seen a worse biopic or historical drama. Nothing made sense. I couldn't tell what part of the story was going on with the constant flashbacks and flash forwards. The whole presence of Anthony Hopkins was totally unnecessary and boring. It just added wasted minutes onto the film. The film is so dry at moments I would fall asleep and wake up and they'd still be talking. Of the 2 hours and 55 minutes there is about 30 minutes of battle and 40 minutes of Alexander crying. Good job Stone. You really should think about whether you should ever direct again. I would say no.1/5 Stars",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
"not his best, but when compared to everybody else...still amazing","Look, Oliver Stone is one of the finest directors in the history of cinema. Platoon, JFK, Natural Born Killers amongst his rest are some of the best movies ever made. The fact that some people who just plain don't understand him continue to post outrageous claims about how he's terrible for movies need to grow up and realize that the reason hes so different is why he's so good in the first place. Alexander, while not being his best work, is still a triumph. You're all so quick to blow it off while not even understanding the passion and comittment Stone put into making the film in the first place. Stone doesn't give two shits what is publicly sound or morally right. He presents his movies in the way he understands them and if you don't like it, the Don't watch it and certainly don't start expressing your distaste for something that you cant appreciate. If your the type of person who thought the Lord of the Rings movies were the best ever made......I'm talking to you. The cinematography, direction, and visuals were all top notch and the acting did exactly what it was supposed to do. Represent a clear portrayal for the time period and that it does. If the homosexual scenes bother you. Don't watch it. But you can bet thats exactly how it was back then. This is Oliver Stones vision and by far his most ambitious project to date. Too many film makers form into the standard that Hollywood creates for them and they just churn out dog poo. The truth is that everybody needs a little Oliver Stone in them and cinema would be a much better experience.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Very bad film from historical and national point ...,"As you are all aware, Oliver Stone's film on the Macedonian conqueror Alexander is due to open on November 24. We, the Macedonians, the descendents of Alexander's Macedonians, want to inform you that we reject the movie as historically inaccurate for it is not a true story of Alexander as Stone claims it to be. We are particularly concerned by the ""Greekness"" that Stone has given to the Macedonian king.1) Where are the Historical Errors in the film?Stone has Collin Farell (the actor playing Alexander) saying to the Macedonians before the battle of Gaugamela against the Persians that they are fighting for ""the glory of Greece.""Ancient sources do not write that Alexander fought for the ""glory of Greece"" but for that of Macedonia. Three ancient historians detailed Alexander's address to the army before the battle. And each one of them made a clear distinction between Macedonians, Greeks, Illyrians, and Thracians, as four separate ethnicities that composed Alexander's army. Here are the words of the Roman historian Curtius Rufus:""Riding to the front line he (Alexander the Great) named the soldiers and they responded from pot to spot where they were lined up. The Macedonians, who had won so many battles in Europe and set off to invade Asia ... got encouragement from him - he reminded them of their permanent values. They were the world's liberators and one day they would pass the frontiers set by Hercules and Father Liber. They would subdue all races on Earth. Bactria and India would become Macedonian provinces. Getting closer to the Greeks, he reminded them that those were the people (the Persians on the other side) who provoked war with Greece, ... those were the people that burned their temples and cities ... As the Illyrians and Thracians lived mainly from plunder, he told them to look at the enemy line glittering in gold"" (Curt.3.10.4-10)Notice what Alexander told the Macedonians - ""Bactria and India would become Macedonian provinces"". It is for the glory of Macedonia, not for the glory of Greece. The Greeks, are here a second nation of importance to Alexander.Throughout Oliver Stone's film there is confusion whether the Macedonians were distinct people or just another Greeks. Ironically the original Synopsis of the film makes the clear distinction between Macedonians and Greeks. There we read: ""Alexander led his virtually invincible Greek and Macedonian armies through 22,000 milesHis extraordinary journey begins when Alexander launches his invasion from Macedonia""Yet although in the Synopsis the Macedonians are separate from the Greeks, and they left from Macedonia and not from Greece, Stone has them fighting for the ""glory of Greece""?! The error is obvious.2) Why the Macedonians and Greeks still hate each other today?Macedonia is now divided between today's republic of Macedonia, Greece, and Bulgaria. The division occurred in 1912 when Greece, Serbia, and Bulgaria occupied and partitioned the country, inflicting a tragic faith upon the descendents of Alexander.In the 19th century Macedonia was occupied by the Turkish Ottoman Empire. The Macedonians then were well aware that they, and they alone, were the descendents of Alexander's Macedonians.This is very important - in this same 19th century, the Greeks did not claim the ancient Macedonians as ""theirs,"" on the contrary. The works of the Greeks in the 18th and 19th centuries reveal that the Greeks did not regard the ancient Macedonians as Greeks, but foreigners who had conquered Greece (see Politis 1993:36; Dimaras 1958; Karagatsis, 1952). Politis had cited fourteen examples from the Greek literature from 1794 to 1841 in which the ancient Macedonians are excluded from the ancient Greek world (1993: 40-42).With the occupation of southern Macedonia by Greece in 1912-13, everything changed. Greece needs its occupied Macedonian territory and created new propaganda to claim the ancient Macedonians as ""Greek"". Such propaganda is needed to justify the present occupation. This stealing of the Macedonian history by the Greeks is resented by the Macedonians who have long before the Greeks claimed descent from Alexander, and still do.3) Why today's Macedonians are direct descendents of Alexander?In 2001 it was genetically proved by a scientific team from Universidad Complutense in Madrid, Spain, that the ancient Macedonians and the ancient Greeks were two separate and distinct peoples. It also proved that the modern Macedonians are descendants of the ancient Macedonians of Alexander the Great, while the modern Greeks are not related to either the ancient or modern Macedonians. The lengthy scientific paper which was published and entitled ""HLA genes in Macedonians and the sub-Saharan origin of the Greeks"", concludes the following:""Macedonians belong to the 'older' Mediterranean substratum, like Iberians (including Basques), North Africans, Italians, French, Cretans, Jews, Lebanese, Turks (Anatolians), Armenians and Iranians. Macedonians are not related with geographically close Greeks, who do not belong to the ""older"" Mediterranean substratum. Greeks are found to have a substantial relatedness to sub-Saharan (Ethiopian) people, which separate them from other Mediterranean groups. Macedonians are related to other Mediterraneans and do not show a close relationship with Greeks: however, they do with Cretans. This supports the theory that Macedonians are one of the most ancient peoples living in the Balkan peninsula, probably long before the arrival of the Mycaenian Greeks, about 2000 BC.""Thus, genetically and scientifically had been proved not only that the ancient Macedonians were not Greeks, but that they are older then the ancient Greeks. You may read the full content of this genetic study at the following web address: http://www.makedonika.org/processpaid.aspcontentid=ti.2001.pdfConclusionPlease consider the Macedonian position when approaching Stone's Alexander. Alexander and his Macedonians would have been appalled by Stone who had tried to make them fighting for Greece, when the ancient evidence says they did for Macedonia, because as the ancient authors testify they were not Greeks.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography

Meeow,"Oh dear. You know I really enjoy Oliver Stone's work, even when he's missing the target, like in the gloriously ludicrous 'Doors' movie, but I never expected to find myself staring at my watch and thinking 'get on with it'.The warning signs are there right from the beginning. Anthony Hopkins, playing an ancient king of Egypt who had once served under Alexandera, recounts his experiences. It isn't too long before his memoirs, instead of engaging the audience, take on the tone of a boring classics teacher.Maybe it was Stone's belligerence in trying to make a historically accurate film that scuppered it. Maybe he worked too closely with the Academics. By not taking liberties with the truth he has made a film too confusing and complicated to follow, even with King Ptolemy's - that was Hopkins' character - droning narrative. Not being an expert on this period of history, I hadn't got a clue who most of the people were, where they had come from and where they were going. The films' attempts to cover the more political, social, religious and economic aspects of the time meant over-long rambling scenes that just didn't work.Once you've committed the fatal  movie  sin of not letting your audience emphasise with the characters, it's downhill from then on. And, of course, once you loose interest you start looking for other things to entertain you.Let's start, and how can you not, with the amazing Angelina Jolie. Not content with chewing up the whole set she has decided to play the part with Ingrid Pitt's accent from Countess Dracula. If she'd have been appearing in a typical sword and sandals epic she would have been wonderful. In a pious effort like this, however, the other cast members (and the audience as well) all shuffle nervously away from her in an attempt to put as much distance between themselves and her as possible. And as for those poor snakesAnd then there is the hair. I'm pretty sure Colin Farrell wears that permanent vexed expression throughout the film to convey the immense pressures of leadership, but it could also quite easily be caused by the thought of the current wig he has upon his head.And then there's the bisexual issue. I would have a lot more time for Oliver Stone's protest about a homophobic backlash in the States, if the film's handling of Alexander sex life wasn't so fey itself. He has no problem with showing the brutality and savagery of battle, so why couldn't he have carried this on with Alexander's relationships. Instead we have Colin Farrell and Jared Leto staring mistily into each others eyes like some star-crossed lovers in a Mills and Boom novel. Surely the whole point about these pre-Christian times was that homosexuality was not equated as some limp-wristed weakness, that's very much a modern idiom. If anything it was the opposite, a re-enforcement of their masculinity.Enough. This isn't even a flawed masterpiece, it's basically dull. Any redeeming features are few and far between. Yet I do hope it's not too disastrous a financial failure. I recently read a review of this film in which the critic said that he always eagerly awaits a new Olive Stone movie and is always disappointed. I totally agree with that, but this is a big disappointment.All I can suggest to Mr Stone is to have a big roar  like Alexander's during his only sex scene, well 'Meow' more like  and move on. We'll all be waiting.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Had potential, but ultimately a big disappointment","When a film has Oliver Stone's name attached to it is released, you think of Platoon, Wall Street, Born on the 4th of July, JFK, all great films. So considering the hype that preceded Alexander you'd expect it to be a great epic film in the same category as Braveheart, or Gladiator. Unfortunately despite the strong cast, they ended up giving poor performances, seeming wooden and unnatural (with 2 exceptions). I'm no big Colin Farrel fan, but I must say his performance was the one thing that kept me going through this very long (too long) film. As well as Val Kilmer in the first quarter of the film (one of his best performances).The big disappointments are from Angelina Jolie who seemed to be trying too hard to achieve a character which was flawed to begin with. The dialogue coming from her seemed like something from a fantasy novel, not a historical epic. And what was with that phony accent?Anthony Hopkins must have given one of the most boring performances of his career. I must say I was on the verge of falling asleep at the end of the film wondering when he would just shut up(Poor Anthony how did he get himself mixed up in this debacle).Jared Leto's character was just pathetic, he seemed to have no backbone at all, its no wonder he didn't die in the first battle in the film. Most of the film just featured him standing around with a smirk on his face and he hardly had any dialogue. His death scene was horrendous.Overall at the end of this drawn out film I felt as if I had wasted my time and money. Don't waste yours.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Waste of Time,"I think 'Alexander' may be literally the worst movie I've ever seen. I want 3 hours and 10 minutes of my life back. It's not even worth renting.

I don't mind nudity in movies, but the one scene of it in this film was just unnecessary and once again confusing. The movie just made no sense and was not aesthetically pleasing at all... (with the exception of Angelina Jolie and/or Patrick Carroll, depending on your preferences, but ogling at them isn't a good enough reason to waste that much of your life). It was way too theatrical and unrealistic. One would think when you spend this much money to make a movie the special effects could at least be good, but they were pathetic.
