Does well (for a sequel),"Sequels rarely live up to the originals. And in the horror genre that's even rarer. I reckon that 'Saw' (part I) will always be better, due to its originality and shock value, but its (first) successor does its best to expand on the mythology and give the audience something more. In short... it's definitely worth a watch if you enjoyed the original.The first outing could be summed up best by 'two men wake up in a serial killer's lair and try to figure out how to escape.' However, there was far more to the story than just that and the amount of different twists and turns really struck a chord with audiences (that and the amount of 'body horror' that was involved.'Part II' ups the ante in every sense. There are more victims in the killer's latest 'lair,' more gore, more traps, more police officers trying to figure out where these hapless people are, perhaps most importantly, more of the killer himself (who was surprisingly not in the first installment very much). In fact... out of all the characters in the film, it's the killer 'Jigsaw' (Tobin Bell) who steals every scene.As with the first film, there's more to the story than just a bunch of people trying to escape from some fiendishly fatal death-traps. 'Saw II' does its best to keep the surprises coming and, like the first, you'll only have one chance to watch it without knowing all the plot twists that will be heading your way.So, if you liked the original then you should enjoy this one, too. In fact it's almost like these two films could have been written together and filmed back to back. After this one I only stayed with the franchise for a couple more films as the quality really does go downhill after this one. For me the 'Saw' franchise was a two-picture deal.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Saw II: Measure once, cut twice","I have no idea what my title means, except that it sounded clever in my head. Hmm.I'll assume that you've already seen the original Saw and you're wondering if this is a worthy successor. In a word: yeah. But it's a very different approach. While the first Saw was brilliantly minimalistic, the story being staged almost entirely in one room, this second installment takes us out of the box. Gone is the claustrophobic feeling of confusion and good ole existentialistic ""who am I"" from the original, and instead we get more of a mystery as seen from the outside, as our hero Eric (Donnie Wahlberg) tries to crack the case before it's too late.Sure, the same elements existed in the first film, with 2 concurrent plots of victim & detective. But the draw of the first was to figure out why all these things are happening. Here the mystery is revealed in the first few minutes, the killer is apprehended, and what follows is a sort of chess game between investigator Eric and perp Jigsaw with the clock ticking to save the intended victims. It's actually a clever approach similar to the rather AWESOME film ""Exorcist III"" (1990) which is composed of dark dialogues between the detective and the lunatic, and this dramatic approach was repeated a year later in the more popular ""Silence of the Lambs"" (1991). But in this domain, in order for it to work, the film must be slow, almost painfully slow, thick and heavy.Saw II attempts to balance the heavy, psychological ""Lambs"" approach with good old fashioned slashes & gore. It succeeds, I feel. But I still can't help but wonder how it would've been if the filmmakers had gone full tilt ""Lambs"" on us. Instead the dialogues between Eric & Jigsaw seem a bit short, rushed and not fully explored.The result is a film which is certainly entertaining, but I don't think it will ever be considered a psychological classic like the other two I mentioned, or like ""Seven""--films that are much slower in pace, with far fewer gallons of blood spilled but with oceans of drama.I know this may sound like a negative review, but that's only because I'm comparing Saw II to the heavyweights. If instead we take Saw II at face value, a straightforward horror flick, it certainly delivers. There's the added bonus of having two nice twists at the end. In terms of sheer entertainment value, Saw II cuts a real log.I should really quit trying to come up with witty puns.",,Anonymous,Mystery
"Less original, but still worth a look.","The original Saw was probably my most favorite recent ""horror"" movie, so naturally I was excited when the second one came out. I saw it its opening weekend in theaters, and **THIS WAS IN PREVIEWS, SO I Don't CONSIDER IT A SPOILER** I see a man strapped to a chair, with this ""Man in the Iron Mask""-like thing on with all sorts of pretty nails poking toward his face. If you've seen the first one, you can expect what it does. A TV turns on, and there's the puppet thing, and that creepy voice. I'm like ""Hell yes!"" and it seemed like a great beginning, and it truly does have a great idea going for it, but unfortunately it seems like they got lost in the success of the original and the new bigger budget and lost something. It became the traditional horror movie, with your typical predictable characters, and the innovation and claustrophobic feel of the original was gone. It wasn't scary, but then again I didn't think the first one was to be honest, I think they're more of a mental experience than anything. The weird acid-trip like camera shake still occurs, though thankfully less frequently, and it is like a bigger budget Saw. Think Land of the Dead. Still a Romero movie, but it didn't feel like one as much. Same thing applies here. The ending is cool for most people, but I honestly saw it coming. It gets a bit muddled, and by the end of it you really don't remember much except the very beginning and end. It's fun, and it's an interesting piece of this new Saw series, but it just doesn't seem to live up to the original for me. You watch it yourself and give it a chance. I give it a 6 1/2.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The Knowledge of Death Changes Everything,"When detective Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) is called to a crime scene of a victim of Jigsaw (Tobin Bell), he finds a lead to the place where he is hidden. Once there, he realizes that Jigsaw trapped his son Daniel Matthews (Erik Knudsen) with three women and four men in a shelter, and they are inhaling a lethal nerve gas. If they do not use an antidote within two hours, they will die. Eric follows with increasing desperation the death of each member of the group in monitors, while trying to convince Jigsaw to release his son.""Saw II"" is a scary, gore and disturbing movie certainly not recommended for audiences with problem with psychological and visual violence. The story is excellent, and the expected twists in the end are unpredictable and well tied up. This movie recalled me the atmosphere of ""The Silence of the Lambs"" and Tobin Bell performs a stunning sadistic and cold blood killer. His explanations how the knowledge of death changes everything is very logical, therefore frightening. The camera, the cinematography and the soundtrack contribute with the morbid atmosphere of this film. My vote is seven.Title (brazil): ""Jogos Mortais II"" (""Mortal Games II"")",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Too Gory for Popcorn,"This movie has just mad a quantum leap in horror films. after watching this movie i had the chills walking to my car, and lets say that i more than enjoy a scary movie. this movie kept me up for at least and hour after watching it. it was one of those movies were you cant let it out of your mind.The movie had one of the best openings that i have seen in a long time. after a few minutes into the movie i had to put down my popcorn. i don't have a weak stomach and this movie got me to put down my popcorn, that is huge.With a great blend of suspense, acting, and oh yes there was a lot of blood. this movie great deserves another watch, i would pay to see this movie a couple of times. not to mention one of the best twists i have seen in a movie. i would say 2nd best ending i have seen in a movie.(#1 was Fight Club). you definitely have to see this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Enjoyable gore,"Saw 2. Saw it last night in my rewatching of all the Saw movies after so many years.Of course number one had the impact of being the first one and not knowing what to expect.But the second one is also good. More gore just for the sake of it and some twist and turns that are not bad at all.As a negative point I would say some of the dialogs are kinda ridiculous. But hey, just with the terror and the plot twits I am sold.Gonna continue watching the series, it's fun.Gotta admit that this second one had me uncomfortable two or three times. Not recommended to watch while eating. Classic villain in the making.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"""Saw 2 Is Not As Sharp Or Shocking As Original.""","While investigating the bloody aftermath of a grizzly murder, Detective Eric Matthews has the feeling that it is the work of Jigsaw, the notorious killer who disappeared leaving a trail of bodies behind. Jigsaw is indeed back, but instead of two people locked in a room with only one unthinkable way out, there are eight. Eight strangers, unaware of their connection to each other, forced to play out a game that challenges their wits and puts their lives in jeopardy.James Wan and Leigh Whannell gave us a sharp and unique film last year, which shocked audiences around the world. It also had over-acting, major plot holes and mediocre pacing. Saw II manages to stay away from everything that was flawed with Saw, although, in doing so, it plays it too safe and loses all the shock that it wanted to give us.Much like the original, you will find some people in impossible situations, which are unique and great to watch. But Saw 2 tries to take it up a notch by putting more people in this situation, the more people you have the more clichés you need to put in. You get the macho guy, the mysterious guy, the pretty girl, the scared girl, the little kid, the one who knows whats going on, and the token black guy.Unlike the original, where you actually liked the characters, as annoying or over the top they may have been, here you hate them all. You know that most of them, if not all are going to die in some elaborate death, and this keeps us wanting to see more, just so we can watch them die in Jigsaw's house of horrors. Saw 2 focuses more on booby traps then clues for it's players. Even if there were more clues, the people don't care about them, or the director didn't care enough to enlighten us with them.With these clues, you would expect the people inside to pull together and try to solve this puzzle, instead they all turn on each other. One guy finds out what the first clue was and goes on a killing rampage. It's pretty much the same formula as the first, which makes this saw rusty and dull. The original had many jaws drop to the floor with it's twist ending, and going into Saw 2, you would expect the same. There is a twist, more then one to be precise, which is probably the best thing in this film. Although it never reaches the high-point of the original.How can a film that has better acting, not as many plot holes and more on Jigsaw, not be as good you might as yourself. It's basically the overall feel of the movie. I got chills throughout the entire first film, here I got one. Without ruining it, I'll just say that when the lights went on, my eyes were wide open with disbelief.Donnie Whalberg is much better in this film, then Danny Glover was in the first. In this installment, he actually has a reason to be here. Aside from the creepy Tobin Bell, Whalberg actually gives a good performance.Everyone else in the house just plays their characters they way they were written. Scream on cue, cry here, and die there.Excluding the house and all it's traps, the film only showcases one other Jigsaw predicament. A man with a bear trap on his face, who must cut out his own eye in order to get the key to unlock the contraption. Very cool, but not like the reverse bear trap on the girl's jaw from the original. Why did I like the first so much, well it was cool seeing all those little trap he put people in. That was missing from this one. The traps inside the house had wre impossible to get out of, the people were doomed and you knew it.Nevertheless, Saw 2 does end with a twist that sets up a possible third installment. Hopefully in the next one, the saw is sharper and the traps are more convincing. If I were ever in a situation with Jigsaw, I would listen to him carefully and follow his every step, I even yelled at the detective to do so. Saw 2 doesn't put to rest the ongoing debate of whether or not Dr. Gordon is alive or dead and it shouldn't, it should be up to interpretation.Saw 2 was quickly written and directed because it wanted to ride the success of the first and it shows. If time was taken and people who first brought it to us were still involved, Saw 2 could have surpassed the original. The script was written before Saw came out and had nothing to do with it. Once Saw became a hit, a few changes were made and it became Saw 2. So when a script is not written directly for the sequel purpose, you know you're in for trouble.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of the best movies I have seen in a long time.,"The first Saw really through me through some spins and caught me off guard for originality, Saw 2 is leagues above the first. Saw 2 runs with the same game based theme as the first, with clues for both the characters and the audience about what might happen next, but it takes the game to a completely different level. Just when things start to come together there is another twist to leave the viewer on the edge of their seat for what may come next. Without seeming to give everything away the movie was made to give it all away, but no one can catch all the clues because they have been pulled so deep into the movie. I highly recommend this one.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
S.A.W. II (Such A Waste It Is),"Wow. While I enjoyed the first Saw, let me say this sequel was an utter disgrace. If its title were an anagram, as in my heading, it would be more honest. This movie was an exercise in shock video, not a horror film. Believe me, there is a difference. It looks like today's audiences have forgotten, or, judging by some poster's ages, never gotten the chance to experience, what a true horror film is.Some reviews which gave this high ratings said they did so because it had ""more movement"", was ""more gory and bloody"" and ""leaves it open for the next installment."" Well, none of those suggests a superior piece of cinema. The script was poor, editing was spastic, and the characters were absent. Even in this age of sequels, need we be reminded a 90 minute film is not an episode? This is a clumsily slapped together torture fest which is missing the mystery, the characterization, and the human element of the first. Horror needs pacing, buildup, and subtlety. Apparently, bloodshed, arguing, and a tacked on twist ending which made little sense scare people nowadays. And I haven't even delved into plot yet!In short, Saw II takes the could-be mystery and shines a light on it, takes the entities and blurs them, takes the audience and leads us by the hand to a ridiculous ending. Save your time and money, and watch some old horror on DVD instead.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Disturbingly Good,"Jigsaw (Tobin Bell), the methodical serial killer from Saw, is back! This time, he's pitted against a tough detective (Donnie Wahlberg), who must try to save his son and others from a house of horrors filled with deadly nerve gas, puzzles and death traps.Saw 2 is just as scary and suspenseful as the original. The death traps are very creative and some of the twists are unpredictable. The original Saw was a very suspenseful film that actually terrified its audience. The sequel is more or less the same except its much bloodier. Whether or not that's a good thing is entirely up to you but it was fine by me. There were more scary, over the top gory scenes in this film then in the original Saw. There were more characters as well and that kind of hurt the film since they were all one dimensional. Some of them didn't even share their story of why they were there. The acting was well not so good. That shouldn't be a surprise to anyone who has seen the original film.Tobin Bell probably gives the best performance as Jigsaw. This guy is defiantly very scary and very creepy. You see a lot more of him this time around so it made the film better. Donnie Wahlberg plays the detective who is trying to hunt down the people being tortured. He does a decent job though nothing special. Shawnee Smith plays Amanda and she also gives a decent performance. Everyone else was either too over the top or under performed. The worst was Beverley Mitchell but she's from 7th Heaven so that shouldn't be too much of a surprise. James Wan didn't direct this one and it shows. The original relied more on suspense to scare its audience while this one focuses more on disturbing scenes. There were disturbing scenes in Saw but that wasn't what the film was really about. So, the director for Saw 2 isn't as good as Wan. Also, the film is too short so the story feels rushed and its not as effective as it could have been. Like the original, it's hard to feel sorry for the characters because they do bad things and are so unlikable but that's just me. In the end, Saw 2 is a very gory and violent sequel that lives up to the original. Rating 8/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Enjoyably mean but the weak plot and lack of characters means it is a lesser beast than the original,"Having been taunted by twisted killer Jigsaw, Detective Eric Matthews cracks the clue that leads him directly to the hide-out where they capture the man himself. However Jigsaw directs Matthews' attention to a bank of monitors that show a group of people stuck in a locked house  one of whom is Matthews young son. The people in the house are breathing in a deadly nerve gas which will kill them in two hours, but they have the ability to solve puzzles to get out before then. While they try to solve the deadly puzzles, Matthews tries to break Jigsaw to find out where the house is.When Saw was a big success in the cinemas it was only a matter of time before a sequel was produced that tried to repeat the success all over again and duly this does feel like a film that has been produced to cash in. Of course this is not to say that it isn't any good but suffice to say that it doesn't quite match up the energy and tension of the first film. It does still produce the goods as a teenage style horror movie, with moments that made me cringe and look away all doing just enough to keep the film moving. Problem was more with the plot, which was never going to be as cool as the first film mainly because it couldn't be as simple and sharp. Instead we have a baggier and more contrived set up that doesn't work as well. The stuff with Matthews and Jigsaw doesn't really connect that well to the action in the house and, although part of the twist was reasonably clever, it did rather feel like it was more about setting up more sequels than producing a big impacting finish.The cast are mixed but limited by the material. Bell is good but, considering he is the heart of the story, he doesn't get much to do and is not as good a presence as he needed to be within the narrative (although the producers clearly feel the series doesn't need him so who am I to speak?). Wahlberg is cut off from the action and although he shouts well, he cannot develop the character that was needed in order to explain the plot and make the ending. The rest of the cast are so much filler and generally they run, shout, scream and die as required without doing much to make themselves stand out; basically when the most famous face is ""the guy from Speed"" then you know you are in trouble.Overall then this is an OK Hollywood horror movie that has a nice mean streak running through it from start to finish. The story is a bit weak and doesn't have the impact of the original, a problem not helped by the lack of good characters. Fans of the original will probably still like it but it is hard to ignore that this is much lesser product than the first film.",,Anonymous,Mystery
One of the best new-age horror/thriller flicks,"Jigsaw kidnaps a few unsuspecting 'criminals' along with the son of a detective. Having been unappreciative of their lives, the dying Jigsaw challenges the hostages to escape the house they are held in. The victims have two hours to find antidotes in order to escape a virus with which they are infected, involving deadly tasks and booby traps, as well as negotiating differences with their fellow-captives. Meanwhile Detective Matthews seeks to find where his son is being held through interrogating Jigsaw, the true colours of the cop coming out through the course of the film.Mixed within the depth of violence and suspense of the film lies juxtaposed moralistic messages and a superb plot that is increasingly rare in the genre in modern times. However, for some, the violence may be too much, indeed the processes of killing the subjects are ingenious but not in any way subtle. However, if you're going to watch Saw II, then it's unlikely that your shy of horror, and you'll get it in bucket-loads, as well as a twist at the end that is as good as any you'll see in cinemas today.Overall as a film Saw II is very good, it's entertaining, thou such a strong plot may have benefited from not seeming to want to rely so heavily on graphic violence. It probably won't go down as a classic and it's certainly not for everyone (don't rent it for the kids one night), but it's certainly one of the better 'scary' movies of recent times and worthy of a trip to the cinema or DVD store.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Saw too gruesome (but that's what we wanted!),"OK, I have to admit, I liked this sequel but had some problems with the gore factor.

better than the first in so many ways,"I went into the cinema the biggest saw sceptic imaginable and came out feeling like this was a worthy addition. Quite often I don't like sequels and I certainly wasn't looking forward to this. I was fully expecting a plot less gore fest but to my surprise it was a true psychological thriller. Although it wasn't as thought provoking as the first I believe that it got the message home much clearer and wasn't spoilt by bad acting, directing or scripting. I don't know where to begin but I found an attraction to some of the plot twists but again I believe a fault lies once again in the casting. A few of the characters were great whereas others made me wince in pain from the stereo-types. The burly 'thug' and the 'hard-ass chick' have to be two of the worst characters to ever brace a cinema and as per-usual were poorly acted out by no name stars. The directing at the start of the film was frustrating with the typical rapid camera fade but as it progressed it turned into slick movement from one scene to another with the right shots and timing. I'm going to keep it short... you may see 6 out of 10 a harsh rating given my positives but nothing in particular made me say 'this is great' but I certainly had a few negatives.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
It Will Blow You Away,"Why is it that so many critics, movie-goers and film patrons see such bold and unique forms of film as nothing but bloody and un-needed garbage? Isn't it about time to enter the age of the modern horror film, and to realize that audiences these days have already seen it all when it comes to the horror movie, so one-of-a-kind ideas such as the SAW series should be seen as a much needed godsend to the film industry. They say that this is what is takes to scare people these days: untrue. Take the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre for instance, upon close examination, one can notice that it is essentially a bloodless film. So what is it about such movies that scare us? Well, it's the idea, the cinematography, and the boldness to plant such a terrifying seed into the world of movies. It isn't a man sawing his foot off or a man being set on fire that scares audiences, it's the fact that it has NEVER...EVER been done before on the big screen that engulfs the audience into a trance-like cloak of fear over a movie. The people who conjure these ideas for movies are not on the mindset to create something for the SOLE PURPOSE of making someone cringe and fray, they want to be their own level, nay, rank of movies for others to, essentially, build off of. Are SAW and SAW II the last of their kind? By no means, if anything they are merely predecessors of the film noir that is going to eventually rise into the R-rated spectrum. Forgive me for not stressing on the movie's actual content, but I feel it is the very ideas behind SAW that make us have to see it for ourselves. And I highly recommend those of you skeptical about it to do so. Will you be frightened? Yes. Will you see things never before shined onto the screen? Yes. And will you leave the darkness of the theater in a sense that you have witnessed movie history unfold before your eyes? YES.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"A Lean, Mean Sequel","""Saw II"" wisely follows the simplest of rules to avoid the typical trappings of horror sequels. It keeps things simple.1. Take the originality of the concept in the first film and elaborate on it. The gruesome set-ups from the Jigsaw killer up the ante in every way from the first film. Here we get up not two people trapped in a nasty bathroom/basement and a single detective trying to crack the case, but a whole group or people trapped in a booby-trapped house and a whole swat team engaging in a face-off with the killer himself in a race against time.2. If you had a twist ending in the first film, through people off guard with added gore and violence and more characters, so that when you pull off yet another twist ending, people will still be slightly shocked.3. If what made the original so oddly endearing was a laughably bad lead performance (courtesy of Cary Elwes), play it straight and populate the film with the likes of ex-TV and pop-stars like Donnie Whalberg, Shawnee Smith, and that cute girl from 7th Heaven. Gone here is all the humor, and genre fans will feel redeemed from the bad acting of the first especially with all the bone-crunching, throat-slitting, head-exploding action on parade here.In the end, the film is leaner and meaner than the first, and all the better for it. Considering the rushed nature of the production, the low budget, and the natural tendency for sequels to horror/slasher flicks to totally suck, this one is godsend.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Nowhere near as great as the marvellous original,"Although this follow-up to the marvellous 2004 thriller 'Saw' is nowhere near as great as the original, it is still a good film worth watching.The ""Jigsaw"" killer plays another sick game with another unlucky group of people. They are placed in a booby-trapped house that is slowly filling up with a lethal nerve gas. They are doomed to die, unless they can find out what they have in common, complete various tasks in the house and find the antidote.Where the original film's gore could be forgiven on the account of its high logic, this lazy sequel is just gore for its own sake.

Sick and twisted,"If you think movies like Friday the 13th or Scream are exploitive then it would be wise to avoid this movie at all costs. Since lots of blood has slowly but surely become acceptable in the theatres it's the job of sick minds behind the camera to come up with new ways to shock audiences. In the 80's, heads were being lopped off, people were stabbed and what not, and it all just seemed to get old real fast. By the time the 90's came there were very few movies that actually tried to be creative or reinvent some of the old ideas; the hit Scream movies did this, and also a little movie called Se7en. The victims in Se7en were actually not-so-great of people and were more or less tortured to death by a killer who felt completely justified. Now, we have the Saw movies, and not only are they pushing the envelope, they're cutting it apart and setting it on fire. 20 years ago you'd have to find a movie like this in the pornography section with all the other Hammer films, but today it's number one at the box-office.The appeal is pretty clear: modern audiences aren't really shocked by simple killings anymore. Now we need to see people being tortured and mutilated to actually feel alive. What also helps is that aside from that, it is pretty absorbing. People like twists and turns, and Saw II is not too much unlike watching an episode of CSI. What is really interesting and grabbed my attention was the fact that this evil ""Jigsaw killer"" was not some superhuman zombie that kills senselessly, but an old man. An old man with cancer, at that! And he doesn't just randomly kill, he hand-picks his victims, and really takes time to think his sadistic plans through. A sick mind proves to be more dangerous than any machete, which is pretty frightening.Saw II was not really much better or worse than the first one. It's bigger: there's more characters, much more blood, but probably an equal amount of twists. Personally, I prefer the first Saw. It had that indie film charm, where it's just these two guys in a room with a puzzle to solve. The game in Saw II plays out as less of a puzzle, more of a fun-house of horrors. Just like the first, there is a final ""end twist."" It was more believable than the first film's twist but not as scary or shocking.I like to think I'm fairly desensitized to movie violence, but I'll admit that Saw II had me cringing at more than a few points. So for all intents and purposes, Saw II's verdict is: mission accomplished. My only concern is wondering where we'll find horror/gore films in the next ten years. How far can you go?My rating: 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Same material, Different approach","This movie was similar to the first Saw in that it had the same style of plot (the killer is the same person, victims must save themselves, the internal conflicts of the film deal with familial problems), but this time instead of two main victims (Dr. Gordon & Adam), there are many- eight or nine victims I believe. This increase in the number of victims warrants a different approach to the material; there are more victims to kill off, so naturally there will be a higher body count, less character depth, and more of a focus on the ways in which people are killed rather than why the lives of these characters are worth saving. Although the first film heavily emphasized its desire to get creative with blood and guts, it functioned as more of a character sketch than this film does. I feel like I know a lot about Dr. Gordon and Adam, but I can't even remember the names of the characters in this movie, give or take a few. This movie is much more of an exercise in bloody visual effects- it doesn't care about its characters like the original Saw does. Its primary function is to gross the audience out- and that's just fine for a 'halloween' movie. I would say that I appreciated the first film more, just because I liked getting to know the characters better (although it is nice that we get to know John a bit better in this film). There are some creative gory sequences in this film, but they are no more creative than the kills in the first film. Therefore, I would say that while this film is not as good as the original Saw, it is still worth seeing if you're looking for some blood and guts in your movies.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Disappointed with this one.,"I am a huge fan of the original Saw movie. Saw II was the movie that I was most looking forward to this year. After seeing it tonight I'm sad to say it was very disappointing.I found this movie to be more of a standard horror than the exciting thriller that Saw was. Sure lots of people were killed, but in nowhere as such a spectacular form as the original Saw movie.The twist wasn't that great either. In no way did it compare to the amazing twist of the original Saw movie.I was expecting to give this a rating of 10/10 after hearing such great user comments, but having just seen it I would rate it as an average movie.

Saw II is everything Saw 1 should have been .. and more!,"I just got back from the midnight screening of the film and I must say -- It was an OK movie.Most of all the cool ""deaths"" were already shown in either clips or on television... but the main highlight of the movie was the conversation between Eric Mathews and Jigsaw himself. You find out a lot more about him then what you think. You find out what makes him tick. Of course, it's not as Gory as what people are telling you, it's just a marketing scam.. However, there IS much more blood then Saw 1.The ending... Grabs you by the hair and kicks you square in the nuts!.And you know when they said they'd revisit some ""old friends?"" oh yes.. they do :) Darren Bousman definitely has a film career on his hands and I hope he goes far with it because the man has talent.I can clearly see SAW becoming the next ""Horror"" franchise.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Excellent sequel,"Actually I went to see this movie without any expectations at all. And I was not disappointed. I saw the first one (did you get that SAW) and was totally surprised by, the fact that, you never know what is going to happen.

They didn't it is surprising where you never thought it would be and at some points you think you have it figured out... but you haven't.

A Worthy Sequel,"It doesn't quite live up to the original, but it's a decent enough continuation. It's more of the same but it doesn't feel like it's more of the same.
There are enough throwbacks to the original film to make this a rewarding viewing experience as opposed to most horror franchises with films written and produced entirely independent of each other.
One thing the first two entries in this franchise did really well was paying attention to the minor plot details. There are a lot of loose ends left in the dark corners of this story that are all resolved satisfactorily by the end.
And this film ends in such a way that I'm genuinely interested and excited to see what comes next. Very well done.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Doesn't have the same ""cutting edge"" as the first ""Saw"" :)","Well, finally after months of waiting, I saw ""Saw 2"". Everyone told me that it was a lot better than the first, so I expected a whole lot considering that I enjoyed the first very much. Well, I did enjoy ""Saw 2"" over all, it had good suspense and kept me interested. But I think it did loose it's originality and I felt empty at the ending. A lot of moments I found to be very pointless or like the director only used it just as a way to get the gore. Like the group being locked in a room together, now for those who haven't seen the film first, it does all come together, but I'm going to say that the violence did seem unrealistic and the reactions were either a little late or early. I don't know, lucky enough I haven't been in a situation like that, so maybe I'm just jumping to conclusions. But there were some very awesome twists and turns, along with the acting, it was worth a watch. I just didn't feel the same excitement as I did with the first one. But I would recommend it for a watch.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"The game continues, and just as disturbing if not as puzzling","Finally saw all the 'Saw' films prior to seeing 'Jigsaw' (as part of my wanting to see as many 2017 films as possible this year, during a quieter and less intensive period). Heard a lot about the films, good and bad, but wanted to see them for myself to know what to expect.The films as an overall series are a very mixed bag. The original 'Saw' had a great premise and while it was problematic it was still pretty good and one of the best in the series. Its first sequel is one of its few follow-ups to be just as good and contain what made its predecessor click as well as it did and, while it is full of its own problems, it is one of the better sequels by quite some way. It is very easy to see why people will dislike it, and the 'Saw' films in general, and no it is not because of the full throttle horror-like elements that are not for the faint hearted.'Saw II's' story is just as weak in the dialogue, here quite cheesy, half-baked and repetitive as well as at times rambling and sometimes irrelevant. Actually it's worse, at least the dialogue in the first 'Saw' had some tightness and intrigue, even if they didn't come consistently. The credibility lapses here are just as numerous and just as big, although the character behaviour here doesn't frustrate as much, nothing as bad as that for Danny Glover's character.Its twists are not as bold and are uneven in execution. Some of them are very clever and devilish, like the apprehending of Jigsaw, didn't see that one coming. Others are plain stupid and pretty predictable. The ending is a let-down, instead of the shocking one of the original this one was hideously contrived. The characters, other than Jigsaw and Eric, are basically cliché-ridden filler and are either bland, irritating or both.However, really liked that 'Saw II' was visually more elaborate and slicker than the production values of the first with much tighter, more audacious and more professional-looking editing. Even if one does miss somewhat the effectively claustrophobic feel. The music is eerily unsettling.Despite its ridiculousness, the story is also edge-of-your-seat and highly atmospheric. A lot of it delights and disturbs, with some truly imaginative traps and uncompromisingly brutal demises. The novelty has not worn off yet. The direction is serviceable and once again Jigsaw's modus operandi, impulse and justification sets him apart from most characters of his type.Saying that Donnie Wahlberg is a huge improvement over Cary Elwes is saying a lot, really not that hard to be better and one would have to be bottom of the barrel SyFy/The Asylum-level to be worse. Tobin Bell is terrifying as one of the most iconic villains of the past twenty years or so (or at least to me). Apart from Franky G the actors don't fare shabbily.In short, very uneven but for a horror sequel not bad at all. 6/10 Bethany Cox",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"More of 'Saw', only not as good.","Despite it's massive over acclaim, extremely poor acting and MTV-style direction, the original 'Saw' was quite a good film. It's good points included a tight and thrilling storyline, some great ideas and a twist that worked through its amazingly simple surprise element. The sequel, on the other hand, feels like writer Leigh Whannell simply jotted a few ideas down on a scrap of toilet paper after hearing of the success of his first movie. The traps here aren't nearly as imaginative, the twist is simply thrown in at the end, the characters are clichéd in the extreme; and the 'drama' surrounding the central character and his son is boring, underdone and impossible to care for. Leigh Whannell, basically, does a terrible job of making the audience care about what happens; but luckily for Saw 2; the style is there, and this is the film's saving grace. The under wrought plot follows a trap-laden house full of people. They're inhaling a deadly toxin, and the antidote is hidden somewhere in the house. If you weren't already excited enough about that, you'll also be glad to know that there's the 'estranged son' subplot, which is ham-fistedly worked into the film.Even though Saw 2's bad points outnumber it's good ones, I still hesitate to call this a truly bad film. For what it is, Saw 2 is an enjoyable movie. It's not on for long, so the stretched plot line doesn't quite run out of steam before the final credits; and there are enough characters in the film to ensure that there's always another death scene on the horizon. The characters, however, are the film's main downfall. While we cared about the two characters in the first film because we were plugged into their plight; here, we're bombarded with far too many all at once, and this makes it very difficult to care what happens to any of them. The fact that they're all clichéd doesn't exactly help either. Tobin Bell stands out amongst a cast of nobodies; but really, he's just on autopilot. The simplistic plot does a pretty good job of hiding the fact that this is a very shallow movie; as does the dark styling throughout. Director Darren Lynn Bousman does a decent enough job of enforcing the macabre element of the film in every scene, and Saw 2 does have a very repulsive edge to it. On the whole, if you liked the original Saw; you'll probably like this one too. It's not a great movie, and most will probably come out of it feeling a little cheated; but I would say that it's almost worth seeing.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Gruesome and Thought-Provoking Sequel,"Saw 2 is the second installment in the successful Saw horror franchise, directed by Darren Lynn Bousman in 2005. The film follows eight people who wake up in a locked room, strapped to various devices. Jigsaw, a mysterious serial killer, gives them 60 minutes to kill each other, or they will all die.Saw 2 is true to the spirit of the first film, offering the same level of brutality and terror. The film is full of violent scenes that may be too intense for sensitive viewers. On the other hand, Saw 2 is also a very thoughtful and thought-provoking film. Jigsaw's games are more than just sadistic torture, but also an exploration of human nature and morality.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Amanda didn't have to say 'she'd played the game before.',"None of the others would have known who Amanda was. If she was simply acting and pretending she was as terrified as the rest of them,don't you all think it was unnecessary to say 'I survived his game before'. It seems that she only mentioned it for the audience. People watching would probably assume she was making reference to the first film but if she was in on it the whole time why does it matter? My guess is that she was enjoying fooling the others and being a little egotistical, she wanted to come across as the experienced one who knew more than the others. She did seem braver and more composed just because she had gone through the experience the first time.

I loved the way they are leaving it open for a third installment. Donnie Wahlberg delivered the goods a a COP. That dude from 24 was good as JIGSAW. He was so intelligent yet very evil.

Movie shouldn't have made it past the first 10 minutes.,"Nothing past the first 10 minutes of this movie should have happened. I'll sum it up quickly so you can get on with your life.A bunch of people are in a house. They are locked in and the same deadly nerve agent that was used in the Japanese subways is poisoning them. The doors are elaborate and cannot be used as an exit. But the windows are WEAKLY boarded up. They have plenty of tools to either go through the windows, or if those are barred, to punch through the wall. It doesn't take superhuman strength to break through plaster and bricks. It just takes a brain. They had 2 hours to punch through the wall and get to a hospital.Do that and the movie ends.And that is just an example of what all ""victims"" suffer in this series. They follow the rules given by this merely condescending and quite stupid villain. The victims NEVER think outside the box. They never search for traps. A trap might find them though. They know it's a trap, but they do the obvious thing anyway, knowing that it will kill them. How stupid do Bousman and Whannell think we are??? The victims NEVER think. For ONCE I would like someone to anticipate the tripwire and freaking STEP OVER IT!!!!!!!! AND STILL GET KILLED!!!! A good horror/suspense movie doesn't demand that they escape. It just demands intelligently thought out writing. You people who give this movie good ratings standards are way too low.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Its Very Violent and Gory,but Not as Scary,","Saw 2 is a better than average movie with a promising storyline that just didn't turn out as good as it seemed.I did enjoy the dialog between Donnie Wahlberg and Tobin Bell,but the scenes with everyone stuck in the booty trapped room set up by Jigsaw was terrible,the dialog and acting was very mediocre and it mostly relied on gore.It is definitely more gory than the first Saw,a bit too gory for me,the way everyone is killed is just disgusting and graphic.The movie also wasn't as frightening as the first Saw and the story didn't have a build up as exciting as the original.I also didn't like how we didn't get to see much of the Jigsaw puppet and the direction isn't as dark (the director is different) as the first.Saw 2 is very gruesome,but its not very scary,if your a fan of the first you should still check it out,mainly because of Donnie Wahlberg and Tobin Bells impressive performances and a very unexpected twist,but you will be overall disappointed.The Jigsaw Killer has kidnapped the son of cop Eric Matthews.Jigsaw gets Eric to talk to him while his son and many others try to survive.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
It was beautiful and attractive,"""Areh 2"" is the first and last sequel of ""Ademizadi"" of this series. ""Saw 2"" is the boundary that separates the realism and controlled structure of the first part from the unrestrainedness of the subsequent sequels. So here we are with a movie that, although it is more reminiscent of the first part, but also contains an effect of the brainless sequels that followed. As the director of this episode, Darren Lane Boseman and his team in ""Saw 2"" go for the same familiar sequel formula: make everything many times bigger! All the components of the first part are multiplied by 4 here. If the first part was only about its violent scenes, this part welcomes open blood and gore and skulls pierced by spiked sticks and eyes blown out by magnum bullets and watching a human being torn apart in a furnace in detail and much more. It goes away. If most of the time of the first film took place only in a limited bathroom, this film has expanded the new jigsaw game to the extent of a large multi-storey house. If the first film revolved around two victims, this one is about a group of eight (with the return of Amanda Young) who wake up in a haunted house. If Jigsaw only appears for a few minutes in the first episode, he is the center of attention in this film. Saw 2 may have lost things by going bigger, but it also gained things in return. As a result, we are dealing with one of the few sequels that has its own unique features.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"A horribly rushed, pointless cash-in.","'Oh yes, there will be blood,' Jigsaw promises.Well about a tea-cup's worth if you're lucky. 'There will be boredom' or ""There will be headaches"" would be more appropriate tagline for this absolutely worthless, mess of a sequel. After the surprisingly great and successful original, Lionsgate immediately green-lit this movie for production and completion within less than a year. Exactly how good can a film be with such a short production schedule? The answer is not very good at all. In fact it's downright awful.Jigsaw has returned to teach ironic lessons to those who live dull lives yet are not truly alive. Only this time he attracts the attention of a half-crazed cop (oh wait, he did that last time as well) who is so thoroughly incompetent at his job that you'll want to jump into the movie and throttle him. Jigsaw has locked a bunch of strangers in a spooky old house with nerve gas slowly killing them. He gives them loads of clues on how to escape but since they are all idiots, none of them work together and their utter stupidity only serves to force the lumbering plot along and lead to their well deserved deaths.It's not just the bad script that kills the film, after all great filmmakers can make brilliance out of a rotten screenplay. It's the very poor editing, urine-soaked cinematography, incoherent pacing, and dumb characters that cripple the film beyond repair. First-time director Darren Lynn Bousman isn't exactly Uwe Boll, but his lack of experience behind the camera gives this entire film an amateurish, hack feel.Wahlberg's clichéd stereotype Detective is right out of a bad, 80s, bottom shelf Cop video and the people stuck in the poisonous house are just morons. The first Saw worked so well because we only had 2 victims who conversed and worked with/against each other for the whole film. We had a stronger attachment to them. And they looked for logical ways out before resorting to the painful. This time we get loads more victims with little explanation on who they are or what importance they have and they just never use their common sense.Another thing that bogs this sequel down even more is its total reliance on condescending to the audience. Any average movie goer could figure the best way out of most of the booby-traps and death scenarios but these stupid characters just do the dumbest things so they can get killed and so film offers up another corpse for us to scream at. But not even this works. Some guy climbs into a big oven (only a retard would do this in a horror film) and is burned alive. But we don't even see anything! And when he tries to pull himself out, not only is he not even burnt, but he just dies for no apparent reason. So his feet got burnt a bit, big deal! If their were no swearing in this film, it would be a PG-13 all the way. Don't expect any of the bone-chilling scares you got first time around.The only thing that stops Saw II from being a complete failure is the interesting, if incredibly stupid, plot twist. But is it worth suffering 90 minutes for? I would only recommend this film if you expect it to be crap, have lowered your expectations extremely far and obviously if you have the time and money to waste on it.Overall this is a disgrace to the original. Oh and said Saw only appears for about a second and half.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Ouch...no pun intended.,"The singular star should speak for itself...but to justify my vote would only be fair. First, the technical aspects of this ""film,"" which I liken to a bad NYPD Blue episode and a made for TV movie, are stunningly awful. Poor editing and poor cinematography make for an unintentionally distracted feel to the film, one that does not serve any purpose besides annoyance. Morever, the lighting simply didn't achieve the same effect it did in Saw, nor was it conducive to the tense atmosphere it hoped to engender. Secondly, the script and dialogue was painful to the point that I found myself cringing with each spoken word, rather than the acts of violence and display of gore. Now arises the question: With an improved script, would the acting improve? And the answer is: No. The acting was as awful, if not more so, than the script itself! It seemed to be truly made-for-TV quality. Finally, the plot, the horribly predictable plot... Each line (as if read from a teleprompter) can be predicted beforehand as can the opening scene and ending scene and every scene in between. Not once did I find myself with sweaty palms or a tight throat, simply because I knew everything that would happen, the entire 93 minutes (this should be a clue as to the production of the film).

I give this movie credit for separating itself a bit from part one.I had a big problem with Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) and his traps. I didn't have a problem with him being a nut job with the brilliance enough to set such elaborate and deadly traps, I had a problem with him being an engineer, medical scientist, AS WELL as a psychology expert so as to know exactly what people would do in certain situations. I generally have a problem with movies that have a genius that sets up traps that rely on people doing precisely what they predicted they would do. People are not machines, they are human hence there are too many variables--no matter how many psychology classes you have taken you can never predict exactly what a person is going to do.So, not only are Jigsaw's traps engineered to perfection, he has also perfectly predicted what his victims will do.

Where Gore Meets Bore,"Where does bore meet gore? Well, yes--in the 2000 election, sure. But also in SAW 2, arguably the worst horror movie of all time. Taking a stride from its predecessor, SAW 2 contains similarly enormous plot holes and an uninteresting group of foolish characters whom we care little or nothing about.But the worst part of both saw 1 and 2 is Jigsaw.Jigsaw, as a character, is the most self-indulgent movie device since the Cube in ""Cube,"" and not half as clever. He's self-righteous, childish and shallow. It's like being kidnapped by a seven-year-old who's crying because she didn't get a candy bar from you at the cash register.In short, this film is designed for persons as self-serving and dull as Jigsaw himself.This might seem a minor point, but it must be remembered that everything that gets put on screen gets glorified in the process. Case study for this is Beavis and Butt-Head, a show making fun of stupid teens that became vastly popular with.....yup, stupid teens. Consider, then, what SAW and SAW 2 glorify: sadism, selfishness and Pharisaic homicide.'Nuff said, I hope.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery

S10 Reviews: Saw 2 (2005),"The game: six seemingly unrelated people are thrown in a dilapidated house with two hours to figure out how to get the antidote to the poison gas that has infected them. Only a detective with a major stake in the action can unravel the mystery. The jigsaw is back and his game is even more intricate and twisted this go around in this sequel to the highly successful sequel to the 2004 highly imaginative original.I deliberately avoided reading stuff about the flick (thanks to an incident on the Horror board last year that revealed the twist of the original) so I would enjoy this one hopefully more. It would be hard to replicate the original since the cat's out of the proverbial bag and the novel approach to Saw (2004) was unrepeatable. But the filmmaker's do a good job continuing the story of the first one. The games are more intricate and the action is bloodier. The look of the film is pretty much the same as the original, dirty and grimy. The grit and grain cover the whole canvas which adds to the action. They did go a bit overboard with the choppy editing (especially in the final reel) but that's the brakes. The acting is pretty strong with several recognizable faces: Donnie Wahlberg, Dina Meyer with Shawnee Smith and Tobin Bell returning from the original. The action gets pretty intense at times and some of the death traps are pretty gnarly (ugh, needles) and to no surprise there was a twist ending (supposedly five endings were shot to hide the true ending) and could spin this into a full blown franchise.In short this is a fine sequel and if you're a fan you will dig it. It channels many things from the original so that would be a wise place to start but if you've not seen you could probably see this one.3/5 or 7/10",,Anonymous,Mystery
"Blood, guts, and...well, what more do you expect from a Saw film?","Good movie. The experience was enjoyable, even if I did end up with several easily grossed out girls behind me. If you don't mind the gory, it's a good watch. Lovely to watch on a Halloween evening. However, if you like being shocked, and/or go to a ""horror"" or ""slasher"" flick to be frightened, this movie is not the greatest (for that), as I found it to be rather predictable. I saw all but one thing coming, course, I would say I'm pretty decent at guessing movies. I can't say if it is or isn't an improvement over Saw. I would say I lean towards the first film, as this, sadly, kinda turned into the teen slasher type flick, complete with stereotypical characters -- something that tends to bug me, but this movie had more blood and guts to it. I think Saw had a much stronger concentration on the psychological factors than this one did. (Sorry, psych major in me talking.)Either way, the film really makes you think...and cringe...",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
What a brilliant film!!,I watched the first one at home on a rented DVD and thought it was the most gruesome but gripping scary film i'd ever seen (and i've seen plenty!!) so goodness knows why i chose to go to the cinema for the second one!! I was terrified from beginning to end because what an opening scene and did not see the twist coming at all and I'm usually quite good at guessing the endings of films!! Who thinks up the kind of deaths in these films???...Yuk!! They must not be able to sleep at night because i know i couldn't for about a week after watching it! I would recommend this film highly to anyone who likes a good gruesome horror but with mind games keeping you guessing right to the end!!,9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Sometimes you just want it to end!,Saw 2 had the potential to be great. It had fantastic concepts and plenty of blood and guts. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time but I still left feeling a little cheated. What was the point of Dina Meyers character? To bore the hell out of me! She brought nothing to the movie and was a waste of time. In my point of view the director successfully scared me but underestimated my ability to look beyond the gore. For example not being able to get out of the house..get real! You could fall out the windows. Being stupid and falling for every request..I know lets climb into the oven and get the serum. Stupid! The ending also wrecked it for me. You are telling me that this serial freak blood lusting murderer had a soft side. Comon!,6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"To Me It Was Ho Hum , Nothing Special and  I Was Not Scared","I thought the original was better. This one, well, I wasn't scared, and just thought it was dumb---the characters, especially this big muscle goof played by Franky G, nice to look at, but I cannot understand his speech. This boy needs to speak clearly and stop posturing. I was not impressed by the plot, the acting or the storyline. I preferred the original Saw. That movie was more suspenseful and had way better acting and believability than Saw II. This is just pure junk. I cannot agree with some other reviewers here who praise this as the greatest horror and thriller movie. I was not horrified and I was very, very far from being thrilled. A disappointment with lousy acting--by all the actors. Junk.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Must See,"Saw II is not as good as the original, but boy, is it still a ride. All of the surprises and twists of the first installment cannot be topped, but they sure try. The traps are not so threatening as before and the story no more stronger.The actors were at most decent this time around. There was no gritty feel to them, but the scenery more than makes up for that.Why a high score? Because all in all it made my pulse rise, my palms sweat, and my eyes want to shut while all the while screaming for more. See this movie if not for the story, but for the ride and the nice twist at the end.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Second Is the Last Good One,"The first Saw movie was a very nice surprise and a suspenseful one too, the twists epic. Anyway, Saw II is in my opinion a decent sequel and the last entry to the franchise that you should put on your watch list (if you don't know the movie yet). After Saw II the whole franchise fell more or less apart (especially the stories), of course, still with some nice ideas of killing scenes here and there.

Absolutely Awful,"Saw the original was great and the ending was the icing on the cake. We all loved it and couldn't wait for the sequel.However, Saw 2 is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. No creativity, no intricate puzzles, no suspense and no getting to know the characters. I just couldn't wait for this movie to be over. I don't know who wrote or directed the original or the sequel but I assume not one person from the first worked on the second.I'm sorry to say that again, Hollywood has capitalized off a great first movie by pulling down their pants, bending over and squeezing out a second. Everyone involved in this movie should be ashamed of themselves. I could have made a better sequel with $2.25 and 2 migrant day laborers.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
okay movie,"this movie was okay.... the only thing that really bothered me was the outright stupidity of all the characters involved... Jigsaw keeps blatantly saying ""just listen to me"" ""the answers are there for you to figure out"" and all these stupid people do is argue with each other...throw tantrums and go rogue on each other...the stupidity just drove me crazy... all the characters in the house had to do was compare notes and they would have gotten out alive in 10 minutes... instead they all died... most of them killing each other morons.the acting was fine... the traps most of which were pretty cool and inventive... i would just like to have seen characters who had a mentality greater then that of a 7 year old on time out.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Saw II = entertaining,"Man, I love the two Saw films. It's because I'm a sucker for twist endings, basically. Twist endings are my favorite. I like to be blown away by something that was right in front of me the whole time, but I still managed to overlook it. It's a little bit like magic. The magician misdirects your attention while performing a secret move that you don't notice. The only difference is that with a twist ending, they're like ""Look at this secret move I did while you weren't looking, earlier. Awesome, huh?"" and then I'm like ""Wow, that was awesome."" Anyway, in addition to having a twist ending, the first Saw was quite original. Taking place almost entirely in a bathroom, with the two main characters chained to the walls and still managing to be engaging was impressive and not something that had been done too many times before. Phone Booth, a movie which takes place almost entirely in a phone booth, is reminiscent of the first Saw.The second Saw, the one I'm supposed to be reviewing, is more mainstream horror/thriller. It takes place in a house, where eight people have been placed and are breathing in a terrible virus. Jigsaw (the killer, played by Tobin Bell) has placed antidotes in various places in the house. Also, there are a bunch of traps everywhere and they kill people, sometimes. Plus, there's a twist ending! The acting is pretty OK, nothing too fancy and that's goes for the entire film, I'd say. It's not an amazing example of exquisite film-making. It is, however, terribly entertaining. If you liked the first Saw, it's likely that you will like this one. If, however, you cannot stand gore, you probably won't like this film. If you dislike horror movies, rejoice, because the two Saw films would fit into the genre ""very bloody action/adventure"".",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"If you expected the typical dull sequel, you'll be surprised","After watching Saw II, I was trying to think if I had seen a better sequel in the history of horror movies, and I couldn't come up with one. Not that horror movie sequels are very stiff competition, given the shortcomings of sequels from Halloween, A Nightmare of Elm Street and Friday the 13th. However, this is one of the few sequels in ANY genre that could actually survive as a stand-alone film on its own merits.Saw II somehow manages to maintain the same edge-of-your-seat suspense and action of the original, while inserting totally new characters, new ""games"" and yes, new twists, particularly at the end. As usual, Jigsaw's tape recordings are always providing the viewer little clues about the terror ahead.While the editing sometimes gives the movie an unnaturally high-energy atmosphere at times, and while the gore is probably very excessive and unnecessary, Saw II avoids the trap that most sequels fall into: a lame and boring plot lacking substance and new ideas. Saw II carries the same jolt of creativity of the first one, while leaving the viewer with plenty of optimism for what a third movie might look like.Highly recommended.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Jigsaw Gave every body the misdirection,"Whether or not Saw II was better than the original, that doesn't matter Saw II can stand on its own. I consider it more of a continuation than sequel.

I know Jigsaw is my boy for life. he gave everybody the okie-dok. i remember seeing the Saturday after it came and i immediately called my brother, who is excited to see the movie, and i told him you got to see this movie. I must admit though that a couple parts may be a little cheesy but that can be overlooked. I know the acting was a lot better.

Very - very - bad.,"In short: This film is one of the worst I've ever seen.

The characters were authentic and interesting, the story was plausible (considering the overall strangeness of it, of course). The script of SAW 2 is very, very poor, the acting extremely (!) poor and the few plots tried for are in any way totally incoherent with the rest of the story line. I think of it as deeply insulting.

"A FANTASTIC FEROCIOUS SEQUEL, my fave of the franchise!!!!","Easily the best film of the franchise!!! This sequel does up the sick & twisted games & bloodshed & it's so much fun!!!Saw 2 is a full bloodied, sick 'n' twisted serial killer mystery Thriller. A gory & grimy shocker than truly beats the first film & is the best film in the franchise. Saw 2 is like a grimy & grim Grindhouse film, just made in modern times.I mean its sick & horrific to be honest & some scenes are hard to watch, but it's a nail-biting thriller that keeps you on edge.I love the big old building that the entire film is set within & it gives a sense of claustrophobic invironment & an intense mood. All the traps & trials are brutally twisted such as the most disturbing one here the ""Needle Pit"" a shocking sequence, a great twisted Gory as hell Horror-Thriller with a good solid cast & the always good on screen Donnie Wahlberg, i like this dude as an actor & yes he's such much like his brother Mark lol but Donnie has become a more B-movie actor than a big movie star like Mark & he's always good to watch & usually pops up as a Detective in many flicks, he starred as a scene stealing Detective in James Wan's AWESOME atmospheric Horror Dead Silence. Here he's a troubled cop on the edge & plays his role perfectly, in fact Donnie is very impressive in his role & is a more capable & more realistic cop than Glovers ""Tapp"" in the first film.The rest of the cast of familiar faces are all fine in their small roles.An excellent sequel & genuinely a well made, well filmed Flick & a great follow-up to the Cult Classic original. There's a thick layer of grime all over this films cinematography. Sickly green & mouldy browns are the main colour pallet & a raw grit is present too.Like with alot of sequels i prefer over the original, this is the case here with Saw 2.Like, Final Destination 2 is way better than the first film in my opinion & Predator 2 & Ghostbusters 2 & Gremlins 2 among others.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Safe and Sound,"Greetings again from the darkness. The second in ""Saw"" series has many more victims involved - this time some outside the game. First time director (and co-writer) Darren Lynn Bousman teams up with Leigh Whannell (from the first one) to try and take the series to the next level of evil.Returning are (the always juicy) Tobin Bell as John/Jigsaw, Dina Meyer as the detective (Dina - time to take your career out of horror films)and Shawnee Smith who returns as Amanda. Adding some punch to this one is Donnie Wahlberg who is always solid as the almost normal, quietly off-center cop. Also among those added to the mix are Glenn Plummer (the guy with the dog in ""The Day After Tomorrow"") and Beverly Mitchell (from the recently canceled ""7th Heaven"").The same formula is used, but we have more desperate types in this one.

I have to say even though I was supposed to hate him, I enjoyed his character as much as jigsaw's character. I however didn't like that they didn't give reasons why some of the people were there. I also like donnie, but that could be because I favor people from the boston area. So over all I say go see it.

"Slick, Sick and Quick","It seems that a 'Saw' sequel was always on the cards before the release of the original in October of 2004. The original surprised many people, as it was complex, intricate and full of suspense. As well as grossing over $100 Million on a meagre budget of only a million dollars. 'Saw II' ups the ante, not in terms of tension, but blood and gore.Not many months have passed after Jigsaw's test in the last film and this time he has taken a turn for the worse. He is in a warehouse rigged up to a drip. Detective Matthews and Kerry discover the location of Jigsaw's most recent test, that takes place at the start of the film. The person that is involved in the test that Jigsaw addresses through a video tape is what he calls ""an informant, a rat, a snitch. I call you unworthy of the body you possess, of the life that you've been given."" Jigsaw informs him that the device that he is wearing, is hooked up to his neck and when the time expires will encase his head, effectively killing him. ""Think of it like a Venus fly trap"" As opposed to the first film, where at least half of the victims survived, this one does not. Eric Matthews investigates the scene and comes to the conclusion that this is once again the work of Jigsaw. Eric's son Daniel is disobedient and in trouble with the police on a regular basis. Matthews' finds Jigsaw's location and realises a terrible truth, his son is currently in a test of his own with several others. The house is filled with toxic gas and only antidotes scattered throughout the house, via completing the traps offer the gift of life. Daniel and the other victims must work together if they are to survive the next two hours. Meanwhile, Matthews' interrogates Jigsaw in the hope of figuring out the location of the toxic gas house, before the time expires.The most apparent element about 'Saw II' is that the characters apart from Eric Matthews and Jigsaw have no character development, a lack of motivation and are atrociously acted. Jigsaw is the best element of 'Saw II' because we are provided with a larger background of his character. We now know that he is a cancer patient, with not long left to live. This partially explains why he does what he does. He wants other people to appreciate what life they have got left to live. Still, I'm sure there is a more effective way than putting people in traps. He must have spent his entire pension on the mechanical devices themselves. Don't ask. Now he is able to perform surgical operations on his victims. We as an audience are not supposed to think too deeply, it is after all a horror sequel.The main attraction to the gore thirsty faithful is the variety of deadly traps and how they play out. Apart from the aforementioned Venus Fly Trap and the needle pit, there is little ingenuity and invention on display here. Even if some of the other traps do display an amount of this, it is cancelled out by how stupid the characters are. Jigsaw gives his victims instructions and they fail to carry them out, yet the answer is right in front of their face!The films length is just over 84 minutes which helps 'Saw II' substantially. It never becomes too dull and a short runtime means that it is not painful to watch. At least for people who like gore and nice little twists at the end to keep them occupied.'Saw II' is nowhere near the terror of the nightmare inducing original, regarding clever plot nuances and depth of character. It provides fans with higher levels of blood and gore, but a lack of tension almost undoes its impact completely. For fans of blood filled horrors though, what is on offer here may be more than satisfactory.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
I'm shocked--a GOOD horror film sequel!,"""Saw"" was one of last year's best horror films--grim, brutal, no stupid jokes and VERY dark. I expected the worst when I heard a sequel was coming. I was shocked to find it just as disturbing as the original.The film opens right up with a young guy trapped in a mask-like creation. There are spikes all over it--but he has the key. Problem is it's embedded BEHIND his eye and he has to cut his eye to get it out! He's been put here by Jigsaw--a serial killer who punishes people for things they do wrong.It involves a bunch of people that Jigsaw has trapped in a house together. There seems to be no way out--and a deadly poison is being pumped through the air vents. If they don't get out in two hours they'll die. But Jigsaw tells them there IS a way out--they just have to find it for themselves with obscure clues he gives...and there are multiple, gory booby traps they have to watch for...Meanwhile the police HAVE Jigsaw and try to get him to reveal where the house is...Sounds like another stupid horror film but, like the first film, there's no humor and the killings are brutal and bloody. It also tells us the back story of Jigsaw and why he's doing all this. It brings up questions of morality--Jigsaw is doing this for a reason--but what gives him the right to torture people? It makes you think and, at the same time, you're trying to figure out the clues Jigsaw keeps giving the people to get out. It all comes together at the end and throws in multiple clever plot twists that I didn't see coming.Be warned--this is a bloody, brutal film but VERY well-made and disturbing. I walked out of the theatre shaken and thinking about the questions the film brought up. There are no easy answers. I hope there's a third movie as good as this! I give it an 8 only because it's not really a movie you enjoy...",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Saw II (2005),"A surprisingly effective sequel. Keeps much of the atmosphere from the first and just increases the gore and horror aspects. This time a number of people are in a house, one of those being the son of police officer Donnie Wahlberg. Watching Wahlberg and Bell's back and forth is a lot of fun, and adds a stark contrast to the gore. Unfortunately a rather 4th rate cast must carry the film and don't seem up to the task at times. It tries to create a claustrophobic atmosphere, like that of Cube and the first Saw, but characters change dramatically in the blink of an eye. It's too focused on furthering the plot towards its bloody conclusion, rather than having believable relationships. But for those that love gore, with a little bit of character, this certainly delivers.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Saw? Seen......sorry!,"Well, here we go yet again. No doubt this movie or should I say this type of movie really does have its followers...age in range of about 10 to 16. For those of us with serious tastes for horror, suspense and the macabre, this ain't it. Let's face a few facts of life, OK? Everything, and I mean just about everything has been done, especially when it comes to splatter and slice and dice. The original ""Texas Chainsaw"" is certainly much more suspenseful and horrific primarily because it follows a basic rule: only imply what's happening, don't actually show it. Alfred Hitchock made ""Psycho"" that way as well. Always merely suggest what's behind the door but never really define it. The human mind is so much more adept at creating its own horrors and fears than whatever a special effects guy or makeup artist is capable of creating. When it's all out in the open, basically, the surprise is over with and you merely have to sit through another hour or so and just wait it out. This film is yet another example of how contemporary writers, directors and producers come up with another ""cash in"" scheme of a picture and then it disappears, except on home video.

i want my $7.50 back,"The only credit I will give this movie is that it is better than the first one. Anyone who has seen the first one knows that is not saying much. The acting is not nearly as bad as the first, however it is hardly believable. I will give these C and B actors some credit, they didn't have much to work with. The script dialog sounds like it was written by a high school student. A movies plot shouldn't have to be believable...thats Hollywood, but the way the people act and react to situations needs to feel real in order to let the viewer into the characters. In no way would real people in any of these situations act or talk the way they did in the film. Aside from primitive dialog and poor character development, the plot went far astray from what makes a successful horror film. Whats with the Law and Order feel to this movie? Is it a cop drama or a horror flick? In order to chill and awe an audience, you have to put them in the mind of the frightened victims. I merely watched them from afar as the scenes changed point of view too often, between character victims and the police. Never once was I able to feel what anyone in the movie felt. Every death I saw coming miles away. At no point did I jump or cringe. In fact, the only means of death I found original was the one that opened the movie. My overall thought is that they spent a great deal of time on a complex story, but did nothing in the means of backing it up.P.S.- If you want to watch a real horror movie, go rent the simple...yet brilliantly successful High Tension.",,Anonymous,Mystery
I like movies with twists at the end...,"and this does not disappoint in that department. I think the first Saw was overall a better film and a much more surprising twist. Instead of a delima between people, jigsaw has set up a game involving a group of people who much escape a house that is filling with nerve gas. First, they must find an antidote or they will be die before leaving. Jigsaw is caught early in the film and his interrogation plays a big role in his ""game"". He wants to teach Detective Mathews a lesson. It seems all the people in the house have something in common, they were set up by Matthews by planting evidence. And as part of the game, Jigsaw has included Matthews delinquent son as part of the house game.Once again, there are some imaginative deaths and creepy choices. Do you crawl into a furnace? What about a pit of needles? And the game Matthews must play at the end with the saw blade and being chained to the wall was all the more great.FINAL VERDICT: I recommend it.

Welcome to the new age of horror thrillers!,"Welome to the new age of horror thrillers! ""Saw"" and ""Saw II"" have surely set a new trend and style of horror/thrillers. No more brainless muscles/skins running from killers with weapons - here comes you psychological game of survival.I just watched ""Saw II"" even though the trailers told me not to. In the movie trailer of ""Saw II"", I saw ""Scream 3"", ""I Still Know What You Did Last Summer"" or...you got the idea - one of those several-mixed-gender-and-race-characters-getting-killed-one-by-one Hollywood horror films ever since the early 90's. But I was terribly wrong.The trailer is NOT the movie. ""Saw II"" is one of the rare squeal that allows you to further relate to the previous film AND further appreciate the both. ""Saw II"" carries on most of the ""Saw"" spirit and definitely adds more spices of horror. It successfully brought itself into a great horror film without destroying the suspense-based reputation of ""Saw.""The squeal started where ""Saw"" was ended. In ""Saw II"", the infamous ""artist"" Jigsaw is continuing his work for the people who, in his opinion, do not appreciate life - ""Those who do not appreciate life do not deserve life."" The great rawness in the opening scene will refresh your memory with Jigsaw's personal-tailored ""games"", carefully-selected players, and most of all, his twisted torture that makes people voluntarily lose blood and/or self in order to win back their lives...The plot was mostly very smooth and well-developed, yet with some commercialized, so-so moments. To avoid spoilers, I will not describe the scenes. There are some stomach-turning-popcorn-dropping horror moments, and they were not done by the disgusting deaths, but the terrifying struggle for not dying. Again, the great rawness that ""Saw"" brought to us a year ago skillfully lived on through the squeal.The squeal also ended where ""Saw"" started...Few twists around the last 30mins+, the ending will surely make you jaw drop like Jagsaw's victims.Overall, ""Saw II"" is made 75% for the ""Saw"" fans and 25% to keep the new and/or general audiences and the box office satisfied, which is an excellent proportion for any squeal, especially horror thrillers. This movie kept you thinking during and after watching it. Let's cross our fingers and hope that the ""Saw"" series would never become ""Scream"", or the ""Nightmare"" series.

"Though I always found ""Saw II"" to be a bit over-rated, this is still a fundamentally solid, enjoyable sequel...  It just has some big flaws...","Now that the series is sort-of officially over, looking back on the seven ""Saw"" films, I get a nostalgic feeling. They were a huge part of my teen-aged years and my early 20's, and it was my Halloween tradition. And so, I am looking back and writing this review for ""Saw II"", a film that is actually a very solid, fun ride, despite some big flaws. I still feel it's slightly overrated, but it's still a good film.Release in 2005, ""Saw II"" is directed by Darren Lynn Bousman (who would go on to direct the next two entries in the series, as well as the cult favorite ""Repo: The Gentic Opera""), whom also co-wrote the script with Leigh Whannel. (""Saw I-III"", ""Dead Silence"", ""Insidious"") The film stars Tobin Bell as Jigsaw/John Kramer, Donnie Whalberg as Detective Eric Mathews, and Shawnee Smith as Amanda, a returning survivor from the first film.Detective Mathews is a cop with a shaky past- he has a history of violence and may have been involved with evidence-planting, whom is lured into a new game with the infamous ""Jigsaw Killer."" Mathews and his SWAT team actually capture Jigsaw in the beginning of the film, but when it becomes clear that his son Daniel is trapped in a house loaded with booby traps, surrounded by other people who are connected to him (including Amanda, the survivor of the iconic ""Reverse Bear Trap"" from the first film), he is forced to play a game of his own with Jigsaw, in order to save his son.The film was of a higher budget than the original, and the scope is vastly increased. The number of traps, as well as their complex nature, is greatly increased, and this is the first entry in the series to truly live up to its ""gorey"" reputation. (The original film had very minimal gore, to be honest, and is unfairly labeled as a ""splatter movie"", when it is actually a tense psychological thriller.) There is also a greater number of characters, and the film employs numerous flashbacks to flesh out the story of our lead ""villain"", Jigsaw.The acting is surprisingly decent for a horror film. Tobin Bell shines as Jigsaw, and his role is astonishingly well-played. Despite being the series villain, he actually comes off as a tragic and misguided figure, driven mad by the circumstances of his life. I remember hearing more than one person in the audience around me commenting that they felt bad for him, and sympathized with him, despite the terrible things he does. That is the mark of a great actor- someone who can really make the audience question them, and make them feel differing emotions. Donnie Whalberg is good as Mathew, and Shawnee Smith is outstanding as Amanda, who is a very tense person with a lot of secrets of her own.The film is decently directed, though there are some very sloppy scenes, mainly due to the tight budget, quick shoot and the first-time director. This is also the first film in the series to use the hyper-kinetic quick-cutting that became a series stable in later films. Editor Kevin Greutert does a fantastic job, and the music by Charlie Clouser is iconic and haunting.There are a lot of flaws to the film, however. For starters, as I mentioned, there are a few sloppily directed scenes, and you can tell they didn't get all of the footage they needed. In addition, though this is arguably the most ""fun"" entry in the series, a lot of the secondary characters are very blank and are not fleshed out in the least. Finally, the film moves a bit too quickly, and as this was the first entry to use the quick cutting and ""hyper-gore"", it felt too different from the first film at times. This was the ""transitional"" film in the series- the first entry to employ a lot of ideas that became regular in later films, which is where it fell apart for me.That being said, this is a very fun film, and it has a decent plot and great acting. I give this a good 7 out of 10. Not the best entry in the series, but far from worst.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Very well done for a horror movie sequel,"This movie is truly disturbing. I think it should have gotten an NC-17 rating. It amazes me what the MPAA will allow in terms of violence, but they readily slap NC-17 on movies with sex or language.Most of the time you are able to walk away from a movie and say it was just a movie and couldn't happen in real life. The disturbing part of this movie is how plausible the plot could be to someone that is not right in the head. All of the traps/games of torture in the movie could be easily reproduced by any nut.I think it exposes the hypocrisy that Congress would raise such a stink about video game violence, but you hear no complaints about Saw II? As for the movie, it was very well done and worth seeing to someone who is a fan of smart, crime/horror movies. Be warned it is not for the squeamish.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
I should have read more reviews,"Saturday night, and I am forced to choose between Saw 2 and Hostel (which I had already seen) for my late night horror entertainment. After reading the glowingly positive reviews of Saw 2 here I thought I would give it a chance. After the incredibly cheesy opening scene (;et s get right to the... well, I won't spoil it for you) with it's 5,001 requisite MTV jump cuts I debated folding my hand and throwing in Hostel.I should have thrown in Hostel.The worst part about all this is that I will never recover the running time of this movie. It is gone forever.If they had eschewed the rapid fire editing and worked on mood, the overall picture could have been much better. As it stands though, it's a weak attempt and not nearly as good as the 3 of 5 star Saw I. The premise has been discussed before, a group of people trapped in a small area forced to find out why and how to escape, which is reminiscent of the highly superior movie Cube. There is no character development, you have no idea who these people are and you don't care. The main protagonists are miserable, as are the secondary authority figures in the helpless hero role. It's basically just an excuse to unravel Rube Goldberg trap after trap, constrained to a 3 seconds per scene limit, so you can't even see what is going on! There is no mood, no overall feeling of dread, the only emotion I actually felt was anger and frustration at watching my Saturday Night drift away. Maybe it is my age, at 35 I remember the new ""classics"" of the 70s and 80s and really don't relate to this flashy style over substance approach to recent horror films. So take my words with a grain of salt if the new Dawn of the Dead far surpasses the original to you.As for me, this was bad enough for me to want to write some words of warning to others. If you've seen Cube and then watched in horror Cube 2, you may have some idea of what I felt watching the inferior Saw II completely obliterate any positive feelings I had about the original Saw.Yup, it was that bad.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Plot Hole,"Not a big deal but I just want to point out this inconsistency.Jigsaw always maintains that he did not kill anyone, they made the choice themselves.But what about the gut in the first movie who was stuck in the room full of razor wire. He had no choice, if he stayed there he would have been locked in forever. He tried to escape, but he still died. The way I see it, jigsaw killed him. He played the game the way he was supposed to play by sacrificing some of himself and enduring pain in order to live, but he died in the process. Therefore, jigsaw killed him.Anyone else notice this? -Pallazzio",,Anonymous,Mystery
"Saw I Very Good, Saw II Not so","After watching Saw earlier this year, i was hoping that the movie would not have a sequel. Given the history of bad sequels for great movies, my expectations for Saw II was low. After recently watching the movie, my expectations were met...and the movie actually went above them...but not enough for me to warrant a recommendation to watch it in the theaters.The first movie, in my opinion, is a classic suspense/thriller that was smart, innovative and knew how to make the most out of little. The theme was clear, well developed and thoroughly connected to all the events in the movie. The second movie simply rode on the coat tails of the success of the first.The movie contained gratuitous blood and gore. The first movie, believe it or not, really did not (contrary to what people may think given the movie poster). The many, many scenes of the victims vomiting blood and puke, the overdone deaths of the characters and the infamous scene at the end with the knife to the back of the neck...all were not needed (as well as the gratuitous cussing). Additionally, there were far too many useless characters. In Saw I, each character had a role to play in the movie...and their roles made sense. In Saw II, not the case. Who is the girl with the pale face? Why is she with them? Just to scream and cry a lot? A lot of the characters were simply used to add to the gore effect. Saw II took the nuanced elements in Saw I and over blown it. Sort of what Ring II did with Ring I.Also, the sterile, urbanesque feel of the first movie was diminished markedly in the second. A lot of it had to do with the marked increase in characters...and the annoying and useless SWAT scenes.Despite these flaws, the movie was an OK suspense thriller. The ending was not obvious and caught most by surprise. The jigsaw theme was still evident. If you didn't see the first Saw, you will likely think the movie OK. If you did see the first (and liked it), you will likely be disappointed with the sequel.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Saw II (2005) ***,"Good sequel to the first SAW features more of a slowly dying Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) and lets us see a little deeper into what makes him tick and why he plays his elaborate games of torture. This time he focuses on a group of eight misguided derelict victims, all imprisoned inside an isolated house rigged with deadly traps as obstacles, while they try to fight their way out before a toxic gas gradually kills them. Donnie Wahlberg gives a strong emotional performance as a wayward cop who's targeted as an unwilling pawn in the game while his kidnapped teenage son's life hangs in the balance.*** out of ****",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A truly bone chilling ride!,"Saw II was in some ways a major disappointment, and in others truly remarkable. First off I must say, this may be the single goriest movie I have seen in quite a while. The amount of bloodshed is just disturbing. So please, those with weak stomaches please steer clear of this one. What Saw II does manage to pull off better than any movie I have ever seen is that disturbing, yet satisfying feeling that just makes this movie a thrill to watch.To me the major disappointment of the sequel was the plot. This sequel is no where near as plot driven as the original and that takes away almost all curiosity to what may be happening to the people in this twisted game or why they are there. The plot twists are not nearly as dramatic as the original, nor as interesting. The ending also leaves much more to be desired and that was a let down due to the fantastic ending of the original.Saw II has moments of absolute brilliance that I felt the original had almost completely throughout, but the plot twists and ending are less than expected and may leave you wanting more at the conclusion of the movie. The movie will definitely give you PLENTY of moments to talk about for weeks, and is all in all a good movie. I just had such high expectations for this movie that I was let down just a bit. Still the disturbing amount of gore is reason enough to watch this movie just for the chill factor.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Saw I,"It was a very well written script and the actors were really good. I also saw the first one and I thought good things of it too, but what was up with the dead guy waking up and saying ""the keys in the bathtub"" HORRIBLE ENDING! The 2nd was much better... Wonderful movies though. I wonder if they'll come up with a Saw 3, I think they might. I love the themes of this movie and everything. I wonder what body part they would use if they did come up with a saw 3?? Maybe a head, or a arm. My favorite part in SAW 1 is when the guy (Doctor) John I think? says ""The saws aren't for the chains, their for our feet!"" That was SO gross at the end when the guy ends up killing himself by cutting off his foot. I have weird feelings for jigsaw... mostly scaredness, and hatefulness, but also a sort of likeness... what would the movie be like with out him???",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Finally...a horror sequel that gives the audience what they want.,"SAW blew my mind the first time I saw it in theaters. The movie had a strong plot, great characters, and really dark, creepy imagery. Not only was it from a new director, its budget let the world know that money means jack squat in making a great film. It also didn't hurt that SAW had one of the greatest endings I've ever seen in my life. That movie became a phenomenon for me the way The Ring did when I first saw it. When I found out about SAW 2 being in production, I was pumped up because from the start it was already in a good position because work began right after the first one. Not only does this keep the story fresh, a lot of the thrill that people got from the first one was still retained going into SAW 2. I was a little worried that the director was different but got some relief that Darren Lynn Bousman is a close friend of James Wan. I got total relief after I saw this movie.The movie starts with the same in-your-face shock factor approach of the first one and immediately draws the audience's attention. Within the first 5 minutes I knew this was going to be a worthy sequel. Everything that made the first one great was reflected on this one times three. The puzzles were more complex, the characters trapped by Jigsaw were not only great but they were in larger numbers, and the imagery was as dark as you can only see in your worst nightmare. The puppet on the tricycle is one of the most insane and creepy characters ever. Most people have always had a fear of dolls when they were little and the fact that they used this puppet as a backbone of Jigsaw was genius. Though this movie contained a lot of gore, it was used to fit the plot perfectly. Nothing was overdone to make the movie undesirable or cheesy. Its amazing how directors can use excessive things in movies such as special effects in horror movies. It just makes me sick seeing a decent movie go sour after seeing very unconvincing and useless shadows flowing all around the room and through the ceiling or ungodly amounts of blood and guts. It just makes the movie look very fake. Movie makers should know by now just how much gore or special effects to use. Saw 2 used just enough of everything to remain relevant.One of the biggest compliments I can give to Saw 2 is the fact that when you watch this movie unfold, it truly gives you that feeling like this really took place right after the first one. This makes the movie so much better and makes you appreciate the sequel and gives true meaning to the word as well. Many sequels have been made a long time after the first one and several ended up horrible. As for all those people that think you can't shock the audience with another twist like the ending from the first one, think again. I was proved wrong after I watched this movie to the end. After the extremely disappointing sequel to The Ring, I was very anti-sequel for a good while until I saw this. This movie is a must see for any fans of thrillers and will add tons of fuel to the fire for all the fans of Saw 1.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Trash.,"yikes, was this bad. not at all psychological or demented like the first. no cool puzzles to work out. no changing scenarios, all one plot line. not twisted. just a movie trying to bank off its predecessor. an absolute waste of money. this one played out more like an action flick than a psychological thriller which is what i considered the first one. the only cool part was a the end there was a twist; but it wasn't even much of sideswipe. when the twist was revealed the reaction was mainly that of predictability. i had high hopes for this as the first one was awesome. but it fell short miserably. it did not follow the same psychological thriller format with differing scenarios. and i have no idea how out of almost 2,000 votes its got a 7.5. i gave it a 5 b/c the acting and directing was a least okay. plot and intelligence were nonexistent.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Great movie,"For those of you who have seen Saw and not yet seen Saw II, I remain to have only one question. Why have you not seen it yet? This movie is by far more superior than the prequel. While the prequel had it's fair share of twists, this one by far supersedes the amount of twists as the prequel. As for the gore factor, at the point in time that this movie had come out I believe this movie to have topped the rest. I read a review to this movie stating the ""this movie just as good if not better than the prequel"" that being an understatement if you will. This movie is definitely far better than the prequel. I as many who know me rarely go that far in stating that to a sequel. Enjoy this movie as much as I have.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Another Jigsaw puzzle done right!,"Saw II marks Darren Lynn Bousman's debut as a director on a major motion picture (though he directed a couple independent films prior to Saw II), so I was a bit weary as to the quality in the direction of the film. After watching Saw II I realized that Bousman can do it (well).The film takes place after the events of Saw and the film opens with a bone chilling scene (this definitely prepared the audience for what was to come). Bousman kept to atmosphere of Saw, recreating a dark, dirty, and crazy atmosphere.The story? I believe the story was well written, though some parts could be questioned as to ""if"" the characters could get away with what was happening (but then again it's a movie). The ending came to me as a surprise too.Acting? The acting was good at best (but a few actors of the cast members did a hell of a job). There are moments in the film that had characters acting a bit generic and plain.Overall, I was very happy with this picture and it is a worthy follow up to the original.I recommend this tile for sure.7.5Thank you, JVL www.jvincentlangel.com",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

more art with less matter,"The first Saw wasn't a perfect film, but it was at least interesting and had a whopper of an ending. This one doesn't even come close to the first one; it's just more gore, but with a much weaker script. There's one interesting plot twist, but it feels like too little too late because it comes at the very end. Hopefully the original screen writers will return for Saw 3...One thing that too few people in Hollywood understand is that a good script is absolutely imperative in film-making. Everything else can be mediocre, but the script is the backbone and if that's weak, it doesn't matter how much violence and gore you have, it's not going to work. A true horror film isn't violent and bloody; it has to have a script and plot that is so creepy that it stays with you long after.

"Not good as the first, but not that bad of a first sequel","Saw II, the first of the several sequels in the Saw's franchise. Is it any good as the original, well that would unfortunately be false, but does lives up to it's hope, well let find out.Basically after the events of the previous film, the actual Jigsaw Killer have been revealed to the Authorities as former Factory Worker and dying patient John Kramer, and they track him down to his factory/home, but right before they even Apprehend him, Kramer reveals he have already kidnaps 8 more people, all of which are trapped inside of an unknown building, that seems to be an abandon apartment, and Kramer refuses to reveals the Address. One of the newly victims, is just so happened to be the lead Detective's Juvenile Delinquent of a Son, which soon worries him, and making this be more of a bigger business to him. Meanwhile, the 8 victims who are all different from each other based on their Criminal Records, have no choice but to make it out alive together or else the Nerve Agent that Jigsaw puts inside the Building will kills them, and the goal for them is to find the Antidotes they need for their Survival, and while on the way, they comes upon deadly traps based on the Occupations of these Criminally-behaved Victims.This film is in-fact a good flick, but is different compared to it's predecessor. The use of Characters I will considered Mediocre, some of them such as the lead detective is a-bit of a Jerk but that the meaning of the character much like the doctor from the first film (Now by-a-way, if I sound like I'm bringing-up an Spoiler, well I'm not going to as I'm not trying to either, what you just read wouldn't be anymore as I say something bad to this character, but I'll not mentioned how, that you have to see for yourself), but some of the other characters like some of the victims now I kinda understand they should act like this because they're Bad people and all, but they kinda took the roles too far into making them another group of unlikable characters, with the exception however with the Lead Detective's son, Amanda Young (Who returns in this film from the previous one), the African-American Gangster, and Xavier, the Hispanic Drug Dealer. The son of the Lead Detective was I would say an Emotional character, somewhat related to some, and Amanda was nice to see in this, especially as a main character now. The gangster was a-bit emotional to see too, I loved the scene between him and Xavier, just a very powerful speech, and speaking of which, Xavier was great to see as an secondary Antagonist, he was quite menacing to watch by the end of the film so. One last of the Victims, I want to bring-up so is an Pyromaniac named Obi. He didn't do that much in this movie so, only have one scene, and than boom, he finished, but he was a-bit of a cool character to see, quite quiet which builds him up here, and I wished he was shown a-bit more, like I wished they gives a-bit more of a Personality. The one last character I bring up in general, is no other than Jigsaw himself. It was neat to see him as a main character this time too, and Tobin Bell who did a fantastic job like always, just playing a sick, dying old man. The traps are well-done in this one, my favorite when one of the main victims in this movie, opens a door that he not supposed to open because there's a gun that shoots him through the eye, just brutal. There is one complaint I do have however beside some of the characters, which is pretty much the unrealistic use of Nerve Agent, now Nerve Agent was also what Jigsaw gives to one of his victims in the first movie too, which I didn't brought up in my review of that one because I didn't think it was unnecessary, but I'm bringing it up now because it's a big part of this film, just how come through-out the film, it feels these people are in their for 2-3 hours, they should've dies already because of the poisoning. But oh-well, this did sorta overshadowed by what we seen in this film.So over-all Saw II is in my opinion is a fine sequel, just not the best in the series, but it is worth to watched.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Almost as good as the first,"A bunch of people wake up and groggily get to their feet. They're in a creepy looking room. They don't know each other. Then they're informed they have to find a way out of the house in a matter of hours, or the nerve gas they've been inhaling will strike 'em dead as a doornail. Naturally, some booby traps aim to prevent this.This follow up to the 2004 original could have lapsed into typical sequelitis and just been terribly derivative and dull. You know the drill: Kill a whole slew o' people in horrible, disgusting ways that in no way further the plot. But Saw II doesn't quite stoop that low. The horrible, disgusting killings do indeed further the plot.I am reminded of an old radio program called The Shadow. You might recognize the name, since Alec Baldwin played the titular hero in a 1994 movie. But it began in radio, and there was one episode called ""The House That Death Built."" In the episode, people were offed in creative ways by booby traps, such as a gas chamber and a series of shotguns.It's usually difficult to translate the unseen horror, like radio can, to a full-length feature film, and indeed most movies fail to do so. But Saw II does do so. You know right away these aren't characters we're meant to find appealing, or root for. No needless attention is paid to their backgrounds; all that you get on each character is all that you need to put things together. No dialog is especially wasted, and that - along with the always-fun gore - is what makes this movie work.Of course, if you don't like blood in your film, you're going to really hate this one. It's everywhere. People spurt from all sorts of orifices, plus some new ones. But things don't seem to be done with the intent to shock, another point in the movie's",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Awwwwww!,"In watching the first Saw, I thought it was one of the most ambitious thriller/horror films to date.

But I missed the ""old man"". They made him ""younger"" in mannerisms instead of more on the older, painful side as implied in the first one. And most of all -- I hate that 'they' are trying to make this into a franchise instead of leaving it alone.Saw II also contains a bit of the social commentary of the first and keeps you on the edge of your seat. It also has that story that you never see coming which makes 'john' such a great character and those around him so oblivious to his games. But oblivious in a smart way.Forgive me if I am a bit upset with where this is going - it just seems so ""money grubbing studio"" to me, for such a great story and idea. Obviously, young audiences accepted an ""older lead character"". Even though I am aware that 'john' could NOT go on for long because of his predicament.

I saw the sequel last night, and I had mixed feelings about it after seeing it. I still think that the first Saw is better because of its magic and the performance of Johns' voice. The second movie I kind of knew what was going to happen, cause John wants to kill these person of the same reason as the first Saw. He wants them to find out how much they appreciate their lives. I felt like there was something missing when I was watching the sequel. It didn't have the same magic effect of suspense and shock as the first one. And Jigsaw was suddenly not so scary anymore. Just a poor guy in a chair, waiting to die. In the first movie he was so brutal, clever and many twists and turns with a brilliant ending I loved so much -- but all of that was like gone when I saw the sequel. I guess I got kind of disappointed. It just didn't have the same 'charm' but the conversation between Jigsaw and Matthews were unforgettable.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Worthy follow-up,"How do you follow up on a shocking success? Or should i say a successful shocker? Any which way, much of the allure of the first SAW-movie was it's rather original take on the splatter/serial-killer genre. And original movies seldom lend themselves to good sequels. So does this suck? No, actually it doesn't.The film-makers decided to open this movie up a bit more. So there are fewer scenes from a confined space, more characters in the mix and more of a story to follow. That was a good choice, seeing another movie basically following people trapped in a room would have been tedious. It worked great in the first movie but we've seen it once and that's enough. Here instead it plays out as a mix between the first movie and a regular race-against-time thriller.The biggest problem as i see it is the legacy from the first movie, which is of course a classic Achilles-heel for sequels. Here they have tried to remedy that by twisting the story one step further. Making the traps and tests more disgusting, the deaths more gruesome (and plentiful) and of course the characters more deranged. In a way it does work, this movie kept me on my toes for the duration. I didn't really feel there was a need for all that extra blood though, although some of the more disgusting traps were delightfully sick.In the end this attempt at a follow-up works pretty well. It's not that far behind the original movie in entertainment-value. Sure, much of the originality that made the first movie great is gone.

Not as good as the first,"I'm not a big fan of hardcore Horror like this, but I like the first Saw a whole lot. So obviously I wanted to see the second one. but I made the mistake of buying it. In the first Saw movie, there were only two people trapped in the room. But now they added an extra 6 or seven people. which in my opinion made the movie a lot less gripping. But this movie the parts that really turned me off had to do with NO PLOT WHATSOEVER, and dirty, used needles. This movie is worth seeing, if your interested in this stuff. it is most certainly the same style as the first one. Except the first one had a plot, and overall a good story. I don't recommend that you buy this movie until you have seen it before, and liked it immensely. I don't know how you could though. I will most likely choose not to watch the third Saw. because that looks pretty crappy too.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A sequel that won't disappoint,"Sequel to the hit horror film Saw (2004), is a pretty tight well-done thriller itself.The Jigsaw killer is still at work, this time capturing a group of folks inside a house where they will soon die if they don't play the game!As with the original, Saw II is a solidly written, gory, suspenseful ride, but it wisely doesn't try to mirror the original film. Right from the beginning the film takes an unexpected turn, to become a more compellingly twisted thriller. It has plenty of cringe-worthy, gruesome scenes. Also like the original, the plot here builds to some great intensity and is topped off with another great surprise ending.Donnie Wahlberg, Shawnee Smith, Tobin Bell, and young Erik Knudsen turn in great performances.A good sequel all around, that won't disappoint the fans!*** out of ****",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Adult version of Willy Wonka,"I couldn't help but notice a similarity to Willy Wonka. They both contained a guide thru the environment, were punished for their bad choices, inability to follow direction, rudeness and self centeredness and were rewarded for their compassion and trying to play by the rules. In both movies you slowly see the rude and disobedient people get sucked up a tube or down a drain in Willy Wonka and burned to death or have their head shot off in Saw II. At the end of each movie only the guide and the polite well behaved person survive. In Saw II they don't realize they have a guide among them, but Amanda and Willy Wonka are supervising the tour and are in control and the others are observed after being given the rules and punished and rewarded accordingly.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Terrible, terrible movie.","The first thing that turned me off of this movie was the horrible use of editing. The use of so many quick cuts and the ""MTV"" style editing turned me off right from the start. I cannot stand when a movie relies on this style of editing to create atmosphere. Forgetting about the editing, the rest of the movie was just as bad. The acting was terrible, and I couldn't find myself believing any of the characters, or really making any connections to them at all. The plot and the dialogue were also lacking. The dialogue seemed dry, and nothing really caught my interest. It was all pretty boring and generic. I don't want to take the time to name all of the problems that I have with the plot, but I could go on for pages and pages. The whole concept of the movie is horrible. It just seemed like a failed attempt to make a ""modern-day"" rip-off of Cube. If it was a Cube rip-off that was actually well made, I wouldn't have a problem with it, but when it is as bad as this movie is, I have a problem. The traps all seemed uninventive and were nothing that I hadn't seen before. This movie was just horrible, and I am going to leave it at that.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery

saw 2 not as good as the first one,"When i heard that Saw would have a sequel i was very happy awaiting another masterpiece to come to the world.And i had solid reasons. Saw was one of the best thrillers i had ever seen.The strongest feature of that movie was its brilliant plot but it had many other advantages, too. Is saw 2 going to be better or as usually happens worse than the first part?Definitely it is not a bad sequel. Actually it is pretty damn good.It is scary. It has a decent plot.Some good actors.A lot of suspense and extreme situations that will definitely catch your attention. That was not the kind of movie i expected, though.The first one was very realistic with few exceptions. The second is far more unrealistic in many different aspects of the plot. And in addition it contains some even fantastic elements.And the blood is too much as well. There are new shocking ways of dying but not as terrifying as those unforgettable moments from the first one. My basic point is that the second film has gone into the wrong direction. Everything that was a major advantage of SAW 1 is somehow distorted in the second part.The stress is too much on the physical rather than the emotional and psychological state of the characters. The second part i not as intelligent as the first one.It is pretty much a horror movie. It is a little bit elementary. Still it is one of the best movies i have seen recently and it is worth watching. But when you have seen a masterpiece usually you expect more from the sequel. That is the horrible destiny of the sequels. They always bear the weight of fans'expectations. Though this movie is not my type it is good.I have one last thing to say: do not make more saw sequels, please.It will be too much of a distortion, i believe!",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Not as nearly as good as the first one,"I have watched both movies back to back. And I have to say that the first movie is much better. It is original, it makes a much bigger impact both psychologically and philosophically.Saw II was just another slasher flick. If you heard about the plot already (with spoilers) then you can skip this movie completely and wait for Saw III if you are interested in the story behind the main character.I'm afraid that this will turn into Friday the 13th (kill this kid with a hammer, rip this guys head off, cut this chick in half with a chainsaw, impale this guy on a branch etc.)... just with traps.Saw was an excellent horror/thriller with a great story and nicely developed characters, and I highly recommend it. 9/10, but Saw II is not worth watching if you are expecting anything more then random killing, spilling of blood and an intricate system of traps. Half of the characters are so badly developed that they are, just there (to die). And the others, even the main ones, are mediocre at best.Saw II 3/10",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Fails to capture the spirit of the original film,"Saw II is clever like the first, but definitely not as good.Whereas the first was original, and genuinely scary at times, this movie just fails to live up to it. It's an alright movie, don't get me wrong. But nowhere near on par with the original (which wasn't all that amazing to begin with).The acting is alright for what it is. Donnie Wahlberg does Cary Elwes proud with the really bad overacting, and everyone else just makes an attempt with what they have to work with. Adding more characters was not a step in the right direction.But the entire movie just feels a bit rushed. Yeah, there are many nods to the original film, but the rest of it is just there. Characters are dismissed all too quickly, and the characters that stay are not the least bit interesting. There are a few shock moments, but it loses a lot of the terror the original packed. The terror made it jump so far ahead of modern horror films, especially ones coming from the United States, and it just is not the same here. Those few moments are also marred by some fast editing that really takes away from it all. The ending rocks hard when it comes, but everything leading up to it just feels a little forced, like they had the ending, but just needed to come up with some filler to get to it.While both movies failed to really captivate, this one just doesn't leave the same feeling with you afterwards that the original did. And that's a shame.6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Good Story, Bad Acting","The plot of this movie was genius; the twists and story of the whole film was exciting, surprising, and just plain cool! The whole blood-and-guts element in the movie made it even scarier, in a good way. In short, I loved the whole idea. Key word: idea. Let's just say, the acting is a whole different story.First of all, Donnie Wahlberg isn't a very good actor to begin with, but he didn't affect the movie too much. However, Glenn Plummer, who played Jonas, did affect the movie to a point where I almost wanted to leave the theater. He was absolutely awful. Just terrible. I could take one look at the script and do it better by memory! But I must say, Shawnee Smith as Amanda was pretty good, as was Tobin Bell as Jigsaw. I was a little disappointed that Erik Knudsen and Beverly Mitchell didn't give very memorable performances, and that Franky G man as Xavier was a little too scary for me. The rest of the performances were pretty good, especially the bickering between many of the characters.Over all, I liked the concept of the movie, and it would have been brilliant if the acting was better.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"More cohesive, gorier and brutal than the original","Much better than the original. More cohesive, less contrived, more brutal. Tobin Bell is solid as the unmasked Jigsaw and manages to elicit a shred of empathy. The premise is similar to the first (several characters search for an exit before death visits), but there are enough surprise revelations, gory, inventive confrontations and a moody score to keep the structure from becoming predictable. Directed by Darren Lynn Bousman and written by Bousman and James Whannell, one of the original's writers, it connects directly with the first film while expanding on the concept. Climax is frantic and final image is one of grisly horror. Made by true horror fans for true horror fans. A fine achievement considering how many plates it's juggling.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Its not a game, its a lesson -- I saw SAW I to SAW VII","Masterpiece fabulous story told in 7 years. Some movies are made to tell us Why the movies are made and give us a good reason to watch movies. Marvelously written and brilliantly filmed, Very Interesting and Intriguing. The message of the Saw series movies are clear -- don't abuse yourself, don't abuse others, control your emotions, and be fair. Do not take drugs, do not smoke, do not cheat or lie, do not frame others, try to forgive, do not keep vengeance, control the obsessions, do not make profits on others death -- Follow the Rules, and you will win in the end. Do not sin from the tiniest to the gruesome/ heinous. There are many gore and horrible scenes when the victims are TESTED. But I think its a glimpse of hell, what we can expect as the wrong doers will be punished in the after life, because they did not followed the rules or had not got the clues.Its not a game -- Make Your Choices! Cherish Your Life!When the Legacy was handed over from John to Detective Hoffman, it all started going in the wrong direction. He tried to fulfill John's Will, but as he had lesser human side, and was going himself against the rules. He became a Victim to be Tested by himself.

A personal favorite,"Probably the best Saw movie. Again this review will be biased. It's s a personally important movie to me but I actually think it's a pretty good movie in general. It has a well written plot, good tension and some good story beats.The police finally catch Jigsaw. But of course it won't be that easy. Detective Matthews is asked to listen to jigsaw, meanwhile a house full of people and deadly traps is being pumped with nervegas where they have to find antidotes. In the house is Matthews son, can he save him?The acting is this movie goes from passable to okay but the main event is Tobin Bell as John Kramer aka jigsaw. Bell gives an amazing preformance and brings so much life to this charecter we only have seen glimpses of he really steals the show whenever his on screen. His dynamic with Donnie Wahlberg as detective Matthews is also amazing. The calm and collected psychopath vs the irritable and angry cop. They are like fire and water and jigsaw knows exactly what buttons to push to set Matthews off. Bell plays this upper hand charecter that always feels one step ahead and is morally over people and he captures this to a T.The camera work can again feel a bit amateurish at times, same as the edeting. It feels experimental and works sometimes but is also too much at other times.This is the movie where jigsaw reveals his mantra and backstory. It makes a very interesting villan whose logic you can follow yet still see flawed. He is a chaotic good chatecter. He thinks he's doing what's right. It's interesting that the charecter is lifted by other charecters in the movie. We see a worse person in the form of Xavier and Jigsaw uses Matthews crooked cop days as a shield whenever his criticised. We aligne more whit Jigsaw because we see bad people around him. He is also a calm and collected person surrounded by angry and aggressive chatecters. The charecter dynamics are well done.The plot and dialogue is actually well written, when you recontextalize the movie while watching it a lot of dialogue and actions starts to make even more sense. It creates a tense movie and has some amazing tvists. I'm surprised how well I think the movie holds up. The big tvist still makes me smile every time it's revealed, it's well done, well executed in the plot and the tvist dominoeffect afterwards is well done.The main scares and gore comes from the house game. I will quickly mention the iconic Venus flytrap in the beginning. A well done scene with a grusomme execution. The horror and gore is again not over the top yet. It still feels more like a crime movie than horror movie. The kills are more suttle and still makes me cringe sometimes. The ending rainbow puzzle reveal, the needle pit, both great examples of horror you can feel. We have all felt being pricked with a needle so the needle pit makes you cringe more than a senseio you can't relate to. The Saw franchise will sadly go towards a more over the top aproche in the future.Even the details of the movie are really suttle. There are so many small details you can catch that again recontextalize everything you have seen. There are also suttle dialogue exchanges that let's you fill in the gaps with your own Imagenation. This is of course not important things, but details that adds so much more to sometimes one dimensional charecters.Yet again this movie means a lot to me and is a favourite of mine. It inspires my little indie movie heart that forgives so many things because I can feel all the passion and shortcomings the production has. But I also think this is just a good movie, not a 10/10 as I biased feel about it but maybe 5/6. It's well written, has some amazing twists has some amazing charecter moments and dynamics and is overall a great passion project. I'll highly recommend it to anyone with a indie movie heart.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Not a good horror film by any means.,"Slasher films experience a resurrection about every ten years. It starts out with an innovative and lower budget film that brings in a lot of revenue. Usually it is just a reinvention of a previously existing genre. In the seventies we had Mike Meyers, the eighties brought us Jason and Freddy, the nineties brought us the constantly changing ghost from Scream and it looks like this decade will be the decade of Jigsaw.Saw II fails where it's predecessor succeeded. The original Saw was made for a low budget and predominantly took place in one room and was made up of one conversation between two people. Now parts of the dialogue were awkward but it was a challenging and very interesting way to approach a tired genre. Saw II instead of picking up with the idea of the original takes a different direction.Why need ingenuity when you have money right? It is a haunted house film. People wake up and they do not know why they are in this house. If you pay close enough attention to the dialogue and the camera work; the entire story can be figured out within the first thirty-forty minutes. Sometimes this can be good, get the meat of the plot out of the way and just let the killing commence, but that never quite starts. Instead we go into more meaningless deposition about the value of life and death and what a person really wants in something.It is as though the filmmakers, writers and all were just going through the motions.Jigsaw's motives are puzzling, even after they divulge into his past, being sick is not a good excuse to exact revenge on society. If the filmmakers were not attempting to make him more sympathetic it was pure filler.The ending is the most contrived piece of crap in film-making to happen in a long time. It is original, and creative, unfortunately, like the rest of the film, really contrived.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
wow!!,"After thinking a sequel would ruin the ingenious of the first movie, I had to stand corrected after watching this movie.This is, quite simply, one of the best sequels I have ever seen.It follows on from the first one.

OK...could have been more,"Let me start by saying that I usually don't really like Horror movies...I have a lot of respect for them as a lot of people do like them...but I just never got into them. That being said, I happened to watch Saw 1, and it pleasantly surprised me. I almost would call it more of a ""Dark Thriller"", like ""Seven"". I loved the story...very well written, and the twist at then end? Great. So I naturally looked forward to seeing Saw 2. I liked the casting of Donnie Wahlberg, as I think he is becoming a good actor. I liked the premise of the house. I had high hopes.I gotta say I was a little disappointed. One thing that I liked about Saw 1 was the fact that they were dealing with some pretty awful death scenes, but still didn't really go for the ""blood shocker"" scenes. It was a little more intelligent...left more for the imagination, which scares me way more in the end. Saw 2 seems to have gone the route of ""How much blood can we get in this film?"" I LOVED the story, and the end! I just thought it changed too much from the first film. It doesn't take a lot of blood to make a good movie. I would recommend it, and I do still look forward to Saw 3!! 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Are you kidding?,"Now, let's just admit something first off, horror movies aren't my favorite. I liked ""Dawn of the Dead"" especially with an awesome use of that Johnny Cash song based on the book of Revelation. I also liked Cabin Fever (shut up, I know). I'm more into comedy from Life Aquatic quirky to Waterboy stupid.It's not so much that this movie was a bad production, it's just the motivation behind it. What's the point? We've got a movie that's violent for the sake of being violent...almost like the movie makers just get off on it. And hey, I've seen some weird fetishes, so it's not really surprising. I especially get this from the ""Trivia"" at the bottom of the IMDb page.This may be more of a critique of the IMDb system than anything but half of these glowing reviews just have to be fake. Again, don't act surprised. Look, we've got guys comparing it to The Shining, and giving it equal ratings to King Kong and 2001. That MUST be a joke...yes, surprise, surprise! There are TONS of fake reviews on IMDb...yet this movie seems to have more than it's share.Side note...HOW TO SPOT FAKE REVIEWS: 1) The reviewer only has like 2 movies to his or her credit. 2) Out of control hyperbole. 3) Way too much detail.OK, it's not NEARLY as bad as ""House of the Dead"" (based on a Sega game) but it's not ""mind blowing"" or whatever bull crap the filmmakers are on here passing off as a legitimate review.I like a good scary movie, this is not one of them.

A huge step down from part 1,"""Saw"" was one of the most surprising and original hit movies of 2004. It had also been fairly cheap to make, so a sequel was produced immediately. The script for ""Saw II"" was derived from an already existing, ""saw-ish"" project that had been rejected for the longest time. After the success of ""Saw"" producers were reminded of that script and decided to adjust it so it would fit the story of Jigsaw and his crazy little world. At times this shows because the movie doesn't quite have the same feel as the first one. It's seems more like a mixture of ""Cube"" and ""Home Alone"".A group of people is stuck in a house full of deadly traps. Needless to say most of them have their little secrets and they start to distrust each other after a while. Unfortunately, the characters' motivations are as predictable as they are unbelievable. Writers needed a little bit more drive so they decided that the group would consist of psychos who act unreasonably all the time, which makes for a couple of silly scenes.Like in part one, there are two parallel story lines in ""Saw II"", but the storytelling is far less exciting than the first time around. At this point Jigsaw has just become too much of a super-brain. This killer is not only a genius, but apparently he also has the time and the money to realize each and every one of his sick fantasies. I know one shouldn't be nitpicky when it comes to such logical observations in psycho thrillers, but I really think they went a bit too far this time.""Saw II"" is also a step down when it comes to the lazy direction, the annoying editing and the less than average acting. The set decoration is a joke. You can literally see how cheap this production was. The rooms look so fake that I thought I was watching a TV-movie at times.Yes, the death traps are gruesome and pretty creative. Yes, it is a torture to watch Jigsaw's victims die. And yes, one of the twists is enjoyably surprising, but the final solution is too unbelievable to be satisfying. The whole story seems forced. It's meant to match our expectations and at the same time blow our minds, but the problem is that the formula is already getting old. We've seen it before and better. ""Saw II"" isn't a catastrophe, but it can't compete with it's predecessor on any level.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Stupid Victim Tricks...where's Letterman when you need him?,"While SmartTALX was a tad harsh in his assessment, it's still valid. But more importantly it is the whispered fragments of dialog that ""John"" or ""Jigsaw"" gives that do add some feature redeeming quality to this film. His flashbacks to the knowledge of his impending death, and the savor it adds to life, and the instinct of survival that he notes is lost amongst the common man. All of these fragments DO make a cohesive whole. I can say, without spoiling anything, that there is an opportunity for a ""Saw 3"". If some of the plot work tightens up, as SmartTALX suggest, with some fleshing out of this 'motivation' that John has this franchise will make the 3rd installment the best. It's well worth watching, for the essence of survival it hints at, not for the mechanistic methods of DEATH Jigsaw engineers for the violent prurience of the baser viewer.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Honestly, I judged a book by its cover, thought it looked stupid, wrote it off as obvious senseless gore and violence that revolves the movie around blood and guts rather than a storyline. Someone convinced me that this movie would at least be ""kind of clever"" so we rented the DVD.The first scene did something to me that no other horror movie has done in YEARS.... it riddled me with horrifying anticipation about the rest of the movie..not about seeing ""yucky things""...or ""boo....

"Saw II has an ending with breathtaking twists and scenes beyond violent. These statements make ""Saw II"" a great continuation for the series","Saw is a phenomenon that brought its creators Leigh Whannel and James Wan to fame. With one of the best film endings of recent times and a general twist, the first film surprised everyone and spurred fans to go to theaters hoping to be surprised again. That's where the question comes: it may not happen to everyone, but most will be slack-jawed again. Before that happens, several other events will take place on the big screen. Some of these long-awaited facts, which will leave each spectator with a different feeling (disgust or some sadistic giggles), but all going against the anguish of not wanting to be in the shoes of the player shown.In Saw II, eight people are trapped in a house. On site, Jigsaw prepared the distribution of a deadly gas that in an average of two hours will kill everyone. They must, like the pair from the first film, fight against time to survive. There are containers of the antidote in various parts of the house, mysteriously (and deadly, importantly) located. Closer to Cube, by Vincenzo Natali, the plot calls for the union of characters to overcome the traps, but it is obvious that selfish and hurried people will mess up everything and star in the (self) carnage typical of the series. What these individuals don't know is that there is a connection between them all, as seven of them were framed by Eric Mathews (Donnie Wahlberg), a corrupt cop. Worse? His son is the ""eighth passenger"", inside the nest that will likely incite feelings of revenge and revenge.This sequence almost faithfully repeats every detail of ""Saws"". If the first film could count on the talent of its cast (led by Cary Elwes and Danny Glover), the strength of the sequel lies in the script. ""Dead Games II"" has a very well-knit narrative, where each piece of information comes together in a big game of ideas. Even so, it is easy for the most attentive viewer to decipher some of the pieces presented to us. The story is a direct continuation of the original film. Jigsaw comes up with another well thought-out plan - obviously, the surprise ending will be there, this one less interesting but much more pretentious nonetheless - this time on top of Detective Eric, who sees his son imprisoned ""live"" while in his possession the serial killer. Obviously all of his moves are predicted by Jigsaw, and all of his actions will eventually lead to the grand finale.The screenplay, signed in partnership, was originally a shelved work titled ""The Desperate"". The material was discovered by the producers who decided to adapt it to the reality of Saw II, a production filmed in just II5 days. With loose ends, the sequel's textual problem isn't the argument: people trapped in a house and trying to survive a damn game is interesting. Achilles' heel is due to verisimilitude. We know there's not much to demand from this movie, but there are some actions that are, to say the least, questionable.Still, many of the qualities present in the original are present here too. Before the fifteen minutes of screening, we already know the troubled relationship between Detective Matthews and his son Daniel, and we are surprised by the bad guy Jigsaw being found by the police. The big question was: Where could the plot go with its main character in police custody? It is at this point that we see that the games were just beginning when Jigsaw ends up proposing a psychological game to detective Matthews that will guide all the plots of the film.As for the technical part, we have an evolution of the first one, due to the larger budget. The cameras, poorly focused and shaky, give the feeling of reality. The flashbacks are well worked out, however, because we use this feature too much at certain times, we think we're in some of the flashbacks, when it's actually the normal progression of the movie. In fact, just pay a little attention so we don't get lost. Maintaining the team was the main factor in achieving success. She is the same as in the first movie (at least the main names). One of the few not to be kept was the director. In his place, debuting director Darren Lynn Bousman, who previously only made music videos, showed firmness in conducting the plot.Bousman began here to show one of the characteristics of his direction, which would only increase in the following chapters of the franchise: his predilection for creating creative transitions between environments. The fact is that the director does well, impressing tension and knowing how to grow the pace in the final chase scenes in which the plot's great plot-twists occur. It certainly had oversight from Leigh Whannel (principal writer) and the producers. Even so, it earns deserved praise. About halfway through the screening, it hit a little indignation, as the film becomes morbid. This is just another projection technique, which happens due to the withdrawal of this expectation. As it approaches the end, the film shows its true ""face"", leaving everyone stunned again. Something in the best style of a game. Something in the best Saw style.Overall, Saw II is more violent than its original. Mainly because this time there are eight players involved, all trapped inside a house. To get out of there alive, they have to work as a team, as the new puzzle involves joint action. Anyone who has ever seen a simple horror movie trailer knows that a bloated number of people in the cast can only mean one thing: more deaths. That's what happens here too, and that's a problem, as the movie stops trying to be a thriller to be just a tape full of bizarre deaths. This violence is very much due to new traps: Michael - The Venus Head trap; FBI - The Electrified Staircase; Gus - The Magnum Eye hole; Obi - The Furnace; Amanda/Xavier - The Needle Pit; Addison - The Razor Box. Each one of them with interesting and creative engineering mechanisms that used in practice succeed in creating panic, disgust and disquiet in the audience.Talking about the greater number of characters imprisoned by the game, it is easy to notice that practically all of them are really stupid, restricting themselves, for the most part, to the same stereotypes of horror movies, something that the first installment of Saw had reasonably avoided doing success. Here there are the strong, the dumb blonde, the wronged, the ""nice"" black man. One of them will end up rebelling against the group, meaning there is a kind of ""sub-murderer"" in the film, in an attempt to bring a new level of tension to the viewer, with a more action-packed horror. Another script error: it should have stayed with the purely psychological horror of the first film. To compensate, we have Tobin Bell, this time having a much larger space compared to the previous film. Through his conversations with Detective Matthews, we came to know a little more about his past and his motivations (John Kramer getting the news of having an incurable cancer through oncologist Dr. Lawrence Gordon from the first film, his despair and unsuccessful suicide attempt which gave birth to him the desire to test those who did not appreciate their lives).As far as the visual language of ""Saws II"" is concerned, we see a great advance. The entire film takes place in two environments (the house in which the victim group and Jigsaw headquarters are located) and director Darren Lynn Bousman has found a very creative way to separate the two stories - the director's solution also accentuates the film's climactic moments, which, in turn, are marked by the characters' feelings of impotence in not being able to do anything to change the situation in which they were placed.

Armstrong's photography continues to use the green filter that was already used in the first one, which emphasizes the dirty, messy, claustrophobic and dark scenes, and we have again Charlie Clouser creating an intense soundtrack from the first to the last scene.In the sociological realm, there are several metaphors that jump all the time. For producer Mark Burg, one of the central themes of this sequel is the immorality of others, in addition to the fact that the plot addresses a kind of mirror of the United States, as he said in an interview, ""these people do not enjoy life, typical of the American people"". Social fears are also present, as the poison that spreads through the house has an effect similar to ""sarin"", a material used in the terrible attack carried out on the Tokyo subway, in Japan, in 1995.If the first Saw arrived as a freshness for the genre, the second film showed that the series was profitable and a broad narrative extension scheme would emerge ahead. Saw II ends open as happened with the first, as well as constant flashbacks responsible for unearthing characters from the past, parallel plots between the films, among other events that are at least absurd, Saw 3 was already guaranteed since the finalization process of this sequel. The message behind the film, an ending with breathtaking twists and scenes beyond violent. These statements make ""Saw II"" a great continuation for the series.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
give me a break!,"I'm sorry guys but this film was absolutely terrible! I'm not trying to be different by saying so but if this film had of been just another thriller without the ""Saw 2"" title, no one would have paid much attention. It just had to many ridiculous twists and turns to make it believable in the slightest.The story was just to ridiculous to believe, if the people wanted to survive they would not have behaved in the ridiculous and illogical manner in which they did.The ending was just pitiful, making me just roll my eyes! In actual fact the end of the film was almost disresectful to the first....for instance...sequels to Predator having people use Arnold's famous ""you are one ugly son of a bitch"".I didn't like it, didn't rate it and really can't believe that people really liked this film.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Inferior to the original but contains similar mind-blowing plot-twists,"Decent sequel to the brilliantly horrific ""Saw"". At the start of the film Jigsaw has eight would-be victims captured in a house together, with various riddles and traps to negotiate if they hope to escape. Whilst we see them all busy being tormented by Jigsaw's trickery, and one another, Jigsaw himself has been caught by the police, at his own hideout. Wahlberg plays Detective Matthews, who, with his police pals, is trying to extract from Jigsaw the whereabouts of the house to save his son, who is one of the eight trapped.The movie clicks along alternating between these two broad aspects. The far better of these are the scenes outside of the house. As Jigsaw and Matthews progress their cat-and-mouse interaction we learn about Jigsaw's motivation and history, and Tobin Bell is near-perfect in this role, just utterly cold and creepy. Wahlberg's performance is only decent, certainly not great, but probably didn't need to be anything more given that this part of the movie is all about Jigsaw in any case.The scenes in the house in the main feel like padding out time in anticipation of a big finish. We learn almost nothing about most of the captured, to the extent that most of them didn't really need to be given a name beyond ""victim #3"" or such. This pretty much applies to the first four characters killed.The traps or their links to their intended victims mostly aren't as clever as those in the original, and this stuff has certainly lost some of its impact and almost become gimmicky in the sequel. Still this is a horror movie, and if you can't respond to what you'll see with ""cooool"" you're probably in the wrong theatre anyway. My stomach did turn in delight at the truly horrible scene involving the character Amanda (who returns from the original) in the ""pit"", about halfway through the movie. Worth making an effort to get through your munchies before it. Better still don't attempt to eat and watch - the opening scene of the film is also deliciously gruesome.A few people die, a few don't, and the movie does build to a big finish and two big final twists. Not much can be said without giving it away, suffice to say the last five minutes were brilliant, and, like the first film leave you thinking ""oh yeah.... so that's why that happened"". Particularly the twist involving Wahlberg's son....wow. I was taken aback by the cleverness of the writers and the little hints along the way which didn't seem to mean anything at the time. The ending, and the performance of Bell, really did make this movie and for me saved it from being average to poor horror schmaltz.You do need to see the original first to best appreciate this movie.Frustrating to review really given that I can't say much about the best thing about the movie, the ending. The way the story has been left after this one, I can envisage Saw III being an absolute disaster. We shall see....",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Oh yes, there will be blood.","Saw II, the 2nd film of the 7 movie franchise, is in fact, one of the worst films in the series. Its not bad, but just not that good. The movie is in fact the most boring of the series and after a great opening the rest of the movie except the last 20 minutes is a big borefest. But the last 20 or more minutes are great and really suspenseful. The twist ending is great but not as good and the very unexpected ending to Saw. Saw II focuses on a Detective who finds Jigsaw's ""lair"" and finds out his son is in a game, he must play Jigsaw's other game to find his son. The game in the house, is where these I think 5 people are in a house with poison gas which will kill them in 2 hours.

Not nearly as exciting as the first Saw.,"If you go into Saw II expecting to relive the excitement that the first one brought on, it won't happen. I guess I went into the theater with the wrong attitude - and perhaps I expected too much. But Saw was a diamond in the rough of contemporary horror films.The beauty of the original Saw was the opening sequence. Knowing as much as the characters in the movie know is what made it that much more frightening and intense. Where are these people? Why are they locked in a gritty bathroom stall? This technique is something that really set the tone for the rest of the film. Saw II has none of this.Saw II opens with a gristly scene that is sure to get the audience going, and it seemed to work fairly well. Unfortunately, the dialogue and acting that follows throughout the rest of the film suffers greatly. Being eased into the father/son relationship was somewhat painful to watch, and a few people in the sold-out show laughed at some of the commends made on- screen by the father.I was also annoyed at the writer's choice to keep 3/4 of the film within a house. I understand the fact that they have to take a step forward from the original, which I remind you was generally kept within a small room, but it just feels like they opted for the house to fit more victims into it - and therefore, to please the audience with more death. Why do sequels always have to involve MORE? I couldn't help but think that they only reason they do is to rake in the cash from the success of the first, and that's exactly what Saw II does.I was also bothered by something else which other film buffs probably noticed as well. The three girls cater to a fairly wide range of men's taste. We have the slut wearing a thin shirt and no bra, with large doe-like eyes and a fairly well-fed ego. There's the cute and somehow sexy girlfriend who squeezes her breasts together for your viewing pleasure. And there's the messy-haired large-breasted drug addict from the previous film, showing off a bit of mid- drift and some chest bounce, again for the viewer's pleasure. For the girls, they throw in the ""adorable"" shy-but-not-incapable son, the rippling (if half-insane) Latino, and a black man who manages to avoid the common Hollywood curse of dying first. Obviously I picked up on the idea that they were desperately trying to connect the audience to these stars in more of a visual way than an acting way.Anyway, without spoiling the ending, you'll either love it or hate it. I hated it. Either way, you'll come away from Saw II knowing that it satisfied your lust for blood and maybe some female (or male) eye candy, and that is really Saw II's only saving grace. I gave it a 6/10, and I gave the original Saw a 9/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of the worst movies I have ever seen in my entire life,"I try to figure out a way to somehow explain exactly how bad this movies is, but I can't find the words. Just to point out that it is edited like the most hyperactive MTV-action-movie-trailer you have ever seen doesn't cut it. To mention that the acting is so horrible that it makes you wanna stab yourself in the eye over and over isn't enough. Even if I would explain the infinite numbers of plot holes and embarrassing mistakes you would never, ever understand exactly how bad this movie really is. All the parts put together creates something more than the mere sum of these parts. The result is a beast, a demonic entity with powers that are not of this world. This movie is so bad it brings physical pain to your body and torments your soul, possibly for all eternity - I just have to wait and see. The worst part is knowing that people did this - that human beings created this excrement, this rotting pile of maggots. If this war crime of a movie would have any redeeming qualities whatsoever, it would be that sometimes, for the tiniest moment, the gore leads your attention away from the pure evil that is supposed to be acting, from the murderous insanity that tries to pass of like a plot and from the genocidal editing.I have only seen one movie worse than this: Pups.

Brilliant - perfect for the horror genre!!,"This film was absolutely brilliant!! Just what horror needs!!

There is the right amount of gore and blood - not too much and not too little!! The acting was superb and the twist at the end was the icing on the cake!! This film is definitely worth seeing at the cinema and then purchasing it on DVD. I'm not surprised that people had to be carried off by ambulances and had fits when they saw it because it was really scary. It is much better than the first - pure genius!

"Halloween Review #26: Ah,nothing awful","Saw was a big hit back in the year of 2004,so big,that even before the film was released some dude Darren something something was making Saw II,which is about another group of guilty people who've done guilty things as they desperately try to get out of Jigsaw's twisted games. So,when I saw Saw II,which was'int too long really ago,even though I saw all the others,I did'int think too much of it and I still don't.

Why do I still like this,"This series is being good for far longer than it has any right to be so far.Obviously I don't like it as much as the first, but for a sequel to a horror film made in the 2000s, made a year after the first, on a budget of only $4 million, for this to be anywhere near as good as it is is frankly a goddamn miracle.While the plot holes have increased a fair bit (and I am fully expecting that trend to continue, and Jesus Christ is Jigsaw already making some huge bets on everything going absolutely perfectly in this one), most of the characters aren't as well defined and are a bit stupider, and the fast editing and close ups aesthetic did start wearing on me a little...I've got to admit that I still don't understand why this series never clicked with the critics.Maybe it's just the gore, which is a fair bit more excessive here (another trend I expect to continue), but honestly I don't understand why anyone who has presumably watched some gruesome horror films before would take offense at this. The acting is pretty great, even if the kid is a notable exception, it's well directed, still doesn't feel cheaply made, and above all...it's pretty entertaining.And you can hang me for it but I really like Jigsaw as a character. So many other serial killer characters are completely blank slates to the extent that some of them don't even talk, but even though he's obviously a total lunatic, you can understand why he does what he does from his twisted perspective. Even if the kid really didn't deserve any of it, the way he factors into the game Jigsaw was really playing all along is brilliant.So I'm not sure how much longer they can keep it up, but for now, I'm enjoying the ride.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A decent sequel,"Saw II was a decent continuation of 2004's Saw. Locking people inside the house for games was a good idea and giving more depth about the antagonist was also a good part added in the story. If I talk about the story and the screenplay, they were good, the direction was average, the suspense element was also good but the performances were average.

Very good,"Saw II is a more than worthy sequel to the superb original and also a solid horror/thriller on it's own. The traps are creative (one in particular is absolutely horrific; it involves someone having to dive into a pit of needles), and the twists are both shocking and brilliant. There's also something that most Hollywood horror films are missing nowadays: character development. Jigsaw is explored deeply and Tobin Bell delivers a chilling performance. The character has become a famous horror icon, ranking up there with Freddy Krueger, Norman Bates, and Michael Myers.The suspense is there and hardly ever let's up. Saw II doesn't have the BEST suspense (the best would be in Saw and Saw III), but it's still impressive seeing how most horror films today lack in that department. I was on the edge of the seat the entire 90 minutes.The subplot that goes on is very interesting and ties perfectly into the rest of the story. There are a few flaws though, and that's what kind of bogs this film down from getting a higher rating. The characters in the subplot are for the most part stereotypical and underdeveloped. Plus they're given some pretty mediocre dialog throughout. If the number of characters was reduced and there was more time spent on developing them and improving on the dialog, I probably would of liked it a bit more.Even with those few negative aspects though, it's still very good and easily one of the best sequels in the Saw series.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A daily comment from Midget Emma: Saw II (2005),I found this to be better then the first Saw. Saw II has better traps and a great twist.Unfortunately some of the traps are ruined by stupidity.

You know the Bad guy talking to the cop and messing with there head. That sort of thing.Now to the twist. It was a very good twist and i never would have guessed it.

"The tag line boasts, 'Oh yes, there will be blood,' and oh yes, there was","Saw IIDirected by Darren Lynn Bousman.Starring Donnie Wahlberg, Shawnee Smith and Tobin Bell.With a troubled son, a pending divorce, and a serial killer who asks for him by name, Detective Eric Mathews (Wahlberg, ""Band of Brothers"", ""Dreamcatcher"") is having a rough time. Matters only worsen when the aforementioned serial killer (a frighteningly matter-of-fact Tobin Bell) begins his new ""game."" The murderer, dubbed Jigsaw by the media, sticks several ex-con stereotypes in a booby-trapped house and watches the chaos ensue from his hideout. Mathews discovers Jigsaw's lair, and takes his team to bring the maniac to justice. When the detective discovers his son is one of the unlucky few inside the house, the case becomes a blurred line between Mathews' personal and professional interests.With the departure of director James Wan (who helmed the first film), Darren Lynn Bousman, a relative unknown, fastens himself into the blood-encrusted shackles. Bousman does not stray far from the formula used by Wan in the original: quick cuts in times of panic, dizzying camera angles, overall confusion.The tag line boasts, ""Oh yes, there will be blood,"" and oh yes, there was. ""Saw II"" requires from its viewers a high tolerance of gore. Knowing that no one can argue that it is a tame affair, the filmmakers try a little too hard to make ""Saw II"" more than it is. Much like ""Saw"", the film tries to cram as much guts as it can fit down the audiences' throats while also leaving them with something to think about when the credits begin to roll. Do Jigsaw's subjects deserve to live if they cannot make the necessary sacrifices? Does Detective Mathews' history of police brutality justify his son's torment? These are interesting questions, but are ultimately irrelevant. The filmmakers are more concerned with burning people alive or having them crawl through hypodermic needles than focusing on why any of it happens at all.""Saw II"" is an above average horror movie, at best. It is memorable only to the fans that can stomach the blood and guts genre that is horror. It'll certainly keep audiences on the edge of their seat, but in the end it falls in line with typical frightful fare.

what happened to the horror?,"Seeing Saw as a hit, I couldn't wait to see Saw II.

If I could describe Saw II, it'd be gruesome. I don't know, the horror just wasn't as intense as Saw (Adam's capture = DANG!).

"As horror sequels go, pretty decent","Saw II continues the tale of modern horror's greatest villain: Jigsaw. This time, 8 people are locked in a brutal test while a detective, the father to one of the victims, and the police try to save them. S2 is a rough, brutal ride. It has been treated unfairly by critics because of the bloodshed. That's just what it uses for scares. Some horror movies use jump scares. Some use tension. This uses violence and uses it reasonably well. It's not always enjoyable as it does get pretty unpleasant at times, but it is undeniably effective. Therefore, it's easy to write it off as a nasty gore-fest, but it counterbalances the gore with thought-provoking thematic material on morals, justice and how far one will go to save themselves. It's a nasty film, but it is effective. It's far from a perfect movie admittedly. The characters aside from Jigsaw and the main detective are weak, the drama is somewhat superficial, it's not as tense as the first one and things are a bit sillier this time. That being said, it's a watchable and reasonably thrilling horror film, although for many it will be a bit much.

Though Cary Elwes's acting is dreadful in ""Saw"", it had the ending that made your jaw drop. In this one, the acting was only slightly better, but the twist didn't quite have that same effect. I think it's the ""been there, done that"" phenomenon. Hear me out on this one. Remember seeing the first ""Final Destination""? I loved the whole ""death's design"" thing. And it scared the bejeezus out of me. The second one was pretty much the same, but it wasn't nearly as scary. I'm figuring the 3rd is really repetitive. It was the same with this movie. Once you saw the unique and frightening death traps of ""Saw"", the ones in ""Saw II"" just weren't as scary. Sure they were gory, but it didn't have the same fear factor.

Not as good as the original,"Saw 2 lacks a lot of the tension of the first one, the jump moments aren't as effective and the pacing is a little slow. Tobin Bell, who plays Jigsaw is really good. They gave the character a lot more depth and he is really convincing and even relatable. Sadly this cannot be said for the other characters, who are all rather shallow and uninteresting. The key to good horror is to make the protagonists relatable so that the audience cares about what happens to them. Now perhaps I'm just a sick, twisted person, but the only character I really found myself caring about is the killer.This brings me to my next point. While the original Saw was definitely a psychological piece, the sequel already started going more for the gore. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, and with the same twisted editing and cinematographic techniques they used in the first one it works quite well.Saw 2 had a much higher budget than the first one, a larger cast and better production value, but they sacrificed a lot of the tight direction and tension that made the original great. Also this film is more graphic than it's predecessor, so consider yourself warned. However it is worth watching just to learn more about the Jigsaw character.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Get some Jigsaw, Get some!!!!","In this follow-up to the 2004 original, Saw II sets the formula that is to be used in subsequent films. One could say that Saw (the original) started the formula and they would be correct, however, the original Saw used the formula on a smaller scale. In Saw II many more people are involved in Jigsaw's plans. Even though Saw had a huge plot twist in its finale, Saw II offers a more complex plot-twist for the audience. We are also formally introduced to Jigsaw/John and his reasons for doing what he does. We find out that he is not as much of a raging lunatic as he is a down-to-earth guy who just wants to change the way people are living their lives in order to help them lead better lives.It's tough to review any film series and keep each film's review interesting and thoughtful as the series progresses. Having said that, the writing, once again, is the single best element in this film. We are not graced with the presence of the best actors but in this case (as not in all cases) the writing transcends any of this film's acting flaws. It's absolutely amazing how the writers weave the plot of crime, mystery, thriller, and horror and bring it all together in a conclusion then slap the audience in the face and say 'no-way, we are not done yet.' Honestly, when I viewed the original film, one of the first things to cross my mind after it was over was, 'there is no way there can be a sequel, but if there is a sequel, there will definitely not be a saga and here we are on the brink of the release of the 7th and final installment in the franchise. The traps are fresh, the twists are fresh, and frankly the change of pace In the film is welcomed. This story has a faster pace than the original. This is something I did not expect because I could not perceive this franchise making film after film and somehow make them unique so that the audience is not left saying 'we have seen that before.' Now, back to the aforementioned film formula. The formula for these films become generically as follows: a larger group of people are the main focus of the film while there is a 'spectre' within the film's background basically carrying out Jigsaw's plan. There may be a few hostages or 'insurance policies' around somewhere but that is the basic formula. Oh, did I mention it is still as fresh as the apple pie I baked 5 minutes ago? If you enjoyed the original then you will respect this installment in the series.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Bad Horror Movies Are Like Blunt Instruments To The Head,"For quite a while I'd wondered what it would be like to watch a Disturbed music video for a little over and hour and a half and not hear the actual band play until the end.

The last Saw movie had a ""twist"". This movie basically held back any relevant information except for the most obvious of character traits and motivations, and then completely inundated the viewer with about forty minutes worth of buildup in a two minute long montage, only justifying this deception with a pun that you've already winced at if you know what I'm talking about. That's not a ""twist"". That's a gimmick. Also known as complete and utter idiocy.Saw II may cause hemorrhage in the frontal lobe.

I really like Saw II a lot more than most do,"It's a step down sure but damn it's great in the way Darren Lyn Bousman directs I like his style even after loving Mother's Day (2010) in the last few years. Donnie Walberg is pretty good and I enjoy the rest of the cast. The traps are great, morbid galore, the doll is awesome, and the flow of everything is spectacular! Tobin Bell is impressive I had a chance to get an autograph back in 2015 ish but the line was to long at mad monster party. I forgot how much I love the Saw movies its been so long, the box set I have is so worth it I try to should try to own more horror.

"Shocking for the sake of it, a dismal sequel","When the first Saw was released it reinvigorated the horror genre, although being incredibly violent and at times almost hard to watch, it possessed an intelligence rarely seen in the genre (despite the blatant nod to 'se7en'). This film suffers from the archetypal horror sequel problem - improving on a plot line that was so complex it would seem foolish to try to add to it. It follows the same basic structure as the first film although the violence is so sadistic that it lacks meaning neither does it add value to the film - almost as if the producers picked up on the predominant features of the first film and thought ""more of the same please"". For example the violence is gratuitous, and there is a convenient (if not slightly predictable) plot twist at the end. My main problem with this film is that the tension is solely built around increasingly horrific ways to shock the audience, lacking any real conviction or thought thus removing the factors that made the first film so original and brilliant, leaving the film to adhere to your stereotypical slasher flick. The only thing that saves this film from a 1/10 is Donnie Wahlberg's performance.. Shame he couldn't have been given a better narrative!",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Victims not dislikeable enough,"Not as good at the first movie.1. A crucial aspect of Saw, is that the victims must be dislikeable in some form. Otherwise, it won't feel right watching it & won't be as enjoyable. I say that because I ended up growing to like & 'root for' a lot of the characters in this movie, who were subsequently killed off. And I don't think that's meant to be the intention of this movie.2. Similarly to the point above, it was confusing re whether or not we were supposed to root for certain characters. It wasn't clear. It felt like we were beginning to understand a particular character - then they would die.3. I felt like the characters in the house were just walking around aimlessly for a lot of the time, and having meaningless conversations. Then only occasionally, something dramatic would happen. Whereas they should have kept the pace up consistently.4. I didn't like the constant switching between 2 different stories that were taking place. I found myself just wanting to watch the game, as opposed to going back & forth.Overall, it wasn't really bad - some scenes were interesting.

A Twisted Game,"Good evening, everyone! I'm Mr. C Reviewer, and tonight we'll be diving into the film Saw two. I had the opportunity to watch the movie on Netflix. This movie originally premiered on October 28, 2005, and has a runtime of 1 hour and 33 minutes. It is rated for viewers aged 18 and older. Notably, parts of the film were filmed in Ontario, Canada. The estimated budget for Saw two was around $4,000,000, and it grossed approximately $147,748,505. As someone on the autism spectrum, I found subtitles to be incredibly helpful, greatly enhancing my ability to follow the dialogue throughout the film. The film was directed by Darren Lynn Bousman, who also co-wrote the screenplay alongside Leigh Whannell.Summary: Detective Eric Matthews finds himself ensnared in a perilous game when he learns that his son, Daniel, is one of eight individuals held captive by the notorious Jigsaw. With time slipping away and a deadly nerve agent permeating the environment, Matthews must urgently race against the clock to rescue his son and the others from this harrowing situation.Review: -The film opens with a striking death scene that cleverly subverts the notorious jaw trap from the original Saw movie. This shocking introduction effectively establishes the film's tone. Shortly thereafter, we are introduced to Daniel, along with insights into his father and his professional life. Approximately 18 minutes into the movie, we meet the group ensnared in the deadly game, which I found to be executed quite well. I appreciated how the film artfully explores profound themes related to life choices, selfishness, moral dilemmas, and redemption through its intricate narrative and character development. I found the pacing of the movie quite engaging. The initial setup effectively introduces the characters and establishes the stakes in a swift manner. However, once the characters find themselves trapped and begin to interact, the tempo noticeably slows down. This deceleration often prioritizes character development over action sequences. I value these slower moments as they allow for deeper exploration of character dynamics, ultimately enriching their narratives as they navigate Jigsaw's traps. I appreciated the incorporation of flashbacks, reminiscent of the original Saw film, as they effectively enhance the storytelling within this series. These flashbacks enrich the narrative by offering crucial context regarding the characters' motivations and backgrounds, particularly that of the Jigsaw Killer. They vividly convey his philosophy and rationale behind the traps he devises for his victims, adding complexity to his character that transcends the typical portrayal of a mere villain. I was impressed with the casting choices for the movie, particularly the decision to retain actors from the original film, such as the one portraying Jigsaw. The performances across the board were commendable, but Tobin's interpretation of his character truly stood out, infusing it with both menace and complexity. His skill in expressing moral ambiguity was evident through his philosophical monologues that provoked thought regarding life and survival among the characters. Additionally, the actor playing Eric delivered a performance that was both intense and emotionally charged, especially during pivotal confrontations with Jigsaw. I admired his capacity to effectively convey a sense of desperation intertwined with determination. The film's soundtrack was a compelling fusion of hard rock and metal tracks from a diverse array of artists, perfectly complementing the movie's intense and unsettling themes. The selection of songs enhances the pervasive mood of dread and tension that permeates the narrative. The film employs sound effects and various auditory elements to craft an immersive experience for its audience. Sound design is pivotal in heightening suspense during critical moments when characters confront life-threatening challenges. The interplay of eerie ambient sounds, abrupt shocks from piercing noises, and disquieting background scores significantly enriches the film's chilling atmosphere.-I appreciated the costumes and make up in the movie, The attention to detail enhanced the film's realism. Many movies often overlook such nuances, focusing instead on ensuring that actors look polished and tidy on screen, while avoiding a more gritty or grim aesthetic. I found it refreshing that this film chose not to shy away from that authenticity. The film's depiction of gore was notably realistic, showcasing a commendable effort that, while not extraordinary, surpassed that of the first instalment. I enjoyed the film's cinematography, which employed a variety of shot types to enhance its narrative. The gentle lighting established a nuanced atmosphere that I found appealing; however, while all the essential elements in each frame were distinctly visible, some parts could have benefited from additional brightness. Personally, I often adjust my screen's brightness for a better viewing experience, which proved particularly helpful during this film. The film's set design effectively establishes a claustrophobic and unsettling atmosphere that enhances its horror elements. The energetic camera movements during critical moments further amplify the tension inherent in each sequence.-I found this film particularly challenging to watch, especially with a teenage boy deeply involved in the Saw game. I appreciated how the movie explored the consequences of the previous game from the first instalment. The unexpected twists throughout the film captivated me, much like those in the original, and I was pleasantly surprised by their quality. I hope that future entries in the series maintain this high standard of intriguing plot developments.I rate each film I watch out of 10 and for this one, I give it a 9.5 Remember this was what I thought about the movie personally and I suggest that you give it a go for yourself.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Decent sequel, gore and blood ala plenty, never lacks creativity thanks to Whannell","**1/2 Donnie Wahlberg, Shawnee Smith, Tobin Bell, Erik Knudsen, Dina Meyer, Franky G, Glenn Plummer. Directed by Darren Lynn BousmanDespite the doubt of a sequel surpassing the original (which it doesn't) or the attempt to measure up, ""Saw 2"" does. Leigh Whannel going out on a limb with out James Wong but substituting for him director Darren Lynn Bousman. A fine choice indeed. This time friendly serial killer and life teacher Jigsaw (Bell) pits eight strangers in a house while they breathe in deadly nerve agents. While Detective Mathews attempts to hunt down his son who is also one of the eight. ""Saw 2"" doesn't fail on blood and creativity but it does the exact opposite, it brings wholesome torture and life back to killings on the screen.

The Best Thriller Of Its Time,"With more gore, more twists, more characters and more plot, Saw II manages to trump even its own predecessor at the thriller game.Where Saw had rare dull points, Saw II moves quickly. The traps are more gruesome and inventive, and we find ourselves with surprisingly well drawn out characters; and a plot that works fantastically as both a standalone and a sequel that expands on everything that was great about the original. Saw II really establishes the 'Saw Mythology' that fans have come to love, and as a film seems to do everything right. It hits the perfect balance between plot and action, and for the first time Jigsaw really comes into his own as a character, rather than just a scary voice on a tape recorder. Indeed; by the end of the first we still felt we knew nothing about Jigsaw, with only a couple of sparse glimpses of the man.No such qualms here. The psychological duel between Jigsaw and the haunted Detective Matthews recalls 'Silence of the Lambs' in its brilliance and intensity, and, in what is surely rare for this kind of film, we actually feel something other than annoyance and hatred for our characters. Even the killer seems human and almost likable.Now when was the last time you can remember a film with such qualities? It was mentioned earlier in this review; need I say more.I'm not lying. Saw II is that good. Now go watch it.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Perhaps the best of the sequels?,"With the original 2004 horror film Saw being such a big hit, a sequel was greenlit shortly after it's release and thus begins a tradition on Halloween where a Saw film has to be released. Saw II was released in 2005 and was still successful at the box office and was a hit with the average moviegoer. If you ask people what their favorite Saw sequel is, chances are this will be it. The film was directed by Darren Lynn Bousman who would go and direct Saw III and IV as well as 2021's Spiral: The Book of Saw. The film stars Donnie Wahlburg, Tobin Bell and Shawnee Smith.Eric Matthews is a cop. A cop who is investigating the latest murder of Jigsaw. Matthews finds out where Jigsaw is and learns that eight people are trapped in a house and they must escape before they all die. But one thing that they don't realize is that they all have something in common...The original Saw is a good film and I honestly prefer that one over Saw II but that is not to say that what is done in Saw II is bad. Sure, I like the small setting of a dirty bathroom and the whole game is the mind games going on between the two main characters. But what Saw II does is go a little bigger and not stick to the same old routine so to speak. Saw II is on a bigger budget which works and also does not. The film still retains some of the crazy editing that is in the original. It bothers me only mildly this time around because the previous film was low budget and all that editing is what made that film have it's charm. I do not think it is entirely warranted in this film. Thankfully it is only used sparingly. I can say that the acting is better this time around and it's all thanks to the three main actors/actresses we have: Donnie Wahlburg (who plays the cop role fairly well), Tobin Bell (who is just cold as ice), and Shawnee Smith (who does fine which is all I can pretty much say). With this film comes more characters and more traps. The characters that we really care about is Matthews and Jigsaw and the other people that are trapped in the house are not entirely developed at all. Some get killed off right away and others, we just have to live with them for a while longer. I could go more in depth, but I would rather one give the film a watch and make their own opinions about it all. The traps are fairly good, where the first one had maybe three typical traps and then the mental game. This time, we have these so called personal traps that our characters come across and these are accompanied by tapes addressed to a specific individual. I somewhat dig this. The traps are brutal but not really in the whole torture porn sense. There is one that is quite infamous for being nearly too much for a lot to watch. The whole game is quite clever when all is explained and the whole end twist, while clever, could be easily predicted. I should admit that I knew what the twist was but I try to view it from the lense of a first time viewer watching this film in 2005 type of deal. The twist does not hit as hard as the original but still enough for people people to be like WHAHHAAATTT?!Saw II is a serviceable sequel to a good low budget horror flick. It goes bigger with virtually everything, some of it pays off, some not so quite.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"great, it continues well","After saw, I heard there was going to be a saw II as i guessed, and for a moment, i was scared even before the movie. I thought they were going to screw up, but i got the nerve of watching it one day, and I was not at all disappointed! This movie will lead to once again, another saw movie as the ending was a pretty cool shocker. The traps in this movie are really good, very cool surprises, as gross as ever, and one freaking good villain.In this movie, Tobin bell (jigsaw) stand out the most in this film. He was great along with the plot. Its about a detective finding one of jigsaws traps again but finds a clue and eventually comes to confront but while hes there, a game goes on stalling him to arrest jigsaw.I found some stuff about this they are not really complaints, but they left a plot hole probably to be explained in saw III.

Meh.,"A while back I found myself in English class trying to read some King when a nearby group's conversation gradually changed the topic to horror movies. That's when I first heard about Saw and how it's apparently one of the scariest and goriest movies ever made. I was skeptical and took my sweet time getting to it. After the initial watch I was a tad bit disappointed since Saw was not a horror movie. It had horror elements but it was supposed to be more of a mystery and on that ground it failed miserably. The ending was totally out of the left field and quite frankly I don't think it was even all that realistic.I gave Saw some time and it grew on me a bit, not one of my favorites but I am now able to respect it for what it is. Saw II on the other hand was definitely a few steps down. Coming into the movie we know how Jigsaw sets up games of torture to test his victims. We know that there are going to be clever traps that involve people turning against each other and I guess we now know that there's going to be a dumb implausible twist at the end (though I admit it's a bit better in this one).Saw II really does suffer from a ""been there, done that"" attitude. It also suffers from being too much like a horror movie. The first film at least tried to be smart; this sequel is just a brutal slasher flick. Hell they even have a stereotypical axe murdered running around at one point. With better writing this content would work but almost everything on display has been done before.Maybe I'm being a bit too hard on this film. Most sequels do suffer from being too familiar. That's not to say it's all bad, in fact there are quite a few clever little scenes that impressed even me. The pool of syringes was memorable and Jigsaw was an interesting yet slightly familiar character (was it just he or did he give off a weird Hannibal Lecter vibe?) So as you can see, a lot of things have been changed for this sequel unfortunately these changes are not the ones that needed to be made. Rather than trying to expand the formula they should have made an effort to fix the things that were wrong with the first one. The camera work for instance. It tries to be ""cool"" by being wild and all over the place with nifty rock music blaring but it just seems silly to me, same with the car chases that were sped up, I actually laughed out loud during these scenes.Another thing would be the acting. I know it's a horror movie and they never have good acting but it was just so bad. I not once felt for any of these characters, well except Jigsaw who was very well portrayed by Tobin Bell. Yet again, Jigsaw was the villain, we're not supposed to care about the villain.I suppose my review may be a bit misleading considering how little good I have to say about the film. I'll admit it's not that bad when compared to other slasher flicks and there's probably enough to keep you entertained for it's running time, just don't expect it to blow your socks off.My review from Frider Waves: http://friderwaves.com/index.php?page=saw2",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
You'll love it or hate it,"There is two ways this film could go. Firstly it could be a stunner completely out do the first film in every way, or it could go the way of most horror type sequels, which is straight in the bin. The film starts off with yet another enclosed room and a single guy that has to try and get out before his life ends. This then leads a police officer onto the seen who for some reason the 'jigsaw killer' has an agenda. This leads to a game being played with the officer and a group of people trapped in a house filling with deadly nerve gas, one of which is his son and one of the others we have seen before. if you don't know who that is i wont say. Its not by the way any of the guys that were trapped in the last one, you do find out what happened to them. This i'm a little disappointed about, I preffered not knowing, i felt it more fun to make up your own mind on it.The film in the most part is fairly average and was starting to head the way of most horror sequels until we hit the twist. Ahh the twist yes this for me turned an average film into a good film, yes it happens with about 5 minutes of the film left but it is strong enough to lift the film to the score i have given it. In my view the twist was better than the one in the last film and leaves it open for yet another sequel.Better than the first film? Probably not, but then that was an original film, whereas with this we know what it is all about. Still it is worth a watch and does enough that we can probably expect saw to be a Halloween regular.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

It was as if everyone in the movie was waiting for something to happen but it never came. Don't take me wrong, it is still Saw were talking about so there is a lot of blood but the physical part that actually made the original Saw scary is missing throughout the whole movie, making all the gore effects rather dull. Another problem is that the new characters lack depth and is very unlikeable. It didn't really matter if they all just dropped dead or not to me.Overall its not a awful movie but compared to its prequel its unforgivable and I just hope Saw III resurrects the series.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Saw II doesn't quite live up to the greatness of the original film,"Saw II (2005), a sequel to the original Jigsaw tale, revisits the deadly games initiated by the methodical killer. This time, a detective and his family are thrust into the gruesome puzzle, leaving us wondering why. The targets of the game will need to uncover the clues to stay alive and solve the mystery behind Jigsaw's new masterpiece.This picture is directed by Darren Lynn Bousman (Repo! Genetic Opera) and stars Donnie Wahlberg (Ransom), Beverley Beverley (The Crow: City of Angels), Shawnee Smith (The Blob), Tobin Bell (Mississippi Burning), Glenn Plummer (Strange Days) and Franky G (Power).The film, unfortunately, falls short of the high bar set by its predecessor. The storyline feels somewhat contrived and lacks the compelling depth of the first installment. Donnie Wahlberg's character comes across as overacted and occasionally unrealistic, detracting from the overall storyline. Also, why do the characters drop crucial items needed to escape their predicaments every other scene? Even the gore and kill scenes, while not entirely lacking in impact, don't quite match the gruesome intensity we've come to expect from the series, with a notable exception being the legendary syringe scene and a rewarding throat slash ending. The film's twist ending, while entertaining, doesn't quite reach the level of excellence we've seen in other entries.In conclusion, Saw II doesn't quite live up to the greatness of the original film, but it still holds some appeal for horror enthusiasts.

"A worthy sequel, but nowhere near the original","*****DISCLAIMER: DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM WITHOUT SEEING THE ORIGINAL, FOR THIS WILL SPOIL THE FIRST ONE TO A LARGE DEGREE. THERE ARE SPOILERS TO THE FIRST SAW FILM IN THIS REVIEW*****Like its predecessor, 'Saw II' is the best horror film of its year. The main difference between these two films is that the first one is more of a psychological thriller with an amazing twist at the end. This one sticks to a typical horror theme, but still pulls it off with great ease. Standing alone, 'Saw II' is excellent, but not even in the same dimension as the original.Jigsaw is back and better than ever, coming up with more clever traps for his unsuspecting victims. His intentions are more narrow now, having a detective's (Donnie Wahlberg) son captive in a room with other people in an unknown place. They must hurry to escape, for they are breathing a deadly nerve agent, and there are antidotes within the house. They must also beware of the many traps Jigsaw has scattered along the house. All this goes on while the detective in question interrogates Jigsaw in Jigsaw's warehouse.Like it's predecessor, Saw II boasts excellent sound and lighting, which are so crucial to a horror/thriller film. Saw II is filled with much more blood and guts than the previous one, including a disturbing needle scene. Also like the original, Saw II suffers from mediocre acting outside of Tobin Bell's Jigsaw, who gives a masterful performance as one of the best villainous characters of our time. Despite how physically weak he is, you will never forget that he is in charge the entire time. Donnie Wahlberg is okay in the film, but I honestly think he could have been better. You just want so much more from the character when it's over. He gets the job done though. The rest of the cast, including Franky G, Beverly Mitchell, and the return of Shawnee Smith is okay, Smith being the best.There is a new director behind Saw II, Darren Lynn Bousman, and I have to say that he does a great job of keeping the spirit of the original. I like him a lot and I'm also anxious to see what he does with Saw III. Bousman directs the film better than any horror film of recent memory, keeping the psychological aspect of the series intact and well, while adding more blood and gore than in the first. His writing is nowhere near that of Leigh Whannell, but again, Bousman is not bad at all, rather, the writing from him is very similar to the style of Leigh Whannell, making the resemblance in the two movies very visible. Bousman provides a clever twist at the end that some will guess, but the other twist is, like the first film, unpredictable. This sequel does the job of keeping you entertained while scaring you a lot. The best part about the series is that we can expect a great thriller and psychological mind bending every Halloween. I recommend Saw II to anyone 16 or older, and to any horror fan. Great film.8/10 --spy",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Absolutely brilliant--can't remember the last time a sequel was this great!,"To be completely honest, I had VERY low expectations for Saw 2. I had watched the first film, and LOVED it. I loved how James Wan and Leigh Whannell were able to create such a creepy film with such a simple set. I loved the brilliant psychological warfare between two individuals who start out calm but grow angry with each other soon after. I loved the flashback sequences. Truth be told, I loved everything about it, and I was upset to then learn of three sequels (and probably a fourth) to such a classic horror film.But anyway, since I had loved the first so much, one day I found myself at Blockbuster and decided to give the sequel a chance. I had nothing else to do. I could barely speak after watching it. I had just walked out of my home theater room with the memory of one of the best and most well-made sequels I've ever had the pleasure of watching.""Saw 2,"" quite simply, is basically the first film on steroids. From the very first scene (which, by the way, was so revolting I had to set my giant movie theater butter popcorn bowl on the table next to me) Saw 2 will take your hands and lead you into a world of nightmare that you can't escape from until the end credits arrive on your screen 90 minutes later.The story is simple to follow yet complex to dive into. Jigsaw locks eight people in a house full of traps, and they have two hours to find a way out before a lethal nerve gas flowing through the house kills them like the EBOLA virus. Meanwhile, Detective Matthews, a cop, apprehends Jigsaw with a team. And, it just so happens, one of the eight trapped in that house is Eric Matthews' son.Saw 2 has everything the first film had and beyond. The gore is up there as a 9 or 10 on the gore scale, while I'd give the first film maybe a 7. Remember the psychological warfare that ensued between Adam and Lawrence in the first film? Well, it's magnified 100x in ""Saw 2,"" between Jigsaw and Detective Matthews, and the eight unlucky individuals trapped inside the house. The acting is incredibly top-rate and soars past the first film in acting talent. Everyone in the cast does a GREAT job and makes the film seem that much more realistic. The direction and editing is superb (better than the first) and we now seriously know Leigh Whannell can seriously write a damn good movie, even though the screenplay for the first film was better. Apart from that, the only complaints I could have for ""Saw 2"" is that it isn't as creative or inventive as the first was, but who says it has to be? It's a sequel--it is merely carrying on the story where the first left off. The second complaint would be that it isn't scary...at all. It's just a brilliant suspense film that will have you cringe in disgust at the deliciously cleverly twisted film before your eyes. And for me, that's enough.The twist at the end is also one of the biggest shockers I've ever witnessed watching a film. You think the one at the end of ""Saw 1"" is big? You ain't seen nothing yet. And go ahead--keep trying to guess the ending throughout watching ""Saw 2."" I guarantee you it'll go in the exact opposite direction of what you're thinking of.Overall--do what your love for the first film tells you to do. See ""Saw 2,"" disregard your thoughts of how a sequel could never be as great as the first, sit down, and put this movie on. You won't be disappointed! My only worry now is the third film possibly living up to the caliber of the first two.

The writers managed to maintain the feel of the original while offering up plenty of surprises. You'll spend a lot of time cringing, but that's part of the game Jigsaw wants to play with us, the audience.Another intriguing element is our first real exposure to Jigsaw, played brilliantly by Tobin Bell. In the world of horror, Jiggy's a true original. He's a force for pure evil who can still draw our sympathy. In a sick way, we can even relate to his ideals of ""punishing the ungrateful,"" especially since Jigsaw himself has suffered so much. We know he must be stopped, but unlike Jason Voorhees or Freddy Krueger, we won't delight in it.By now it's clear that ""Saw"" will buzz its way into a multiple-sequel franchise. This will surely become the ""Friday the 13th"" and ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" of the 2000s. ""Saw III"" came out the following year, with part IV slated for October 2007. Horror fans are the big winners.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Scary, but highly viewable","As a pretty devoted viewer of the Saw franchise, I can say that this is the best of the three though I have to admit it is not without a strong feeling in the stomach one leaves the theatre. They've managed to get most things spot on, and Jigsaw is one scary character. Here in Monaco they showcased the franchise after Cannes Film Festival, and everybody in the cast came over so even had an opportunity to meet the director - cool guy. Well, if you enjoy a good horror this is one flick to watch for sure! I actually must recommend watching the movie first, and then Saw I followed by III. Then, of course, don't forget to wait until the end credits are finished as there is some pretty cool stuff for the true fan. I cannot cherish Saw enough for its very detailed and superb special effects, but then again everybody that seen the first one knows what I am on about.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Not Frightful as the first, but still the same thrills.","After scaring myself half to death with the original SAW, I almost cried when I heard that they were going to bring out a sequel which wasn't going to hold a candle to the original. When the film finally came out I decided to see for myself how terrible this was going to be. The acting was alright, not adrenaline rushing like the last one but pretty decent and the scenes that were supposed to make the audience scream with fright were just dead and cheap. I was waiting for that one scene that was going to make me scream and throw my popcorn up in the air like the last one, but no. There was no scene like that, just a bunch of scenes that were trying to be scary like a Sci-Fi Channel original movie. The film did as I predicted, it did leave me disappointed but I was impressed with the work they put into the script. It may not be a walk through the carnival spook house but it did have the twists and turns of that roller coaster that looks like it is touching the sky. I would only suggest this movie to people who saw the first SAW but only after the movie has been in theaters two weeks so they could use their free pass tickets.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Saw II -- a typical sequel,"Saw II i thought was definitely a good horror movie but probably would have been better if it didn't have to follow the original Saw. I could definitely tell that it was a different director, everything about the movie was different. Unfortunately though, the movie constantly seemed like it was trying too hard to live up to it's prequel. It wasn't as creative, as suspenseful or as shocking. Every twist and turn seemed mediocre at best. Although, that may be unfair since everyone who had seen Saw I had already been exposed to all of these gruesome and horrific plot twists, and it is of course extremely difficult to top that.I went into this movie expecting to be scared out of my mind seeing as how after the first one I couldn't sleep without my light on for weeks after. But i found instead that although I was mildly scared, it wasn't to the point where i was constantly checking my backseat to see if someone had snuck in. Saw II is a good horror movie on its own, but a bit of a disappointment in comparison to Saw I.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Arguably the Best Saw Film,"With it's psychological turn from it's predecessor, unique editing style, and fantastic script writing, not only may Saw II be the best Saw film ever, but it may also be the best horror film ever made.The movie starts up showing off it's bigger budget and amazing editing, while at the same time introducing what the next sequels of the Saw series will follow which is a tense and gory trap leading up to a great storyline that will keep you locked in your seat for the rest of the film. Soon you meet Eric Matthews, an aging, stressed out detective who fathers a troubled teenager named Daniel. They are two of many intriguing characters who all have their own opinions on how they should live their lives.Of course, Jigsaw's is the only opinion that matters. As the film moves on, your brought further and further in to his twisted head which helps you understand the reason he is what the press has named him.Unlike the other Saw films, the acting is great and keeps the movie more realistic. The writers of Saw give the actors excellent lines and the director gives out the best direction, making the movie very, very well done, especially with it's arguably low budget.Then the movie is topped off with the epitome of twists, which will leave your jaw dropped down to your feet. You might have to watch it a few times in order to understand it completely and due to it's excellence, this won't be a problem at all.Saw II deserves every single one of the stars I'm giving it now.10.0/10.0A+",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Let's play some more,"The first Saw was, on its own terms, groundbreaking in its nastiness and brutal originality. The sequel, on the other hand, does what all other horror follow-ups do - mimic the formula of the first one -, albeit with a little more thoughtfulness.The script, according to various statements by the crew, was originally a stand-alone thriller, written by director Darren Lynn Bousmann, and had to be rearranged to fit in the Saw universe after the original became a huge box office hit. Despite Leigh Whannell's best efforts, this fact shows quite a bit, mostly because of the plot being a lot more complex than in the first movie. This time, instead of two people in a bathroom, we have eight in an entire building, and it's only a matter of hours before they're all killed by lethal nerve gas. While each of them figures out why he or she deserves to be there, Detective Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) and his task force get as far as facing Jigsaw himself (Tobin Bell), a cancer-ridden old man who has no intention of dying before his work is complete. There is also another reason why Matthews can't kill him right away: his only son is the gas-infested building.Making the story more twisted and ambitious is not a bad thing per se, but considering all the traps seen in the first Saw were conceived for one or two people at most, the mass carnage in Saw II appears a little difficult to justify. That it becomes rather easy to ignore this fact is down to two elements: the consistent tension, paired with some good old gore, and Tobin Bell, who is allowed to expand on his character after the brilliant twist ending of the previous entry showed us how far he could go. Having perfected his villainous acting in episodes of Alias and 24 (and also, surprisingly, Seinfeld), he owns the entire film, spitting out Jigsaw's life (and death) philosophy with understated menace.And then there's the one thing most fans will judge more harshly than anything else: the final twist, or rather twists (there are at least two). One is a bit of a let-down, in fact it's Saw II's biggest liability (anyone who's seen the first movie can guess it very easily), the other is actually smarter than expected, although the overall feeling is that the ending was constructed to leave the road open for Saw III instead of providing a good shock. Still, after seeing the third installment, it has to be said that at least the makers of the second one tried their best.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Inevitable and inevitably of poorer quality,"STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The PitsA crooked cop (Donnie Whalberg) becomes the latest target of the twisted Jigsaw (Tobin Bell.) A S.W.A.T. team has tracked the elusive killer down and has him stationed. But they've burst in at just the worst time- he has another group of victims trapped, including the cop's wayward son, in a room that's slowly filling with a deadly nerve gas. If he wants to see his son alive again, the cop had better just listen carefully...A sequel to a successful horror film is an inevitable but also inevitably worse thing. As, once again, is the case here with the follow-up to last year's box office Cube rip-off hit Saw.It has a few of the problems it's predecessor had. It's still very much a rip-off of Cube, a little known independent film that's developed a bit of a cult following, as well as elements of Phone Booth. Throw into the equation some stereo-typical characters (the heavy smoking, hard-edged bent cop, the wayward son, the pushy female character) and a lack of actual effective scares, as well as the obligatory rock song playing over the closing credits, and you don't have a searing film experience. The poor box office performance indicates Saw 3 might not be hitting us quite so quickly and when it does it may just be the start of a straight-to-DVD franchise. *",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Near as good as the first film,"Building off of the brief appearance in the past film, Jigsaw takes a very large role in this film. This time, the primary focus is a group of people trapped in a house that features a variety of traps for them to overcome. Meanwhile, audiences watch as Detective Matthews has a battle of wits with Jigsaw himself in an effort to get his son back. When on screen together, these two characters have some very good scenes together. I found Jigsaw to be a very interesting and engaging villain who, instead of just being a depraved serial killer, takes the approach of trying to help people in his own disturbing, convoluted way. It was also interesting to see the series' lore expand, integrating some of the characters in new and unexpected ways. I did still find the traps to be very cringe-worthy and some of the deaths to be downright traumatic and disturbing to watch. If it wasn't for the plot being as engaging as it was, I probably would have stopped watching. The sets in this film are also much like those of the first film. This time they have a broader scope since they take place in a house versus a single room. The producers again did an excellent job of creating the practical and special effects, making the gore seem very real on screen. On the whole they did a pretty good job creating this film and managed to avoid delivering a bad sequel like so many horror franchises succumb to. I put it as slightly just under the first film in terms of quality. While Jigsaw is an improvement, the emotional stress just doesn't have the same weight behind it as Cary Elwes's character did in the first film.You can read this and other reviews on my blog at https://ajourneywithjake.wordpress.com",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Tobin Bell does an incredible job playing John Kramer, and Donnie Wahlberg does an incredible job as Eric Matthews. These two carried this film in a similar way Adam and Gordon carried the original.

A continuation of perfection.,"Someone apparently didn't tell the men and women behind the Saw franchise that thrillers had to be about terrorists, boobs, and have a clichéd social commentary that we've heard since we were 3-years-old. That's why the Saw franchise is easily the only truly original movies being released todaythey break every genre rule you think you know.Saw II takes the same formula from the original Saw and spins it, making it bigger and gorier. It allows you a much deeper look into the mind of Jigsaw, and further shows that Jigsaw himself defies any and every cliché you thought a villain must abide by. What makes him so complex is that he isn't a villain at all; in reality, he's the only good guy in the entire franchise.Also, Saw II proves thrillers can be thrilling. I simply cannot remember a thriller that actually had something going on from beginning to end, without a single dead spot in the entire movie, but that is exactly what Saw II is. There are no pointless conversation scenes that plague every thriller/action movie because the director thinks he's so original, when in reality the audience understood the movie from the first trailer. Saw II gives the audience creditthank God someone, anyone, understands how to tell a truly adrenaline-pumping story.Gore-wise, the movie excels. In an era when Hollywood has turned to generic, family-friendly gore, it's insanely refreshing to see a series that actually makes gore disturbing again. People often compare the Saw franchise to Hostel as far as gore, and all I can say is this: Saw blows Hostel out of the water here. Hostel uses cut-off camera scenes, where NONE of the gore is on screen, and all the gore is generic and boring. The Saw series, specifically Saw II, does not cut the camera away for ANYTHING. Everything is on-screen, and everything is disturbing and cringe-worthy. Saw II is easily the most brutal of the Saw series.None of the five plot twists in the end of Saw II match the single plot twist in the end of the original Saw, but there is the thing: the movie has five plot twists! It takes a lot of thought just to inject a single sub-par twist into a movie without making it seem gimmicky, but Saw II does five of them with perfection. Once again, how can a movie get better than this? Like I said when I wrote my review for Saw and Saw III, how can a movie get more perfect? The action never stops or even slows, and the plot puts most every movie of our generation to shame. Saw II makes every other thriller I have ever seen, including Hostel and it's sequel, look just downright cute.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Absolute rubbish!,"What a load of dross! This film is NOT scary - just pointlessly, gratuitously violent and gory.It is drivel from start to finish. And, shortly before the final denouement, we get a 2 minute recap of everything that's happened in the film FOR NO REASON! Unless it's because the film makers assume that anyone watching this is so stupid they can't actually remember what happened 1 hour ago.The ""twists"" are signposted miles in advance, such as they are, and, possibly deliberately (though I suspect I am granting the director/writer more intelligence than is their due) no empathy at all is generated for any of the characters, which makes it really quite boring.I haven't seen Saw, and after this I would go a very long way to avoid seeing it.

"Saw II does continue on the strengths of its predecessor, but it also sees itself as a transition from the gritty minimalism of the first to the series' exploitative aspects","Detective Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) is struggling with a divorce from his wife, his son Daniel's (Erik Knudsen) excursions with petty crime and being confined to a desk following allegations of problematic behavior that have derailed his career. When Detective Kerry (Dina Meyer) calls Matthews to the scene of latest trap by the Jigsaw Killer that has claimed the life of one of Mathews' informants, she directs Matthews' attention to the message on the wall to him from The Jigsaw Killer. The message ends up leading Matthews, Kerry, and SWAT to the lair of Jigsaw aka John Kramer (Tobin Bell) but true to his methods Jigsaw has setup another trap with several people, including Matthews' son Daniel with the group going around a booby trapped house in search of an antidote to the nerve agent they've been exposed to.Saw II is the 2005 sequel to the 2004 sleeper hit Saw which became Lionsgate Films biggest narrative feature success at the box office leading to immediate greenlight of a sequel. Due to James Wan and Leigh Whannell's production commitments to Universal Picture's Dead Silence, the reins were instead passed to music video director Darren Lynn Bousman who'd written a script called The Desperate which came very close to being made as a low budget feature before a potential cinematographer suggested to Bousman he show the script to Saw producer Gregg Hoffman. After producers noted the similarities between Bousman's The Desperate and Saw due to the bleak atmosphere and locked room mystery element with a twist ending, producers acquired the script and reverse engineered it into a sequel to Saw with Whannell providing re-writes (hence the co-writing credit) and Wan signing off on the adjustments in a producer capacity. The film was a box office hit earning nearly $32 million in its opening weekend and claiming the #1 spot over much larger budgeted films from larger studios such as Legend of Zorro and Prime. While critical reception began to skew more negative, the audience reception cemented Saw as an annual horror franchise with new entries releasing in Halloween regular up until 2010. While Saw II maintains the same grimy atmosphere and mystery like appeal of the first film, there is a noticeable expansion on the traps and torture.As with the first film, Saw II is primarily a procedural with the core of the movie being a cat and mouse game between detective Eric Matthews and John Kramer aka The Jigsaw Killer. Both Donnie Wahlberg and Tobin Bell do well playing off against one another in a very ""cat and mouse"" type game but in addition to the Seven/Silence of the Lambs esque procedural elements with that storyline we also see expansion of the original premise of characters trapped in a singular location with the Trap House now playing host to 8 characters instead of the two in the original bathroom location. While this setup runs the risk of being a rehash of the same format as the first one with Detective Tapp investigating Jigsaw in parallel with the locked room being similar in setup to this film, the movie does use the expanded breathing room to get more in depth with Jigsaw as well as giving our detective Mathews more personal stakes as opposed to Tapp's obsession. The one downside to the expansion is that with 8 characters now roaming around the Trap House we don't get the opportunity to know them like we did Adam and Lawrence for the first film and in some cases characters die without being named or are only named after they're dead. I will say that despite not being given the breathing room to develop their characters like the original had, the acting on display does compensate for the thinner material and the performances of Erik Knudsen, Glenn Plummer, and the returning Shawnee Smith are some solid standouts. While the movie does revisit the elements that brought Saw to the public's attention in the first place, Saw II also marks when the series starts becoming more gore focused with more elaborate torture and death sequences in comparison to the first film where most of those were implied. Having seen some of the worst imitators of this genre such as the Hostel series or Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning this is nowhere near the level of cynical we saw with these envelope pushing horror films of the time, but you can see the seeds being planted for producers and creatives taking the wrong lesson from this movie and building their film solely upon that one aspect alone.Saw II falls well in line with the first film even if it does lose a bit of its appeal with an expanded scope and character roster not giving the same richness as the first one. If you did enjoy the first film Saw II does a solid job of continuation and expansion.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Bad Bad Bad Bad...,"After seeing the first movie, I was excited to see the sequel. After seeing it, I was disappointed. Really disappointed. I was expecting a lot more from it but I guess they are too scared to push the envelope.This film is about Jigsaw locking a few unlucky people in a booby trapped shelter and they must find a way out before they inhale too much of a lethal nerve gas and die. But they must watch out, for the traps Jigsaw has set in the shelter lead to death also.The beginning starts off good but it went downhill from there. The movie is weak. There are more people and more deaths but they're not good enough to make you happy. We don't care for some characters. We don't even care what happens to them. Then at the end, there's this twist. I heard the twist in IMDb before I watched this movie so maybe that's one reason I don't like this movie. Saw was such a great success that this sequel feels so sad, it shouldn't even be called a sequel.The plot is repeated for this sequel.The score for this film is great like any other Saw films. The energy and suspense from the first film did not came back for the second. It's not thrilling, suspenseful, nor scary. Fortunatley, there are moments that makes you cringe including the needle pit scene. Saw was just a great crime thriller that this must be the opposite.This is an OK movie.

We're then introduced to the main character of the show 'Donnie Whalberg'. When the torture begins Jigsaw is already in police custody, heavily guarded by a set of SWAT men and being talked to by Mr Wahlberg. What he doesn't realise is Jigsaw is playing with him to. Unlike the original where Jigsaw makes a brief appearance at the end John (Jigsaw) is in this movie from the start to the end. Being a little worse for the wear he also spills why he is devoting the rest of his life to testing human frailty. Not one to be missed if it is a decision between this and The Hostel pick Saw 2.

We have Tobin Bell reprising his role as John Kramer a.k.a Jigsaw, but this time we are actually treated to his immense talent. Every time Bell is on screen he commands ALL the attention of the audience and he does this all only by taking. The power he exudes behind the charismatic dialogue is truly unfounded. The rest of the cast isn't to be slept on either though; all the actors bring the terror, pain and utter confusion as the film progresses forward.

Decent follow up,"Gory as hell and proud of it, Saw seemingly came out of nowhere to grab cinema goers by the throat, shake them violently and vomit blood into their faces. Thanks to it's success a sequel was inevitable but when it followed the original in less than a year and still turned out to be a decent follow up that in places surpasses it's older brother was about as expected as the Spanish inquisition. And as the tagline boasts the level of depravity reaches all new levels.Setting the tone instantly, the first five minutes sees Jigsaw's latest victim having to make the decision between having his head splattered in a giant metal trap or carve his own eye out in order to retrieve the key to open it. True to the hype's promises the claret is gushing in seconds and when the cops arrive to investigate this rather unpleasant demise, the story properly kicks into gear. Bursting into a warehouse, the police led by detective Eric Matthews (Donnie ""New Kid On the Block"" Wahlberg) corner Jigsaw in his den and all seems to be neatly wrapped up. Before you can say ""Gee, that was a very brief and concise short film"" however the villain plays his ace in the hole; he has eight people locked up in a house riddled with traps who are slowly dying from breathing in air tinged with a tissue destroying virus and one of them is Matthew's delinquent teenage son.What follows plays out in two separate strands - Jigsaw plays his game of cat and mouse with the police while the eight victims of his scheme try to escape the house and meet all sorts of nasty ends along the way. Revealing too much more would give away too many of the twists and turns the plot takes along the way, but rest assured fans of the original will find plenty to relish in here. Spiked baseball bats, bladed hand traps, booby-trapped ovens and a pit filled with thousands upon thousands of used needles ramp the level of unpleasantness right up and there are none of the irritating flashbacks to disrupts proceedings like in the first film.It's not perfect of course. Grim and depraved it may be but 'Seven' it most certainly isn't and once again, every little twist has to be painstakingly explained but as far as squirm-in-your-seat film making goes, it's certainly effective. Jigsaw himself also has a far more active role this time round and makes a decidedly menacing presence but it is the link to the prequel that really seals the deal, a final act revelation so delightfully messed up it'll be with you for days.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Reasonable but not as good as the original.,"It seems like such a cliché to say it but I have to go along with the majority of other reviewers who seem to be agreed that 'Saw II' is basically not as good as the original. That still leaves a lot of scope however, given that 'Saw' was such an excellent film.It may just be that sequels never work (Godfather Part II being the exception that proves the rule!) But it is always disappointing when you have enjoyed the first one so much, to finish watching the second with a feeling of letdown.That said, Saw II is not in itself a bad film. It only really suffers in comparison to its predecessor. The pace of the sequel is good, the original premise is retained but with interesting new twists and the acting is, in general, better than average - without any one performance worthy of being singled out as excellent (with the possible exception of Tobin Bell's menacing portrayal of Jigsaw).One of the main problems here is that the script is crammed full of too many characters, and so there is little time for developing these and giving them real depth, with the result that a few of them are really fairly one-dimensional, about whom it is difficult to care too much. (This is a mistake that was very much NOT the case with the original!)Overall, it's OK. Go and see it. But just don't expect anything miraculous - and I'd certainly say that you should not see this film without seeing the original Saw first.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The script carries itself despite sub par acting.,"Writing, filming and producing a sequel to a film that is a surprise hit is always difficult. Doing it in under one year is even more challenging. Making it as good as the first film and in some ways better is nearly impossible, and I am pleased to say it was done.The script is fully capable of carrying itself without brilliant acting. At times the acting seemed contrived and almost forced, with obvious exceptions from Tobin Bell and occasionally Shawnee Smith. It seemed to in many ways prove David Mamet right when he said that the actors job is to just say the lines and the script, if it is good, will tell the story itself. It does. Lacking the complete element of surprise of the first film the writers of this script, while maintaining the conventions of the previous movie, do an excellent job of adding in twists and will keep you guessing on your first run through it.Tobin Bell is the one actor I appreciated in this movie and I may also be able to attribute much of that to the character he plays. On the whole the majority of the acting in this movie seemed to be at just above the level of a decent Haunted House tour. Not a good tour, a decent one. However the spectacle of gore and blood and the myriad of ways available for the characters to hurt, maim and kill each other will keep your mind off their performances and on keeping your popcorn down. It delivers everything and more that you can come to expect from this franchise.If you enjoyed the first movie then you will not be disappointed with this one. You may even become giddy. If you did not enjoy the first one you will not enjoy the second one. Well, you might if the first one was just ruined for you and that took you out of it. At any rate I can assure you it is worth the cost of admission.Oh yes, there will be blood.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One hell of a movie!,"Saw 2 is the sequel to the surprise hit ""Saw"". Something occurred to me. I recently found out that the original ""Saw"" had a 1 million dollar budget. I also read that it was about to be a straight-to-video/DVD release, but it got positive reviews, so it got released to theaters. Now if the first one was only released to DVD first, then I don't think there would've been a SAW 2. The only reason there is a sequel is because of how much money it made. I actually liked the first film. I also liked the second. It's a good horror sequel and it keeps getting intense by the minute.The film is basically about the sadistic killer ""Jigsaw"". A young detective is investigating the case of serial killer Jigsaw, who continues his deadly game on a new group of unlucky victims. The group is stuck in a booby trapped house. They have to play along with Jigsaw's rules and clues for survival. They are basically playing a game to keep their life.I'm not really sure if I liked the first more than the second. But I have to say that the first one had one hell of an ending and it was very shocking. But I felt that SAW 2 was one hell of a movie. With it's sick traps and bloody deaths.******POSSIBLE SPOILERS****** What I really liked about this movie is towards the end of the movie, Amanda & the young boy entered the room were the two victims were in the first film. They were in the same exact room, and I felt that it was so awesome and brilliant.I also feel that audiences should see the first film before they see the second. The first might get spoiled, so thats my suggestion.Let me just say hat SAW 2 is one hell of a movie. Towards the end you will be in a ride. I give this movie a 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
This SAW does not cut like the first,"First off, I'm not a hardcore horror movie fan (yes I saw the first one..Ha) but after seeing this film I feel that only the hardcore horror fan or Saw fan will really enjoy this moviewhy?Well, first off the acting is terrible, with one expectation of the Spanish guy in the movie.Next, the camera and editing was bizarre at times with extremely quick movements and odd edits  I guess with the idea to build suspense in the audienceMoving on, the film really was not scary at all. With the biggest scare coming out of the audience during person popping up in a scenebig dealLastly, after seeing the first Saw you tend to expect what's to come in most of the scenes. The scene that you don't expect tends to be too far-fetched and incomprehensible to enjoy.Well, if you're a fan of either Saw or horror films in general don't let my opinions steer you way from this filmbut if your like me the average Joe, save your money for KING KONG",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Perhaps disappointing when compared to the first but as a genre movie it's still one of the very best.,"""Saw"" was one of the most surprising movies of this decade. How would they ever have been able to top that very first surprising success. ""Saw"" was a fresh and surprising horror-flick that was different and more direct than any other movie from the same genre. It would been a real achievement if ""Saw II"" would had become a better movie than its predecessor. ""Saw II"" isn't a better movie but it still has plenty of originals and great to offer.There are several reasons why ""Saw II"" isn't as good as ""Saw"". First and foremost; the originality is gone and people already know sort of what to expect while watching this movie. Also the story and settings are a few other reasons. A whole house as playground this time, simply isn't as claustrophobic and psychological strong, as just one small dirty room, like in the first movie was the case. ""Saw"" mostly was a psychological horror movie in which you never knew what to expect and what actions the main characters would take. ""Saw II"" is for most part lacking this psychological horror element in the story. In ""Saw II"" there also are multiple characters who unwillingly participate in Jigsaw's games. Having multiple characters, yet again, isn't as scary and claustrophobic as just having two characters who are trying to find a way out of their positions. It also is harder to identify yourself with any of the characters. Also Jigsaw himself plays a far more prominent role in the movie this time. He has lots of screen time with as a result that he perhaps loses some of his mystery and therefor also some of his scariness.But if you have to judge this movie for what it is you have to conclude that it still is a powerful, gory, well made horror movie that is better than lets say 90% of other recent horror flicks. ""Saw II"" is mostly original in its games and settings and you never really know what to expect or who will be the next one to die. Although, when you have seen ""Saw"" you already know sort of what to expect and you know that the movie will end with a 'surprise' ending and in the movie itself nothing is what it seems at first sight. The 'surprise' ending isn't as good and powerful as in ""Saw"" was the case and perhaps it even is a bit too far fetched but it still leaves the door open for plenty of sequels, which is a good thing.""Saw II"" mostly relies on its gory moments and yes it has some original constructed and executed moments in the movie. Some things come as a real surprise and therefor ""Saw II"" still is a great mysterious and scary horror movie. It's an original genre movie that without doubt will surely please the fans.Most of the characters are pretty shallow but I some how think this was intentional to still maintain a sort of mysterious atmosphere and feeling. Donnie Wahlberg is a welcome addition to the Saw franchise and he does play a pretty good role. Jigsaw still is a scary enough villain, mainly thanks to Tobin Bell, who portrays him, who simply is a very good actor that perfectly knows how to play his character.Overall ""Saw II"" is a good looking and well made horror movie that is unique in its genre and has plenty of originals to offer to shock its viewers, as long as they can get over it that this movie will become nowhere as good as its successful predecessor.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"More Than Descent, But Nowhere Close To The First Movie.","Saw II is good, but it had quite a bit to live up to after the first ""Saw"". This movie focuses primarily on ""Jigsaw"", or John Kramer, unlike the first movie, which explained very little about him. Jigsaw is back for round two, with more victims, more blood, and more plot twists. Jigsaw has allowed himself to be apprehended by the cops, but it's just part of his game. Jigsaw has locked eight strangers in a sealed off house, and they have 2 hours two find an antidote for the deadly gas they're breathing, or face the bloody consequences. And Detective Eric Matthews must beat Jigsaw in a battle of wits to save his son Daniel, who is one of the people in house.This movie was highly entertaining, but its clearly not on the same level as the first movie. Most of what made the first one good, was noticeable here as well. Very creative traps, well planned plot twists and things like that. But this movie just didn't pack the same punch as the first movie. Still solid though.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One Horrible Movie,"This is absolutely one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. I liked the first one but I mean they really messed it up bad with this piece of garbage. I know there is a third one coming out this year and I hope to God it is not as bad or worse. The worst part of Saw 2 was the end. Sequels usually suck, this one especially did. It lives up nothing to the original, just plain stupid. I expected better, I got a HUGE disappointment. Shawnee Smith was a lot better in the first one. The killer is a geek, and the killing scenes suck. Yes, they are bloody, gory, but what horror movie isn't? This movie was a big ripoff. I hope 3 won't be.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Not terrible but not needed either.,"If I have to make one statement about the nature of the on-going horror (and specifically) the slasher trend it would be this; No good formula works twice.This is the simplest reason why Saw II is an inferior sequel as so many films are. James Wan had a clever idea for his debut picture, it was well thought out, nicely paced, and offers a really scary twist ending which was totally unpredictable. Saw II presents a different string of characters and bloody chapters, but at its centre, this is pretty much the same thing, only less effective. The story is far more shallow, and moves too quickly. The acting is weak, the plot twists are predicable, not to mention the the ending which is totally plagerized from the Saw script. What is frustrating is that it offers a cliff hanger for what is probably an even worse sequel. The Saw franchise is the latest domino effect with each film's ending giving way to a new beginning. They are now up to #6. By the time they decide to stop the franchise there will be so many Saws that the public is liable to forget the brilliance of where the idea began.Jigsaw plays a more ambitious game this time. He has locked a bunch of people in a house. The instructional cassette informs them thay they have (without knowing) inhaled a lethal gas which will take affect in two hours. In the room is a safe, and inside is the antidote. They have two hours to find the numbers to the code which are located somewhere within his booby trapped house. The youngest of these captives is Daniel Matthews, and his father Eric is a locally renowned police detective. He and his team have miraculously arrested jigsaw, but can detective Matthews get him to reveal the whereabout of his son before time runs out?I like the way Saw II is photographed. Each location uses a different filter to change the color scheme. The house is tinted golden making it look kind of retro or antique. Jigsaw's headquarters are tinted green, which is a very sickly color, and one of the last scene takes us back to the cellar bathroom from Saw. The colour is tinted Blue/and white, which are very cold colours.I guess the only reason I am not appalled by Saw II is the fact that I was expecting it to be less impressive than Saw (which it is). Saw truly is a story fit for one film, not 2 (let alone 6 or more)",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Twist no one SAW coming,"After being able to see Part I the sequel was a must see. Of course as skeptical as I can be never really thought a sequel can be this good. The movie no change from the first of course is a bloody foul language film that under 17 is a must to watch flick, but no nudity to what I recall. Of course Jigsaw is still trying to play the playful life tester that is only getting worse by the minute. The introduction of the first chapter of the film is captivating and it's a simple sample of what more is coming. I believe this film might be a little more gruesome than part I and a lot more games are played.I recommend this film to the horror loving audience now if the sight of blood the feeling of nauseous arises I suggest to think twice about the film. There is action, suspense, twist and of course thrill that makes Saw II one of the best in my opinion.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Safe Place?,"Saw II is no deviation from the formula. The movie involves a game of death and twists in which both audience and characters are confused
and scared. The acting and choices from some characters was a bit irritating but overall this is is a decent sequel. The movie feels a little too much like watching forced escape room intelligence (numbers, keys, etc.) at points but it doesn't kill the movie (only its characters). Saw II keeps the franchise alive as a decent installment with it's storyline and gore and delivers upon expectations for a movie of the genre.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
There will be Blood,"Jigsaw is back and this time he has 8 people locked in a house full of traps and only a few hours to live and it's up to Detective Matthews to save them as one of the unlucky 8 people is his son.I absolutely loved the first Saw it was brilliant and very original and I'll be the first to admit that when I heard that a sequel was being prepped to be released only one year after the original I thought that it was gonna be bad but gladly I was wrong. SAW II was a relentless, enthusiastically directed and twisted little gem. Just like any other good film, this continuation had a powerful weapon in its holster, one that Hollywood so often forgets to bring to the table when creating their ""products"" and that's a strong screenplay. The bases were mostly covered in that department with riveting chain of events, a clever puzzle like nature when it came to its mind toying mystery, some heart (the Matthews ordeal) and a near flawless juggling act in terms of the two main plot lines which were steamrolled forward simultaneously. To make matters much better. Now being that this is a sequel, some of what made the original special was lost in the name of not fully repeating the first film while new goodies were gained. I particularly loved the ""Hannibal Lecter/Clarice"" like mental warfare Jigsaw and Matthews shared. It made for a compelling listen/watch, was the soul of the film while acting as an interesting contrast to the more action oriented ""in the house"" shenanigans. The further exploration of my fave Bath Robe wearing killer's psyche worked really well! Although I craved more info (I still don't know why Jigsaw is so freaking nuts!), the added insight was appreciated and went to prove me wrong. Knowing more about the lad didn't make him less scary. I think I fear him more now! Donnie Wahlberg (Det. Matthews) played it smart; he underplayed it while displaying an endearing mix of toughness and vulnerability. Tobin Bell (Jigsaw) was very much focused and controlled as Jigsaw Dina Meyer (Kerry) did what she had to do adequately most of the time, although I didn't buy a couple of her ""reaction shots"" and wished she'd do more than stare at PC screens. Shawnee Smith (Amanda) was bang on in her role; selling it to the max. I'm so happy they brought her back and gave her more to do.All in all I really enjoyed this movie much better than the first.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I couldn't see her doing the brain work and getting people into the house like nor could I see her doing the massacurs like he did. From there, it was good. I loved all the blood and edge of the seat suspense. But I just got a good pointer for you guys when you make the 3rd or the 4th Saw. Take the main CSI guy ""Grissom"" and put him in the house. Like do a special guest on CSI or something. I bet you would have fans from Saw and from CSI watching that one. Cause I cant figure out who would win. I mean Grissom is a pretty good thinker and I bet he could get out of all of those things in Saw 2. I can just see it.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"I ""Saw"" it ""two"".","This is an immature and decidedly teenage thriller movie. Unfortunately, the violence in this movie gets in the way of the potential horror of the script. The premise contains enough material to construct a half-way decent horror film, (as did the very similar ""Cube""), however, it cannot resist temptation, and indulges itself continuously with low-end graphic-novel style violence.Sure, the odd hack/stab/bullet/club is effective, but, with so many identical and self-referential films in this failing genre, each action halves the effect of the next. What impact does the first bullet have, say, after watching 60+mins of additional violence? Very little. It is it's own worst enemy.By the way, notice how for the length of the entire movie the swirling, ""tortured"", rubbishy atmospheric soundtrack? This just further undermines any potential long-term horror as it consistently blending every scene into the next - every scene is equal. I've never seen a movie with so much violence and gore lack so much power.Thankfully the cinema I went to shows these films at a reduced price, so I'm too upset about this hunk of trash. Not scary, not suspenseful, not funny, not reasonable, but (thank God) not too long.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Better than expected.,"I really, really, REALLY enjoyed the original SAW. When I asked friends who had seen it what they thought, some were impressed, others weren't. I, for one, enjoyed the premise - that this one man forces these people to confront their mortality, and allows (if not forces) them to decide whether they really want to live. I liked that part of the plot, because it was something I hadn't see before. Also, the variety and complexity of the traps were great. And, the twist at the end of the movie was, at least for me (forgive me for being naive) out of nowhere, and got me instantly hooked on the film.For the sequel, I had mixed expectations. I wanted more of the same mental manipulation - I didn't want to see anything coming. I was worried, however, that the speed with which this sequel released would force it to be sub-par, another sequel to tarnish the memory of the original.That was not the case.SAW 2 is amazing. Start to finish. Yes, a little gory (not for the squeamish). Yes, the acting was good but not Oscar-winning. But the storyline was adequate, and made sense. The character development, especially in the case of John the Killer, was a great addition. And, the twists, turns and traps were all great. More than great. Better than I could've hoped for. Whether you liked SAW or not, this movie, in my subtle opinion, is entirely different, while keeping the parts of the original you liked. I was ecstatic when I left the theater, and cannot wait to go see it again.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Surprisingly good sequel,"I went to see Saw 2 assuming it would suck, but to my surprise it rocked. I didn't think that I would leave the film shocked or wanting more, but I did. While I was closing in on the end, I felt that it was going to be predictable, but my predictions were incorrect. It is a must see. Unfortunately, many horror sequels end in disappointment. This film rates with the few successful horror sequels. It definitely deserves to be rated with such ""sequel"" classics as Halloween, Friday the 13th, and Scream. Luckily for us, it was not as disappointing as Nightmare on Elm Street part 2. When you see this film you will not be disappointed.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Massive Hype=Excellent Reviews for Terrible Movie!!,"First of all I am blown away that Saw II has received rave reviews from not only critics but people who have seen it. This is a typical Hollywood movie,that lacks emotion and intelligent dialog and carries on with pointless blood and guts only to insert a massive plot twist in the end.Over the past three years horror movies have become so similar in script and violence that they are ruining American Cinema. What ever happened to slasher flicks, with a touch of humor or realist views of horror. Now a days there is always some form of game or puzzle which the characters must solve, and Saw II follows this pattern. The twist in the end isn't satisfying one bit, even though it is surprising you know it is coming in some form or another; thus, taking away any scary aspects of the movie. Sorry to say but Saw II is an embarrassment to the horror genre and my intelligence. My advice to anyone is who is listening to all these fantastic reviews, just ignore these people they have no comprehension of real horror movies and should not be trusted. Save your Ten bucks and spend it on renting ""The Shining"" or a Jason flick.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Not as good as the original, but still a fun time","I enjoyed the original Saw for its ability to build an atmosphere of discomfort and hold it for the length of the film. It was creative and disturbing and just a really fun horror film, and Jigsaw -- the villain -- was one of the most refreshing horror villains to come along in a long time.Saw II does not quite live up to its predecessor in that it leaves too many plot holes and -- for the most part -- ends up resorting to having its characters just walk around endlessly for much of the film. Certain characters seem to hold no purpose and some questions are left completely unanswered, such as the motivations of some of the victims locked in the house by Jigsaw.As well, some of the traps set up in the house are so obvious that the effectiveness fails. You are left in the same position as most bad horror films where you ask yourself of the main characters, ""Why are they doing that?""However, even with all of these shortcomings, the film is a fun little picture to watch. Like the original, the setup of the film is unique and thus it is nice to see something in a horror film that is more than just more of the same. As with the first film, there is a twist at the end of this one that was very impressively pulled off.

Hello Again.,"Saw II is a decent enough sequel to the original movie with enough plot twists to keep non-gore fans guessing until the end. Horror fans, like me, can lap up the dark as hell direction, inventive death scenes and overall sadistic tone of this meandering sequel even if the whole thing seems pretty uninspired. Technicality wise, the Saw films are top-notch even if repetitive and scraping the barrel for justification of means. The editing is dizzying and the direction is pretty much hands on to keep the narrative rolling and the sadism coming.

"Brutal, twisted, exhilarating.","I should preface this by saying I have been watching horror movies since age 4. I've seen everything the genre has to offer. From the old Romero movies up to Hide and Seek, I've got it handled.Saw 2 is not a horror movie. It is far more.I liked Saw a lot. One of my favorites. Knew it was flawed, but liked it a lot. The claustrophobic setting was beautiful and the twist was heart-pounding. I had my doubts about Saw 2, as the cast seemed ""contemporary"" and the setting of a house rather than a bathroom made me fear it would be too open to be enjoyable.My fears were wrong, much to my delight.A strong stomach IS required. The plot is already known from the previews, a bunch of people in a house and they need to save themselves with the clues as per the game. One of the best features is the lack of a recognizable actor save Amanda and Jigsaw himself (you might recognize Donny Wahlberg, granted). This gives the movie a fantastic ""anything goes"" feel where the audience doesn't feel as though any character is safe from Jigsaw's traps.In addition, the nature of the house gives a horrid feeling of dread at all times, that a trap could spring from a doorknob or a tripwire that we don't see, and every idea that a character has to free themselves that doesn't seem like Jigsaw would have wanted it makes the viewer want to look away and wait for the loud noise and the scream. Saw 2 mastered fear, period. You wait for bad things to happen, even when they don't you don't feel as if the danger is gone.Saw 2 is sadistic by and large. It's not the goriest movie ever, the bloodiest, or the darkest, but it is the most sadistic. It revels not in killing people, but HURTING them, causing pain both physical and mental. One thing of Saw (perhaps not the unrated version, I've not seen that yet) was that we weren't shown much of the direct actions. If we did, it was fast and brief. Not so here, we have to watch it happen right along with the other characters (group setting and all).The plot is bigger here, more convoluted and the movie has more twists and turns. The games are harder to stomach and the characters, sadly, less developed. We only know of the characters what they tell each other, and they don't say much. That's the only complaint. An extra 10 minutes could have been spent giving us info on some of them.I've never seen a movie as tense as Saw 2 (not even the aptly titled High Tension), and with the exception of Fight Club, I have never been so shocked at an ending (again, not even High Tension, or the famed Sixth Sense). Indeed, near the climax of Saw 2 was the first time I've ever made an incoherent noise in the theater out of my utter speechlessness.I can't say the movie is flawless, as I said the characters are rather undeveloped, the traps will seem unnecessarily brutal for many, the entire setup will seem over-the-top for those who somehow thought Saw was more ""grounded"", and the twists may be too intricate for many people to pay attention to (the internet is alight with discussions on this).For any fan of thrillers, horror, and those with strong constitutions, I say go see it. You won't be disappointed.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
They turned SAW into a TV series cop drama with this dog.,"I give this an especially bad rating because the first SAW was sooo good. What is missing from this movie that was in the first is the raw brutality, the mystery and the excitement that comes with identifying with the characters. The villain also acts a bit differently and the tortures are not as clever.This time around we get a low budget poorly acted crappily written mess.The point of this movie was to be scary or entertaining or both. It is none of the above. This time we get a fast food drive through biggie size version, where a group of people get stuck with a saw puzzle all at once instead of the more intricate and personalized situations from the previous movie.What we wind up with is a dumb cop drama where a cop is trying to protect his family, can we say cheese plate au gratin? Yes it's very cheesy formula crap of all the junk that DOESN'T work in a horror flick.

The games get better.,"Jigsaw returns for another series of mind-blowing torture and relentless head games.This time headed and co-written by Darren Lynn Bousman, as opposed to James Wan from the original who this time has turned to executive producer. Leigh Whannel also returns to script this instalment alongside Bousman.Given the incredibly high standard that the original set, i think its safe to say that there wasn't many people who were expecting this to be as good as its hugely acclaimed predecessor despite the creators of the original on the production.However...Saw 2 is able to stand up to the original and then some. It goes much deeper than the before, its amazingly inventive and it answers the questions you may have had about the original.It is a lot more graphic and has more intense deadly games that will keep you on the edge of your seat. I found so many things to cringe at in this film and i really could feel my heart pounding throughout the film.Saw 2 is better than the original even though the ending didn't have the impact that the original did (at least in my opinion) its what happens throughout that makes it one of the best sequels in the history of cinema.The script is ingenious and the overall result is so much more surprising than you could ever imagine.

Though a little vision-clashing still pretty good!,"After one year Saw returns with a sequel Saw II. Although I enjoyed this film, I have to say I think new director Darren Lynn Bousman and original director James Wan had a clash of vision for the series. Several things in this film Bousman develops even more disturbing games for his victims, which are now mostly ex-convicts and makes them all move throughout his game trying to free themselves of a deadly neuro-toxin which is now in their blood. My biggest problem is that Jigsaw seems to challenge the individual, not a group. More importantly, every task in this film seems to be accomplished if they just work together, which obviously because they're ex-convicts, they don't. Nevertheless, there's still a lot of scare potential in this film and come the end there's another mind-blowing twist that knocks you completely off guard.

This is Not a Sequel !!!,"Very disappointing ""sequel"" but it was expected if you have a new director and a new writer; First this director fail to recreate the same darkish, tense atmosphere. The plot was dragged to poorly imitate the original movie; they just took an old script and put ""Saw II"" as the title,(I'm not sarcastic, they really did it!!) What the hell were they thinking! That's called Fraud!!.And the more pathetic is that the movie made no sense with the original, in ""Saw 1"" the ""sick games"" were supposed to be ""winnable"" if the player was willing to play and take the pain; in this poor sequel most of the games are ""unwinnable"" they are designed to kill the players no matter what they do. They never get a chance to win!! This is a revenge movie, not a ""Saw"" movie. In the original ""Saw"" the logic was: Take the pain and survive (and learn to appreciate life) Or give-up and die in pain.In ""Saw 2"" you don't see any of that, just a bunch of people being killed one by one; they are not given real chances to survive. They are not playing, they are being hunted.Instead of trying to cheat the public the producers should have put a different title to this piece of junk.The next time you go to see a ""Sequel"" make sure it's done by the same writer and director of the original.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery
the real start of Saw,"Leigh Whannell was back in business to write part 2. But times did changed due the original Saw. James wan had left the building in came Darren Lynn Bousman who also did a bit of writing. He stayed until part 4. Torture Porn, as the genre was called was the next big thing so they had to focus more on the gore. And they did, Saw II started of immediately with a device killing a victim. Back again was Jigsaw, and here he took the most important part of the story, it stayed that way until the end of the franchise.The focus of the story was here more on one of the coppers who's child is captured by Jigsaw. On the other hand, we had to go back to the devices made by Jigsaw. And here we had a bit of the feeling like in Cube. Cube was also very original but part 2 failed because you have seen it all before so here we got a bunch of scum being hold captured by Jigsaw. To survive they had to play the game. There is a bit that naturally had to do with the captured ones but it is a bit too focused on them. There's a part that in fact nothing has to do with the story. And the weird thing is that Shawnee Smith was back again as Amanda and was captured again by Jigsaw, it looked so stupid but wait until the last minutes. Again, the writers decided to keep the best for last. The best acting was done by Tobin Bell again followed by Donnie Wahlberg. Dina Meyer wasn't convincing for me as a copper, sadly I have met her and congenial wasn't her middle name.But they brought in more devices and more blood and even more torturing done on-screen. The most creepy device was simply the syringes being used as device. Saw II was something completely different from part one but it was more a horror than a police story with an unpredictable ending.End for the horror buffs, again two references towards old school horror, one is a picture hanging on the wall with a kind of pinhead design, the other is when jigsaw is showing the way he answers, the last house on the left...Gore 3/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 4/5 Story 4/5 Comedy 0/5",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Saw II is really just an update of the first film but with more people and a larger location, although that doesn't mean it has to be disappointing.","Saw II has that uncanny ability to make you feel as you're watching one of the many, many American TV serials that have popped up in recent years. You know the sort; the drawn out and somewhat repetitive sequence of events that lead from one dark or dingy set piece onto another. The element of crime and murder twinned with the fact many-a police officers are running around trying to solve a crime in progress just cements the feeling and it's this rapid approach to the material that hammers home the race-against-time atmosphere throughout. But in essence, this is alright if done sparsely and within moderation  the reason I hate most television serials has a lot to do with the drawn out manner they take to the material; from face value, characters can travel a lot of distance over a lot of time and not really achieve much which is frustrating, but Saw II seems to get down to brass tacks and just gives you what you want.This 'what you want' is a mixture of suspense; race against time; something emotionally involving at stake and generally horror and/or gore. They are the hallmarks of generic horror and Saw II delivers perhaps not what you demand but what the genre demands on top of a grungy and depressing approach to cinematography that compliments the enclosed and bleak setting. Much like the first Saw film, unknowns are trapped in a room with no initial knowledge of how they got there  things will become clearer at nicely spaced intervals.They are there, of course, due to the actions of themselves but the instigations of one other man; he is Jigsaw (Bell) and in Jigsaw we have a villain well suited to the piece. As a horror villain, Jigsaw is not what we expect: he is old, decrepit and barely able to breath or talk. The effectiveness of Jigsaw is in his presence and his 'type' of villain. Saw II is the sort of film that will have most of its viewers squirm in some fashion; it taps into basic fears and phobias but does not make an obvious study. Whether someone's fear or phobia are needles or enclosed spaces, Saw II carries an unpleasant but effective atmosphere and the idea that its villain is an old and incapacitated old man complete with breathing apparatus adds to the squirming nature it carries  do we like seeing an elderly and frail man being threatened and knocked about like this despite his clear delicate complexion?But of course this effectiveness in appearance of a character can only carry as many cons as it can pros. This is because the emphasis on the weak and frail is so apparent and made to be so effective that it's almost impossible to believe that someone of this disposition is able to own so much real estate and is able to set up so many elaborate traps, not to mention to be able to handpick people out of society and place them there. Jigsaw is an interesting character; the sort of character that by appearance and build appears weak and useless but is constantly in control of any given situation and given a few twists that unravel towards the end, seems to be able to remain deadly calm even when the ball isn't entirely in his court.The victims this time range from big, broad, egotistical Hispanics to young and insecure kids that are barely teenagers but act as a link to the bigger picture. This is in opposition to two guys, in a room, with restraints around their legs. Saw II's hook is that these several people are given the freedom of their surroundings and the surroundings are an entire house with extra rooms complete with individual traps and 'tasks' of their own. One of this Saw edition's grizzlier scenes involves a woman having to go down into a pit of syringes in order to fetch a key  it's a set up or an idea similar to Fincher's 1995 film 'Se7en' with the idea that people pay for their 'sins' (or crimes in Saw II's case) by way of meeting them head on in an orgy of terror and pain. On this occasion, the person down there (or supposed to be down there) distributed the syringes, complete with drugs, and must now meet his wrong-doing head on.The film forces its race against time idea upon us via inclusion of a poisonous gas slowly making its way through the victims lungs  if they don't solve the bigger picture, they all die. This actually works against the film in the sense one of the reasons I liked the first Saw was that they had time to think, work things out and do their best to escape. Here, they have limited time and I feel the film would've been better without the inclusion of the gas. What's at stake here is the well being of the hero's child, Daniel (Knudsen), it is policeman Eric's (Wahlberg) problem so remove the poisonous gas and allow the many traps and general desperation of the captives to act as the primary threat to the well being of Daniel.Indeed, when the captives find out who Daniel is this should act as a further dramatic twist but it falls marginally flat due to the fact we know the gas will kill everyone eventually anyway, regardless of how much everybody knows. The film is by no means great but as a dramatic and grungy thriller with a constant whiff of unpleasantness, Saw II works on a basic dramatic and horrific level.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Fantastic!,"When there's a sequel to a great movie that you really like then you got mixed feelings. Off course you want to see it but you think it just can't be as good as the previous one. Well this one is even better. I'm not really trustworthy here because I also liked the sequels to 'the cube' and 'the godfather' as opposed to everyone else.The story is pretty much the same. Play the game by the rules, you learn your lesson and you live. This movie is, just like the previous one, so unpredictable and it drags you from one plot twist into an other. No stupid horror clichés, no 'ooooooooh I got it'-moments after ten minutes and no plots that can't be explained.Bottom line: stop reading and go see the damn movie.

turn off your brain and your gag reflex and enjoy,"In 2004, ""Saw"", a little independent horror film, starring the actor best known for his work in ""The Princess Bride"" and ""Hot Shots!"" was foisted upon unsuspecting audiences. The flawed, but tense flick inadvertently created a film franchise that maybe shouldn't have been.""Saw II"" takes the life and death game of physical and psychological torture to another level. The first film spent most of its time in a single dank public restroom, whereas this film opens things up quite a bit. Things get started when a police informant is found murdered by some sort of medieval torture device. The investigation leads the cops to a creepy old man who begins to play mental games with the head detective, played by Donny Wahlberg, who spends the whole film struggling to act like Mark. The film crosscuts between the police investigation, and the ticking time bomb of a house that nine strangers are trapped in.""Saw II"" is an intense, edge of your seat, thriller with flashy, but effective fast-paced editing that leaves no time for thought. By the time the end credits roll, the experience was an enjoyable one, but at a cost. The stylish editing and over-the-top death scenarios can't conceal the fact that half the plot stays stationary the whole time, and that the other half is stocked with characters whose sole motivation is to assist the plot. It's a fun, popcorn movie, but it fails under the weight of its own high expectations.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A load of POO!!!,"There were approximatley four parts of this ""Horror film"" that made me squirm...and the other hour and forty minutes were a complete bore.Let's begin with were it all went wrong. 1) The acting- I felt the acting was better in the first one (I'm not kidding) Wahlberg and Meyers performances were as flat as the plot, not to mention how ridiculous and silly all of the abductees were acting.2)Lack of terror-Tobin ""Jigsaw"" Bell had more screen time than the rest of the cast, when your face is constantly on screen it's hard to be a menacing force. Also, the ""trick"" ending was a complete letdown. While it may come as a surprise to some people, i felt the execution was sluggish and NOT SCARY!!Recently, I have heard that there will be a Saw 3 & 4...

Better than the Original!,"Following the line of gruesome death scenes, surprising plot twists and creepy clowns, Saw II directed by Darren Lynn Bousman and written by Bousman and Leigh Whannel (he played Adam in Saw) will definitely make you jump out of your seat.The Jigsaw Killer is at it again. The movie begins with an unknowing victim trapped in a room and subject to self mutilation in order to save his life. This crime scene draws the attention of Detective Eric Matthews, played by New Kids on the Block's Donnie Wahlberg.In the events that follow, a group of seven extremely unlucky individuals find themselves playing one of Jigsaw's twisted games while trying to find an anecdote for the lethal poison seeping through their veins and a way out of the booby trapped house.Saw II immediately grabs your attention and keeps it for the entire 90 minutes of blood, gore and death.Everything in this movie fits perfectly - from the camera shots, to the actors, and all the plots. Saw II is creatively mastered from every angle.The sequel also takes time to make a connection back to the original movie to clarify the relationship between Jigsaw and his first set of victims. Jigsaw's motives and philosophy of his work is also revealed in Saw II.At first it's hard to decide which movie is better Saw or Saw II, but in the end I would have to vote for the sequel  shocking isn't it! In the original, Dr. Lawrence, played by Cary Elwes was not a good actor and somewhat took away from the movie. In addition, the single room scene became somewhat stagnant.On the other hand, in the sequel, all the characters were well cast and the continuous motion only added to the suspense.Overall, Saw II receives three and a half out of four stars. Scary movies just don't get any better than this. I truly hope they make this set into a trilogy.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Some Mistakes, But Worth Every Penny","First and foremost, know this: Saw II is probably one of the sickest, twisted movies I have ever watched in my entire life, rivaled only by the first one. Having said that, let me also say that I loved it. Theater ticket prices in my area nowadays are ridiculously high, but even though I'd vowed to only ever see Harry Potter movies on opening nights, this was definitely an exception and it was worth every bit of money I'd dished out. (And all the effort I'd put into my makeup to make myself look over 18 so I could watch it.)As soon as I left the theater with my friend, she and I were busy caught up in our fangirl squee-age about the brilliant story and plot twists, which can only have come from Leigh Whannell, who was the screenwriter for this part as well as the first (and starring in the first). I didn't see it coming. Did you see it coming? I didn't. Granted, there were a few scenes that were painfully predictable (-1) but the ending more than makes up for that.What I was disappointed with, however, was the obviously different style of this movie from the first one. If you be so kind as to recall those jumpy, flashy scenes that look like time elapsed photography (like when the camera was spinning around and around Amanda while she had the jaw trap on); there are similar flashes but to me they seemed like watered-down versions of the originals. (Another -1.) It made me miss James Wan incredibly. Another thing was the inconsistency with settings. We all saw that the bathroom Adam and Lawrence were locked in led out into an abandoned work building, which is strangely altered in the second story. (The final -1.)So that tallies up my final score to a 7/10, but other than that, this movie was the best. Despite what others believe as it being a crass artless pointless excuse to create scenes of unspeakable gore, it is far beyond that. My final words of advice would be: don't miss the opportunity to see this movie. =)",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
When in comparison with the original-BETTER,"I was a fan of Saw last year. Even though similar plot lines have developed before (the superior se7en comes to mind), Saw still felt original and twisted enough to maintain my interest and when combined with an awesome ending- I was won over. Now it is a year later and the story of the Jigsaw killer continues. This movie is not some lame sequel, yet a worthy follow-up of its predecessor. The acting was far better in this movie. The gore was amped up. And above all else, Saw II managed to maintain a feel of obscure discomfort and unease while watching. I had my doubts at first, but after seeing it , I am very glad this sequel was made. If the quality (by quality i mean -good disturbing psychological thriller material) of these films can remain, then I would gladly welcome more sequels in this series. PS-don't let anyone ruin the ending for you!",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
New game. Different pieces.,"I liked the first Saw (2004) because it has a good mystery and was suspenseful along with it having good acting, and a disturbingly creepy feel to it; the sequel Saw 2 (2005) was a good sequel to the first movie that had some good things about it that I liked, along with there being things did not work well in the movie. Also, the movie has the reveal of the Jigsaw killer played by Tobin Bell, if you do not know about him, I will not spoil his motivation on why he does what he does; but I will say the name of the character which is John Kramer.The acting is not bad and the performances from the actors, I especially like Eric Matthews played by Donnie Wahlberg who was believable as this police officer trying to find his son who is in Jigsaw's game. The victims of the game were also believable, and you can feel the panic coming from them when they need to figure out how to escape certain rooms or traps that are activated in the rooms. Something I will say is that some of the characters in the game would get annoying and they would turn into idiots at certain moments in these traps, and they will sometimes push each other into a trap that is supposed to be specifically designed for them to do it.The killer Jigsaw/John Kramer has more to his backstory that is dark but interesting in knowing why he is doing this kind of stuff to people, and I did like that we get to see him more in this movie compared the first. I will not spoil anything major, but there are two twists in the movie that are surprising and make sense when it comes to connecting to the plot, along with the location of the movie being disturbing and the traps in the rooms being designed in interesting ways for the people stuck in this situation. Also, I liked how they went back and forth between the police figuring out where the people in the game were, and the people playing the game and trying to survive it.Saw 2 (2005) was not as good as the first, but it was still a good sequel; I liked the traps, the acting, and that we get to know more about the Jigsaw killer in the movie and what his motivation for doing this is. People who cannot handle gore should not watch this because they will not like this movie like the first, but if you liked the first Saw movie then you will like this sequel depending on if you like what is done in the movie. I liked Saw (2004) and think Saw 2 (2005) was not a bad follow-up; give it a watch if you like the first, and if you do not like these kinds of movies, this movie is not for you.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"We come for the depravity, we stay to connect the dots","I saw the first 'Saw' film with a good friend of mine. She left in tears, crying all the way home.Naturally, we had no choice but to set off for the second.What really intrigued me before we even got into the theater was the active carding going on. Since when does this happen? I can't speak for the rest of the world, but I barely knew the concept even had merit in Montreal.Naturally, I expected the gore to blow my mind.Interestingly enough, it did not perform such an action. Mind you, this film is truly gruesome when it decides to be. One second you'll have generic paddlin' gore and then the next your eyeballs will feel violated and your skin will crawl for the poor fool on screen.The gore isn't what matters here though. There's a lot going on in this film. I'd go so far as to say that its very machinations are superior to its prequel in every way, exempting the lack of a consistent ""ick"" factor and one very depressing aspect of the film...The characters are horrible. There is no one to love in this film. Well, okay, the most likable character is Shawnee Smith (who returns from the first film to endure some more pain) but it's hard to pay attention to how good she is when everyone around her is attracting your eyes and ears with just how much you wish you were knocking their teeth out.Oh yes, and Jigsaw is an extremely likable character despite being our featured antagonist.What I intended to get at (before I decided to ramble) was just how fun it is after this movie, to piece everything together. While watching, certain things will seem foolish or flawed (and as I've told ""plot pickers"" of the first film, this would be false with one possible exception) but inevitably come together and before you have time to process it, something else will make sense and by the end of all this processing you've still got some thinking to do on the way home.Awesome Tobin Bell, awesome Shawnee Smith, some lukewarm but welcome Dina Meyer and a whole lot of uncomfortable squirming every time someone is about to get punctured, prodded, sliced, diced or otherwise ripped to pieces by god knows what.7/10 or 3 and 1/2 stars",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Wow,"Just got back from watching Saw II. I'd never seen the first one, never want to really, and I must admit when I heard that they'd come out with a sequel so soon, I rolled my eyes thinking to myself ""eh, just another blatant Hollywood attempt to cash in on the existing popularity of a hit movie"". But I went along with my friends to watch it anyway. And I came out of the theater with the credits rolling a very very impressed man. The story, the camera work, the violence, everything just blew me away. The movie also manages to throw some social commentary at you. But what I really loved was the subtle hints that the director threw at the viewers all throughout the movie. Right from the beginning, you see things, hear things, things that seem really unassuming and harmless at first, but at the end of the movie, all of it ties up for an explosive twist. The final twist of the movie caught me totally off guard, I don't think I've been so surprised by a movie twist since ""The Others"" in 2001. This is a great movie, and if you're not scared of blood and are a horror/thriller fan, you owe it to yourself to watch this movie. Now to go get Saw 1 in DVD...",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
SAW 2 director in need of help!!,"I believe that the director for SAW2 did not give us that edgy shock that was delivered in SAW.

"A movie that makes you feel stupider for just watching it,","I hated SAW with a passion. There was no gore, no suspense, loads of plot holes, and ""shocker"" ending thought up at the last second, not to mention it damn near plagiarized the much superior Se7en. How can the sequel get any worse? Well I went to Block Buster to spend my free rental, I didn't see anything halfway interesting so I grabbed SAW 2 because it can't be worst than the first and it got so much praise and hype.So it starts almost exactly like part one. This guy has an iron mask filled with nails that will snap. OK I know for a fact it won't be gory because it'll just cover his face, what's the point. So I was right, just a little cheap blood. It goes on very slow paced with characters no one gives a damn about and never a reason to care if they live or die. Eventually everyone is locked in a room with no idea how they got there. They get a message that each one of them can unlock a safe and each one knows a number. Wait, did you ever see the movie Cube? Wow, they just ripped off Cube this time. But Cube had suspense and some gory moments and Saw one and two don't have either. So everyone of these idiots blinds runs right into every single trap without thing about it. It's like an hour in a half of watching rats walk into a mouse trap for a chunk of cheese. Not to mention that this movie isn't anywhere near as gory as it's hyped to be. as far as gore and violence go this would be a 3/10, even that snooze fest Hostel had a little more blood than this dung heap. Oh yeah and this Jigsaw killer is the lamest horror villain since the Leprechaun. Jigsaw is just a poor man's John Doe (Se7en) and Hannibal (in this movie he blatantly rips off Hannibal.) So just like SAW one everyone is stupid, there's no gore, and you already know who's going to die and how. For example ""Hey I should craw into this giant oven, nothing could possibly go wrong here!"" The movie treats it's viewers like idiots, and you know what after all the praise both movies got maybe they have a point. And like SAW one this movie does another moronic plot twist that will either leave you laughing or just insulted. Not to mention like SAW one this isn't the slightest bit scary. I think it's made to freak out teenie boppers who think I Know What You Did Last Summer was scary.How do people say this movie is gory anyway? If you thought this was gory I'll bet you wet yourself in terror at the very mention of The Little Mermaid. You'll be better of renting or buying something good, like Se7en or Cube.

Jigsaw is still there and that's enough,"Obviously the effects of part 1 were quite impressive, that movie created a brand character and now the effects of Jigsaw have overwhelmed the quality of the movie in part 2. The story of part 2 still creates excitement entertaining and has a successful twist. The horror and thriller are still portrayed well enough. However, it is difficult to say whether the quality of this part is a breakthrough or an attractive continuation. In contrast, part 2 almost seems like an episode from a TV show and has more of a fan service effect than a deeper character development. Anyone expecting this will likely be disappointed. The supporting characters exist like some game characters in some whatever PC game, with almost no special emotions. The story about the detective and his son only stops at a mildly interesting level and does not go into much depth. Some details are sketchy and weird.

As good as the first movie...,"Following up the 2004 movie ""Saw"", this 2005 sequel titled ""Saw II"" from writers Leigh Whannell and Darren Lynn Bousman, turned out ot be a rather enjoyable and entertaining movie. And it is indeed a worthy sequel, carrying on the things started in the 2004 movie, while adding upon the legacy in a very interesting way.The storyline in ""Saw II"", as written by Leigh Whannell and Darren Lynn Bousman, is quite good. The writers managed to keep the thrills and excitement of the first movie, while adding new elements to the franchise. It is a storyline that once again traps a group of people inside a building, whilst having to solve tasks in order to stay alive. But human nature and selfish preservation tends to make people do irrational things.The acting performances in ""Saw II"" are good, the cast ensemble was definitely good and interesting. It was nice to see Tobin Bell, Dina Meyer and Shawnee Smith return to reprise their characters and roles from the first movie.I have to admit that I was genuinely entertained by ""Saw II"" and sitting down to watch it again here in 2023 makes it my third time watching it since 2005. So there is a good amount of replay value to the script and storyline, which is a testiment to the skills of writers Leigh Whannell and Darren Lynn Bousman.""Saw II"" amps up the visual carnage in comparison to the previous movie.

The special effects in ""Saw II"" look good and are quite visceral, with some very nice contraptions and traps.If you enjoyed the 2004 movie ""Saw"", then you will definitely also enjoy the 2005 sequel ""Saw II"" from director Darren Lynn Bousman.My rating of ""Saw II"" lands on a seven out of ten stars.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A soothing grotesque experience but does not compare to the original,"The Jigsaw Killer(Tobin Bell) is caught by Detective. Eric Mason(Donnie Whalburg) but Mason soon finds out that the Jigsaw Killer is currently ""testing"" 8 others including his son, Daniel. The group finds themselves fighting to stay alive as they complete deadly tasks to find antidotes to a deadly nerve gas that is slowly killing them in an abandoned house.Whereas the bloody originality of Saw II competes very heavily with Saw, everything else falls short of the greatness that the predecessor enclosed. The sequel to surprising blockbuster fails to bring a great twist like the one in the original. Although the twist was probably not predicted by the majority of it's viewers, it still fails to have such a lasting, realistic effect on the audience. It was just a mediocre twist in a sequel to one of the greatest twists of all time.Everything else about the sequel just didn't compare to the original although it was still quite good. It kept an enclosed, mysterious plot with very little characters that Saw was known for but didn't establish any redemption such as in the original. It just doesn't feel as though the Jigsaw Killer really wants to help his victims in this one. Many of his gruesome tasks are close to impossible to complete, giving them very little chance for salvation. This takes a very complicated character of the Jigsaw Killer and makes him seem more like a psychotic old man. Although the character seemed flawed, I liked how Saw II showed flashbacks of the Jigsaw Killer's life and how he decided to become what he is. This helped his character development but still underachieved in what I hoped to be the creation of complex, sac-religious vigilante.Once getting past the large amount of flaws and disappointments in Saw II, it is very easily enjoyed. It is entertainment at it's best, keeping you on the edge of your seat at almost every scene. Overall, Saw II is an enjoyable modern horror film but considerably outdone by the original.I recommend this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Just as God awful as the last.,"With the massive success of the first Saw, it was inevitable that there would be a second. Of course, you'd think they'd want to improve on it a bit. I guess not.

Of course, the result is terrible.This time around, the Jigsaw killer has a house full of 8 people, yes, 8 people instead of 2, how thrilling, and there's plenty of traps to go around. One of the victims is Det. Eric Mason's son, so this makes it all personal for him.As well as the first one, the concept is kind of cool, but the acting is almost unbearably bad. Donnie Wahlberg isn't really worth the money he gets paid to act. He should leave acting to his brother, even though he isn't even that good either.Like the first film, it ends with a twist.

The Return of the Haunted House,"Let the games continue. 'Saw II' had one great thing going for it: it brought back a true ""haunted house."" Since I don't believe in ghosts, let me explain – the worn-down house in 'Saw II' that the multiple victims need to navigate through is truly a ""haunted"" house, in my opinion. They seemed to want to up the ante from 2 victims in the first movie to 3-4 times that and have them all solve another puzzle by Jigsaw simultaneously creating a Hannibal/Clarice scene between the now practically on his deathbed, Jigsaw, and the father of one of the test subjects. That's probably a better term than ""victims,"" as anyone who's seen the 'Saw' series, knows there's always a reason the people are there, and if they're victims, they really only did it to themselves. This is their wake-up call. Do I agree to the extreme measures Jigsaw puts these people through? Not at all. But, I didn't create the (now) long-running series. Previously mentioned, I said they up'd the ante, and they did with gore but more importantly, plot twists. Where part 1 almost started up too many twists/turns, this one is practically tripping over themselves to introduce multiple story lines (obviously setting up the inevitable III, IV+) but that's part of its downfall. While it's fun to try and solve the mystery/whodunit, it's almost exhausting to keep up with everything flashed in front of you in music-video-style. That said, I did enjoy the movie, loved some of the revolutions and it was nice to see more of Jigsaw interact, almost to the point of feeling sorry for him and wondering if he's the smartest person in the room. Perhaps he is, but putting ourselves in the opposite character's shoes, it would probably be hard for us to act differently.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

More Fodder For Jigsaw's Slaughter,"Saw 2 - More Fodder For Jigsaw's SlaughterDid you like the first Saw movie? You enjoyed its jump-cut array of clever puzzles, decrepit settings, and inventive butchery? Me too. So I watched Saw 2 without any notion that it could be an improvement on the original. It isn't.Nor is Saw 2 even in the same weight class of the first. How could it be? The powerful wallop of the first movie was packed into a fistful of originality so it's no wonder that round two lacks that sucker-punch effectiveness. But, come on, this is a sequel! People go to them to have their expectations fulfilled and if that's what you want in Saw 2, your wishes are granted.More intricate puzzles, more feculent buildings, more blood and more fodder for Jigsaw's slaughter. The main premise revolves around 7 people waking up in a locked room. Some of them we know. Some of them are purposeless other than to be ground up into bloody bits.Some are just plain idiotic. In fact so witless that you wonder how such a single-minded moron could reach adulthood and it's unfortunate that a great deal of the tension of the movie relies upon this cretin being an uncooperative mountain of muscle. You'll see what I mean.The scares are not up to the standards of the first Saw which formed a deep knot of unsettling dread in my guts that lasted for days afterward. Saw 2 does not even come close to any sense of worry and the director (Darren Lynn Bousman) seems to know it so he tries to compensate by tossing off some of the lamest over-the-shoulder ""boo!"" frights ever committed to film.It's never a good sign when the audience laughs aloud at the on-screen stupidity of the victims. You know you've gone wrong when human suffering is met with cackles and snickers rather than sympathetic gasps.The de rigueur twist ending somewhat redeems the film and invites another sequel but was set up in such a way that I didn't mind. At least it made more sense than the last 10 minutes of High Tension.Final word: In Saw 2 you get what you pay for. You're not going to be surprised in any way. You'll be painfully aware that you're watching a movie with characters that play by the same tired horror-movie rules. But if you're in to inventive gore you'll go anyway. But don't expect to be disturbed by what you see. Or saw.SAW 1 - ALTERNATE ENDING? Does anyone out there recall seeing an alternate ending to the original Saw? I watched the movie in Japan and remember a short flashback scene that takes place in between the time when Dr. Laurence crawled footless from the toilet chamber and Adam was locked in by Jigsaw. This is at the very end.I watched the DVD and it doesn't match my memories of what I remember from the Japanese theatrical version. I recall seeing (in flashback) the moments leading up to the beginning of the film. Short flashback scenes of Jigsaw setting up his own faked death and placing Adam in the bathtub with the penlight keychain.Then Jigsaw ""kills"" himself to make it look like suicide thus placing himself at the centre of the room between Adam and the Doc. Only moment after Jigsaw gets into suicide position on the floor, Adam wakes in the bathtub (which is the beginning of the movie).After locking Adam in the toilet, I remember Jigsaw stalking a footless Doc. Laurence down the corridor. Then the movie ended.Has anyone seen this or am I going crazy? I only recall it because I watched the Saw DVD this week and when it ended I wondered, ""Hey, what happened to the other bits I saw in the theatre?"" Figured they might be on the extras but no dice.Japan often has theatrical releases that differ from the N.American release. Perhaps the extra bits I remember are in the recently released ""unrated Saw"" DVD? Anyone? Anyone? Bueller?",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Disposable entertainment,"""Saw II"" is the perfect epitome of disposable entertainment.**SPOILERS**After months of hard work, Detective Eric Mathews (Donnie Wahlberg) tracks down and apprehends the serial killer Jigsaw, (Tobin Bell) who informs him that his son Daniel, (Erik Knudsen) is trapped along with several other people, Amanda, (Shawnee Smith) Xavier, (Frankie G) Jonas, (Glenn Plummer) Addison, (Emmanuelle Vaugier) Laura, (Beverly Mitchell) and Obi, (Tim Burd) inside a booby trapped house and have a certain amount of time to get out before they all die inside. As they start to wander looking for antidotes, they fall into Jigsaw's traps, despite Amanda's warnings. When they secret to their situation is finally revealed, it increases the desperation and the fight to survive.The Good News: Wow, what do I say about this one? There wasn't a whole lot to it. The traps this time where much bigger, more involved, and therefore, much better. Several of them were quite inventive as well, including the wonderful opening kill that perfectly sets the tone for the others throughout the movie. We get more gore in this one, which is an improvement over the first one. This one is a bit more of an R than the first one in terms of the violence, which is nice to see. It moves at a lot faster pace than the first one, and the time just disappears, which is the hallmark of good writing. It really does get lost in the moment in the story.The Bad News: Again, not a whole lot. Not a lot wrong with ti, but nothing wrong either. It's just inside and then nothing.The Final Verdict: I don't quite know how to feel about this one. I wasn't super entertained, but yet wasn't bored either. The perfect kind of film that if you want a harmless hour and a half to go by with nothing too special of a film, this is the perfect choice. Naturally, fans of the first one will eat this one up.Rated R: Graphic Language and Graphic Violence",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Perhaps one of the worst movies ever,"The only thing keeping me from calling this the WORST film ever is the fact that ""Cry Baby"" and the first ""Spiderman"" movie already exist. We will, however, throw it in the category of ""horrible"". Those who think this is a good movie are the same people who thought ""The Cell"" was ""riveting"", ""The Others"" was ""scary and exciting"", ""Hostel"" is so cool because Tarantino made it, and ""The Ring"" was ""totally, the scariest movie I've ever seen, seriously"".Was it scary? NO. Was it interesting? NO. Was it completely predictable from beginning to end? YES. Could the movie be saved by the virtue of Amanda's hotness? Nah. Anyone who thought this movie was great or even remotely thought-provoking should probably return to third grade and try it again. I've read Bobsey Twins books that had more mysterious twists.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Nicely Done,"Anytime a low budget ($4 Million) horror film beats the box office pants off all the expensive stuff is cause for rejoicing, even when it is being pushed by a major distributor (Lion's Gate).It is hard to understand the negative reviews of ""Saw II"". Sure its target audience is the lamest segment of the teen market (the ones who rushed to see ""Dukes of Hazard"" and avoided ""Serenity""), and braving the Halloween crowd at my local mega-plex required the self-infliction of a large dose of local drones and wigger girls snorting like pigs throughout the film. But this sequel is a much better movie than the original (insert ""Aliens"" here). Although not on the level of the more subtle ""The Hole"", it delivers a nice package of suspense and misdirection, plus a cute ending. And even tripling the original's budget did not make it so big that the good qualities of the original were lost to expensive effects and computer generated nonsense.The ""Saw"" franchise is an idea born out of the need for low cost production design. They continue to make do with an industrial rest room and the interiors of an old house (or apartment complex) and warehouse. Which fortunately fit the atmosphere and texture that they want. Acting and action are secondary to this psychological thriller/horror film despite vast quantities of blood and gore (insert the snorting of wigger girls here). It is much better on the big screen than at home because the audio is extremely important to the whole effect.Three characters return from the original. This time Tobin Bell has a major role as a kind of low-key Hannibal Lexter (the franchise owes a lot to ""Silence of the Lambs"") and Shawnee Smith reprises an expanded Amanda role. I was shocked that I actually recognized a slimmed down Beverly Mitchell in the cast, maybe not as shocked as I was at seeing a virtually unrecognizable Donnie Wahlberg. The last I recall of him was ""Southie"" (1998) and the seven years since have not been kind.To really enjoy ""Saw II"" you have to be willing to cut it some slack in the credibility department, although not to quite the degree as was required by the original. Although several of the performances are poor (Dina Meyer-the third returnee and Frankie G especially) none are on the clinker level of Danny Glover's in the original. Likewise the plausibility factor never hits deeply into negative, there is no repeat of anything as inane as the original's family menacing scene.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Fun and bloody, but nowhere near the quality of the first.","""Could contain Spoilers""Saw 2 opens with yet another doomed victim who lacks an appreciation for life - not a good character trait to have when the Jigsaw killer is hungry for gaming. In this most anticipated sequel, the first victim wakes in a grungy room wearing only an iron contraption around his neck and a pair of navy blue boxer briefs. Soon enough, a nearby TV turns on to reveal that creepy papier-mâché mask that we all have come to know and love. Through a brief explanation, we learn that some hours earlier, Mr. Joe Boxer had a key implanted behind his eyeball; the evidence of which is shown on the TV in an x-ray. The key unlocks the ""Death Mask"", a spring loaded spiked device, that he has woken up wearing. Armed only with a scalpel and a mirror, he must cut the key out of his head and unlock the mask before it snaps shut and kills him. To make matters worse, he only has 60 seconds to do it! Talk about a rude awakening! He's just woken up and he has a split second to decide if he would rather lose an eye or die When I first wake up, it takes me 3 minutes just to remember what day it is Rough day for this guy The TV turns off abruptly the game has begun. Does he perform this gruesome surgical procedure? Better yet, does he perform it within the given time? Seeing how this is the opening of the film, you should be guessing no. Bingo SMASH! The mask closes like a Venus flytrap on steroids.Enter hero Donnie Wahlberg playing the role of Detective Eric Matthew. He walks onto the crime scene and after five minutes basically says, ""I'm outta here!"" What? Wait a minute are you sure? Maybe you want to find a clue before you leave? Eventually, he decides to look a little closer, which leads to the discovery of a manufacturer's label on the death mask. Calling all cars! Everyone heads down to the manufacturing plant where they discover The Jigsaw Killer. ""Gotcha"", says Detective Matthew. Yep, he's a smart one all right. Jigsaw tells Matthew to look in the other room. He sees a group of monitors displaying eight victims in an isolated, grunge infested room. To really hit home, Matthew sees that one of the victims is his teenage son. Let the games begin Detective.Here's how the game is played folks  The eight victims are trapped inside a house. There is a toxic nerve agent in the house that is seeping into their bodies. The door to the house will open in three hours but within two, their bodies will bleed from every internal organ. Throughout the house are games that, if won, will yield an antidote, but usually just a single dose. This leads to one of my first major problems with the film. OK, you have a decent size house to explore and only two hours to do so. The first thing I would do is form some kind of a plan, look around the room very carefully for clues, etc What do these guys choose to do first? Freak out. Fine, we'll give them a few minutes to do that. However, I felt like they never stopped arguing. I understand that these eight personalities vary to the extreme but it was very annoying to see the clock ticking while they do absolutely nothing to benefit themselves. You have one girl on the ground crying half the time and another one telling everyone to shut up. Towards the finale, one of these characters becomes an even bigger threat to the household than Jigsaw very odd story choice in my opinion.As you might have guessed, I really would have liked to see the characters working together more, or better yet, working together at all. I felt the script should have spent more time playing with what the characters knew and didn't know, as in the first film. You had two characters chained up in a bathroom. One of them would secretly read a note hidden by Jigsaw and instantly we know that Adam knows something Lawrence doesn't. Then five minutes later Lawrence reads a note. Then we watch them play against each other. The original film peeled away layers like the Iron Chef on crystal meth but sadly, the sequel did not. Towards the end, I was so annoyed and frustrated by the characters, I was eagerly awaiting their hopefully painful demise. You have this huge house with all these undiscovered rooms why on Pluto would you waste more then ten minutes showing them arguing. It was like watching Jigsaw's version of Big Brother.The character of Detective Matthew was almost as annoying as the arguing. At some point in the film, Jigsaw says something to the effect of  all you have to do is listen to me and your son will be returned safely. That's it, nothing more, nothing less. Actually, pretty simple directions The maniac promptly launches into his mantra, talking about the value of life and how people don't appreciate it. Sure enough, in five minutes Matthew is rolling his eyes and calling the guy a crazy loony. Call me loony but if Jigsaw had my son and he said those words, my ear would be down his throat. Apparently, my viewpoints on a child's life are a little different from Detective Matthew's.Overall, Saw 2 can definitely be fun and entertaining at times but it just wasn't what it needed to be. The movie is decent but when compared to the original, it did not shine as much as it should have. With all this being said, I still recommend Saw 2. I don't feel it's a must see but if you're a fan of the genre it's definitely worth a look.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Very good but has some issues with consistency,"A decent horror movie. But feels much more generic than the first, the movie has a slower start and while it gets to the interesting stuff very quickly the first movie has a much better way of balancing it. The acting and stakes are much larger and more interesting than the first however while the movie is still tense there's not as constant of a feeling of what's going on and the tension from it. About half the characters are also not very well developed, interesting and likeable. Because of all this the movie feels more like a generic horror movie where you're waiting for the next trap and death instead of figuring out the clues with the character, there are still lots of mysteries to figure out as the movie goes on but it's just not as consistent as the first movie. That being said the movie still has very interesting characters, much gorier and more interesting deaths and struggles and the movie has some amazing twists that even top the first.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Couldn't have been better!,"Well, saw2 does surely beat saw specially for all those who loved saw. I mean this time the plot gets more intense with identity of the jigsaw killer known there is a sense of tension among the viewers of what he'll do next. But with all do respect................one thing if i may point out is , due to more people in this movie as in the 8 people in the room...........it might confuse.......because we don't know much about the characters. But then the jigsaw killers games are so sick , inventive and bloody the viewer forgets about character development.

This is exactly how low budget should be done!,"Note to all the 50+ year old critics who are still single and spend most of their time in arthouses praising the subtext of Oscar-contending foreign films: this movie isn't intended for you. You might want to keep that in mind the next time you insist on reviewing it just so you can lambaste the gullibility of its target audience.That being said, I'm going to make this real simple for you readers. Are you actually part of Saw II's target audience? Did you enjoy the original? If so, then I don't see why you wouldn't enjoy this sequel. If not, then direct your time and money elsewhere. It's not a complicated process.Let me make it even clearer: the opening scene involves a man with a trapjaw device hooked up to his face. He has a very short amount of time to get the key to unlock it before the device snaps shut and uses his skull as a pin cushion. The real kick to all this? The key is buried in his face, below his eye. But hey, he has a knife he can use to dig it out! I'm sure there's no need for me to point out that it's not a pretty scene. This is either your flavor of frappuccino or not.Being a sequel, Saw II has no choice but to be looked upon with a skeptical eye. Sequels always start with that handicap. I enjoyed Saw (especially considering its LOW budget and less-than-stellar cast), so when a sequel was announced about 12.3 seconds after Saw made a profit on opening night, I had my doubts. The question had to be asked, is there a story to be told or just money to be made?There's no doubt that there's money to be made here, but thankfully the story doesn't suffer just for the sake of making a healthy profit against yet another small budget ($4 million). The main element of Saw II's story that really gripped me is its intense unpredictability. A lot of that is due to the fact that you likely won't recognize most of the cast. That's fine with me. If you stick the 5'4"" Tom Cruise in that room then there's no doubt that he's going to figure out all the puzzles and save the day. However, put such no-names as Lyriq Bent and Tim Burd in there and you know everybody's fair game!The premise isn't much different than its predecessor - Jigsaw is one messed up individual who is dying of cancer, and he's putting people in nasty situations to find out what lengths they'd go to in order to survive. But what I like about the new group of victims is that they all have something in common. To make things a little more complicated, they also have a connection to Donnie Wahlberg. Are they disgruntled New Kids on the Block fans who still feel they're owed refunds? You'll have to watch to find out.So is this sequel better than the original? It's hard to say. There are definitely areas that have been improved - the acting, for example. I'm not going to claim that the acting is across-the-boards fantastic, but overall it is better than the original. Nobody attempts the over-the-top act that Cary Elwes tap danced upon us. I particularly liked the interaction between Jigsaw (whom we see a LOT more of) and Donnie Wahlberg. Both guys put in fine performances.But the main advantage that the original still owns over the sequel is its ending. I felt Saw's climax was possibly the most exciting, most intense 10-15 minutes of any movie of 2004. Saw II doesn't end on quite the same pace, but it still goes out with a pretty loud bang. The suspense, tension, and painful-to-watch gore moves along at a consistent clip, and by the time it all wraps up we're delivered a couple of clever twists and really cool tie-ins to the original. Just keep in mind that this ain't no riblet that needs a clean picking and you should be fine.Just be forewarned that like needles on a chalkboard, there are some scenes that will make you tense up and feel the pain. All I'll say is when you see a big group of hypodermic needles appear on screen then go ahead and start preparing yourself. Get in your best squint-mode and be ready to squirm.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
I Need more Money,"I was quite happy when i saw Saw II coming in the theaters here in Germany this early spring as I'm going to call it. I was surprised and quite astonished by Saw 1, the surprise maybe of all genres last year. So there was no question, I had to go see Saw IINow for your viewing pleasure, and maybe the ongoing life of your monitor or TFT - thing, i shall not tell you the plot.So, well the basics: (includes just about as much as cinema commercials include) Cop argues with son, who is in the eyes of the cop on the way to being the number one criminal in the city (the ones who have a father that is on the police force might recall that they tend to see the ones who eats their piece of chicken at dinner to be on the road to be a major criminal) well anyway. So they find a body, the cop merely engages in investigation, easy case, finds jigsaw, game is on.OK so far. But then it gets tricky, having way more characters than Saw 1, and being just for a moment in the brain of Jigsaw, I would it find greatly troubling to keep track of all the lunatics I'm playing with at the same time, while having a couple of guns pointed at my face. And thats the problem of the movie. It's too thin for its many characters, the viewer is not as connected to the characters as he is in Saw 1. Sometimes somebody says: ""Let's discuss who we are so we might find a way out."" And the answer by another character is:""There is no need for that""That just about sums up the entire movie. There is no need for it. And when you do your homework during the movie you will find out what is going on so early that you might have a chance to go out while the movie is still on and actually enjoy the rest of the night.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A decent sequel...,"The first SAW amazed me with the writers' clever ideas but SAW II felt a lot different from the first one. I mean, it's a good sequel, but it feels like there's something missing in this one...SAW II starts off by John ""Jigsaw"" Kramer (Bell) testing Detective Matthews (Wahlberg) by having a conversation face to face when his son is in one of Jigsaw's games along with other victims. And somehow, all these players, including Matthews, have something in common that they will discover near the end of their journey. Its just a matter of time who will survive longest to find the missing puzzle piece of this sick game.I think what bothered me the most in this movie could be because too many people are involved in the new game which lead me into confusion and never gave a lot of background from each character. But as I said before, It's a pretty good movie. The ending has a twist as usual and a pretty cool one it is. Let's just say I never ""saw"" it coming haha.

"Close to the original in spirit, and quite effective","One of last year's most pleasant surprises - at least when it comes to the not too spoilt genre of horror - was the exhilaratingly ruthless jigsaw horror film Saw. Made by the highly talented newcomers James Wan and Leigh Whannell, the film had a rawness and an edge to it that I hadn't seen for a long time in horror filmmaking. Of course, the sequel was just around the corner; Saw II is a fuse between an original idea by writer/director Darren Lynn Bousman and Leigh Whannell's penning to make it work as a follow-up to the 2004 movie. The result is close to the original in spirit, and quite effective.One of the greatest strengths of Saw, was the meticulously delicate presentation of the unique premise - placing Cary Elwes and Leigh Whannell in their particular situations and letting them work out their predicament by themselves. It was with this scene (and others like it) that Saw really got to you - by depicting desperation in an overwhelmingly effective manner. Bousman's film lacks (or fast-forwards) this part, and suffers clearly from it. Like many sequels, it makes the mistake of skipping important build-up, thus failing to create its own identity and universe. Instead, Saw II becomes the very resembling, less gifted adopted child of the original.With that said, Bousman demonstrates talent in his directing. After a somewhat messy and dramatically unimpressive start, the film picks up and has some well-assembled puzzles to offer as well as a few nice tricks. The script maintains quite intelligent throughout (though not as inventive as the original, of course) and the wrap-up is not at all disappointing. However, the characters are quite stereotypical and the plot defies logic a couple of times, but you'll have to make a very good argument to claim that this will go high up on the list of the least successful horror sequels.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

mA 15+?,"Classification for Australia is mA 15+...which restricts viewing to those the age of 15 (accompanied with adult if under 15) I'm generally a objective and resilient person when it comes to violence in films, and hardly conservative.

Worthy sequel that narrowly falls short of its predecessor,"Exasperated with people taking life for granted, the cancer riddled sadistic killer, Jigsaw, is back for a second bout of intricately engineered games of death, designed to make his victims prove they are worthy of existence.Saw, released in 2004, achieved cult status through its innovative approach to the horror/serial killer genre. A cleverly worked script with twists and turns overcame some dodgy acting and turned Saw into a triumph. The inevitable sequel builds on the premise of the first by introducing ever more elaborate schemes for the victims to die, in Jigsaws twisted little games. Half the fun is trying to figure out how the next trap can possibly outdo the previous one in terms of violence and 'look through your fingers in disgust'. Yet each time the deaths get ever more depraved.The tag line says it all. If you can't handle the blood then stay the hell away. This is not one for the faint hearted. I deny anyone to watch this film without feeling tense and uneasy. It's chilling atmosphere sends a wave of foreboding and fear flooding through your veins as you expect something horrible round every corner. In terms of pure fright Saw actually fails to deliver many jumps and jolts, purely because you are generally expecting the worst. But in terms of sustained grimace and horror for what the characters are going through, Saw lets your blood boil, forgetting about the off switch.Unfortunately Saw is let down by some painfully poor acting which seems to have been unceremoniously accredited to the horror genre. Part of the reason the original was so highly regarded was the gritty interaction of its two main characters working with and against each other in their desperate situation. With a larger cast its successor loses all notions of character development and portrays a group of impossibly dumb individuals and, therefore, a very unbelievable bunch of idiots.Although it loses the original impact of its predecessor, Saw II is a commendable but significantly weaker sequel. It still manages to blow the majority of modern horror films out of the water, delivering some of the most memorable and haunting sequences of recent memory. However, it isn't a patch on 'The Decent' when it comes to the terror department.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"A reasonable sequel, yet lacked certain essential elements","I recently watched Saw II and was gracefully horrified at some of the tortures, and traps in the movie. However what i felt really dragged the movie downhill was the amount of characters in the movie. From memory, there were about 8-9 characters initially in the house. This somewhat detracted from the over all horror of the movie. What this movie should have learnt from the original 'Saw' was that concentrating more heavily on maybe 2-3 characters was far more effective.Also i didn't feel as though Saw II was really executed the twist as perfectly as the original. In the original, it built and lead viewers into a possible twist, then in about the last minute or so, it went 'snap' and shocked all viewers with an amazing twist. In Saw II, it wasn't more spread out, and didn't create that shock, which was an essential feature of the first 'Saw'.Having said this i was satisfied with the overall effect and award it 6 stars. All I can say now is bring on Saw III and make it a good one.

Well I'm hoping Saw 3 will be a lot better, with more twists and i hope it keeps me at the edge of my seat and not so much blood, I already know what happens because my friend told me the end of the movie which sucks.I give this movie a 7 as the twists were really good",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
horror has returned....,"From the beginning, you see that this movie is taking no prisoners. Horror movies have been on a steady decline in the past decade or so, with the exception of remakes like the Ammityville Horror. This sequel not only matches the first in terms of gore and intensity, but surpasses the original with suspense. It is an edge of your seat thriller that literally leaves you guessing until the final frame. For those of you who enjoyed the ending of the first, the second is mind blowing. While the film may not focus on strict scare tactics the entire time, the edge-of-your-seat effect makes up for it tenfold. I highly recommend this film and possibly even a second viewing.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Could Have Been Better,"With what they had to work with (budget included), this film should have been directed by David Fincher (Se7en)written by Andrew Kevin Walker (same) with cinematography by Paul Laufer (The Cell). Or even the director, screenwriter, and producer of The Cell. This film takes a fascinating criminal nut-job serial killer flick and turns it into I Know What You Did Last Summer. For crying out loud, it really would have been scarier by bringing mortal fear into the equation rather than distaste for scenes of slow death and dismemberment. This has the flavor of a made-for-TV movie, only I'd have to say those have more interesting crime dramas. If I combined Darkness Falls with a cop show on ABC mixed with a bad reality-TV style show, I'd get Saw II. I only watched it because of the spoof in Scary Movie 4. I think the spoof was better. Twisted Pictures should be replaced by Dark Castle Entertainment. They made House on Haunted Hill in 1999. The characters in Saw 2 did not behave in a natural way when locked together. I can only say the actors I could respect were the cops and the son. Also, they did the female cop's hair so stylishly perfect. I gotta say only Nicole Kidman has hair like that for work. But that lady went on a stake out in style, so it seemed a bit unrealistic she'd have that fancy hair-do to go catch a serial killer.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Saw II is a Decent Follow-Up,"I am a big fan of Saw I. So when I heard a sequel will be made, I had mixed reactions. On one hand ..I love Saw and it would be cool to see how Saw II turns out but on the other hand most horror sequels suck. But let me just say... Saw II will not disappoint....This time around we have 8 people being played by Jigsaw in a house and have to find antidotes to an deadly gas they are breathing. Out of the 8 people trapped by Jigsaw,... Amanda and Xavier are like the only characters that makes Saw II memorable. The rest, I can really give a damn about. Donnie Walhberg of New Kids fame who plays Detective Mason actually did a decent job in this movie but his character was not likable enough for me to root for and maybe that is the way it was intended to be.The high points of the movie is you never get bored. And oh yes, there is blood ..plenty of it. Not to mention, the last 30 minutes of the film is an awesome roller-coaster ride and have some cool twists and turns but still in my opinion cannot top the twist we saw in Saw I.Still, the movie is not all bed and roses ..some low points for me is that it lacks that gritty fear I felt Saw had. I guess because this time around not only do we hear Jigsaw's voice but we actually see him and get to know him for the whole 90 minutes. And by golly, actually feel sorry for the guy. I am glad we got to know Jigsaw but seeing him throughout the film made the film less scary. What made Saw I really creepy was Jigsaw's voice and we had no face to match it to ..now we do. Imagine Michael Myers and Jason without their mask for the entire movie.Overall, in a day and age where most horror sequels suck. Saw II prevails. So, get popcorn, get soda, watch the movie and enjoy!",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
65%,"PROS:A solid follow up to Saw.We get some great new traps and scenarios which allow for some real gory and hard to watch scenes.Tobin Ball as Jigsaw is more present than in Saw and we really get to see how psychotic he truly is.There are a few clever little twists which make this movie entertaining.CONS:The acting is pretty poor, so it makes it hard to care about them or any consequences they may face.There isn't as much of a mystery surrounding this sequel compared to the original which makes the tone very different.Just like Saw, I hated the editing where it would have so many cuts in between intense scenes.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
too predictable,"For a movie who's tagline was ""Oh yes, there will be blood"", it sure didn't deliver. But being that i'm not a fan of gore for the sake of gore, that's fine with me. This movie is exactly what happens when a movie does well and then a sequel is rushed into production(this idea wasn't pitched as saw 2, but as a whole different movie.) I felt like I was watching what will be filmed in 15 years when they eventually remake Saw. 8 people instead of 2. A whole house instead of one room. I loved the first Saw, and I wanted to like Saw 2, but it had all the originality of a remake and was the most predictable movie I've ever seen.

The Saw has gone blunt,"Saw was a well-written piece of work that balanced suspense and drama. There was sufficient gore to keep the audience happy (well, those who came to watch it for the gore) and shocked as well.Sadly, Saw II does not live up to its predecessor. There are a few key things missing that made Saw such a treat to watch.The first being character development. This same easy for Saw because the focus was mainly on two individuals. In Saw II, there's quite a few of them and hence not all of them get explored. Heck, the majority of the characters are very obnoxious and antagonistic and it's hard to care for any of them. But this could have been done to make the audience cheer for their deaths.The next would be suspense. There isn't simply enough of this to keep me shocked or glued to my seat. Plus those who have seen the first one (or Cube) won't be as fearful for their familiarity. The deaths were also more predictable.I also credit the advertisements for ruining some of the best moments in the film. Why do film ads these days have to ruin the best parts of the film?There is also a lacking build-up that was present in Saw. But again this problem is an attribute to the number of characters present plus the limited screening time.What this film maintains however is the great writing. While the film didn't have as much shocking moments as Saw, it has a pretty sweet twist and I give credit to that.This movie is better credited as a ""slasher flick"" rather than a suspense. This is not to say that the movie is not good. It is still entertaining. I recommend this to anyone who loves gore but to those who are expecting something of the same magnitude as Saw, better not see this or you'll be disappointed.3/5",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Bloody Good Time,"So I just got back from seeing ""Saw 2"" and I feel about as giddy as a kid on Christmas. I loved the first edition because quite frankly it was so bad it was good. I mean that with utter respect- it was a high quality B horror flick with a fantastic ending. Needless to say I was a tad cynical that the sequel would live up to the original. Specifically, would this movie deliver a wham-bam finale? I have to say the sequel delivered with flying colors. Needless to say, you hafta hang in there. The majority of the movie does not have the same tension as the original; mainly because there are many more characters to consider. However, keep the faith... the ending is brilliantly twisted, and will have you counting down to the inevitable ""Saw 3"".",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
don't waste your time,"Their are two kinds of people who see saw 2: Those horror fans in search for a gripping and compelling story which matches the film's intensity and those who are immature and only see it for gore and shock value, the teenage boy types who think naked chicks and blowing stuff up immediately qualifies for a good movie. Sadly you'll have to be in the second category to enjoy this.Saw 2 takes off from SAW and very poorly at that. After a boring intro sequence we are introduced to a group of social misfits who have been drugged and put into one of Jigsaw's trap riddled houses. One of the people is the son of a burnt out detective who will stop at nothing to get him back (yawn).The acting is bad, we don't care about these characters and it quickly becomes an episode of ""survivor"" with trumped up gore. Their is no shock value; the scenario's could never even happen and the director's constant close up shots of traps and screaming victims becomes very predictable. Of course there are twists in this mess but it's like pouring the choicest of sauces onto a cow manure sandwich, the main course still tastes bad.One of sensible taste doesn't waste time on this rubbish however if you lack an eye for true creativity and are easily satisfied by the instant gratification commercial culture then by all means see it.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Better Than The 1st,Saw 2 is definitely better then the first. I wouldn't say it's one of those movies where you need to see the first one to understand the second. The ending for Saw 2 is definitely better then the ending in the first. After seeing this movie your mind definitely. has some issues... takes a little while to figure stuff out and wonder how a director or any human being can think of the craziness that this movie has in it.

Gimme a break. If you see this movie, you may think as I did: ""Why did this entire plot need to take place?

The best film of 2005 without a doubt...,"I didn't go to SAW II expecting very much. The first SAW was an instant classic, an amazingly well-done horror film that only suffered from a few faults, if any. If there's one thing I hate, it has to be quickly dished-out sequels, so I was a little hesitant about whether or not I thought SAW II looked good. God, was I mistaken!! SAW II is one of, if not the, best horror film I have ever seen. And trust me I'm quite the movie buff. My horror collection boasts over 396 titles, some of which I loved, and others of which were utter garbage. And I have to say that SAW II is the first horror film I've seen opening night that received a round of applause once its ending title sequence rolled around.Anything that seemed wrong with the first film is perfected with this sequel. And, surprisingly, SAW II surpassed the original by far. It had great deaths, and managed to keep the character-driven aspect of the story intact even with all of them. Some of the scenes in SAW II were so chilling and graphic that I cringed in terror. Which is to say that SAW II is definitely a hard R rated film, never holding back in any areas. There is EXTREME, realistic gore contained here! There were also several nods to the first film, and SAW II even included comedy in with the carnage!!!SAW II had a very good plot, and never seemed to slow down for longer than a minute. This was one of the most suspenseful movies I've ever seen!!! During the last act of the film I felt like I was gonna have a heart attack. In the end, everything, including the twist ending, makes perfect sense, and it even manages to tie up almost all of the loose ends from the first film. A great, highly recommended film.Any horror film fan should check this out, whether they liked the first SAW or not. If you're planning on going to the movies for a horror flick, don't waste your money on the horrible remake of THE FOG.

hollow sequel,"I first watched this film when it came onto D.V.D. it was 3.30 in the morning and i was waiting all day to watch it. I stuck it in the player and after about an hour I thought ""Oh this film is rubbish!"" the lighting is as dark and moody as ever this is the best thing because the story is more hollow than a eggshell.There are a lot more characters this time However, Jigsaw turns up and so does his malevolent wooden doll. The film is NOT scary and it cannot compare to ""SAW"" because the film features more on the action than the shock and suspense of classics such as ""HALLOWEEN"" and ""THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE"" Erik Knudsen provides a decent portrayal as an innocent caught up in the brutality of Jigsaw's games. Donnie Wahlberg however, plays Detective Eric Matthews With a realism that is a reflection of the British Police (Well Meaning and willing to do anything to get their man or woman for that matter) Shawnee smith is great as the female protagonist because you know she isn't like the others due to the fact that she tries to protect Daniel Matthews (Eric Knudsen) One of the best things about this film is the creativity in the death traps. They are a lot more creative than the original however,the way the traps are laid out within the film give me an impression that the director wanted to create an action flick instead of a horror.In conclusion, ""SAW 2"" is a sequel not to be taken seriously because if you are expecting a horror film you will be disappointed",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery

There was just enough blood (not too much) to do the job done. The second I think is just the start of the SAW3. Maybe too much action, too much blood, too much ""Hollywood"". I also don't think that SAW2 is as good as original. At very best the same maybe.

A Step Down,"This movie takes a lot of what the first film does well and fails at it in round 2.

The game that is played and its setup feels like a high stakes escape room as opposed to a kidnapping. The set in the house is less interesting than the single room used for most of the first.The twist at the end is ok, but it's not nearly on the level of the first.

"As good as the first Saw was, this is even better","Everyone who watched ""Saw"" had one of two opinions on it: either they loved it or they hated it. I for one LOVED it and so I was stoked when I heard that Saw II was coming out just in time for Halloween. I was a little skeptical, however, for Saw came out only a year ago. The sequel, however, surpassed my every expectation. And yes, there is plenty of blood and guts to go around! All of the problems from Saw were fixed in Saw II. The crappy acting of Danny Glover and Carey Elwes does not carry over to Saw II, in which most of the actors are believable and don't have crappy accents. Tobin Bell is superb in his role as the dying Jigsaw killer and Shawnee Smith is wonderful a recovering drug addict stuck once again in Jigsaw's puzzle. Donnie Wahlburg also gives a decent performance. My only complaint with the acting is Franky G. Honestly, I think they could have gotten a better actor for the part, he just kind of annoyed me.Overall, the film plays out in a way that expands upon the original's premise and creates a creepy and tense atmosphere on its own. Trust me, at certain moments in the film, your jaw will hit the floor. It's still shocking. And the ending is a fantastic and unexpected twist that leaves the door open for a Saw III.

Useless!,"SAW from 2004 is one of the scariest films to come along in quite a while. It isn't surprising that since it was a small film and was such a hit, a sequel would be inevitable. Unfortunately Saw 2 is awful: this film is so bad I almost wish Saw 1 had never been made. The story follows the further exploits of Jigsaw, a terminal cancer patient turned serial killer. Jigsaw's existence and motives were part of the reason that Saw 1 was kind of hokey, but at least that film had characters I cared about and it was scary. There is absolutely no one in this film that I cared for, and this film is merely disgusting and cruel AND NOT SCARY IN ONE SCENE. There could have been scares later on, but I turned this film off at the 50 minute mark, taking cue from the late Redd Foxx.

I saw Fear.com and there was only one other person in the theater. Very cool.On to the movie. I thought this was a great flick. Initially I was rather upset that they revealed Jigsaw really early on, but this eventually became one of the smart parts to the movie. He is a watcher, but this time, he could actually affect the characters in ways other than leaving tape recordings and clues on how to escape. He actually was interacting with the main pawn (matthews). It was somewhat comical when he was getting the heck beat out of him since he is rather aged and deathly ill, but I guess when your kid is in dire straits, you would do anything to get to him.I can't wait until the next installment.My favorite scene was when the guy went in the incinerator, even though you pretty much knew what was going to happen.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A taught thriller that ties perfectly to the first movie.,"The first two Saw films have certainly found its audience and is inevitably here to stay. I have heard that they are already beginning production on Saw 3. And why shouldn't they? Saw was great tense thriller and the second one was as well. The two films tie in perfectly creating a whole, which is very rare in the horror genre, because most horror movies you can watch each film without having seen the predecessors and still enjoy it.Saw II begins with a man in a room with a ""DeathMask"" around his face. Jigsaw, the infamous killer from the first one, appears on a television screen in the room. Just like in the first one, he wants to play a game; he explains the rules to our friend in the chair and then begins the timer. I won't tell you what the game is or what happens, I will leave that to you to discover and squirm in your chair as I did.After the opening scene we see our main character. He is a detective who does not have the best relationship with his son. He stumbles along some hints that lead him to Jigsaw and soon discovers that he will have to play a game of his own. A game that involves his son and about four or five other people trapped in a house full of lethal nerve gas. They only have two hours to find the antidote to the nerve gas. Each of the antidotes is placed in a trap, so you can image the carnage that ensues. As our hero-the father played by Donnie Wahlberg-plays his game with Jigsaw, which consists of him simply sitting there and talking to Jigsaw while this group stumbles through the house killing themselves through the traps, the intensity builds and I found myself on the edge of my seat just like the first one.I have been asked why anyone wants to go and see a movie like this. It is a sadistic film, and I have joked about how the writers need to be locked away. The more I thought about it, the more I realized that the writers are ingenious. The writers have put together a taught thriller that draws you in and you find yourself biting your nails. That's what a good movie does; it puts you in the fray. I also feel like it is ingenious because it is basic human nature to want to see things like that. We are a curious people and when we here about people being put in situations like this, we want to know how far they will go.I loved this movie. I loved the first Saw and to see how the two tie together makes them that much better. This is a series that draws you in, makes your heart pound and your fists clench. When a movie has done something like that, then it has accomplished its goal. Allowing you to leave this world for a few hours and enjoy something new altogether.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Missing a few pieces from the puzzle itself, if you were a major fan of the first film, skip this one.","Saw II was one of the few movies I was actually looking forward to seeing this year, and I have to say that I was quite disappointed. Not only was this movie more predictable than the first, but the psychological aspects were dulled down and almost drowned out by needless gore.This movie is lacking the key elements that made it's predecessor so great: a fresh and original story, well-developed -likable- characters, and a crazy plot twist that you won't see coming. Instead, Saw II features the opposite: an unexcitingly dry story, more than a few too many under-developed characters that make it almost unbearable to watch the story (with Xavier striking a surprising resemblance to Quentin from Cube), and ""plot twists"" that are too predictable and boring to deserve the title.I'm not entirely sure if the faults found in this sequel originate from Bousman's ""The Desperate"" (the movie Saw II was built around) but it sure would be a place to start. The movie begins it's head-first plunge downhill after the opening scene, and ends much lower than a true Saw fan would expect. Saw II is missing a few pieces from the puzzle itself...if you were a major fan of the first film, I'd recommend you skip this one.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
one of the best movies I've seen,"I love this movie, unfortunately I saw it on SYFY so it wasn't as good as it would have been if I would have seen the normal version, but it was still good. I wouldn't really call this a horror movie though, it's not that scary. it was mostly just really violent and suspenseful. I think the actors were really good, as well as the special effects. this is definitely the most brutal movie I've ever seen. very violent and there were a lot of things I didn't expect to happen, most of them happened in the old warehouse where the people were trapped. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who like violent and suspenseful movies.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Hollywood smelt money,"Warning: spoilers may be found below.The original Saw was an interesting movie: a low-budget thriller/horror with a very original storyline, a tense atmosphere and no lack of gore either. It was a refreshing oasis in the desert of mindless, stupid Hollwood drivel.Sometime after the in-crowd of real fans discovered the movie, the general public caught on and Saw was a genuine hit. Unfortunately, Hollywood caught on too and smelt money. Sequels! More money! Quick! Make sequels! Alas, what that lead to is the nonsense called Saw 2.Saw 2 is, sad to say, a poor ripoff of the original movie. The premise is milked from original, showing Jigsaw at length and droning on and on about his stupid ""games"". Whereas the original had a puzzling plot, this nonsense throws 6 people in a house full of stupid traps in no way scary or interesting in an attempt to lure moviegoers into the theater with the tagline ""6 x the terror."" Well, it failed miserably. Poor acting, an uninspired, boring plot, poor gore and did I mention that STUPID editing? What is this, some MTV movieclip?

What were they thinking?,"Why did the directors of Saw decide to make another? The first Saw was a fantastic movie from the beginning to the end. However, I wanted to put myself in a Saw situation after watching Saw 2. This movie was ridiculously stupid from the beginning to the very end. O I know what they were thinking, lets have 1 tad bit of a relation to the first and just add gore, people will love it! More gore in the beginning? Well maybe if the guy at the start will hardly touch his eyeball with a knife and then scream away the ""pain"". That wasted my time and jigsaws. They should have stuck with a shorter list of characters or ""players"" of the game. None of the characters had relations to each other, other than they were druggies, and they had to background unlike the first movie. The goal in the house was to find the antidote to cure the ""slow killing poison"" but it ended up being a guy who has PMS killing everyone to achieve numbers on the back of peoples neck. O Boy! Then there's the childish ending. The location to where the dad pulled up was a completely different spot than the first movie. And the amazing bathroom seemed to be down in a sewer not a basement. Eventually the heroin addict girl achieves her goal and the cop gets bitch slapped. ""Game Over"". Please god i pray to you, make this series end now!

There are tons of exciting/OMG moments in this movie that will rattle you out of your seat. The acting was supprisingly good for not having to many famous actors in the film.

What the hell are critics and audiences talking about???,"Gee This movie is a total letdown. I got bored in some parts, and the 'horror' bits of Saw II are totally forgettable. The twist at the end of the first flick was awesome, despite the awful acting, it was worth the ride. But this What is this? Some things I really didn't like about it:¿No MTV editing? Are you blind? This looks like a Francis Lawrence video from start to finish.Gory/disgusting/unbearable? Damn!!! You guys are really numb from watching Scream and thinking that was hardcore horror. I was waiting for the 'gory' and 'disgusting' parts to start and then the movie ended. What a letdown.Smart killing devices my arse. The only good trap was the needle trap, and it wasn't that great either. Just amusing and that's it.And that 'twist' at the end. OMG, it was the worst thing ever. What is this? Star Wars? Everything said by Jigsaw was pure trash. Compare that to John Doe's words from Seven when he confronts Mills. Now that was intense and I suffered through it.Saw was a good excuse to eat some popcorn and hug my girlfriend, and that was it. If you're into your typical American-horror-film, this is it.

Enough mistakes for two bad movies,"After reading much praise on this website and having sort of liked the first part i went to see ""Saw II"" yesterday. And man, were those praises wrong. The idea that there are people out there who actually think that this is a good horror movie is more scary than anything in this ineptly made crap. The acting is bad enough but who really has outdone himself is the editor of this movie who puzzles together the wildly hand-shaken parts without any feeling for rhythm or atmosphere at all. It's really a pain to watch bad movies like this, because their makers do real annoying pseudo-hip stuff to hide the fact that they have no talent for this sort of thing ( making horror work). It's good to see that the ""new wave"" of horror movies is trying to keep a straight face like in the good old days but while watching ""Saw II"" you can learn why there were so many ""comic"" slashers and monsterflics through the 90ies. Because with a crew like this and a director like Bousman it's gonna be a pretty ridiculous time no matter how hard they try to make this trash work.

Hugely disappointing sequel.,"To me, Saw was never a film that could really be made into a series or franchise. There were many comparisons made with Se7en around the release of Saw and, although it was quite a loose comparison, both films did really make their impact as stand alone 'jaw drop' twist films.So forgive me for being iffy about Saw 2 from the moment I heard it was seriously going to be made. But I gave it a chance and I was sadly massively disappointed by this sequel. I'll try not to go on a rant here...Saw was a film that got under the audiences skin not simply because of the twisted and disturbing premise of a serial killer who does not actually kill with his own hands, but also due to the character development building up through the film that made it's dark and unforgiving ending have such an incredible impact. We began to feel like we knew the characters a little by the end of the film, thanks to flashbacks and snatches of dialogue between the two victims. We could begin to place ourselves in the situation of the film because it felt more rounded and perhaps we could even relate to these characters.Relating to the characters in Saw 2 is not an option. Not only does it present depressingly familiar stock characters (the tough cop in the midst of a divorce, the son going off the rails who just longs to be loved, the hard ass female partner who has at some point got close to the tough cop, the special squad that just want to 'kick some ass!' or 'take him down!' or shout 'let's dooooo this!') Exactly who are we meant to relate with in the film? Perhaps nobody, but how then is this film meant to be as effective as the first? We certainly can't relate to the good guys as we know little to nothing about them. Do we see any of their home life? No. Their past? No, but we get a few 'shocks' far too late in the film. How are we meant to care whether they have any sort of a moral code if we know squat about them? Of course we're not going to relate to the 'baddie'. I doubt few people did in the first film, although the idea of his motive and his status was a particularly interesting one. Well, it was until this film when they attempt to break it down by making Jigsaw more human. Not only does Jigsaw look and sound different and far less threatening in this picture, he gets the most character development out of everyone. You think this could be positive? Wrong. Very soon, you'll begin to long for the certain amount of mystery that surrounded him.I promised not to rant, didn't I? Well, I'll skim over the rest, The victims are terribly 2D. Convicts and ex junkies and the 'joker card' that connects them all, we never know much about their pasts either. They're simply used as cannon fodder. If the deaths were sickeningly inventive again then maybe that would suffice, but they're not. The whole 'needle' scenario is about the only 'oh no!' bit in this film. Once again, how is this meant to get under our skin if you've destroyed every element that made the first film genuinely special? Finally, the ending/surprise twist. I can't say much without saying too much. Simply put, they've really clutched at straws here. See it for yourself, you'll see what I'm talking about.When the first film came out, I tried to see it twice before I actually managed to get tickets. The screening I attended was once again completely sold out. Word of mouth had done the job well. At the end of the first film I felt like my nerve endings were completely blasted and I had to pick my jaw up off the floor. The whole cinema seemed to be in shock. Nobody spoke on the way out. I was terrified walking through the cinema car park.At the end of this film I heard laughter. People had been walking out throughout the film. The room was barely half full to begin with. On the first weekend. At 7pm. On a Saturday night.Weak.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Solid Sequel,"This movie I made sure to see in the theater when it first came out because of how much I liked the original one. After that first viewing, I actually enjoyed it more than the first and held this thought for awhile. I don't think I had seen it since getting it on DVD back in college. This is the first time I'm watching it with a critical eye for an October Movie Challenge where I needed to watch some part 2s of franchises. The synopsis here is a detective and his team must rescue 8 people trapped in a factory by the twisted serial killer known as Jigsaw (Tobin Bell).We kick this off with a cold opening of a guy in a trap. He has something up with his eye and he has a machine around his neck. He has 1 minute to get the key that has been surgically placed under the skin of his eye. If he doesn't, it will clamp shut like a Venus Fly Trap with nails.The movie then shifts us over to Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) who is a detective. He has to collect his son, Daniel (Erik Knudsen) from police custody. Daniel is acting out as his parents are going through a divorce and he's angry. The two of them get into a fight where Daniel states he wants to go back to his mother and Eric tells him to go. He then worries, because he can't find his son.Matthews goes to a crime scene that is run by Kerry (Dina Meyer). She is dedicating a lot of her time to trying to stop Jigsaw. The reason that Matthews is called there is the guy killed was one of his informants and there's a message left for him on the ceiling. Matthews and Kerry get into it and we learn here that Internal Affairs is investigating him. That night, he dreams about the crime scene and a clue of where to look flashes to him. He gets up and relays what he saw.A unit is thrown together with Rigg (Lyriq Bent) and his team. They go to an old factory and soon learn they've come to the right place. There is a trap set up that decimates a few members of the team. Upstairs, they find John Cramer, better known as Jigsaw. He is dying though. He has cancer and not long to live. He wants to play a game with Matthews. He gets his leverage he shows him what is at stake.In a side room, there are monitors showing what the synopsis is alluding to. It isn't at a factory, but a large, decrepit house. People walk up together in a room where Xavier (Franky G), Jonas (Glenn Plummer), Addison (Emmanuelle Vaugier), Laura (Beverley Mitchell), Obi (Timothy Burd) as well as Daniel and even Amanda (Shawnee Smith). She was put back into a Jigsaw game and it appears because she started to cut herself. They all have something in common as well, but they aren't sure what yet. Jonas tries to put it together from what the tape says, but Xavier is a bull in a china shop. They do learn that there is a poison gas in the building that is slowly killing them and they have to play a series of games to get the antidotes for each one of them. This will also lead them on a path of discovery as to how they're connected.To just close out this recap, Matthews is told that his son is in a safe place and all he has to do is sit there and talk with him. Matthews is a hothead and is trying to figure out what happened to his son before it is too late.Now this recap went a bit longer than what I wanted it to, but there is a few moving parts that I felt needed to be brought up before I moved on. What I want to start my analysis with is that as a sequel, I like that this takes what the original does and builds on it to make it bigger. We have more people that are involved and technically we have two games going on that are interconnected.What I love about the games here are that if you just listen to what Jigsaw says, for the most part, and stay calm, you can win the game. The first guy has it a bit rough, but if the will to live is there, then you can do it. As for the larger game in the house, Xavier creates a lot of problems. If he would listen to Amanda and Jonas, the first guy doesn't die. He is bullheaded and quite violent. The other thing is that, people make this an individual game when if they work together they can survive. My original point also works for Matthews and his game. Kerry tries to convince him of this, but he is similar to Xavier. He has anger issues and that blinds with him with red.I have more that I want to delve into with the story, but I think since I've touched on the games, I should go into the effects here. The first trap was cool and reminded me a lot of the reserve bear trap, just obviously a bit different. There is a razor blade game that I think I've figured out how to beat, but the character that does it is exhausted and the poison is really wearing on them by that point. It would be very easy if you have others helping for sure. There is one with fire that you just have to suck it up and go for it. The one that got me the most though was a bunch of used needles that are in a pit. This is supposed to be Xavier's challenge, but he throws someone else in. I like the set up for what they did with these. The make up to show these characters breaking down the more they inhale the poison was a good touch as well. The cinematography was fine aside from some weird edits late in the film that annoy me and there's just this like greenish filter on everything I'm not a fan of.To get back to the story though, Jaime brought up while we were watching this that everyone in the game in the house really is being punished for something that they really didn't do. Matthews is involved and some of them are guilty of something, so I guess that could be the reasoning. We also don't get most of the characters fleshed out. I don't know much about Jonas aside from what he states. Same could be said for Addison and Laura as well. It doesn't ruin the movie, but I think it would help me understand a bit more if that is fleshed out.This would take me next to the acting for the movie, which I do think is good. Bell is John Cramer aka Jigsaw in my eyes. He just embodies it and with his look, I believe he could be a mastermind. This is interesting here to show his weakness that he has cancer and I started to feel bad for him when Matthews is smacking him around. It is just odd for the things that he is doing and it really isn't his place to punish people as he is. Smith is solid being back. I like her story arch here. Wahlberg does a great job as Matthews. He just has that look of a dirty, rough cop who is falling apart. Knudsen was fine. Franky G is a character I hated with how mean he is, but I give him credit for getting the reaction. Plummer was fine, along with Vaugier, Mitchell, Burd, Meyer and Bent. None of them really stand out but the ladies are nice to look at until things fall apart of course.So now with that said this movie I'm not as high on as I was when I left the theater. My original thoughts on it being better have definitely gone away with looking at this with a critical eye. The acting is good here though, across the board. The effects I thought were really good and I really only had issues with some editing near the end and the filter that we see the game in the house has. I like how they build on the story from the original, but I do think there are some problematic aspects to some of the characters being punished to me. Aside from that, the soundtrack was fine, I liked playing the theme right there at the end as well. I'd rate this as an above average movie for me now. Still worth a viewing if you liked the original to see the story continues on.My Rating: 7.5 out of 10",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Even once the full picture is revealed, there are still a few good twists and blindsides.The second saw movie is more like what I was expecting - gratuitous gore and violence. Plot is more basic, almost token, and really just a vehicle to get to the next pointless gory scene.Unfortunately, it doesn't end there.

"Wow, now this is how you make a thriller!","Jigsaw is back and it seems that he's improved his technique for this sequel.Saw II is one of those rare Hollywood sequels that capitalize on the success on a small time film festival winner and somehow actually make it even better than the original. The story is primarily about a father and a son, Eric and Daniel Matthews, with the father being the cop who's thrown into Jigsaw's twisted version of Mousetrap.For those who've seen the original, things get touched on a bit here in the sequel and it expands the story even more from it. Its pretty much beneficial to see the original (which is a good movie) as you can gain more insight on the soon-to-be trilogy, otherwise you'll be kind of left in the dark on some of the key events.I won't say anything about the story or the nice little twists here, just see the movie for yourself or read other spoiler reviews. I'll just say its entertaining enough to keep your attention the entire way, but I was a little disappointed on how the story strayed away near the end from what's suppost to be its main purpose. But just a little, you'll see what I mean. As for the characters themselves, i'd say its overall solid. The acting was good and almost all of them served their purpose well.The meat and potatoes, the actual traps, are more intense this time around. While you can tell why there were limitations in the original (it was a small time flick), the bigger budget implemented on Saw II meant they needed to be better this time. Thankfully, they actually went ahead and did that. The new traps actually look more agonizing this time, including the ""shock"" flashbacks too. Everything I wanted to see was all pretty much here, they delivered the goods.All in all, I thought it was a great movie. Well worth my time and also the first recent movie in awhile to actually shock and keep me at the edge.

Jigsaw is back and so is the nastiness in a not very good sequel,"Jigsaw, the crazed killer from the first Saw is back. Here he's locked up a group of people and told them they have two hours to get out of the house before the nerve gas he's pumping in will kill them. Meanwhile a cop has captured the killer and learns that one of the people trapped in the house is his son.As illogical and mean the first film was it had a certain something that made you want to watch to the end. You had real characters and real twists that kept you glued to your seat. Unfortunately here only the meanness and illogic remains.I need more than just the prospect of nasty things happening to make a movie. Saw 2's horror does not arise from anything other than waiting to see what the next gory event is going to be. Its a step up and over from the slasher films of the early 1980's where you were more interested in how people died than who the characters were. Here the interest is how are the elaborate traps going to kill the next victim. Yes it creates tension, but on some level it becomes nothing more than catalog of mans cruelty to man.Saw 2 also has other problems that I can not get past (Spoilers a head) how does Jigsaw have the time to build these huge death traps? This is especially curious owing to his condition. I had the same question about the first film but the plot moved along at such a clip I didn't have time to think. Here there is time and it made me crazy. How does Jigsaw know so much? He knows so much about everyone and he has access to files and info that he would have no reasonable way of getting. Again how does he have the time and strength to gather all of this material? I won't go into the behavior of the cops, the means of his rounding up all of the victims. Obviously you can't think about these things or the film will collapse.I can't really recommend this film, since while it is well made, its little more than a collection of nasty deaths and cruel acts with the pretense of being something else.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The film does offer one unexpected twist at the end, which led to several more sequels, but for the most part, this film set the formula for the many sequels, which was simply a new set of victims and anew set of overly elaborate traps.

Brutality and boredom. A can't-miss combination!,"The ""Saw"" movies are alternately quite clever and very distressing. Taken together, they constitute an endurance test of brutality. These films challenge us not to look away at least once. So it's no surprise, for those versed in the first installment, when the various expendables of ""Saw II"" start digging into their own flesh, climbing into industrial ovens, and inadvertently shooting themselves in the face. These things sometimes can't be avoided.The hook of ""Saw II,"" like its predecessor, is a neat trick. The victims of Jigsaw, evil mastermind extraordinaire, are given legitimate  albeit gruesome  means of escape. Likewise, the police have the keys to these deadly puzzles right in front of them, if only they knew where to look. This time, Jigsaw is captured early on, in what seems to be a suspiciously easy fashion. Sure enough, he's arranged things so that he's calling the shots, even from police custody. He's rigged a series of monitors showing Detective Eric Matthews' (Donnie Wahlberg) son trapped, with 5 or 6 others, in a house that is to a normal abode what a roach motel is to the real thing. They're slowly being poisoned, and must navigate the house to find the antidote before they start to bleed from places they shouldn't.As in the first ""Saw,"" the film depends on an essentially omnipotent villain. This seems unfair; since we're dealing with god, it's a given that everyone in his clutches will be killed, horribly maimed, or otherwise put at his mercy exactly as planned. The ""thrills"" of ""Saw II,"" if that's the appropriate term, come not from discovering whether these people will be disgustingly done in, but simply how. That leaves us with an ultra-graphic peepshow that exists for its own sake. It's morbid fascination taken to seriously grisly extremes.Both these films are extraordinarily aggressive. They're far less interested in suspense than in making us squirm. The result are some lengthy, boring sequences of chatter between scenes of people getting offed in various death traps. There's little incentive to care about anyone when their ultimate fates are all but certain. As creative as these murder machines are (and they are creative, if you're into that sort of thing), they almost always depend upon impossible anticipation of character behavior and superhuman timing. ""Saw II"" comes with a nifty little twist at the end. I guess it works as much as anything else in the movie, but the body of the film gives viewers no conceivable opportunity to work it out themselves. All the characters here are given the tools they need, if only they can figure out how to use them, but the movie doesn't give us the same benefit. ""Saw II"" happens to us, rather than engaging us. With no stake in the outcome, we're turned into mere voyeurs. But the escape for audiences is hidden in plain sight as if it were one of Jigsaw's traps. It's at the back of the theater, and has a red ""EXIT"" sign over it.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
brilliant film. A classic horror for years to come.,"you have fine horror films like the Texas chainsaw massacre and the exorcist, and now you have saw 2. the film shows true makings of a horror classic and i can honestly say i have never been so scared of a film in my life. the film is so successful because it relates to the first film and has one hell of a twist at the end. the basic outline is that a group of unfortunate souls get caught up in jigsaws little game he has planned out for them. they are in a house and they have to get out before the gas kills them. also trying to hinder there escape are little traps set around the house which also bring death. so the odds are against the gang. well, as the tag line goes...ooh yes, there will be blood. - it almost certainly lives up to it.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"As good of a sequel as the original,but is a totally different movie.","Saw 2 though not done completely by the first 2 creators of the original Saw is as good as the 1st film. You get the same aspect of a game being played as the characters wake up after being drugged or beaten over the head, to wake up in a house they do not know, & find out they are locked in breathing a very toxic nerve gas that was planted by the serial-killer Jigsaw. Throughout the movie I kept thinking, if Jigsaw is so cancer-stricken how in the hell did he,if he's so sick booby-trap the house, lock up the place as you see in this film,he's breathing through an oxygen-tank & is barely able to walk. The answer you find out at the end of this film & it is a shocker! Very cool plot twists just like the first film. More gorier (which I really appreciated!) & just as suspenseful.Donnie Wahlberg,Dina Meyer,Shawnee Smith & Tobin Bell did awesome jobs throughout. And, the scene where Frankie G's character cuts off the back of his own neck to be able to read his number to open the safe which has his number of the combination on it, was most brutal & will have you squirming in your seat most definitely. Also,the guy who plays Obi, I was surprised to see wasn't Steve Railsback, as my god he's a dead ringer. And,one other question I have is the scene where Shawnee Smith's character Amanda & the cop's kid Daniel are running through the underground portion of the house & they come upon a door where upon opening it, they find the abandoned bathroom that Cary Elwes & Leigh Wannell's character were in, in the 1st film. So,how come if they were in there, you see Leigh Wannell's corpse decaying on the bathroom floor still connected to the pipe by the chain, but you also see another body lying on the floor decaying as well & what i want to know is, was that Cary Elwes character Dr Lawrence Gordon, who in the first film crawls out of the bathroom when the door's is opened by the man who kidnapped his family,and after he's killed,larry goes to go get help,even though he had to Saw off his own foot & was bleeding to death? Or, did they forget that Jigsaw was the guy laying in the middle of the floor, & that he got up after Larry left,when it was just him & Leigh Wannells character in the room,closed the door & Said Game Over?Or,did he find Dr Gordon & drag his\m back in the room, & let him bleed to death? Never was answered in Saw 2. Very cool way to end this film & leave it open for a Saw 3 which they are already promising us in Halloween of 06. Also,if you love this film,check out the new comic series from IDW Publushing, that continues on the Jigsaw man quest for making us ingrates appreciate are lives much much more. Very cool film. I was a little worried when I initially fount out it wasn't the original creators writing it but this writer was just as good, as initially this was supposed to be a different film altogether, that had nothing to do with the Saw franchise whatsoever, & Leigh Wannell came in & helped the guy re-write it so it would fit the Saw storyline.Very cool if you ask me. **** out of *****",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Why? Why did they sucker me in a second time??,"The original Saw was the first movie I ever walked out of. I've seen some awful movies in my life, but I've never felt the need to make such a bold statement before. So why I suckered in on buying Saw II on DVD is just my own fault. Oh, Wahlberg is in it, it can't be that bad. Wrong Wahlberg. I was thinking it was the Wahlberg that doesn't make crappy movies. The Saw series offers such a great premise without following through with a great cast or script, not to mention the worst acting ever. Do you know how they do recaps from previous episodes on TV series? They felt the need to do a montage of all the scenes that explains the twist in the end. That is just too sad.

Saw II: A psychological thriller that keeps you guessing until the end,"When ""Saw"" was released in 2004, the reviews on the film were quite mixed. Some were impressed with the unexpected hit of the season, while others could not stand it. For those who did like ""Saw,"" I highly recommend the sequel. I went to the movie expecting a crummy effort at mediocre sequel, and could not have been more surprised. I was kept on the edge of my seat (not quite literally) throughout the whole film. Towards the beginning of the movie, I felt quite thirsty and wanted to get a drink; this is usually done when there seems to be a bit of dead space in a movie, so that missing the two minutes to get a drink won't really matter. However, I was never able to leave my seat and take myself away from what I was seeing. It constantly keeps you guessing about all sorts of things, and I found myself trying to decipher ""Jigsaw's"" riddles along with the captives (for the most part, without much success). Many of the film's scenes are just as, if not more intense than those of the first, and for the fans of ""Jigsaw's"" infamous traps and ""games,"" well you're in luck, because there is a whole new array of sadistic contraptions and situations, some that I found quite difficult to watch, that are quite up to par with those of the first. The acting has improved considerably in comparison to the original and story seemed a lot more clever to me. The film's slogan is ""Oh yes... there will be blood"" and blood there is indeed. I would not recommend this for the faint of heart, nor anyone under the age of fifteen to eighteen (depending on one's maturity level. But to all fans of the first, it's worth the money...",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Absolute Trash,"When the first Saw movie came out I thought it was just going to be another stupid horror movie that we have seen a million times, but when I saw it I thought it was really good. It was an intense psychological thriller with a lot of surprises. The writing was excellent and fresh.Having said that, I recently watched Saw II and it was the most appalling piece of trash I have watched in a long time. There was absolutely nothing in the second one that could be compared to the first one. The writing was weak and the writers should be embarrassed to have their name associated with this tripe. The situations are stupid, the characters are complete idiot's and there isn't a scare in the whole movie. If you think listening to a lot of screaming and seeing over the top amounts of fake blood is scary then maybe this movie is for you. I don't think I jumped once and I certainly wasn't on the edge of my seat. The twist at the end was okay, but it was just a set-up to make a third one. The only thing good about this movie is that you get to know Jigsaw more and learn what makes him do what he does.If you have any sense at all you would avoid this movie at all costs. Don't pay money to see it, but if you must watch it try and see it for free.If you want to watch an intelligent, tense movie, then watch Saw. If you want to watch complete stupidity and see how a movie should not be written, then watch Saw 2. As for Saw 3, well, I'm not getting my hopes up.You have been warned.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Brilliant.,"This movie was shot very well..it's almost like an illusion...causing you to believe one thing while something completely different is happening in the background.If you are terrified of blood, gore, disturbing images &/or themes, you should refrain from seeing this, because those are the building blocks of Saw and Saw II, the pieces to the puzzle, if you will.I would also recommend that you see the first movie before this one, because it will help you understand what exactly is going on (they make a lot of references to Saw).Prepare for the ending. It will shock you.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Disappointed,"First off, let me just say that the first Saw film was a work of art that made me feel something no other horror movie has touched since. There was claustrophobia, tension, and a great plot twist at the end. Most of this is lost in Saw 2.The movie begins with a bang, as Jigsaw has set up a trap for an unknowing individual. You get the same look and feel as you did when seeing the traps for the first time in ""Saw"". However, it is all downhill from here. John is not the mysterious character that he was in the first movie; rather the writers tried to make his humanity stand out more through a series of flashbacks throughout the movie. I don't think they foresaw the entire mystery element being swept away with that decision, but that is exactly what happens in this film. Not many movies can survive outing the villain within the first 15 minutes, and sadly, this falls into that group.When the mystery element is compromised, one of the things that can really keep me on the edge of my seat is the tension of the actors. This is also vacant in Saw 2. The cast never gels as Adam and the doctor do in the first movie, and it is apparent in every scene. Shawnee Smith, the lone survivor of Jigsaw's ""game"", is back for the sequel and acts much like Ali Larter did in Final Destination 2. She tries to be a leader and mentor to everybody in the house, yet comes off as a smug and obnoxious character who is just as unlikable as everyone else in the house. Beverley Mitchell (of 7th Heaven fame) is out of her league in the horror genre, as is Franky G, who plays Xavier. Everyone else had loads of potential, but never quite gelled as they should have.As mentioned before, the tension element is lacking in Saw 2, and much of it has to do with the missing claustrophobia that was everywhere in the first one. At first, I thought they were all going to be confined into the one room that they wake up in, but you find shortly after that the rest of the house is their's to explore as well. The house felt huge compared to what it was being portrayed as in the previews, and I feel that was a mistake.The two things that I felt Saw 2 had going for it were Donnie Wahlberg's acting and the amazingly twisted ending. Donnie was great as the father of one of the victim's of Jigsaw's game, and fans of the first Saw's ending will NOT be disappointed with this ending. As stated in countless reviews before mine, the ending to Saw 2 sets up the franchise for however long Lion's Gate decides to keep it running. Overall, the movie is a disappointing entry in the Saw franchise, but looking forward to the last 15 minutes makes the other 1 hour 15 minutes bearable.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Oh Yes, There Was Blood","This movie was SO amazing! I saw Saw 1 and Saw 2 wrapped it up beautifully, but now there's more to the story... Not only was this movie truly frightening, it had a plot line! After the movie, my dad and I debated the story all night- you can't debate Godzilla. It makes you think what you would do in similar situations. It makes you ask if what's happening is right. The cast is fantastic as well.

Devoid of emotion and scary for the wrong reasons.,"Although the Saw films have some rather nifty ideas, you cant help but feel the same ideas could be pulled from a 12 year old boy sitting above the ants nest with his magnifying glass. I felt, watching this movie, the presence of those same twisted little boys now grown up now inside their brand new executive suits and looking for a way to prize money out of the new generation of twisted little boys. Saw is, to horror, what pop-stars is to pop music. Films such as Michael Hanekes 'Funny Games' make you feel implicated and ill embarrassed with yourself for the events you are witnessing. I think the director might hope he has duped his audience that this is also his intention. I do not believe it though, although this is a scary film, the object of my fear is the people who made it and starred in it. Saw 2 will make a lot of money and many of the audience will be happy, perhaps I am too sensitive a soul but for me, I feel a sense of emptiness, what has society come to when this is entertainment. I have felt this many times before with a lot of horror films better or worse. This time I feel the reason behind this gray feeling I have, the object of my fears, lie in the filmmakers and, perhaps I am just to sensitive a soul, but there comes a time for me when horror films cross the line.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Very disappointing and extremely flawed,"I completely agree with Plumberduck! I actually liked the first Saw film, but this one was pretty much rubbish. In the first one we get all these great and horrifying puzzles that the victim needs to solve to avoid dying, in this one we get them too, but like plumberduck says, they are not really solved at all. It was not nearly as scary as the first one, maybe because now we've seen it before, though I was a bit disgusted, but mostly with the behavior of some of the characters and some of the acting as well. I am sorry, but I simply cannot take Lucy from 7th Heaven seriously in a role like this. And yes, the yelling overshadows the puzzle solving completely. Jigsaw has managed to capture some pretty dumb people this time. I did enjoy the Jigsaw character, but I'm getting a little sick of his ""I don't kill people, they kill themselves"" routine. No they don't. They do NOT kill themselves, they are just unable to save themselves. And as far as I remember, in the first one, the last guy didn't really have a fair chance of saving himself, so Jigsaw definitely killed him. I mean, does this guy think what he does isn't illegal, simply because he doesn't directly shoot the victims? He captures them and place them in different sort of devices that will eventually kill them. Now come on! I do, however, think the whole Saw plot idea is pretty good, just too bad they mess it up like that. With a better writer and a couple of better actors, this movie could have kicked ass. But it doesn't. And now they're doing a 3rd? Jesus Christ. I'll give it 5 for nice traps.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Beyond my expectations,"I expected ""Saw II"" to be Pretty Much Just Okay. I wasn't sure how it could surpass the original, considering the original film's Final Twist(s), and the trailer for this sequel didn't have me jumping up and down to see it. But ""Saw II"" surpassed any expectations anyone might have. While I wasn't surprised for Dina Meyer to reprise her role from ""Saw,"" and I was pleased she has more to do here, I was even more pleased to discover the return of Shawnee Smith from the first film (my being a bit of a fan of this expressive underrated lovely and talented actress notwithstanding). But in this awesome sequel, the twists keep a'coming, and this film had me more on edge by *far* more than even the first. The tricks and traps are a bit more creative, and I love movie villains who have various contingencies covered. Which side is thinking ahead of the other?

The Rebirth of Sick,"Twisted serial killer Tobin Bell (as John ""Jigsaw"" Kramer) is back, from the first ""Saw"" (1904), and he's out for more blood. Last time, as you recall, Mr. Bell trapped two men in a bathroom, with leg-irons and ""Saw"". This time, he's locked a bunch of people in a dirty house. To make it WORSE than the first movie, the house seems to have NO bathroom at all. What happens if you have to go? There is a way for the characters to get to the bathroom from the original film (but I'd rather go in my pants). Anyway, ""Jigsaw"" is also releasing a deadly gas in the sealed-up house; it makes the trapped cast cough up blood, and wear dark eye makeup...""Saw II"" is directed by Darren Lynn Bousman with continuity assist from co-writer Leigh Whannell. It is a great thriller - and, more importantly as this is obviously now a film series - an excellent sequel. They do just about everything you need to do to build a successful franchise. The neatly constructed plot weaves Shawnee Smith (as Amanda) from the first film with corrupt cop Donnie Wahlberg (as Eric Matthews); his estranged son, curly-haired Erik Knudsen (as Daniel), is among the unsavory types trapped in Jigsaw's puzzle. The cast is wholly entertaining.

What's wrong with the world when so many people pay money to see movies about torturing other people for no reason?!,"The original Saw was OK. It had more or less an original premise at the time and it actually focused on at least some story and not only violence. Saw 2 on the other hand is just terrible. Bad acting, bad idea, bad script, bad directing and w whole lot of blood for nothing. Who would pay to see this c-r-a-p? I can't believe i payed to see it. Okay, i paid for the different reasons. I've seen all the Saw movies, not in theaters, and every last one of them sucks. Except for the first one that's at least watchable. The reason i've seen them is because i don't like to criticize something i don't know anything about and because so many people seems to like them. Which is just another proof of where the society is going when people are ready to pay their hard earned money to see movies about people being tortured by some psycho that the writers give their best to show him as some sort of a 'ocassionaly makes sense' kinda guy!Don't get me wrong. I have nothing against violence in movies. But i don't see why so many people want to see a movie that's about nothing but violence. Braveheart, The Deer Hunter, Clockwork Orange, Pulp Fiction, even Kick Ass... Those are all violent movies. Some of them don't even have a message that speaks against it! And i don't mind that. I am not searching for a message when i'm watching a movie. I'm searching for a good movie. But Saw is a movie with only one storyline-violence. That's what i don't like about it. It's about nothing but violence!The worst thing is that they made a whole money making series on it. That's something i will never understand! Violence is OK - movies that hurt peoples intelligence are not. This kind of movie belongs to that group. And how in the world did it succeed to make that many fans??? I guess i'll never know!?

"""Yes, there will be blood...""","James Wan is gone, and the studio needed a sequel for what was being regarded, incorrectly I think, as a new type of cult horror. Leigh Whannel stayed, and the studio decided to turn a man's interesting screenplay into ""Saw II"".The film doesn't begin where it ended up, but it didn't have to. Later on, you could say it really has a lot to do with its predecessor, because manipulating plot lines connections can be created. Most people don't care if something actually makes sense, but I do; and there's nothing in this film we could have understood without the multiple flashbacks the movie presents to help us.""Saw"" was original and in a way its sequel is original too; but not as risky as the first part, that wasn't even that risky. If the writers give us something to make our minds work, why do they provide us all the hints to resolve their madness? Maybe because they know it's impossible for us to figure it out! And then what are we watching? In terms of directing, the same thing Wan did last year. A lot of loud sounds, quick shots, constant camera changes, the wanted problems and confusions with time; and if I hadn't seen the name of Darren Lynn Bousman (that's the director), I would have thought it was Wan again. But then maybe it's a comfort, because Wan did it differently.I said when I wrote about ""Saw"" that it had accomplished something that wasn't all ""blood and death"". He had the courage of putting no more than two persons in a room for over an hour. But when the number of persons increases, the complexity decreases. In ""Saw II"" we get around eight persons (I don't even remember) in the same environment that, according to Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) have something in common; and to get out of there they have to play a game.There's no complexity because it becomes the typical lock-up script (""Cube""); with different types of stereotyped characters, suspicions, distrusts, anger andYes, killing everywhere. A lot of blood all around in a lot of varied ways, that betray Wan's vision of a subtle and well constructed film. There was no need of most of the things included in this sequel, and the intentions don't work either. The blood didn't even make me squeeze. Does that mean that I'm brave? No, it doesn't; it means that the elements were out of place.Miraculously, at least one thing felt right. I'm talking about Tobin Bell and his expansive portrayal of which is, while not presented as it, the main character of this films. His commitment goes way beyond what's written in the screenplay and the duality of his interpretation remains to be the strongest connection of this film with the other one, which is saying a lot.I forgot to mention lots of things; some actors, some plot lines, some surprises, I don't know. But I know this: ""Saw"" was a regular film; ""Saw II"" is worseIt's bad.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Terrible, but marginally better than the first","The Saw franchise suffers from everything. From poor screenplays to bad acting to worse directing. This movie takes some of the creepy ideals cherished by Kevin spacey in Se7en (a fantastic flick) and executes them in a generally brainless, uninspired, gore-fest. Just about the same as the first. The only difference, however, is Saw 2 does not suffer the same cast. Let us not forget that Carey Elwes is a fantastic COMEDY actor, he never should have been cast in a movie like saw. So, better cast, slightly more intriguing story make for a marginally less craptacular film.

Saw 2 breaks traditional sequel suckage.,"I just seen the flick for the third time last night and I've got to say, it doesn't disappoint. It offers all that the first one had to offer and then some. My only gripe with the film is that it had too many center characters. With the film running at roughly an hour and a half, it's hard to focus on all of the cast and give them their own story. So if and when the next one comes out, I'd suggest keeping it down to three or less central characters (with side character killings ala Saw 1) or bump up the length to around two hours. All in all though, it was a great movie in a genre that seems to have ran dry of ideas. I give it a 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Barely holds a candle to the first film,"I was quite impressed by the first ""Saw"", and thrilled to hear that a sequel was in the works. The more I thought about it though, I began to worry that the second film would turn out to be an uninspired, inferior, money-driven counterpart. While one could definitely do worse, I'm sad to say that Saw II falls drastically short of it's predecessor.The movies starts off very well, with a disturbing ""victim"" scene that evokes the same feelings of nauesa and suspense as the first film. However, after the credits roll, the sense of dread and terror disappears, and Saw II turns into a second-rate, though technically impressive, thriller. This time, instead of two men chained in a bathroom, the Jigsaw killer (Tobin Bell) has locked a large group of strangers together in a decripit old house. There's a poisonous gas wafting around the house and the prisoners have two hours to find antidotes before the toxins kill them. And of course, the house is rigged with Jigsaw-worthy booby traps. While all of this goes on, Detective Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) has corned Jigsaw himself, and thinks that he has the killer's scheme all figured out. But what would a ""Saw"" film be without twists? Unfortunately, in the case of Saw II, I thought that the plot twists actually hurt the film in the end, as well as a lot of other things. First and foremost is the cast. What drove the first film was the development of the two main characters. I cared about them and wanted to see them escape from the bathroom. Not only are the characters in Saw II underdeveloped, but most of them are either so bland, obnoxious, or despicable that I couldn't wait to see most of them meet a grisly end in one of Jigsaw's traps. This, is not a good thing. Jigsaw himself is well played by Tobin Bell, but the fact that he is presented in person throughout the film actually makes him less frightening. The Jigsaw from the first film was more than a slasher villain, but at the same time, he was no Hannibal Lecter. He was a brilliant, sadistic philosopher/killer who was only seen at the very end of the film. The Jigsaw in Saw II just doesn't seem quite perverse enough.As for the other characters.....Donnie Wahlberg gives a decent performance in a role that doesn't command much sympathy from the audience. Shawnee Smith returns as Amanda, and does a good job in the part. I don't know the word to describe Franky G's acting, but let me just say that I have not encountered a more beligerent and annoying horror victim (I couldn't wait for him to bite the dust, again, not a good sign). Overall, the acting isn't atrocious. It's just that none of the characters are remotely interesting.The direction from Darren Lynn-Bousman makes me cry for James Wan to return to the series, for Saw II sorely lacks the edge and I daresay the mean spirit of the first film. Fortunately, there are some nice nods to Saw in the second film. The first kill, the cackling doll on the tricycle, and another scene which I will not give away. The film is well shot and lit, and the production design is nice, but the fast-paced, MTV-esquire editing that occasionally popped up in the first film is everywhere in Saw II, and often detracts from what little horror there is.And finally, there is a big twist in the end of the movie, but it's not a very good one, and feels more like plot revlation recycled from those of other movies. The whole film seems to be building towards the inevitable twist in the end, and the pay-off is far from satisfying. Indeed, the plot of Saw II has more holes than a wheel of Swiss cheese, and much of it is very hard to believe. At first I found it hard to believe that Leigh Whannel (and although uncredited, apparently James Wan) penned the script with Bousman. But then I realized that Saw II is exactly what I feared it would be. An unnecessary, hollow sequel that was probably made with the promise of reaping huge profits from the box office.If you want a good film that will make you squirm uncomfortably, check out ""Three...Extremes"". If you're a fan of Saw like I am, you'll probably be quite disappointed by the sequel.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery

It has always been said that the sequels of most movies leave you wanting more, or in some cases, asking why did they even spend the money? This one had every aspect of the horror movie you paid to see: blood, violence,creativity, intriguing characters (Jigsaw is the MAN!), and enough twists and turns with just a touch of imagination from the director that had three hardcore horror fans sitting on the edges of our seats! This man has a truly brilliant, disturbed mind...and I thank him for it!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
revolting and frankly meaningless,"The only thing I'd save is the twisty ending (as twisty as the prequel finale) but, apart from that, I found no positive notes, in spite of the bigger budget and of the certainly bigger expectations. Too may scenes are needlessly disgusting and besides, when a horror movie is only revolting without showing the audience something different from mere violence and bloodshed, well, it means the film is not worth watching and nothing did work; that's why the only reason why somebody could (not should) be interested in going to theaters and watching this sequel is the memory of the premise. This picture then has no famous actor nor significant character, therefore the conclusion is that no one, except for affectionate fans, should waste time and money.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"NO! Don't hire ""american idols"" to be actors. It doesn't work.","Just a quick comment on this one, even though it's not really worth it: This movie has very *amateurish* acting and poor direction + weak script and dialog. And what is the point with all that obscene language? We are starting to get very very fed up of finding it in almost every movie released nowadays. I mean, I'm not really offended or anything, but it throws no punch if it's just sprayed out in every sentence (plus it just sounds silly).First Saw movie had something special, this movie is just sad. Think it could have been made something decent out of this, but the whole crew of actors (ok, maybe except the guy playing jigsaw) + director would have to be replaced and the script would need some ""tightening up"" to make it more sane. Also never got the feeling that people in this movie were really trapped (like in the first one) - you could see through the barricades on the windows for gods sake!? I really hated all the actors in this movie, except the jigsaw guy cos he had a bit of intensity and presence, and I wanted them ALL to die.Another thing that I'm starting to (sadly) realize is that:RATINGS ON IMDb CAN'T BE TRUSTED!I'm 100% sure that movie studios/companies (or some ""whatever person"" related to this movie (and others too) ) are hiring people to write untrue reviews and give false ratings. Well, who can blame them really after spending millions of dollars on a movie..but still..I don't know, it's just sad {again} I suppose.I give this a 2. I'm tempted into giving it a ""1"" (to correct the ""damage"" of this having a rating of ""7"" ), but..that wouldn't be fair either, I suppose.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Tacky cash-in sequel ""oh, yes, there will be crap..""","The original ""Saw"" is a pretty good horror effort, for an American film, (although it can't compare with the stuff coming out of Japan.) It was bloody, but stopped right on the line of going overboard with the violence, which would have cheapened the film. It had a suspenseful story, with some real twists, and finally, a surprising, and satisfying ending. There were only two main characters, and this allowed for some focus on actual character development, and believable story. And so it received attention and praise, as something decent coming out of Hollywood these days is rare indeed. Unfortunately when a horror film is successful in the States, the parade of inferior sequels is inevitable. ""Saw 2"" is no exception. First, lets state the obvious; You cannot make the same film twice and expect the same level of quality entertainment. The film makers here, seemed to want desperately to make a sequel that actually didn't suck. So they decided that they had to top the first one, by making it a hundred times bloodier. Well, they did succeed at that. And the first ""Saw"" ended with a surprise finale, so they tried to think up another shocking last second revelation, to wow audiences. But this time they failed. Because the ending was contrived, and most of us saw it coming a mile away, because we know how the first one worked. And like I said, you can't pull the same trick twice, because we will always want something new, and different. At least when it comes to this type of film. Because films like ""Saw 2"" have nothing else to offer, besides shocks and cheap thrills, and gore. There is not one scene in this film that is stylishly or artistically shot, or even competently shot for that matter. Most of the film looks like a TV cop show, or an MTV video.There is not one interesting character here (with the exception of Jigsaw himself). And this fact really sunk this film. Filled with the most insipid stereotypes imaginable. We have the macho dark-skinned drug dealer, the sexy Spanish-looking bad girl, the white bread 'honkie' who spends her entire time on camera crying with mascara running down her dirty face. We have one of the most ridiculous, one dimensional versions of ""the ex-junkie"" that i have ever seen. We even have the ""token black guy"". It seems like the film makers were trying to make everyone like the film, by including a character that each one of us could relate to individually. I even found myself relating a little to the little juvenile delinquent with the estranged, cold father. Afterwards i realized what manipulative bull it all was. Nothing more than a money making ploy here. The thing that depresses me now, is how much some other people praised this film, some even saying it was better than the first film! Are todays moviegoers that stupid, that easily fooled? We should get one thing straight: Saw 2 is BLOODIER than Saw 1. That does not mean it is better. This film should only appeal to MTV and video game addicts, looking for gore set pieces and nothing else. And I will give credit where it is deserved; There are some good blood scenes here, including one of the most grisly and realistic throat-slashing scenes ever. Don't expect anything more, unless you have extremely low standards, or extremely poor taste in film. I will not be in attendance for the inevitable, (and inevitably stupid) ""Saw 3"".",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Not too impressive,"Saw II (2005) is of course the sequel to the famous Saw (2004). This sequel didn't really impress me all that much. I'll start with what I didn't really care for in the movie. One of the negatives about the movie is some of the cast members acting ability. Tobin Bell and Donnie Wahlberg both turn in good performances, but to be honest, the other actors just didn't really sell me on their performances or pull me into it the movie more. Another one of the negatives is that the movie as a whole isn't all that interesting. The first Saw movie is undoubtedly the best in the series, and it surpasses this second installment. To be completely honest, if you watch Saw for the traps, then you probably won't like this one, the jigsaw traps aren't that interesting or creative at all. The characters, except for Detective Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) and his teenage son, don't have much depth at all, which made me not really care about them very much. The writing is slightly below average. So all in all, Saw II gets a 4/10, just not a very entertaining film. I don't even think fans of the Saw films would enjoy it very much.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
We need more like this,"Like its predecessor, Saw II proves that not only is there a market for hardcore, adult-oriented material, Hollywood is only hurting itself by ignoring the fact. Made for a mere estimated four million dollars, Saw II has already given a RoboCop-like return to the tune of eighty million, and it is only just coming to the home video market. To call this a spit in the face of the Everything Must Be Suitable For Four Year Olds mentality that is making Hollywood painful is like calling a nuclear missile a subtle expression of disdain. But I am getting ahead of myself here. All the box office data in the world does not mean a thing without the answer to an exceedingly simple question. Namely, is the film any good? Does it keep one interested during its running length? The answer to these questions, in spite of a few artistic decisions I am not sure I agree with, is a big yes. Everything that the horror film industry got wrong in the late 1980s or early 1990s, Saw II gets right. The film gets them very right, as a matter of fact.Saw II has a similar plot to its predecessor, but with some important differences. The scope of the story is broader, the cast is larger, and the game is more complex. Where the original revolved around two men chained to the piping in a disused bathroom, this sequel gives us a small group of very confused characters who all have unsavoury histories. In Repo Man, we are told by Agent Rodgersz that no one is innocent. Darren Lynn Bousman and Leigh Whannell must have been paying attention during this shot, because the only character in their script for Saw II that comes remotely close to appearing innocent is Daniel, the son of the detective portrayed with a great fury by Donnie Wahlberg. As Daniel attempts to survive by psychologically manipulating his peers, Wahlberg's Eric Matthews tries to coerce Jigsaw into being a little less exceedingly obvious. Tobin Bell once again gives us a stunning portrayal of a madman who just wants people to appreciate what they take for granted. He survives the comparison to classic film villains such as Darth Vader brilliantly.Obviously, when the budget on your film is this small, you are not going to have elaborate special effects or amazing feats of action. The real kicker in Saw II, like its predecessor, is in the fiendish traps and puzzles designed by the production team. It is impossible to describe these traps to someone who has not seen their kind before. It is also impossible to explain exactly what Jigsaw is doing without giving away the plot. Suffice to say that Jigsaw is extremely literal. As one reviewer has pointed out, one of the trademarks of the old 1980s serial killer characters that devolved in annoyances with the progression of sequels is that everything must be complicated beyond belief. When Jigsaw speaks, it makes the film exceptionally enjoyable to bear in mind that he is never lying or elaborating. It is the people he speaks to who defeat themselves by assuming complication and deception where none exists. We should be able to say this kind of dialogue and plotting is not unique, but in a manner of speaking, it is. But as I indicated earlier, this is by no means the only way in which the Saw films set an example others should follow.I have but one complaint about Saw II. Where its predecessor was a tad overlong at a hundred minutes, Saw II feels too short. Yes, it is well-paced and holds the viewer's interest for its entire running time, but in expanding the cast, Saw II presents a few too many characters in too little time. Some of the deaths are just too brief, and some characters could have done with a little more background. The upside to this is that in contrast to some films that are short and yet feel too long, Saw II leaves the viewer waiting for more. If every film that ran for ninety-three minutes could say the same, Hollywood and its product might just be experiencing a little less consumer hostility. While I cannot say anything about the ending for fear of spoiling the surprise, I will say that the performances of Shawnee Smith and Donnie Wahlberg will leave this scene echoing in the viewer's memory long after the credits roll. Tobin Bell also gets in a few cracking lines, but this truly is Smith's and Wahlberg's show, through and through. Both deserve far more work than they have received of late.I gave Saw II a nine out of ten. It is not the kind of life-affirming experience that I found X-Men 2 or Eegah to be, but it does give one hope for the future of film. See it with a friend, or with someone who likes to do something with their brain while they wear their eyes down. You will both be glad you did.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The Jigsaw Killer Strikes Again!,"If you enjoyed Saw, I have a feeling you will enjoy Saw 2. After watching both movies on the theater screen, it was hard to judge which one is best. After all, when you watch the first movie of any series, the story is new and therefore less predictable than when it is developed into a sequel, but I think I've finally decided that the second movie is the best, mostly because there is a lot of movement. Though the confinement in the first movie creates an interesting tension in the theater, the second one creates an overwhelming sensation as you watch the characters travel from room to room. I also like the idea of putting a whole group of characters together in such a creepy situation. The expectation is that they will work together to get out, but this movie shows you how members of a group against each other when their lives are at stake. I also like how viewers are presented with the idea that a group of people who seem very different can have more in common than they realize face to face. The twists in this movie are great! I hope a third movie can be developed from this storyline.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Everything you expect from the movie is there. And NOTHING MORE.,"For beginners, the movie suffers from the Shyamalan syndrome: you KNOW there's going to be a twist at the end, and you KNOW the writers will do their best to make you go ""WOW, I could never tell that was going to happen!"". That's obvious right from the start. So, what's the point? Even if you don't know what the revelation will be, you know it WILL be there, and you know it will be in the exact same The Usual Suspects style - which was already done in the first movie. And what's worse: it looks EXACTLY like on the first movie. Exactly. Even without the less-than-subtle throwbacks to the first movie. The writers were willingly delivering ""more of the same"" to people who wanted it. And there were a lot of them, so who's to blame them? Still, though, the ending isn't the only thing in the movie that matters. The set-up of Saw II is nothing new. For starters, it's Cube - even with the exact number of people (edit: in fact, there's one more person in Saw II, but he dies such a jaw-droppingly contrived death that he isn't even worth mentioning) - but with an over-the-top back story and with idiotic, uninteresting characters. Through the whole movie, I was amazed to see that the characters KNEW what kind of ""puzzles"" they were to expect, and didn't try to out-trick the puzzles even once - and it was possible. The puzzles AND the characters were there merely to provide sick, gratuitous violence and those intense ""psychological"" sequences of people screaming and going nuts. And yes, their actions were calculated down to the millisecond to make the WHOLE plan work, with the maximum amount of violence possible. There's no depth to the story. There's not even any development in the relationship between characters. There's just blood, blood, death and people screaming. And I say, what's the need for a Cube rip-off that takes off its most interesting aspects and replaces it with shallowness aplenty? The Jigsaw back story, well, I could live without it. I don't know the need EITHER for a story about 90-year-old Christopher Walken lookalike with a brain tumour and more than sufficient money and time to build ultra-clever ""games"" which all work flawlessly due to the victims' stupidity and a few plot contrivances. With games and movies like that, I'm thankful we still have Chessmaster. Overall, I'll just stop calling the movie a rip-off of a dozen other movies because it actually looks more like a homage (check the mandatory verbal reference to Last House On The Left); a humble homage; a VERY, VERY humble homage, so it deserves an extra star.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Bigger Budget, more dumb characters, dumbed down flick","Title: Saw II (2005)Director: Darren Lyn BousmanCast: Donnie Wahlberg, Shawnee Smith and Tobin BellReview:There was no doubt on anyones mind that this sequel would get made after the first SAW film became such a huge success. The people liked something...lets give them more of what they liked! And with more blood, more effects, more actors! And sadly, less suspense and a dumbed down plot! Yeah that will bring them in!The story for SAW II isn't to hard to summarize. First off the killer known as the Jigsaw, has captured and kidnapped a group of strangers and placed them in a house filled with death traps. Together they must follow the rules of his game if they want to survive. The police commence their investigation to try and save them.Let me start by saying that this movie is a clone of the first one. Its basically the first movie step by step, everything that you liked from the first one is done here again. Only thing is that since this time you already know whats coming, well there's no real surprise to anything. The Jigsaw traps his victims, places them in an elaborate death traps and he sits back and watches them kill themselves while trying to escape. So there's no novelty in its premise. That jolt you got when you saw the first one, where you didn't know what was going on or what was going to happen next just doesn't happen this time around.But putting aside the fact that this movie sacrificed its freshness to the altar of sequels, there is some fun to be had with this flick. The only redeeming quality for me in this flick where the kills. I knew the people where going to die at some point, I just wanted to see HOW. And for the most part, the deaths were cool. Not as gory as expected and kind of tame, but cool. Id definitely say that with the exception of the first death with the ""venus flytrap"" mask, the rest of the deaths in the movie are very mild in comparison to the gruesomeness of the first film.Now, onto what I didn't like about this film. First off, the characters were the dumbest most unreliable characters I've seen in quite some time! The jigsaw killer left them with some very obvious clues which the chose to completely ignore for most of the movie...right until the last part! I'm like Hello! wake up he left you idiots plenty of clues! But no, we have to stretch the movie so lets let them be idiots for most of the film. I didn't like that. It just felt like an excuse to stretch the running time of the film.They would fall into the traps so easily...and in one instant when they throw a girl into a pit of needles to look for a key that the killer has placed in it, she starts to savagely look through the needles getting hurt in the process, I found this act to be so dumb! She didn't have to look through the needles like that! She could have done it more carefully so she wouldn't hurt herself, but no, these characters are idiots. And then after all the hoopla has happened you realized she could have gotten out of the pit if she wanted to. It was only like two feet high or something.Then there's the premise. I loved the idea of the first movie involving only two people for a grand majority of its running time. It was just this intense plot with just two people inside of a room. Now in comes the sequel, and of course this translates to more budget and everything having to be bigger, so what do they do? The have a house full of people ready to die. I personally thought it was more tense with just the two guys in the first film.As it is, with this film, I got some really strong CUBE flashbacks. Think about it, a bunch of people in a claustrophobic environment, they switch from one room to the next searching for clues on how to get out...and in every room a different form of death awaits them. And just like in Cube, the real conflict comes from all the different personalities just clashing with each other, and of course one of the characters has to be this real asshole that becomes deadly dangerous to the group, just like the Cube films.The plot was really dumbed down in my opinion. It didn't have the edge that the first film had, it didn't have the element of surprise that the first one had, and the characters were dumb as hell. The only saving grace for this movie in my opinion was the ending and how the film connected with the first. Thats the only really cool thing about it. The rest was just dumb and repetitive.Rating: 2 out of 5",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery

This one had a bunch of tricks that where creative and thrilling, but overall not as mentally interesting. They had basic bodies for the creation, with interesting aspects, but it was all very ""ooh, look at that! I think i'll puke now!"" instead of in the first.

"Clever, Well-Thought Out Sequel to the Original...","I am such a huge fan of the original 'Saw' movie and I had been excited to watch 'Saw II' for about a year. I started watching it and from the first minute, I knew that this movie would shock me.As you go along through Jigsaw's newest game, you become shocked with the new traps he has set up, which I will not go into. They were just too incredible and sick to imagine. The entire game itself was very well thought out by the filmmakers.Every character in the film has an interesting personality, role, or background that helps add plot and spice to the movie. Although the original 'Saw' was more mysterious and original than the sequel, 'Saw II' is still worth watching because it definitely gives you a new perspective outlook of the original.I must warn you though, the ending leaves you questioning and confused. I know it did to me. But taking some time into it helped me understand more of the film and appreciate it. So I'm not saying to not see 'Saw II'. Go see it! 'Saw' fans won't be disappointed because it's just like Jigsaw promised - ""Oh, yes.

"Nice, but somewhat disappointing if you've seen ""Saw"".","If you haven't seen the first ""Saw"", I think you'll enjoy this movie big time! It has a nice and somewhat more complicated story and also some interesting twists. Don't forget about the gore either. All in all an intelligent horror/thriller movie.However, if you did see the original ""Saw"", you might find the movie a bit more predictable (this does not include the end, for we're used to a nice and surprising ending). You might also see some similarities to the movie ""Cube"". I also find the acting in ""Saw 2"" slightly disappointing: having seen ""Saw 2"" right after I saw the first ""Saw"". Most characters have sort of a predefined role to play and they do just that from start to end (with minor exceptions). In ""Saw"", you really didn't know what to expect. This is different with ""Saw 2"". But I guess this is the case with sequels most of the time.As I already mentioned however, the ending is more than welcome and comes with some nice flashbacks. This makes up for the predictability of the rest of the movie. If you haven't seen the first ""Saw"", I really suggest you see that one first, being the better and more original of the two. After that, ""Saw 2"" will keep you interested. However, it won't leave you with the same WOW!!!! you'd have after seeing the original ""Saw"" for the first time.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I will not spoil the movie and go into this further.The original Saw was more intense and real. it sucked you in and didn't let go. this second one was almost a parody of the first- gratuitously gory, with a storyline lacking direction. the only cool thing about the second one is that you get to see who jigsaw really is.As far as the acting goes, the man who plays the detective and the boy who plays his son do a good job with their parts. i wish i could say the same for the other actors.Bottomline: don't waste your money on this Hollywood fodder, but do check out the ORIGINAL SAW!!!! YOU WON""T BE DISAPPOINTED! for this movie, a 5 is kind pranayama",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
AMAZING suspense/thriller/horror movie! some of the best twists EVER!,"When I first saw the preview for Saw 2 i was SO EXCITED because the first one was so captivating, suspenseful, and had some of the best twisted and unexpected turn of events in movies ever, i couldn't wait to see what would happen in the next one...then i got to wondering how a sequel could do justice to such an amazing film. i started wondering if it would even be worth seeing...and let me tell you it Definitely is! It's actually one of the few sequel's that is BETTER than the first. I think that the twist in this movie is even better than the one at the end of the first. I couldn't believe so much that happened, and the end was amazing! i definitely recommend this to anyone who likes suspense, horror, gore, and surprises...A MUST see!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A seemingly well-thought out sequel to one of the sleeper hits of 2004.,"I just got out of a screening of Saw II. Well, I didn't just get out of it, but you know what I mean. It's the 28th, meaning opening night. Considering the level of enjoyment I had when I first saw the original, I went into this movie with rather high expectations. I feel confident when I saw that they were met.The basic plot revolves around Detective Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg), a cop who tediously walks the line between light and dark. He has done whatever it takes to bring down the criminals he's gone after, even resorting to planting evidence and physically assaulting them for information to get the job done. When one of the informants he deals with is found dead by way of Jigsaw (Tobin Bell), he's convinced by Kerry (Dina Meyer, reprising her role from the original) to take on the case. They track Jigsaw down to an abandoned building where his latest 'test' is revealed: eight individuals are locked inside a house. The door is set to open in three hours, but due to a nerve toxin they're breathing in, they only have two hours to find one of the multiple syringes of antidote hidden throughout the house or they die. Among the test subjects are Detective Matthews' son Daniel (Erik Knudsen) and the familiar face of Amanda (Shawnee Smith, reprising her role from the original).The acting, in my opinion, was of a higher caliber than that of the original. Tobin Bell's voice sounded so perfect every time it was heard, and had that creepy Master of Ceremonies quality in it. He played the part of John/Jigsaw with the same enthusiasm that he seemed to have in the original. His philosophical rants, while not for everyone, do expand upon what we were told in the original, and explains his motives for putting on his tests.Donnie Wahlberg did a good job with what he was given. Though he wasn't quite able to portray him as a three dimensional character, he was able to show more than one side to him. He was more than just a cardboard cutout of a character, which is what this archetype of character tends to come off as. He's come a long way since his first role of note in ""The Sixth Sense"".Shawnee Smith did a fine job as well, considering most of her dialogue was exposition. She brought just the right level of fright and understanding of the situation to make it believable for me. The character turn she takes at the end makes sense, and didn't throw the character development from both movies out the window.And now, for the most important part of an analysis of this type of movie: the scare factor. Now I have been watching horror movies for as long as I can remember, and I am fully confident when I say that I have never been truly scared by one. While that still hasn't changed after watching Saw II, there were a few cringe-worthy moments. One at the very beginning (the first scene, in fact), and two at almost the very end (one of them being the second last scene). The various traps and devices used were creative. The death mask 'venus fly-trap' device in particular caught my eye.The false (twist) ending has been a cornerstone of both the original and the sequel. Unless you're paying attention, you may not completely understand the reasoning and explanation behind it, so keep your eyes peeled. The sequel also does a nice job of tying together with the original, and the final scene is a bit of a callback.All in all, a well executed movie. Although there are still some things that could be improved (I challenge anyone to name a movie that can't be, short of the classics) it certainly met my expectations, especially for a sequel.My rating: 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Logic? Who Needs Logic?,"Oh wait a minute. If I am supposed to get interested in a story, it's got to make sense, right? I don't mean nit-picking a sci-fi, alternate-universe kind of sense. That is rightly called 'fantasy' and so you can let that slide. I'm talking about things that supposedly could happen to you tomorrow. What makes a film 'work' is if what you are shown has the aura of plausibility, that it could happen to you tomorrow. If it doesn't, then the thrill is gone and instead you're left shaking your head and saying, 'well that's a load of garbage right there.' Unless you are one of those people who doesn't care if things don't make sense, and you somehow convince yourself that illogical rubbish is really gripping theater. LOL more power to you.Why I rated it a '5': ""Saw II"" follows the continuing adventures of the serial killer named ""Jigsaw."" As it's a sequel I'm going to assume anyone seeing this has already seen the original ""Saw"" and thus no real exposition is necessary here. Instead I will attempt to illustrate some of its major flaws and explain to those who want to give it a '10' that maybe they should reconsider. ""Saw II"" is one of those films that is very intense, and often moves at a breakneck pace so that you barely have time to process what you're seeing. But once you do take a breath and think back about it, some really annoying and nagging questions pop up. A lot of them actually. And you ask yourself ""hmm would I do that if I had the choice? Or would no one do the things shown here?"" And if your answers are ""yeah no one would do that"" guess what? The film sucks.So let's see...if there was a number tattooed to the back of your head, would you (A) cut off the back of your head to read the number? Would you really? Or would you ask another person to read the number?Similarly, in trying to obtain the numbers on other people's heads, would you (A) kill them? Or how about just asking for them to turn around briefly so you can read the tattoo?If someone is going to unlock a door, would you (A) run up to the door and look through the peephole as the other person is unlocking it? Or would you just sort of stand there and wait for the person to open it?If you are told a key is hidden in a massive pile of syringes, your best chance of finding the key is to..., uh, grab the nearest person to you and throw her into the pile and demand she find it in two minutes? Haha I could go on, you get the point.Besides these awful character decisions to ponder, there's more. How about figuring out how 6 people were all successfully kidnapped on the same night? No problems, no issues, no one avoided capture. All caught and brought to a certain location in a few hours. One or maybe two people managed to swing that nifty piece of business without any complications, interference, and no one noticing them dragging people to their car. That's pretty darn amazing. And isn't it a bit curious that the mastermind behind this setup just happens to know the smallest and intimate details of all of these random people? When he's not going for cancer treatment that is. Heck he even knows what a cop said to his son when they were out walking around the city. Heck he even knows the cop is dirty but it seems Internal Affairs didn't get the memo. This guy is awesome! (Or, maybe the plot is mind-numbingly far-fetched...) And I guess he's rich or something to have all of his time to devote to his 'games' and pay for the materials. Speaking of, he must also have a degree in mechanical engineering. It's just...so dumb. The more you think about it, the more stupid it gets.But the best is for last. Now just think for a minute. If you were the victim of a serial killer, but managed to survive your ordeal, wouldn't your first reaction be....'you know, that was great? I enjoyed being traumatized and almost losing my life, and I actually had to kill someone else to preserve mine, this is wonderful. I would like to do this for a career! Now I would like to target random strangers and torture them!"" Uh....what? In who's world does this make any sense? That's like saying a Jew who survived being tortured by the Nazis decides that he wants to now become a Nazi himself and torture Jews. Yeah that makes zero sense. Zero. And you know it.5/10 - Decent production values but the plot is as ridiculous as they come. Would I watch again (Y/N)? Definitely not. ""Saw III"" is even worse and I stopped there.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
