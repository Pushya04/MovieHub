Elf Will Be A New Christmas Classic!,"After seeing ""Elf"" last night (special preview screening) I am happy to say that I, as well as my children left the theater feeling full of Christmas cheer. I do believe that this movie will become a Christmas classic. I can see this movie being viewed by millions each year on TV just like ""A Christmas Story"", and ""It's a Wonderful Life"". Was the movie perfect? No. Will it win an Oscar? Of course not. Did it make me laugh, and feel good while looking forward to another Christmas this year. Without a doubt.7 out of 10 Stars.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Sweet and charming, salvaged by the cast","Elf isn't a perfect Christmas movie, but it was sweet and charming with a great cast. The script can be a little too fluffy and unfocused sometimes though, while the pace occasionally lags and some jokes such as Buddy eating the sweets felt forced. However, it does look terrific, with the locations striking and the cinematography very nice. The soundtrack is a nice addition too, it made me nostalgic and all the more ready for Christmas. The story while simple and a tad predictable is at least original and well-meaning, while the direction is credible. The cast is what gives Elf its staying power and charm. Although I am not a fan of Will Ferrell, I think he really shone here as Buddy, while Zooey Deschannel is beautiful and a huge part of the film's charm, James Caan is a suitably gruff father-like figure and Bob Newhart is wonderful. All in all, it is a sweet film if you forgive the slightly clich√© ending, by all means not for all but the cast do save the day. 7/10 Bethany Cox",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A star is born in this laugh-out-loud holiday comedy...,"Charming Christmas confection--about a boy raised by elves in the North Pole who grows up and journeys to N.Y.C. in search of his biological father--puts a clever spin on even the most familiar gags, successfully walking a fine line between absurdist comedy and holiday schmaltz. Will Ferrell looks like a string-bean in yellow tights and, with his mass of curly hair peeking out from underneath his elf's hat, he could easily be used as a walking punchline. Fortunately, director Jon Favreau's handling of ""Elf"" is incredibly nimble, treating Ferrell and his naive character Buddy with the utmost respect; you can laugh at all the silly pranks without ever feeling guilty. Favreau's work is smooth, and he's assembled an incredible supporting cast of character actors to back his star, though some may find the climactic moments (involving Edward Asner as Santa Claus) a bit too literal--and the movie is certainly funnier before we get to this point. Still, the special effects are kept to a minimum in order to let the people shine...and that's not only refreshing, it's heart-warming. *** from ****",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A really nice, funny movie for Christmas despite a little bit of the inevitable smaltz","Accidentally finding his way into Santa's bad once Christmas Eve, little baby orphan Buddy ends up in the north pole, where he is raised by the elves as one of their own.  As he gets ever bigger and less and less suited to the elf lifestyle he is told about his real father and decides to go to New York to find him.  However Buddy's natural smile and elfish enthusiasm doesn't really fit in with New York, not to mention a father who rejects him.When I first saw the trailer for this film I laughed slightly but I also thought that it could easily be just awful.  Despite this fear I decided to go and see it on the basis of seeing Ferrell in the Reloaded MTV spoof on the DVD and being very funny.  I was glad that I did as the film was refreshingly funny very enjoyable despite the weaknesses inherent in a seasonable film of this nature.  The jokes are a mix of adult and children - but not separately, the humour is of a nature families can all enjoy rather than being of a `one for me and one for the kids' type.The film does get a little sweet towards the end, but it manages to avoid this usual trap for the majority of the film and can't be expected to not be all Christmas cheer at some point!  The fish out of water stuff is pretty funny and Farrell makes his character funny without being annoying to the audience (as he feared he might be from the trailer).  Caan is good but has to work with the `scrooge' character of the film and thus gets fewer laughs. The support cast is good with fun turns from Newhart, Asner and Steenburger.It does get a little sickly sweet towards the end and the fish out of water jokes do wear a little thin towards the end but mostly it is very funny and refreshingly fun to watch.  The film is made better by a performance from Farrell that is perfectly pitched without being annoying and full of spark and wit.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
This will play on television every year for the rest of our lives,"This is a good natured holiday comedy that definitely is in the same realm as ""The Santa Clause"" and (Dare I say?) ""Miracle on 34th Street"". Story is about a human that has been raised by Santa's elves at the North Pole and as he gets older he figures out that he's very different from the other elves. Years earlier Santa (Ed Asner) was delivering at an orphanage and a human baby accidentally crawled into his sack and was taken back to the North Pole where he was raised by Papa Elf (Bob Newhart). He is called Buddy (Will Ferrell) and he grows to six foot three and one day he is told the truth about his situation and told by Santa who his real father is. Buddy travels to New York City to meet his father and he heads to the Empire State Building where he works. He finds his father Walter (James Caan) who runs a publishing business and works all the time much to the chagrin of his family. Walter is unable to get away from Buddy and after a blood test proves he is his son he takes him home with him to stay with his family. He meets Walter's wife Emily (Mary Steenburgen) and their son and Walter thinks Buddy is just someone reverting to his childhood after a shock. Buddy starts to work in a department store and he meets a woman named Jovie (Zooey Deschanel) and is smitten by her. Buddy tries to fit in with the others but finds it difficult although he becomes friends with Walter's son and starts dating Jovie.This film is directed by Jon Favreau who has made his mark as a director of low budget films like ""Made"" and also as a character actor but this is his first effort at directing a mainstream Hollywood movie. He does a commendable job and as I watched this film I kept having the feeling that he purposely made the most commercial film that he could. Favreau as an actor has mostly appeared in small roles. As a director his small films are lucky to play at art house theaters and I seriously doubt he's getting rich hosting ""Dinner For 5"" on the Independent Film Channel. It looks as though he wanted to make a crowd pleasing film that will ultimately be playing on some cable channel for the rest of our lives. I'm not knocking this decision at all, it's a smart move and he's become a major Hollywood player with the success of this film. Even the script was carefully written to insure that WHEN this plays on television there will be nothing to edit out. The closest thing to a bad word is uttered by Caan when he says ""Hell"" once towards the end of the film. This is a fun film that does have undeniable charm and its heart is definitely in the right place. It's sentimental and corny but thats part of the appeal. The script doesn't try to hard and the energy and flow of the film keeps at a constant pace, it doesn't try to go over the top which is refreshing. Ferrell is a natural performer and his dopey wide eyed expressions never grow old. This film must be doing something right because tough guy James Caan is believable as a caring husband and father. Very old fashioned story that never raises itself above lightweight status is nonetheless funny and charming. Like I said earlier, this film will be playing on television every year for the rest of our lives!",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Unexpected out of nowhere against all odds classic,"This was my 4th viewing and now ready to review.The story is insane. This film should not have worked. But almost as a tribute to the X-Mas miracles it tries to riff off, it is an astonishingly entertaining film.Behind the camera Favreau, Mr Money Shot, who has quietly without fanfare turned into one of the hottest directors in Hollywood history. In front of the camera Farell who I usually don't care for but may just give the performance of his career here. A script to die for. Probably the best use of Zoey D's looks in her career to date.Way under rated and unappreciated.As in my other reviews, most ""recent"" X-Mas films (since about 2000) are Canadian B-movies shot on a budget which would barely cover a reno on THIS OLD HOUSE What an unexpected treat See it",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Finally watched Elf...,"After 20 years of thinking it would probably be a silly waste of time and listening to the naysayers (like my husband) that it was stupid. So, if you are like me and haven't watched this, then put on your childlike wonder, forget that you are a grown-up and enjoy this very enjoyable and funny movie. Chill out and laugh out loud. Bob Newhart is hilarious as papa Elf and Ed Asner plays a marvelous Santa.Now I understand why Zooey Deschanel now has black hair, because in this movie she has blond hair and it does not suit her well.Give this movie a chance, don't wait 20 years to watch it like I did!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Must Watch During the Christmas Season,"Elf is a fun Christmas film that has a guy living as an elf then going to the ordinary human society. I feel like that led to good humor throughout and I find kinda interesting. For me, it's within my top 5 Christmas movies. I feel like Will Ferrell did a good job as Buddy. He really nailed the hyper personality. It's a role that I really tie to Ferrell, I can't see anyone else playing the role. Also this is the first role that comes to my mind when someone says Will Ferrell. This movie helps bring a more well defined definition of Christmas spirit. It's about being together and believing it. Seeing something may not be the same as believing something. You could take the quote from the Santa Clause and apply it here. ""Seeing isn't believing, believing is seeing!"" I feel like this is full of Christmas spirit and a must watch during the Christmas season.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"This is a wonderful, original and perfectly portrayed film.","This was one of my favorite movies in 2003. Will Ferrell is brilliant as the Elf. The supporting cast is great too, especially Bob Newhart as his elf ""dad"". The characters are well written and it is a refreshing film to get lost in. Will Ferrell plays the elf with such innocence, he is so funny! This is not just a Christmas film but when the DVD comes out I will be watching ""Elf"" in July. The story progresses nicely, there are many lessons to be learned as you watch this movie. It touched my heart in many ways. I highly recommend this movie for kids AND adults, you won't regret it.

"After so many years, I finally got to watch Elf and consider it quite a funny and partly touching movie","Confession time: Until just a couple of hours ago, I had never seen this now-classic Christmas comedy starring Will Ferrell in the title role. He's an actual human who as a baby was taken to the North Pole accidentally and was raised by elder elf Bob Newhart. After becoming the least prolific of workers at Santa's Workshop, he decides to go to New York to find his biological father who's played by James Caan. I'll stop there and just say this was quite funny and had also some touching scenes. Because this was a family film, there's no dirty language nor any adult situations. In summary, Elf is a wonderful comedy suitable for kids ""from 1 to 92""!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An Uplifiting and Cheerful Display of Raw Uninformed Innocence,"Will Ferrell does a great job here, and it's the perfect Christmas (Holiday) movie that can be enjoyed anytime of the year.The contrast of almost unbalanced folly of Will's character with those that encompass him, lends a great degree of innocence and non-stop joy and plenty of laughter as he leaves the mundane world of the usual, boring, and often time intolerance of the world in his dust.It's refreshing to see a story where others are encouraged to rise to the level of this main character instead of him being overwhelmed and dragged down by the majority of ""Cotten Headed Ninny Muggins"", a.k.a. the ""touch me not, speak to me not"" big city public psyche so familiar that many walk around with.For those that represent the general public in the movie, as well as the audience, Ferrell's character dares us to believe again, even for a moment of the magic of Christmas and tears down decades of political correctness to connect us with the late 60s and 70s when so many annual Holiday shows brought us a seemingly sustained desire to entertain ourselves with the magic that waxes then wanes but for a few short weeks each year. Whether a work of animation or raw theater, this refreshing story brings vitality and rekindles childhood memories for the kid in all of us.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I watched Elf because it was hailed as the best Christmas movie of all times, I don't agree with that at all. It did have some cute elements that would have made an enjoyable film, but the annoying antics of Ferrel didn't work for me.

An instant holiday classic: Ferrell's crowning achievement to date!,"ELF (2003) *** 1/2 Will Ferrell, James Caan, Mary Steenburgen, Edward Asner, Bob Newhart, Zooey Daschanel, Daniel Tay, Amy Sedaris, Faizon Love, Andy Richter, Kyle Gass, Michael Lerner, Artie Lange, Peter Billingsley, Peter Dinklage, Claire Lautier, Jon Favreau. Ferrell gives an inspired lunacy turn as a man who was raised by elves at The North Pole and discovers to his dismay he's actually human sparking his quest to be re-united with his long-lost father (Caan in an inspired bit of casting), a 'naughty-list' occupant, who works as a children's book publisher in New York City, just in time for Christmas. Hysterically funny thanks to the goofy yet sweet and wonderful turn by Ferrell (no one else could pull off the razor's edge of looking like an idiot yet retaining the innocent glee of a child and bares a striking resemblance to Tom Hanks' turn in 'BIG') with a great cast especially the beguilingly pretty Daschanel as his fellow Santa's Little Helper at Gimbels'who he falls in love with. Directed with style and witty warmth by Favreau (who has a cameo) and written by newcomer David Berenbaum with a smart, fun script that caters to all ages with a nostalgic nod to classic animated holiday specials for good measure. An instant holiday classic. Trivia note: Billingsley, best known as Ralphie from the yuletide cinematic classic, plays 'A CHRISTMAS STORY' the elf foreman!",,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Christmas classic for the right reasons,"It's hard to believe that I haven't seen ""Elf"" in the last twenty years but I figured that I'd fix that before the sequel is released. Which of course will never happen because the three stars (Will Ferrell, James Caan and director Jon Favreau) didn't hit it off.Which is a shame because this is a funny, well constructed story with its heart in the right place. Ferrell plays the role of Buddy the Elf and this is someone who embodies elf-life to a tee. He eats nothing but candy, thinks nothing of singing badly in front of strangers and just wants to spread happiness throughout the world.I know that it sounds cheesy but Ferrell pulls it off by being 100% committed to Buddy. He really is an innocent abroad in New York City. Caan plays his unsuspecting father (someone who's definitely on the naughty list) and his lack of reaction to Buddy's antics also plays well. The contrast between the two could not be starker.However the film is Favreau's baby and he really nailed it with this one. It's a feel-good film but it's not over the top. There are special effects but many of them were achieved in-camera and so don't look dated. Ferrell is allowed to be appropriately wacky but the film never makes fun of him.Instead it's a simple tale about a simple man/elf with a simple wish. You'd have to have a heart of stone not to grant his one true desire at such a festive time.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Classic Christmas spirit.,"This is the kind of Christmas movie you should be watching every 25th of December apart from your usuals. It's a wonderful story, with a strong Will Ferrell, playing an innocent, child-like, distracted elf who has no idea how the real world functions, as he is on the quest to search for his real family. He is willing to spread the Christmas spirit on a city which apparently hasn't got the spark in its eyes, so there is a hard task on his hands.The rest of the cast is wonderfully completed by Zooey Deschanel, James Caan, Mary Steenburgen, Daniel Tay, with Peter Dinklage and Bob Newhart in small roles. Ferrell definitely steals the movie; and his troubled relationship with his father (Caan) provides some funny and touching moments as well. Jon Favreau did quite a good job from the director's chair, turning this seemingly childish film into a marvelous choice for your Christmas movies of every year. Some even regard it as a classic, but well, I will let you be the judge of that.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Great, Clean Christmas movie!","It was so nice to be able to sit down and watch a movie featuring an SNL actor without having to mute or fast forward any crude parts. Granted, this may not be Will Farrell's most amazing performance, but if you want a new Christmas movie to watch this season, I highly recommend Elf. I talked to a few people who thought the movie was stupid, but that was because they were expecting Will Farrell's character to be a duplicate of his SNL performances. So, to fully enjoy this movie, watch it without any expectations and remember that it's okay to have a childlike sense of humor--nobody's too cool for a great Christmas movie. I love most all the movies from Adam Sandler, Rob Schneider, Will Farrell, Jim Carrey, Chris Farley, Chevy Chase, and David Spade, but most of them aren't appropriate for viewers of all ages. Elf is a movie you can throw in the VCR and not have to worry about what the kids hear or see on it.

"Funny, but lacking","The film is something quite intriguing with a very unique plotline; from the beginning it looks to be very promising and, is, in fact, promising. However, it misses a certain something that becomes more apparent throughout the film: after a while the pure immaturity of the Elf slowly begins to wear away on you until the film loses all of the original appeal that it had.Nonetheless, the film has some delightfully entertaining and hilarious portions, though overall it leaves much to be desired. The ending drags out painfully and becomes torturingly corny, nothing that is unpredictable about it.In spite of the ups and downs that one has when watching the film, it can still be called a decent film. There was some very good exercise of comedy and admittedly it is superior to many of the films that have come out, but if you were hoping for anything more than just a slightly entertaining film, you will be disappointed. Aside from the minimal comedy to keep you interested nothing more is offered by the story.The movie should make you laugh, and the movie is worth seeing, but again, it is far less than the Christmas classic that people are claiming.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Wonderful Christmas Movie! Absolutely Worth Seeing!,"Elf (2003)I sure wish they would have released this movie in December, it would have given it an even Christmas-ier spirit to it all.

Nice Family Christmas film,"Buddy (Will Ferrell) is a human brought up in the world of Elves at Santa's grotto in the North Pole by Papa Elf (Bob Newhart). When he finally realises he doesn't seem to fit in, he asks Papa Elf and learns that his dad (James Caan) lives in New York and he's on Santa's naughty list. So off he goes on a quest to find him.Elf is charming and funny throughout and Buddy's naivety in the big apple is an over-used premise that works with charm. He also meets a department store Elf (Zooey Deschanel) bringing a little romance to the tale.OK its full of clich√©s and the basic plot has been done to death, but the film is still a winner that cannot fail to entertain on some level.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Reminds you that it's no fun being cynical,"At first glance, Elf would appear to be one of countless holiday- season cash-ins with daft costumes and even sillier special effects, featuring a well-known actor performing pantomime on a bigger budget and grabbing an easy pay-day in the process. That is stars Will Ferrell, one of cinema's most naturally hilarious funnymen who seems to be caught up in an endless loop of mediocrity - Blades of Glory and Stranger than Fiction excluded - as the titular human-turned- elf, bodes even worse. Throw in some little people dressed in elf costumes and a romance involving surely the only woman to accept a date with a man who claims to be from the North Pole, and it would seem like a movie tailor-made for a critical beat-down.Only Elf is genuinely charming, and even more alarmingly, incredibly funny at times. Using Ferrell's man-child comedy chops to the fullest extent, this may actually be the best work Ferrell has ever done. He plays Buddy, an orphan accidentally whisked off to Santa's homeland as a baby. Taken in by the sympathetic Papa Elf (the wonderful Bob Newhart), it doesn't take long until Buddy is towering over his adoptive father and his co-workers. Learning of his biological pop Walter (played by James Caan) and that he is in fact a human, the 6-foot elf journeys to New York City to be with his real family, only for his miserable publisher dad to shun him. Buddy learns that his world no longer buys into tales of flying reindeers and a jolly fat man who knows if we've been bad, disbelieving in the 'magic' of Christmas and draining the power from Santa's sleigh in the process.Directed by Jon Favreau and written by David Berenbaum, Elf is pretty standard stuff story-wise, and is hampered by a predictable sub-plot involving Walter's struggling publishing company and his dire need to lighten up. Yet there are many touching moments, particularly in the scenes involving Buddy and his young half- brother, and the former's awkward courting of a pretty toy store assistant (Zooey Deschanel) initially freaked out by his maniacal claims but who eventually succumbs to his hyperactive charms. It all inevitably leads to a climax built around a special-effect laden set-piece as Santa struggles to deliver the presents with a dying sleigh, but this is expected from a movie designed to win over those looking for something easy-going and festive. The world has grown cynical, and perhaps so have I, but Elf reminded me that it is no fun being so.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Very Very Funny Movie!,"The most helpful thing I can tell you about this movie is that if you've got even a smidgen of a youthful spirit about you, then this movie will make you laugh until you cry....over and over.

It's An Enjoyable Christmas Fantasy,"I'm not the biggest fan of Will Ferrell, but in casting ""Elf"" someone had a brainstorm, because I have to admit that Ferrell was absolutely perfect in this role. He plays ""Buddy the Elf,"" a human baby in an orphanage who accidentally hitches a ride in Santa's toy bag one Christmas Eve and finds himself at the North Pole, adopted by ""Papa Elf"" (Bob Newhart) who raises him as an elf. Of course, it isn't a good ""fit,"" so to speak. As a human, Buddy is a lot bigger than your average elf and, finally realizing he's human, he sets out for New York City (with no knowledge of the world outside the North Pole) and sets out to find his father, who he's been told is Walter Hobbs (James Caan) - a big publishing executive working at the Empire State Building. Essentially, the story is about Buddy trying to fit into life in the real world, and to be honest, it's really quite enjoyable and sometimes even quite funny.The cast all do quite well with their parts, although I thought that we didn't really need a love angle for Buddy, represented by Jovie (Zooey Deschanel) - who's adorably cute, but I'm not sure she was essential to the story. Every movie of this type, of course, needs a scrooge-type character to be reformed and filled with the Christmas spirit. Here, that was supposed to be Walter, but I honestly didn't find Walter to be scrooge-like enough. He seemed to be a basically nice guy who was himself just being overworked by an overbearing boss (in a limited role played by Michael Lerner.) I didn't get the jarring ""turnaround"" in Walter's attitude that you often get from this. He seemed to accept Buddy too easily - with a bit of encouragement from his wife (Mary Steenburgen.) Still, while some of the characters didn't hit home as powerfully as they could have, the performances were good and they added up to a fun story.It was nice to see Ed Asner play a fairly important role as Santa in this, and the movie even managed to pay just a wee bit of homage to the TV special Rudolf the Red-Nosed Reindeer, as Leon the Snowman who slid around at the North Pole looked basically like the sliding snowman who slid around and narrated Rudolf (although the narration for this movie, when necessary, was done by Papa Elf.) The animals in the woods at the North Pole also reminded me of the animals in Rudolf.It's a cute story, good fun for the family in the Christmas season. (7/10)",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A nice Christmas movie,"A nice Christmas-themed movie. Nice is very apt for this title, as I experienced it never really either shone or sucked. Just nice. A few scenes that made me laugh audibly, and a lot of scenes that made me smile.I didn't really give me anything new, the plot was very predictable and kind of tame. It was nice to see Will Ferrell in a role where his character didn't have these ridiculous scenes where he overplays to make it hilarious and just misses the spot. The funnier scenes were well played out by Will and fit the character of Buddy the Elf.Sounds like my impressions of the film doesn't coincide with my rating of it, but it was a perfectly fine Christmassy flick that left me with a smile. I might just watch it again next winter.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A tonic for your Elf?,"As a baby, Buddy {Will Ferrell} crept out of his crib in the orphanage right into Santa's goody bag. Thus he grows up at the North Pole working with the elves in Santa's work shop. Now firmly grown up physically, Buddy is shocked to learn that he is a human being, not an elf. So upon hearing that his father lives in New York, he sets off to find him. But can he survive New York? More to the point, can New York survive Buddy?Like him or loathe him, Will Ferrell has a nice line in physical comedy. So with that, Elf is the perfect vehicle to showcase his exuberance. But with that also comes the problem with the film. For it feels {actually it is} like director John Favreau and writer David Berenbaum have plopped Ferrell into a fish out of water scenario and stitched together a number of sketches for him to run thru. The outcome of which may induce some amiable comedy along the way, but renders the finale a weak attempt at holiday message emotion. The supporting cast also suffer in the wake of Ferrell's domination. Something that annoys when you consider we have the likes of James Caan and Mary Steenburgen trying to breathe on the sidelines.There's enough here to make it a safe holiday viewing for the kids and those adults who have a penchant for Ferrell's comedy. But really it's a patchwork quilt of a picture, with the makers playing it all too by the numbers just to sell tickets. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Modern Christmas fairy tale has some good laughs,"This film has a very good cast with some big names of the time and past in entertainment. ""Elf"" is a modern Christmas fairy tale that scores well just for its comedy. Somewhere amid the crazy antics and situations there is a Christmas message or two. But this film is something to enjoy just for the laughs. Most of the humor comes from an overgrown elf trying to adapt and learn how to live in an adult world. Along the way, he spreads some Christmas joy.Will Ferrell is Buddy ‚Äì an overgrown elf by mistake, whose doings resemble the Marx Brothers, the Three Stooges, and Merwin's magic. It's hard to imagine anyone else giving the performance Ferrell gives here. The role seems written for him. Bob Newhart is Papa Elf. I don't know any other comedian who could get people to laugh so much with a straight face. He applies his trademark as well in ""Elf."" Edward Asner is Santa Claus, and James Caan is Buddy's real father, Walter. A host of younger actors do very well in their supporting roles.This is a fun movie that most should enjoy for the silliness and laughter.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Wonderful holiday spirit film - Never gets old,"I was lucky enough to see in the theater today which was so much fun! Will Ferrell is endlessly entertaining in just about anything.

Numerous funny parts and several heartwarming bits makes for a lovely gem that I'll always appreciate.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Saccharine and Sickly Sweet but Well Done,"I feel torn. On one hand, this was an extremely well-done movie. Very entertaining. Funny. Cute. Captured all of the elements one might require in a Christmas movie.On the other hand, I felt it was a little too cloying and saccharine. There were some very entertaining moments and good scenes, but it's obvious this movie was made for the whole family (which is fine) and, in the end, it didn't feel like a great movie. It felt like a good movie. You have to be ready to stomach the shmaltz, mind you (and there is a lot).I'm torn between rating it 6 or 7. Why? Because on one hand, the shmaltzy elements alienated me a bit from the film but on the other hand, the movie has heart and is essentially a feel-good Christmas movie with all the fixins. And, I don't want to come across like a Scrooge.It was well-filmed. Zooey looked beautiful. It was funny in a broad sort of way. James Caan isn't as badass or mean as you originally think, and in the end, he seems rather likable.My complaint is that the movie could have more edge. Maybe it's because I spent the last few days watching really good thrillers, but I felt like this movie could have had a darker dark side. For me, it would have enriched the experience.As it stands now, it's sweet, fun, harmless and stands alone as a rather storybook Christmas fairytale that can appeal to a huge demographic. But heed this warning: There are a large share of Christmas songs, and several shmaltzy moments.Add this to your Christmas movie list. It's worth it. It ain't the best, but it's a well put together little tale with enough funny moments to make the experience worthwhile.And a heckuva lot of Christmas spirit. Cheesy and cloying at times, but still... it's there. Enjoy it.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Enjoyable fluff...very enjoyable fluff!,"""Elf"" is a pretty cute film--but they're starting to overplay it a bit. Just this Christmas season, it's been on TV 1483857 times (give or take 2). And I worry that being shown so much that folks might have a backlash--might start to hate the film even though it's decent family entertainment and is worth your time.Will Ferrell stars as 'Buddy'--a STRANGE young man indeed. Apparently, as a baby he was accidentally kidnapped and brought back to the North Pole by Santa. Not knowing what to do with the boy so he gave him to an elf (Bob Newhart) to raise as his own. However, he's a terrible elf. Part of it that he's absolutely too big to live as an elf--and part of it is that he's a bit...well....stupid. Eventually, after not fitting in for a very long time, the elves inform Buddy that they now know who his read father is and Buddy leaves the Pole for New York City to find his dad. Once there, Buddy once again does NOT fit in--and makes a mess of most everything. Can Buddy sort all this out and connect with his dad or will the audience leave the theater feeling depressed and miserable (yeah, right!).The film has many funny moments (my favorite was when he exposed FAKE Santa to the kids waiting to see him), a few sweet ones and some very clich√©d ones--but I can forgive this, as it IS a family comedy and I am not expecting Shakespeare! Well worth seeing....and a bit odd seeing Ed Asner playing Santa!",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Yeah it's sappy, but it is a Christmas comedy...","This is one on my Must Watch at Christmas list. It just fun, and we still watch it every year. The movie is sappy, but that is the point, most Christmas movies are.Will Ferrel is great in this and is perfect. And I know I will get some flack for this, but I am glad it never got a sequel, it is one of those that shouldn't. Will did everyone a favor by turning down the role for the sequel.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great for the holiday season but a bit silly,I watched this last night as it was on TV and there was nothing on at all last night so I said since we are reaching the holidays I might as well watch it. The movie is similar to Enchanted in a way(minus the animation)and it tells the story of a man who is raised by Santa's elf's and he goes to NYC to find his biological father who is a writer apparently . Buddy(Ferrell) then meets a girl named Jovie(Zooey Deshnail who is a dead ringer to Katy Perry)and becomes smitten with her.I may not be a fan of Will Ferrell but I laughed at a few parts to this movie like the part where he is singing the Baby its cold outside song from Tom Jones and the part where he humiliates his father at work by some guy who he called an elf too LOL that was hilarious.The movie is a bit stupid but I like fish out of water movies as I like how the characters interact with our world and that. I liked some parts to it but the ending was quite dumb. So I am giving it a 6 simply because its nearly Xmas and I like to get into the Holiday season.,6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One of the most annoying films I've ever seen,"Let me first off say that I don't like Will Ferrell. He's been in good movies but always playing the same character. This is definitely in his top 3 most annoying characters, all Buddy does in this film is scream and mope around. He's not like able at all. Every other character is forgettable, cookie cutter, and two dimensional. Everything about this film looks either fake or cheap, to me that sort of thing worked for the scenes in the North Pole but everything else just felt fake. And the scenes that didn't were over-exposed and bland in their cinematography. On a critical level this film is boring, unoriginal, and annoying. But I also base how much I like a film based off of my enjoyment. And this movie wasn't terrible to watch the first time, but when I was forced to four more times, my enjoyment was at zero. Plus, I just don't like Will Ferrell, I know people do, and he's good in films like Anchorman, and some of his stuff on SNL is funny. But here it's about as annoying as some of the modern SNL skits. There's no harm in watching the movie for the first or second time. But I would not recommend anyone watching this anymore than two. Go watch Home Alone, A Christmas Story, or A Charlie Brown Christmas instead, they have much more rewatch value.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Rewatched it for the first time in years!!,"I gotta say, while a lot of stuff is quite over the top and a little too silly in the film, a lot of stuff still makes it work as a feel-good comedy and as an adult, I appreciate it a lot more than I did when I was a kid. I like some other Christmas movies better but this one is definitely a good one for the humor alone! Will Ferrell does great as this main character and was a good casting choice. The film even sends a good message toward the end about what love is and how important it is to have enough Christmas spirit! This is the kind of movie fun that is meant for the whole family to enjoy!",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Will Ferrell Creates Iconic Christmas Character,"Like most people around the holidays, I'm usually up for a watching (or re-watching) of the great holiday classics (""Wonderful Life"", ""Home Alone"", etc.). For whatever reason, however, it took me until 2016 to actually sit down and watch ""Elf"" all the way through. While maybe not jumping up to the top of my ""all-time Christmas list"", I did find Elf to be an enjoyable romp.For a basic plot summary, this movie tells the story of Buddy (Ferrell), a human boy raised in the North Pole due to a mix-up with Santa Claus (Ed Asner). For most of his life, Buddy believes he is an actual elf, until realizing his shortcomings in that community. As such, he decides to strike out for the ""human world"" in order to find his real father (James Caan). Along the way, Buddy (as a result of his endearing cheerfulness) brings a bit of Christmas spirit to all those around him that are in dire need of it, including a young retail worker named Jovie (Zooey Deschanel).To me, ""Elf"" is primarily a success because of the iconic character that Ferrell creates. The script/plot itself is about as irrelevant and corny as they come, but Ferrell's quirky energy steals every single scene. Quotes like ""You sit on a throne of lies"", ""Bye buddy, hope you find your Dad!"", and ""Buddy the Elf, what's your favorite color?"" will forever be burned into my memory! I don't think there is an actor out there who could have played Buddy as perfectly as Ferrell.Simply put, I'm glad I finally sat down and watched ""Elf"" from beginning to end. I don't know if it will get watched religiously every Christmas in my home (time will tell on that one...but maybe it will grow on me even more!), but I can tell you that I will be quoting it going forward!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Great Family and Holiday Film,This film is about a man (Farrel) who had just learned that he was born human! He never knew that he was human and he imagined that he was an elf the whole time! Now he needs to search for his biological father instead of his elf father. He finds him but his father won't believe it. They take a DNA test and you know what? He is his father! I must say this film entertained me a lot! It' actually really funny and I wasn't expecting from it that much. This film made me cry from its sweet moments. This is also a great film for the family looking for a great Christmas movie to watch. The adults won't get bored and the kids will have the time of their lives! The special effects are great to see. I highly recommend anyone who hasn't seen this movie to see it!,7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Brilliant,"I love this film so much and it is hilarious. Although, I do feel like buddy could come across as more stupid as he doesn't really know how to act civilised.

Will Powered,"I'm starting to think that there are dumb comedies and smart comedies. The ""dumb"" ones typically I cannot stand and usually fall into the banal (Farelly brothers) or ride one joke to exasperation (""Romy and Michelle's high School Reunion"")This is a pretty good dumb comedy. One that thankfully gets by on a single belch, a little ""tasteful"" vomit and a urine joke that spears asparagus. Instead it relies more on us liking and maybe even identifying with an ""idiot"" who is more childlike than clueless.The more Will, the more power it has...especially when we get detours from the required plot landmark visits. Scenes like... -   Will running around New York city waving at a guy hailing a taxi, swapping pamphlets, etc... -   Will hitting the ""maple"" in the mail room...making a best friend -   Will getting a DNA check at the doctor's (director Favreau)That last section may have been the funniest to me, as it felt the most free... I suspect some of that was just plain improvised based upon the props on the set??Overall of course 99% of this was scripted, but whenever a film can at least feel like the comic is just riffing, that is a key for me. (And I think it is where Eddie Murphy's career evaporated...)Certainly this film is well planned out, but to its credit (and largely to Ferrell) it does have a looseness. If you enjoyed Ferrell on SNL, you should likely be able to find humor in this. Or if you like tromp l'oiel this has some nice bits... Some of the other grandiose reviews on this (lauding Asner, for what exactly?) might unjustly inflate expectations. Product placement was a little heavy here, I wish they'd skipped that and just not spent the money on the CGI sleigh ride from the four horsemen/orcs of the central park rangers. The ending of the film suffers as many comedies do, it's the time when everyone has to pass their papers to the front.Favreau is a sharp and gracious fan of film (from his IFC show) and Ferrell is funny as a stand-up sort of everymoron. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Classic- one of the best Christmas movies ever!,"How this movie is ""only"" rated 6.9 is a mystery to me. Everybody I know young and old, who has ever seen it fell in love with it. For me personally, Elf is up there with Miracle on 34th Street and It's A Wonderful Life- not just a great Christmas movie but one of the eat family movies you'll ever see. Will Ferrell is hot and cold when it comes to his film work. I've enjoyed maybe half of his movies, but the other half are unfunny duds. (Bewitched, Kicking and Screaming, and Semi-Pro come to mind.). Elf is probably his very best work ever- and also just happens to be his most innocent, childlike character. The supporting cast is wonderful, too. James Caan is a great, grumpy comic foil, and Bob Newhart is perfect, as always.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Of course Jon Favreau directed this,"It has Jon Favreau all over it. And that other guy, the one in every scene. And thank god for that because that Will Ferrell is so funny he can BE in every scene and you still want more. This movie is sweet. It's funny as hell without hurting anyone. It's gentle humor so perfect for an xmas tale. In this one a human man who has been raised as one of Santa's elves is told the truth by his tiny elven ""father"". This makes the chance for hilarious sight gags of Will Ferrell being too big for his life. When he finds out his actual father is a human in NYC (and on the naughty list) he sets off to find him. Will Ferrell's elf is a character so full of love that he can push his way in and be happily received, even if not right away.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Short Review: The stupidest movie I've ever seen.,"Elf is supposed to be a comedy, but it's more along the lines of travesty. We're supposed to laugh every time Will Ferrel's character Buddy does something boneheaded, but I found myself cringing and moaning almost every time he showed up on screen. Relentless stupidity and disgusting sight gags are supposed to pass for humour here, and it seems to be the only trick Elf has up its sleeve. For example, in one scene Buddy chugs a bottle of Coke down and starts to burp continuously for 12 seconds. In another, he licks bird excrement off of a rail. Ugh.This buffoonery continues for 97 minutes, and it never gets any less painful. I could comment on the acting, but I don't know what to say. The actors all do a perfect job of being unbearable. The camera-work and sound are both fine as well. In fact, the cinematography is the high point of the film. However, when the best thing about a movie is the camera angle, you know it stinks. Little kids will love it, though.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Beyond Dumb,"Save yourself from this train wreck of a film. Although touted as a comedy not one laugh was heard from the audience I saw the movie with...not even a chuckle!

Solidly Good,"Elf has sort of went off the map in recent years. It's been a while since I watched it, and I wasn't sure if it was going to hold up. I like Will Ferrell a lot, so I have it a try.

He discovered his real father lives in New York, and sets out to find him. There, he meets his father, and falls in love with another human.This is some good stuff. There were plenty of laugh out loud scenes. I couldn't even say it had any boring parts. The beginning was a little slow though. It was some solid good fun. I guess everyone else in the cast was secondary to Ferrell, but they all did well. When I thought the collaboration between the elf and his business minded father would suffice the entire story, suddenly new subplots arose that were even more satisfying.Great movie.

"Big Elf, Big Laughs","This movie has some big, big laughs it. It's clever and very well done.

Ferrell is a strong comic force and he is hilarious in the movie - he gives 100% and it pays off. Great to see comic legend Bob Newhart on the big screen and the visuals of Ferrell crushing Newhart's lap is priceless. Now, it is not a perfect movie of course - yes, near the end it kind of runs in place and spins it's wheels and Caan's complete character turnaround is fake - he changes just because it is time to change cuz the mvie needs to wind down.

I guess I was undecided about Will Ferrell, I thought I liked him, but this movie finally tipped me over to the 'I hate him' category. He's just not funny! He's shouty and creepy; as the titular elf, his man-child schtick is getting really annoying.

Elf,"Whilst delivering toys to an orphanage, a curious baby crawls into Santa's sack. Back at the North Pole shortly after, this young lad makes his presence felt, is named ""Buddy"" and put in the care of ""Papa Elf"" (Bob Newhart). Years later, ""Buddy"" (Will Ferrell) has now grown to full height and isn't really fitting in - on any level. His adopted dad tells him something of his real parents and off to New Work he goes in search of his father ""Walter"" (James Caan) who had, hitherto, been completely unaware of this son's existence. Hard-nosed ""Walter"" is initially disinterested, but thanks to a photograph from years gone by, quickly decides to try and help his green-suited offspring to try and make his way in the world. ""Buddy"" isn't very good at much, but what he excels at is making friends and spreading good cheer - and all of that proves crucial when Santa (Ed Asner) finds his sleigh won't work on Christmas Eve for lack of Christmas spirit. Can ""Buddy"" rally the troops - and avoid the menacing Central Park Rangers? This is a jolly and fun Christmas feel-good film that has weathered the last twenty years rather well. The sentiment is well layered, the humour works for all ages and Caan compliments the sometimes cringe-making effusiveness of ""Buddy"" - aided by sparing but kindly appearances from Mary Steenburgen - well. There is even an hint of a romance for our good-natured soul in the form of ""Jovie"" (Zooey Deschanel) and as Christmas movies go, this is certainly one of the better ones.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Enjoyable but Unremarkable Movie,"14 November 2003.

Will Ferrell does it again.,"Jon Favreau has directed a cute and quirky Christmas movie that will leave both children and parents satisfied. A script that could have easily been thought of as too dark and absurd (the absurd moments in the film are one of its many strengths) is pulled together by a man who continues to amaze me in every film he's in: Will Ferrell. Will Ferrell brings an edge of naivete to the character that is so charming and hilarious it makes it incredibly easy to sit through a film about Santa's attempt to regain the Christmas spirit. In the movie Ferrell plays Buddy, a human who grows up to believe that he is actually and overgrown Christmas Elf and eventually finds out that he is adopted.  Buddy sets out on a journey to the wonderful land of New York City to meet his biological father played by James Caan. Injected with many weird and quirky moments (including a cast of claymation animals a la ""Rudolf The Red-Nosed Reindeer"" and a group of villains ominously know as ""The Central Park Rangers"") everyone puts in a good amount of charisma. Zooey Deschanel is quite memorable as the love interest with the sultry singing voice and Edward Asner is pitch perfect as a realistically jolly Santa Claus (Faison Love also puts in good performance as the Gimbel's Department store manager). Not a classic by any stretch of the mind Buddy is a great film to take the kids to see. Though I saw this film in a test screening in October I definitely felt the Holiday spirit. Yes, the movie has its syrupy sweet ""Good Lord this is corny!"" moments, but the off the wall bits of comedy balance the storyline out as a whole.Favreau and Ferrell are fully aware of what moments are sterotyped genre dreck and seem to ham it up.Buddy is worth seeing for Ferrell's performance alone, mixed with both Favreau's sense of humor and direction its stands out amongst the sea of the standard Disneyfied X-mas tales.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A steaming pile of , well you know ....",I didn't laugh one time. Not once. I thought Will Ferrel was kind of funny on SNL But he isn't funny in movies. I wasn't surprised Ed Asner would be in something of such low quality but I was kind of surprised James Caan would. Caan should know better. It tries to be funny but falls flat. It tries to be heart warming but the try is faint and fails. The love element is all but embarrassing for the lady in the movie and unbelievable for the audience. Movies like this aren't supposed to great art but they are supposed to be entertaining on at least a child like level but Elf just can't even manage that. Don't waste the time with this dud.,1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Rudolph on 34th Street,"This is a truly funny tribute to MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET and RUDOLPH THE RED-NOSED REINDEER. The references to RUDOLPH are very clear, but if you haven't seen that one, you'll still find this a funny movie. If you remember the seventies, you'll feel a certain nostalgia, what with the presence of Ed Asner, Bob Newhart and, as the voice of a Burl Ives snowman counterpart, Leon Redbone. (The snowman even looks like Leon Redbone, just as RUDOLPH's snowman resembles Burl Ives.) James Caan shows an ability with pathos and Will Ferrell has a silent movie comedian's ability to appear simultaneously naive and knowing. I also like the fact that the department store in this is the now-defunct Gimbel's. I understand this was the case because Macy's wanted script changes. It works as a New York movie, too.

"A film that is funny, enjoyable, and for the whole family","Elf is another family film featuring Will Ferrell. Ferrell is Buddy, an elf raised by Santa's elves in the North Pole. Buddy lives with the elves thinking he is one of them until Papa Elf decides that he is old enough to know the truth. Buddy, after learning that his mother had died and his father did not know that he was alive, sets out for New York City to find his father.Buddy's father is played by the legendary James Caan and he is perfect for his role. Buddy finds that his father, Walter, is not as jolly as he had hoped. In fact the man has made the naughty list from Santa. Family is second to Walter and Buddy is third. Buddy's innocence and carefree view towards life is the only way to loosen up Walter and let the family have its first enjoyable Christmas.Will Ferrell goes along way from his adult comedy in Anchorman to a family film. He is carefree and at a few times you may thinks he's a complete idiot. But his jolliness defines how Christmas should be to family, a togetherness and unity during the holiday times. James Caan brings the same tough guy role to his father role, being the big man in a different way. He doesn't see the importance of family as much as money. His acting is fair with some great transitions around Ferrell, the scene when he convinces Buddy to go work in the basement with the criminals maybe his best acting in the film.As for the story. It's your typical fish-out-of-water story with a happy ending that is always expected. The scenes in North Pole are fantastic, putting the sort of magic behind the time of Christmas. THis film is going to be one Christmas movie to remember. It brings out a sense of importance of family, unity, and brings back what it is like to be a kid.Elf.

A Modern Holiday Classic,"When it comes to holiday films, there are few as well renowned and adored as Elf. Telling an whimsical tale of a misplaced orphan reuniting with family, the story gives such charm and emotion to masterfully capture the spirit of Christmas. Though this could have been written off as another run-of-the-mill comedy, director Jon Favreau passionately crafted a new age holiday classic, to be rewatched year after year. Portraying Buddy the Elf, Will Farrell gives one of his most memorable performances, balancing his childlike attitude with an infectious holiday spirit. Elf achieves more than most holiday films, as it focuses on its characters and story and then uses the holiday to accentuate the experience. If you haven't seen it, your holiday season is missing out greatly and if you have seen it, than I'm sure you'll be watching it again shortly.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Not a bad Christmas comedy at all, though nothing great","Jon Favreu and Will Ferrel as a director/star combo is a good premise and execution here in Elf, as they create a film that assuredly works for the whole family.  This is because the film is as much directed towards fans of Ferrel from Saturday Night Live (which ranges with both sexes from little kids to people in their middle ages) as it is towards those looking for the holiday spirit.  Bottom line is, he makes the movie fun to watch, among a cast of well knowns (the likes of Bob Newhart, Ed Asner, Mary Steenburgen, Artie Lange, and Andy Richter pop up, and James Caan has a better than average supporting role).  Here, Ferrel plays Buddy, a man who's grown up adopted in the North Pole.  Raised by Elves, it pains him to find out that he isn't one, and that his father didn't even make Santa's 'Nice' list this year.  He decides to seek him out in New York, and has a brief stint working in a department store, followed by the mailroom of his father's office in the Empire state building.From what I described of the plot it sounds a little routine, and it is, but there are some things in the story that are inspired, though most of the joy in the film comes from Ferrel's Buddy.  Some might take his performance as over the top or lame, however I think he finds just the right bit of gleeful un-awareness at what he does, good and not so good, and there are a few real howlers too.  Best scene- Buddy confronts the department store Santa in front of the children (this is a near draw with the scene in the recent Bad Santa where Billy Bob beats down the plastic reindeer in the store).  Only the last part of the film, the Christmas Night bit, doesn't work at all.  A nice little Christmas comedy, which can be seen after the Holidays too. B+",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Jon Favreau has created a family-friendly timeless Christmas classic with Elf!,"After rewatching this movie with my Mum last week on Friday night for its 20th anniversary on Netflix here's my spoiler-free review of Elf! As usual, I'll be talking about my thoughts, my favourite moments & childhood memories of watching it and my conclusion/rating! This was released before Zathura: A Space Adventure, before Iron Man & before The Mandalorian which Jon Favreau would later work on those projects! This film has the late great Edward Asner who plays Santa Claus sadly he passed away in August 2 years ago same as James Caan who we lost a year ago! Will Ferrell is so funny in this he even played Alex Trebek in Celebrity Jeopardy! For SNL. This is a more family-friendly Christmas flick than Love Actually where that's an adult Christmas movie! I've been to New York City twice once in 2007 on my first trip to America with my family of 4 (Dad, Mum, brother Jordy and me) & again 10 years later in 2017 with Mum and Dad! I do want to find the original Ray's Pizza & taste test them! Overall this timeless Christmas classic still holds up after 20 years and I might even watch Elf: Buddy's Musical Christmas!

Not a laugh in the entire movie,"I have now watched this movie three times and have yet to crack a smile, much less laugh. I know I sound like a masochist for subjecting myself to this punishment, but I just could not believe a popular movie could be this bad. I assumed I missed something but every time I watched the film, it seemed worse than the time before. Absolutely nothing imaginative, creative, or witty in the entire film except the brief bit with Peter Dinklage who can actually act. Everyone else simply embarrasses themselves except for Farrell, who apparently cannot be embarrassed because he continues to make endlessly lame and boring films and has yet to figure out why people like Belushi, Steve Martin, and Bill Murray are funny and he is not. Picking old gum off a rail and putting it in your mouth is not funny, Will. Wearing tights as an overly tall elf is not funny. Belushi dressed as a samurai warrior is funny.

Painfully Unfunny,"Ebert starts his review of Elf this way:""If I were to tell you 'Elf' stars Will Ferrell as a human named Buddy who thinks he is an elf and Ed Asner as Santa Claus, would you feel an urgent desire to see this film? Neither did I. I thought it would be clunky, stupid and obvious, like 'The Santa Clause 2' or 'How the Grinch Stole Christmas.' It would have grotesque special effects and lumber about in the wreckage of holiday cheer...""And that's just how I saw it: clunky, stupid and obvious. And let me add, painfully unfunny. I cheerfully admit that I am in the minority here; Rotten Tomatoes has it at 83% I think, essentially a rave, and Ebert gives it three stars.We turned it off after half an hour, and, if watching by myself, I might have turned it off after the nearly endless opening credits, because I knew I was in trouble. Very early in the film, Santa Claus sees something moving in his bag of toys. He says, ""What in the name of Sam Hill is that?"" Gee, what a useless, trite thing to say at the first moment of tension in the film. Even a simple scream would have been an improvement.Ferrell's performance has been praised; I found him unlikable and tiresome. We've seen too much of this before, and done better, as in Starman, Moscow on the Hudson, and Time after Time: the naive waif encountering modern civilization for the first time. The elevator scene is almost funny: Buddy joyfully pushes all the buttons. What does the stranger in the elevator do or say? NOTHING! What a riot. Buster Keaton could have saved the scene with his ""great stone face,"" but here it's just one more opportunity squandered.Is there anything good about this film? Yes, Bob Newhart puts in a welcome appearance, but it's a good thing that his old stand-up comedy persona is that of looking ""out of place and anxious about it,"" because that's exactly how he looks here in his elf costume, talking to the camera. Fortunately it's mildly amusing rather than yet another embarrassment. The special effects are reasonable... ""Buddy"" is convincingly a lot bigger than all the elves, though his animated toy friends look off, somehow. The paintings used during the opening credits are attractive. I saw nothing else to like about this awful, painful film.Alan Nicoll www.angelfire.com/art/megathink",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"That movie where Will Ferrell buys his Dad Lingerie, Eats Spaghetti with Syrup, and gets high with a mailman","Funny, heartfelt, and with great casting- Elf's continuing status as a Christmas classic still manages to this day, due to its true sense of joy and child wonderment, as well as it simply being a genuine family film. Will Ferrell is by far the perfect casting choice for Buddy the Elf, no one can pull off the character with such ease, and make him so iconic. Ferrell has the energy to bring the character to life, and James Caan's performance as his father also proves to be an equally impressive match. The film starts out a little bland, I get what they were trying to, being an obvious ode to the Rankin Bass films of the older generation- but something just falls a bit flat about it, and it adds nothing really to the heart and or point of the story. I enjoyed watching Buddy harass people in New York, always found it really funny, as well as his scenes at Gimbels, interactions with Zooey Deschanel's characters, and him bonding with his new family. Perhaps the best part of the film though is its triumphant ending due to the large amount of Christmas spirit, and truly you are a cold hearted cynic if you don't smile at least once during that scene, let alone the film itself. In the end, Elf is not quite as great as the hype, but it still proves to be a very enjoyable and heartfelt little Christmas movie. Well deserving of its classic status.My Rating: 8.6/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
First Timer,"After all these years, I finally thought I should have a look at this, since so many people I know have it at the top of their Christmas movie list. I enjoyed some of it, but it is entirely predictable, schmaltzy, and doesn't really off much of a message. My favorite part was Bob Newhart explaining about the three thing that elves can aspire to. Otherwise we have the old father-who-works-too-hard bit as he ignores his son and tries (gasp) to earn money. Will Farrell is pretty funny at times, but his incessant talking and ridiculous actions started to lose me. There was never any doubt that he would be accepted, the boy would get his father back, and all would turn out well. At least now I can talk intelligently about it.

My 'inner elf' thought it would be worse than it was,"When I first saw the advertisements and previews for 'Elf', I thought that it looked like one of the dumbest films ever to be shown in cinemas. I thought: 'why would anyone want to see that stupid-looking film with that stupid-looking elf in pretty yellow tights and a green suit'? But, people saw it; some people I know saw it, and they said it was good, and I had to ask them if they were getting therapy. Well, anyway, I was wrong about the film. It has not been the first time, and it probably won't be the last. Whilst flying in the air, the airline showed this film, and I caught the later three-fourths (and watched the entire film shortly afterward). I *actually* thought that the film was funny - not just funny, but it was hilarious in some places. I can even still remember some of the events that made me laugh, but I won't post them here and spoil them, and some of them have to be seen to be appreciated.Now, this is not a great film, so don't expect it to be a flawless masterpiece.

Not Your Typical Christmas Story.,"Former ""Saturday Night Live"" standout Will Farrell stars as a man who was actually reared at the North Pole by Santa Claus (Ed Asner) and a group of kind and loving elves (led by Bob Newhart) after he wandered into Asner's bag of toys by accident one night at an orphanage when he was a baby. Fast-forward 30 years and the secret is finally out that Farrell is really human and that his father (James Caan) hails from New York City of all places. Now Farrell decides to leave the only home he has ever known in order to hopefully fit in with the human world, but his transition is difficult with usually hilarious results. ""Elf"" is another one of those productions this year that I liked even though there is really not as much substance as I would have hoped. Farrell, who was the only redeeming thing in the disgusting ""Old School"", is basically given free-will to run everything in the show and ends up dominating with a consistent performance that is surprisingly believable and definitely comical. Everyone else is present, but Farrell proves to be a true comedic force almost by himself. Overall the good messages sent by the film, the smart Christmas undertones and some very creative attempts at entertaining its audience are all enough to make ""Elf"" a strange winner that could best be described as the guiltiest of guilty pleasures. 4 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

The naivety of the central character is perfectly balanced to provide children with plenty to relate to and adults with plenty to laugh about. Despite being 25 I found myself in the former category!

"Find out: why Will Ferrell's performance is a good one, and which radiant newcomer to look out for...","As the delightful human who was raised by elves at the north pole, Will Ferrell, the greatest new comic actor out, walks a fine line between satire and genuineness.If he played Buddy completely for laughs, the movie would not imbue the audience with christmas spirit, and make us forget our doubts for a magical hour and a half.If he played Buddy completely subversively, poking fun at the christmas myth, adults would perhaps have had a few more laughs than they did.The reason Ferrell's performance is one of the best comic performances in recent memory, is that it serves both these purposes: there is a hint of satire in Ferrell's over-the-top enthusiasm, yet the innocence on his face appears absolutely genuine. One of the greatest sources of humour in the movie comes from actually believing Buddy has the mind of a child.Truly a remarkable thing. After this he goes on my list of greatest comic actors.My other favourite thing about this movie (which i found absolutely magical) was exciting newcomer Zooey Deschanel. She was absolutely radiant in this movie. I would watch it again just to watch her. She played William's sister in ""Almost Famous"" who leaves home to become an airline hostess (and plays Simon & Garfunkel's ""America"" to her mother to explain why she must, in one of the movies's best scenes). She also played one of the funniest characters in ""The Good Girl"" - Cheryl who remedies her boredom with her job by insulting customers without their understanding.

While I couldn't tell from the credits just how much was actually filmed in NYC vs. Vancouver, I'll credit whatever it does, as it is such a Valentine to Christmas in New York, to mix holidays.While Ed Asner makes me believe that he too thinks that Edmund Glenn really was Santa Claus, it is Will Ferrell's consistent wide-eyed innocence that carries the movie.The product placements do get annoying, but mostly serve the script.

A classic that needs to be seen every December.,"If I were to tell you ""Elf"" stars Will Ferrell as a human named Buddy who thinks he is an elf and Ed Asner as Santa Claus, would you feel an urgent desire to see this film? Neither did I. I thought it would be clunky, stupid and obvious, like ""The Santa Clause 2"" or ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas."" It would have grotesque special effects and lumber about in the wreckage of holiday cheer, foisting upon us a chaste romance involving the only girl in America who doesn't know that a man who thinks he is an elf is by definition a pervert. That's what I thought it would be. It took me about 10 seconds of seeing Will Ferrell in the elf costume to realize how very wrong I was. This is one of those rare Christmas comedies that has a heart, a brain and a wicked sense of humor, and it charms the socks right off the mantelpiece. Even the unexpected casting is on the money. James Caan as the elf's biological father. Yes! Bob Newhart as his adoptive elf father. Yes! Mary Steenburgen as Caan's wife, who welcomes an adult son into her family. Yes! Zooey Deschanel as the girl who works in a department store and falls for his elfin charm. Yes! Faizon Love as Santa's elf manager -- does it get any better than this? Yes, it does. Peter Dinklage, who played the dwarf in ""The Station Agent,"" has a brief but sublime scene in which he cuts right to the bottom line of elfhood. ""Elf,"" directed by Jon Favreau and written by David Berenbaum, begins with a tragic misunderstanding on a Christmas long ago. As Santa Claus is making his rounds, a human orphan crawls into his sack and accidentally hitches a ride to the North Pole. Raised as an elf by Papa Elf (Newhart), he knows he's at least four feet taller than most of the other elves, and eventually he decides to go to New York City and seek out his birth father. Indeed the whole world has grown too cynical, which is why Santa is facing an energy crisis this year. His sleigh is powered by faith, and if enough people don't believe in Santa Claus, it can't fly. That leads to one of those scenes where a flying machine (in this case, oddly enough, the very sleigh we were just discussing) tries to fly and doesn't seem to be able to achieve takeoff velocity, and ... well, it would be a terrible thing if Santa were to go down in flames, so let's hope Buddy persuades enough people to believe. It should be easy. He convinced me that this was a good movie, and that's a miracle on 34th street right there. Of course there's a big scene involving Buddy's confrontation with the department store Santa Claus, who (clever elf that he is) Buddy instantly spots as an imposter. ""You sit on a throne of lies!"" he tells this Santa.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Better Than Average XMAS film: Elf,"To start off, Elf is not in the same category as A Christmas Story or A Christmas Carol. It is not even as good as Miracle on 34th Street, which had much better acting and dialogue. That being said, for the current generation of moviegoers, who are easily satisfied with whatever is served up to them as long as it has great production values (and this film has), Elf will more than fill the bill. I am a big fan of Will Farrell, and he does a great job of containing himself (something difficult for him to do) and not running amok with sexual innuendo (something that is totally lacking in the film; and rightfully so). I thought the casting of Caan was odd, but the rest of the cast seem to be mailing it in, anyway. Who can share a scene with Will Farrell and survive? Good film for the kids around Xmas.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Timeless festive fun,"There are very few Christmas movies, or movies in general for that matter, that I could watch over and over again without getting sick of. 'Elf' is one of those movies.We're approaching the festive season as I write this review and, being such a crowdpleaser, this movie is already appearing in TV listings everywhere. It seems to grow in popularity year-on-year and it's hard to believe that it's been 14 years since its release.Will Ferrell without doubt makes the film what it is. He gets his character spot on and provides plenty of laughs for adults as well as kids. There are some hilarious individual scenes and the movie as a whole is just great fun, which is what Christmas movies should be.For sheer entertainment value, 'Elf' is without question one of the best.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"135,000 people can't be wrong!","Clearly some contributors to IMDb have no sense of fun or Christmas. This is a harmless film, aimed mainly at kids, which is an easy watch at Christmas. 135,000 average almost 7 out of 10 with their opinions on this site, so who are these few humourless people who feel they can criticize so freely. It may not be Hamlet but it has many saving graces and clearly appeals to the majority who watch it.Jamess Caan's role is a million miles from his role in The Godfather, where he met with a very bloody end. Will Ferrell built a reputation on this film so it had a positive effect.Bob Newhart took a break from running the Driving School and Ed Asner is also prominent.The film received positive reviews from critics and it earned $220.4 million world wide on a $33 million budget. That is a whole lot more people who cannot be wrong.

"Horrendous, Stupid, NOT Funny","It is incomprehensible that this film garners a 7.1 on here. It's sappy, stupid and obnoxious. Used to be that stars who had a name would be worried about being involved in a film that was totally vapid. That day is long gone. The story is so stupid. The ending is so sentimental and dumb. As the sputtering blunderbus flew off during the climax of this piece of crap, I could only think of the scores of starving people who could have been fed instead of spending millions on this useless pablum. And John Favreau doing this is all the more hilarious. The way he chomps his cigar while waxing unpoetic about the biz on Bravo, you'd actually think he had more in mind than just cashing in on pieces of garbage like this. The whole cast looks like they are attending a wake except for Will Ferrell who turns in another classic post-SNL performance: one dimensional, schticky idiocy that might work in a 2m skit, but leaves you numb after an hour and a half.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
not funny but shallow entertainment for kids,"I was disappointed in this movie simply because it wasn't a comedy.  It was just a simple kid/family movie about a na√Øve if not slightly retarded man who thinks he's an elf.  Even in a movie about Santa, the leaps that Cann's character and Elf's girlfriend made by the end of the movie were unbelievable.  Why would a pretty blonde like that even talk to an elfin retard who can't figure out an escalator? If you're going to throw the sap around, at least make it somewhat believable. This disappointing movie contains exactly TWO laughs.  The first occurs early when they explain that elves can only do three jobs (shoe repair, cookie maker, Santa worker) and shows the hazards of putting an oven in an oak tree. The second, is when elf tries to top the tree with a star using a couch as a trampoline.  Other then this, the movie is just shallow entertainment for kids under the age of ten. Don't go in to this movie looking for a comedy.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Sometimes unsurprisingly cheesy, but an overall impressive Christmas comedy","I have now seen a bunch of movies starring former ""Saturday Night Live"" comedian Will Ferrell, but it took me a while to get around to seeing this one, even though I have now been aware of its existence for probably about three years. It's getting to be that time of year again, and just yesterday, I finally rented ""Elf"", not exactly sure how impressed I would be. It could have easily turned out to be yet another cheesy, boring family movie from recent years, but while it may seem like that at times, it usually isn't. It's sometimes cheesy, and certainly not consistently hilarious, but I'm still impressed.One Christmas Eve, a baby boy at an orphanage is placed in his crib shortly before Santa comes. When Santa is not looking, the baby crawls into his sack and stows away to the North Pole, which is where he's finally discovered in that sack! The elves name him Buddy, after the label on his diaper, and Papa Elf volunteers to raise him. So, Buddy grows up at the North Pole, living the life of an elf, and still thinking he's one of them, even though he's a lot bigger than the others, and can't make toys nearly as fast as them. After finally finding out that he's actually a human, he learns about his real father, Walter Hobbs, who is a children's book publishing executive in New York, and doesn't even know Buddy was born! Buddy learns from Santa that Walter is on his naughty list, due to his selfishness, and the human raised by elves sets out to New York to find his father and change him. Obviously, this won't be easy, and it doesn't help that Buddy has never experienced the human world that awaits.The film starts out with an opening narration from Papa Elf, which certainly isn't the best part, and the segment where he says how trolls once worked for Santa, but they weren't toilet trained, showing an example with a troll in a diaper, may suggest the film is going to be another cheap gross-out comedy for kids. But hey, not so fast! The vast majority of the film is definitely NOT like that! I got some BIG laughs out of this movie, I think starting with some of the gags that involve Buddy's life as a grown human at the North Pole. I definitely laughed pretty hard when the main character meets a raccoon on his way to New York and tries to be affectionate with it! After he arrives in the city, the things he does there, being unfamiliar with life in a community like this, a lot different from the North Pole, are also good for laughs. Some of the gags I didn't care much for, including Buddy spinning around in a revolving door until he throws up in a garbage can, but for the most part, Will Ferrell's antics in the lead role didn't fail to amuse me. Interesting story as well.Being about Santa and his elves at the North Pole, one might think ""Elf"" is strictly for kids, and I guess I thought that might be the case. However, overall, I would say it has enough to please both child and adult viewers, not ALL of them of course (it's obviously not for the many Will Ferrell haters out there), but a lot of them. Now, there are obvious reasons why this movie is rated PG, a great example being Jovie (an employee at Gimbels, a clothing store in New York) singing in the shower, and Buddy coming into the restroom to sing along, not realizing she's naked! I found this to be another comedic highlight in the film, but parents might want to be cautious. Anyway, while this movie clearly isn't perfectly clean family fun, I would say it's close enough to it, and a lot better than the last Christmas movie I watched, ""Deck the Halls"", that's for sure",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A brilliant Christmas comedy!,"I remember when I first saw Elf at a specialized showing at AMC Theater in Neshaminy Mall back in 2009. And I love it!Elf centers around Buddy (played by Will Ferrell), a 30-year-old man, who as a orphaned baby, snuck into Santa Clause's (Ed Asner) sack on Christmas Eve, at the orphanage that he lived in. After being brought back to the North Pole by mistake, Buddy was raised by one of Santa's elves, Papa Elf (Bob Newhart), and grew up thinking his entire life that he was an elf... despite being three times the size of the other elves, and being the slowest at making toys. Upon learning that he's a human, Buddy departs from the North Pole and travels down to New York City, without shedding his elf garments, to meet his birthfather, Walter Hobs (James Caan)... who turns out to be a cynical and self-centered businessman, and on Santa's naughty list. Because Walter never even knew that Buddy was born, he takes Buddy to a doctor for a DNA test, and finds, to his dismay, that Buddy is indeed his son. As a result, Walter is forced to start a relationship with Buddy. And the results get more and more chaotic.The acting is brilliant. Will Ferrell is hilarious as Buddy. James Caan (may he rest in peace) is magnificent as Walter. I really like the contrast that their performances create between Buddy and Walter. While Buddy is incredibly good-natured and kind, but naive and simple-minded, Walter is cynical and small-minded. Ed Asner (may he also rest in peace) is perfect as Santa. Zooey Deschanel is really good as Jovie, the resentful, standoffish Gimbels employee that Buddy falls for. She starts off bitter and cold, but really softens up as the movie goes on. Plus, she has an amazing singing voice.The movie is also jam-packed with comedy that hits every right note! Favorite scenes of mine include Buddy chugging 2 whole liters of Coke and then unleashing a KILLER 12-second burp (dubbed in by Maurice LaMarche, one of the most brilliant voice-actors alive), getting into a fight with the Gimbels Santa after discovering that he's fake, wandering into the women's locker room when he hears Jovie singing in the shower, putting syrup and candy all over a plate of spaghetti (Mmmmm!), and answering a phone call meant for Walter: ""Buddy the Elf, what's your favorite color?"" HA! Oh, and the scene of him mistaking renowned children's author Miles Finch (played by the FLAWLESSLY cast Peter Dinklage) for an elf. PRICELESS! The movie is also heartwarming at times, like with Buddy and Jovie's falling-in-love montage, and Walter finally warming up to Buddy.The music is also great! I panned John Debney's score for Home Alone 6, but his score for this movie is beautiful and amazing, and really sells that Christmas vibe. The songs choices are also really good.Everything considered, Elf is a triumph at Christmas uplift and comedy, and one of my favorites to watch at Christmas. If you don't believe me, watch it for yourself! You'll be laughing like crazy.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Your very good elf...,"A delightful Christmas fantasy for all the family, proof that latter-day Hollywood can still knock out a charming festive film, just like in the old days.Sharing with the classic ""Miracle on 34th Street"" its New York department store setting, the story here is as improbable as any you'll encounter on any Feast of Stephen you care to mention. But forget that and just enjoy Will Ferrell accomplishing a wide-eyed but never over-played naivet√© rarely seen since Jimmy Stewart in ""Harvey"" as the innocent elf (actually a human baby born out of wedlock) abroad, attempting to bond with his curmudgeonly old dad this particular Christmas (of course!).Thus Buddy's many humorous adventures and encounters with the people, sights and sounds of New York naturally take us on an emotional roller-coaster ride but by the end of the movie, as if you didn't know, he's gotten a pretty co-worker (the wonderfully named Zooey Deschanel) to fall in love with him, made up big-time with his dad and just for good measure restored Christmas spirit to all and sundry in a nice, even exciting conclusion, which gives us the memorable sight of Santa's sleigh taking off over Central Park so that old Saint Nick can get on with his naughty or nice list.The casting is very good, James Caan, like fellow 70's tough guy De Niro before him, adapting neatly to family comedy, with in support, the ever-lovely Mary Steenburgen as his too-good-for-him wife and old MTM stalwarts Bob Newhart and Ed Asner, even more improbably as Buddy's adopted elf-father and Santa Claus respectively. Ferrell makes the film though, his wide-eyed wonder infectious right from the outset. The only real drawback for me really was the too-obvious product placement inserts. Otherwise, the film stays away from maudlin sentimentality particularly in its treatment of children and is filled with uplifting Christmas music, settings and spirit, rarely stooping to vulgarity for its laughs (okay, we do get a couple of near-obligatory flatulence and burping jokes, but that's okay, kids love 'em!).I heartily recommend anyone in need of a Christmas tonic to watch ""Elf"" and bring out your inner-child.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""There's not enough Christmas spirit!""","Elf (2003) -I first watched this film, because I was hungover at a friends house and couldn't change the channel and I am so glad that I did, because it is now a must see every year.A happy Christmassy place that was obviously full of fun, their version of the North Pole had a quirky, cartoony style that was inspired and made it clear how different the worlds Buddy The Elf found himself in really were.I had always found Will Ferrell's (Buddy) films to be a bit too childish and abrasive for my tastes, so I was surprised to find that I adored this film and that he was, of course, ideal in the role of a child like Human, raised by Elves.There were a few moments that I would typically associate with the Will Ferrell type of films that I have seen bits of or avoided based on the trailers and they did get on my nerves slightly, but I got over them fairly quickly, because everything else was just so brilliant.It had many great actors in it and no one gave a duff performance. I liked Mary Steenburgen playing Emily Hobbs, although it was a relatively small part for her and I found a new appreciation for Zooey Deschanel, because she had a great voice and was lovely as Jovie. I have since adored her as Jess in 'New Girl' (2011-8) and recommend it to everyone.Even James Caan was perfect as the grumpy old Walter Hobbs, whom Buddy visited in New York. Bob Newhart was also the absolute cutest as Papa Elf, who suffered greatly as Buddy's adoptive father.All of the Elves were actually very cute and cleverly depicted, including Peter Billingsley, the kid from the American classic, seasonal film 'A Christmas Story' (1983), as Ming Ming, which I thought was a clever touch.Veteran Santa, Edward Asner was a tad grumpy in the role for me, but he didn't effect things too much for it, because the story followed Buddy so closely and the shenanigans he got up to in The Big Apple, leaving Santa as just a bit part.Said Shenanigans were full of wit, joy and laughs aplenty, thanks in a large part to the brilliant direction by Jon Favreau, the genius behind 'Iron Man' (2008) and 'The Mandalorian' (2019-). He clearly had a liking for cult Christmas style and a great sense of humour, which delivered this enchanting tale.961.04/1000.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Will Ferrell Christmas Story,"Elf is considered an American Christmas classic and it is a film that has a charm to it. Will Ferrell doing what he does well, play a giant man-child which well works well in Elf because he was so innocent. There was an attempt at a heartfelt story with Buddy (Ferrell) trying to bond with his biological dad (James Caan) despite his dad not wanting to know. However, the comedy depends on how much you like Ferrell's style of comedy. I do like the ending because it does have a warm fuzzy feeling when the public by Central Park starts singing Christmas Carols and a Christmas choir singing when Santa appears before the public.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Perfect Film to Get Into the Holiday Spirit,"Legends Jon Favreau and Will Ferrell have created an instant classic perfect for getting you into the holiday spirit. This film is absolutely hysterical thanks to Ferrell's quirky antics and improvised style throughout nearly all of the film. There's a lot of heart that's suitable for ALL ages, making it extremely kid friendly. However there are a few moments of innuendo that will need explaining but they're extremely mild. And due to the main character being ""a fish out of water"" in New York, his antics may be questionable to younger audiences but are mostly humorous. But this film also has a lot of heartwarming messages as well, and not just about being in the Christmas spirit. It's also about family is what matters more than anything, believing in yourself, and how you don't need to change who you truly are just to be accepted by others, be it friends, a girl you like, or even family.

For example when Buddy goes to the mall and see's Santa Clause for the first time but he notices that its an impostor, then they start fighting...Another funny scene is when Buddy hangs out with his brother Michael after school then they see bullies throwing snow balls at them, so Buddy starts making a ton of snow balls then they start firing back at them and the bullies leave and run away.

Spagetti  Syrup And Gingerbread Men,"Will Farrell has done better films than this one but this is a warm feel good holiday film. When you look at it as a whole film, it holds a certain charm. That charm is established by framing the story around belief in the fantasy known as Christmas.This is the most extensive work done by Bob Newhart since the 1990's. Bob is the framework that holds this story together. Ed Asner has a very small role as Santa & is just here enough to be recognizable having little chance to do much acting.Brunette bomb shell Zooey Deschannel is charming as a blonde & proves she can sing. Hopefully she will get some better roles as her young career has proved she can handle them. In this movie, she makes the viewer buy that young innocent charm as she glows here.Faizon Love is excellent in support as the Gimbles store manager. James Caan is OK here, less annoying than in some films, but for some reason he does not seem to get really good roles anymore.There are some gross holiday bits, like downing a 2 liter Coke & a 5 minute belch which is entirely logical, and then some bits which are funny physical comedy. Farrell does not carry the whole show here and that is a good thing. While he is considered the star of his films, his films are better when the support can carry them.

Christmas Spirit!,"As far as TV was full of rubbish on Christmas night, I chose to watch ""Elf"" as the less annoying program. I am prejudiced with this kind of comedies and unfortunately I was unlucky enough to confirm my opinion once again. Except the 4-5 first minutes (before the opening credits), the whole thing was a huge disappointment. It is supposed to be a film for Christmas Spirit and lost childishness. Probably, Œô have a distorted point of view on how Christmas Spirit should be presented and what can be the meaning (at least for the people who still believe in it).Peace, love, altruism. ""Elf"" tries to convince the audience that Christmas Spirit is overconsumption in the nearest mall and Santa Claus is a guy who takes a break between the shots of a well known refreshment's advertising. I fully agree to a previous review saying that this film was made without any talent and producers should offer the amount given for the ""Elf"" to the homeless (if they really wanted to promote Christmas Spirit). Another paradox in this movie is that the main contributors are Jewish. That means that they could not have a real feeling for the subject they have chosen to film. Really, what is the necessity of a Menorah as a background in the Doctor's waiting room or snowflakes made of paper depicting the Star of David in a film for Christmas? Plot was totally predictable without any deviation from Hollywood's formula for family ""comedies""...(The kind-hearted naive hero who manages to change the hardhearted guy at the end bla bla bla)...

Wacky Spiritual Successor to the Tacky Holiday Tales of Yore,"A great excuse for Will Ferrell to run around in holiday garb, drawing sidelong glances from the sidewalk-strollers of Manhattan. Ferrell is the ultimate man-child, a six-and-a-half foot mess of arms and legs in green tights, buckled shoes and a pointy hat, matching the elvish wardrobe of 1964's Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer. As physical comedy and ridiculous enthusiasm is his forte, Elf makes for an excellent vehicle, but it's also loaded with a swath of supporting talent (admittedly, another of the comedian's calling cards). Zooey Deschanel (somewhat unrecognizable in blonde hair) is a good fit as his skeptical, frayed love interest, but the best work comes from James Caan, Peter Dinklage, Amy Sedaris, Andy Richter, Kyle Gass and especially Bob Newhart as his sweet, yet long-suffering, adoptive father on the North Pole.

"Not excellent, but a wonderful Christmas comedy nonetheless","Before his first debut in the superhero genre starting with the first two Iron Man films, he directs a Christmas comedy known as ""Elf"" starring Will Ferrell and James Caan.It's about one of Santa's elves named Buddy who learns of his identity as a human and goes to New York City to find/meet his father and teach him the true meaning of Christmas in world of wacky cynics.As far as Christmas movies go, this one successfully details the Christmas feeling quite perfectly. The actors are brilliant. James Caan did a good job as Buddy's father, but I think that the best performance goes to Will Ferrell for his portrayal as Buddy and successfully gives out his hilarious comedic moments. The rest weren't that bad either especially Bob Newhart, Mary Steenburgen and Ed Asner. The jokes in this movie are hilarious including the ""He's an angry elf"" part and the directing from Jon Favreau was surprisingly good.My biggest complaint about this movie was the ending which felt too cheesy for my taste and in the third act, there were barely any jokes near the end of the film including it's atrocious dialogue, but I think the story was wonderful that boosts up the character development and it's not a complaint.Elf may not be excellent, but I'm sure it would be known to fans of Jon Favreau as a Christmas classic for children young and old.7.6/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Will Ferrell is an absolute genius in his ability to bring such warmth, humor, love, belonging, and unique character to this movie. That's what made it such a classic. Will and Faizon love were perfect in the rolls they played in each scene. The innocence of youth longing to love and be loved is something else Will brings to the scene in such a unique way in his ability to capture the hope in everyone's heart. That hope is a reality that comes to life during the holiday season with family, relatives, extended family, and special long time relationships with friends.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"It's OK, but I'd rather watch Scrooged.","Will Ferrell is one of my favourite movie funny-men, but even so, I had my reservations about Elf: it is a Christmas film after all, and they do have tendency to get rather sappy for my liking.Still, I put aside my doubts, and to start with, I admit I had a chuckle-some time, with Will providing some amusing 'fish-out-of-water' moments as wide-eyed innocent Buddy, the titular 'elf' (in reality, a human adopted when a baby by one of Santa's workers) who leaves North Pole to travel to New York, where he hopes to find his real father (played by James Caan).Unfortunately, the makers of this film just can't help themselves, and gradually allow over-sentimentality to take control, before unloading a whole sackful of saccharine sweet clich√©s in the final act: Buddy's mean, inconsiderate father miraculously transforms into a loving dad; good old Santa pops up needing some Christmas spirit to power his sleigh; and everyone starts singing carols and being all happy and stuff! Hell, Buddy even gets the girl (pretty shop assistant Jovie, played by Zooey Deschanel). Gag! A bit of cheesy schmaltz is to be expected this time of year, but this amount in one massive dose is just too much for me to handle.I rate Elf an unexceptional 5.5 out of 10, very generously bumped up to 6 because, hey, it's Christmas!!!.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Holiday Classic,Funny and heart warming with great Holiday vibes. A truly classic Christmas movie that should be watched every Holiday Season. Will Ferrell have a classic performance.,10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Elf and safety,Elf seems to have become a Christmas Classic over the years. The kind of film kids want to see each December along with Home Alone.The premise is rather silly. Will Ferrell is an infant adopted in the North Pole and wrongly thinks he is an elf despite being much taller than the other elves.The naive Ferrell decides to go to New York in search of his real father once he finds out the truth. Dad happens to be the more cynical James Caan who is rather taken aback by a long lost son who thinks he is an elf and maybe borderline retarded.Ferrell gets a job helping out at Santa's grotto in a department store while trying to connect with his father. He also helps the real Santa by getting the public some real Christmas spirit to make his sleigh soar.The film is both silly and charming. Kids will love it but adults may find it a little bit over the top.Ferrell has enough charm to pull off the role. James Caan on the other hand has found a new generation of fans who know him as Walter and not Sonny Corleone.,6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Touching Yet Funny,"Elf is the story of a human named Buddy who was raised by elves in the North Pole at Santa's Workshop. When Buddy becomes an adult, he is told that he was adopted so he goes on a quest to find his father in New York City.This movie is hilarious. Will Ferrell is perfect for the role of buddy! He really portrays the character's sweetness with a comedic touch. One of the reasons I love this film so much is that it really captures what it would be like to take someone who has lived in fantasy land and throw them into the hustle and bustle of the big city. There are several montages throughout the film. My favorite would have to be when Buddy comes to New York for the first time because he does such bizarre things. If I were to see him eating the gum of the hand rail or playing in a revolving door in my town, I would think he was crazy! I end up feeling bad for Buddy because he is so clueless to how the real world works.Another thing that makes this movie so hysterical is that in the North Pole the props, costumes, sets and back drop are so elementary and simple, it really accentuates the innocence and comical quality of the elf world. Also, in the North Pole, there are some animals made of clay animation. Their design is very similar to the old Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer movie, and that warms my heart and makes me laugh.This movie is perfect for family night, watching with friends or when you just need a laugh. This story is touching yet funny as Buddy goes on an amazing journey to get closer to his father's heart and bring back holiday spirit to all. This is a great film for all ages because it contains the fun innocence of an elf that children can enjoy and it also has a bit of adult humor for the older viewers. Although young children will love this movie, I think ages 7 and younger should watch this with an adult or older child because they may get slightly confused or frightened. Over all, this is a wonderful film, whether it's the holidays or not.Reviewed by Raven Devanney, age 13, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
AWFUL,the worst movie i've ever seen.. i regret not leaving after 20 minutes.. it's such a terrible movie. there's no story to it.. it's not funny.. it has nothing to do with christmas really.. will farell is an ugly elf.. and the usually funny farell is VERY unfunny in this movie... it's just badly made....!!!!,1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
F-U-N-N-Y,"After seeing this movie at a sneak preview, I gotta say I loved it!! I hadn't heard much about it and really wasn't interested as most movies starring members of SNL are usually not very good! But was I ever pleasantly surprised! This movie was really funny! Wil (Buddy the elf)was hliarious as a man raised to believe he is an elf. His genuinely good heart and sweet disposition just make you smile, even when hes not saying a word. To see 'tough guy' James Caan in a comedy was also a bonus- he is great as a cold-hearted New York career man! As always, Bob Newhart is just awesome- who is more funny than him? His facial expressions alone deserve comedy awards!!! True this film is not gonna win any awards but who cares?! It has a great supporting cast, all of whom play their parts perfectly! Its is funny, enjoyable and a really good holiday picture. Great for kids, adults, teenagers, whoever!! You're gonna laugh and thats what a comedy is for!!!",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Enjoyable but not a favorite for me,"I remember seeing this in theaters on my first date with my first real girlfriend at 15. I'm a Farrel fan and I LOVE xmas movies but this never was one of my favorites. I never really understood the love for it. I don't hate it. It's def not bad. I enjoy it but it doesn't stand out for me.

"""He's A Fake!"" But The Excitement Is Very Real!","I love everything about elf, the story, the comedy; the Christmas everything about this is entertaining to the point it becomes a Christmas tradition to watch it. Will Ferrell is without a doubt one of the funniest comedians I've had the pleasure of watching, in this he plays Buddy the elf, a baby who was found in Santa's sack when he got back to the North Pole, that alone makes the story interesting and even more so we get to see an elf go to New York, a human sized elf that is.Its a very funny movie that is sure to keep you entertained and in stitches, I really enjoyed it and i think everyone else will, truly remarkable!Highly recommend!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Christmas comedy fun,"This film has become a sort of modern day Christmas favourite and it is not hard to see why. It has all the magic, heart and humour that makes a perfect Christmas film.Throw in a good script, Santa and a twist on A Christmas Carol and it is clear why this film has endeared itself to so many people.The cast are good - Ferrell may be the star name but James Caan and Ed Asner are all good in making their roles add something to this film.The whistle stop romance is rushed but very sweet and there is enough visual humour to entertain kids while also being verbal enough to make their parents smile.If any modern Christmas film has a chance to be a classic that is enjoyed every year it is this one, because it has all the magic ingredients, and appeals to so many.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Cute, funny holiday classic of a grown up being a kid at heart!","Finally after all these years saw the now Christmas classic ""Elf"", and I must say it was funny and enjoyable actually sentimental. As the story is well done and it gets one in the holiday mood for the meaning of Christmas. Buddy(in a funny turn from Will Ferrell) is an orphaned little baby who ends up in the North Pole to be raised by a lead elf(Bob Newhart) and he loves it up only when grown like an adult he needs a change so he decides to travel back to earth and find his real dad in New York City. And Buddy loves and lives it up only to find that real daddy is cold and tough(James Caan) he's not really a Christmas or holiday guy. Yet Buddy meets Jovie(the young and perhaps first film appearance from the sexy Zooey Deschanel) and she's a department store elf who has talent that being of a great singing voice. Thru it all Buddy learns life with a new family as magic and fate help bring out the spirit of Christmas. Overall fine and funny Christmas film memorable for Ferrell's funny turn as his adult elf is a kid at heart and the talent of the sexy Deschanel was well on display making this movie a must watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A rarity for the holidays and for Ferrell,"Elf has the premise and the look of a badly made Christmas special made solely for network TV. Going into this with mediocre expectations, it only took about ten minutes of seeing Will Ferrell in an elf costume to know that my predictions were dreadfully wrong. This wasn't a case of holiday dreck, but a case of the Christmas film that combined heart, soul, wit, and laughs into a beautiful holiday parable.The story is about Buddy the Elf (Ferrell) who accidentally crawled into Santa's sack at the orphanage when he was an infant and gets taken back to the North Pole. Santa Claus and the elves choose to raise him and train him to become an elf. Buddy is of course a human so he grows a lot faster than the average elf. In fact, he towers over every other elf he works with, and this leads to problems when he is older.Buddy then learns he is a human, which causes confusion and sadness. It is told that he was placed in that orphanage as an infant because his father fell in love with a woman who gave birth to him then gave him up unbeknownst to him. Buddy then decides he will go to New York City to try and find his dad and reconnect with him.His goal is to also spread Christmas cheer far and wide because Santa's sleigh is almost forced to operate with an engine. In the olden days, Santa's sleigh could fly because of mass amounts of Christmas spirit and children believing in Santa Claus. Now, he has to resort to heavy machinery to do that job.Will Ferrell hasn't sat right with me for the longest time, but as I see more of his movies I begin to like the guy in a sense where I'd like to see him do one of two movies; (a) heartfelt children's' films or (2) very serious dramas in the vein of his 2011 film Everything Must Go. He doesn't have the talents to pull off incredibly funny slapstick because his schtick is usually composed of running around like a towering dork or just screaming. Elf shows his ability to incorporate his persona in a character you can't help but love.We also see Zooey Deschannel, one of my favorite females in the business today, as Jovie, a woman who works at a mall as Santa's little helpers. Buddy falls for Jovie in a sort of non-conventional way, but he winds up getting conventional help from his younger brother Michael (Tay).Elf is more than holiday fluff, it's a successful romp of Christmas spirit sealed inside a good family film. The cast is lively, the antics aren't over the top, and the storyline unique and film sustainable. This also shows immensely that director Jon Favreau can be handed a script for a thriller, a comedy, a romantic comedy, a superhero film, or a drama and still be able to create on screen magic. I'm also sure this beats a movie about elves working in a tree during the dry season.Starring: Will Ferrell, James Cann, Zooey Deschannel, and Daniel Tay. Directed by: Jon Favreau.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The final yearly traditional classic we will ever see to date,"Its hard to believe that a movie in the 2000s could make it a must-watch in every year but I will definitely say its made my list. Jingle All The Way didn't make that list for a while but alas it is a must-see for those who partake in the holiday.That being said the comedy from Ferrel is spot-on what you would expect in his prime - This movie is very funny. It contains a lot of animations and characters from the claymation days and the music adds to the nostalgia trip.This is a family movie for sure and has some suggestive mature moments but so does A Christmas Story and Home Alone. The only flaws this has is some scenes can be a little on the younger audience side which could be a little cringy but forgivable -- that's the only thing that affects the score, it could have been a little more serious.Great movie to watch every year. And after this there hasn't been a new yearly traditional movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The film's success proves there are a lot of people on antidepressants,"That's the only explanation I have in order to explain why such a sucky, corny and unfunny movie was such a huge hit at the b.o. and now on home video. So many people's brains are so numbed by drugs that something as awful as ELF can easily be considered a classic.What's remarkable is how unfunny and predictable ELF was. I knew things were going to happen several minutes even before they were going to happen (for example, the short writer...). And the film's corny attitude is so overwhelming, I cringed throughout the movie. This film is so corny, it could supply a years worth of high fructose corn syrup for Coca Cola, Pepsi, 7-up, Dr Pepper, Tab, RC Cola, Orange Crush, Kool-Aid AND every Kelloggs cereal in production!!! This film is so divorced from reality that it's unfunny. Yes, it's a fantasy. I'm aware of that but the employees at the mail room of the Empire State building are working on Christmas eve? I mean, come on!And I felt so bad for James Caan.If you like Will Ferrell's shtick, you'll probably like this movie.

Elf,"You've got to be Elf'n kidding me. Not only is this an amazing Christmas movie but it's also just a well done movie. It has laughs, love, drama and Christmas spirit all in one without trying too hard. It's an immediate classic that can be watched every year and is automatically in the best 3-5 Christmas movies EVER. Will Ferrell is amazing and the movie is just so unique and stands alone.

It's way too long for the normal movie fan and reviewer.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It's Kind of Hard Not to Eventually Like This Movie,"The Good: This movie is all about Will Ferrell. Ferrell's Buddy the Elf is imbued with so much energy, personality, and purpose. He's memorable and a joy to watch, even if Ferrell's particular brand of idiocy does get carried away sometimes. He's really the heart and soul of this movie.But, there's plenty to like here. James Caan is fantastic here, New York City really feels like a character, and all those North Pole scenes are wonderful. This is a cute movie and definitely worth putting on your Christmas movie watchlist.The Bad: Again, Elf has a tendency to get a bit carried away at times, veering a bit too close to Step Brothers in terms of maddening stupidity. This is the point where Ferrell goes from funny, to very annoying for me. I also felt the Deschanel subplot was very half baked and honestly, kind of weird and unnecessary.The Ugly: A little puzzled by the end...so it takes a crowd of New Yorkers singing ""Santa Claus is Coming to Town"" to revive Santa's Christmas spirt powered engines to fly his sleigh? That's maybe a question that doesn't need answering, reading it out loud.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

SANTA!!!!!!! Oh My GOD!!!!!!!!! Santa? Here? I know him!,"There are a lot of iconic lines in 'Elf', and it deserves more than that. Every line from Buddy should be iconic because it is freaking uproarious. Master of situational comedy. The storyline is very simple indeed.

Best Christmas film..ever,"There a very few Christmas films that have been made that don't go extremely cheesy.

I found it so funny and can't wait till it comes out on dvd.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Funnyish, but is it Christmas Funny or Ferrel Funny?","Undeniably there are a few laughs in Elf. And it has a decent soundtrack that has lots of festive tunes to keep the yuletide feel alive. Now a few might argue with my reasoning here. But the biggest drawback for me is the rewatchability. Take Scrooged with Bill Murray as an example. I will never , ever tire of seeing the ghost of Christmas present smash Bill Murrays face with a toaster. Still laugh as hard every year. Elf unfortunately for me, made me laugh the first time. But Subsequent viewings don't bring the same enjoyment as the jokes are ""seen it, heard it"" and have limited replay value. I did enjoy the movie and Ferrel. Love him or loathe him, does what he does best and borders on the farcical with a style that only he can provide. Perhaps that's the problem. Ferrel's rewatchability in most of his work is not the easiest as his work depends a lot on the shock factor which diminishes each time you see it. A movie like Airplane I could watch countless times and still be amused. Elf for me is only slightly rewatchable and If it wasn't for my Daughter wanting to watch in 2023. I would have probably past it by this year.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Instant classic,"I cannot possibly overstate how magical this movie managed to be/become. I watched it as an adult...and was completely charmed by it anyway. I introduced my kids to it a decade later...and they fell in love with it too. Creating a Christmas classic after the year 2000 is pretty unthinkable. But the script had heart, Favreau had vision, and Ferrell was at the peak of his powers. Even if it was a bit derivative, the familiar beats find new humor and heart. Every year we watch Elf while eating waffles (with candy on top, of course). It never gets old. I don't always re-watch the Rankin & Bass TV movies, but a December without Elf would be unthinkable.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A great family movie for the holidays!,"Elf was every bit as funny as I thought is was going to be; surprisingly though, the comedy appealed to all ages.  I am a very big fan of Will Ferrell and his work in Elf was exactly what we like to see from him.  Kids will absolutely love this film, and their parents will laugh all the way through as well.  Not since Shrek has a movie really been able to entertain both sets of audiences with this much enthusiasm.I saw the movie at a screening at the Austin Film Festival, and even without all the Christmas decorations across the city, the story was enough to get me into the spirit of the holidays.

Getting you in the spirit? That was the premise if you watch all the way through.Watch and enjoy.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Will Ferrell makes this movie work,"OK, for the most part the movie was somewhat corny. Here it is, Will Ferrell is playing a guy named Buddy that believes he's an elf. Even though it is rather obvious that he is a LOT bigger than every other elf, he goes on believing it until the elf he referred to as ""dad"" broke it to him that he wasn't an elf. So began Buddy's journey out of the North Pole and to New York to find his real dad.Like I said, a lot of the movie was just corny, but I'll be darned if that guy Will Ferrell isn't a riot. Will Ferrell makes the ridiculous work, he was the perfect cast for the role. I just know that the movie doesn't have the same lustre or appeal with someone else in the role of Buddy. There was hardly a scene that Buddy was in that wasn't funny. And I would watch the entire movie again just to hear him say, ""He's an angry elf,"" when referring to an irate midget.

Elf yourself.,"'Elf (2003)' is a sweet, 'Christmas spirit'-soaked experience that's got just the right amount of edge. It's lead by the somewhat 'restrained' (in that he isn't swearing or getting sexual) yet brazen and unembarrassed Will Ferrell in perhaps his most iconic role. It's also backed-up by pretty much the pitch-perfect 'straight-man' and screen legend that is James Caan. The film is genuinely funny on a surprising number of occasions, while just generally being enjoyable the rest of the time, to boot. Where it falters slightly is in its third act, where the much more interesting father-son stuff is sidelined - to the point that the 'all is lost moment' and its aftermath (including its initial rectifying and, even, the flick's ultimate denouement) are rushed so much that they feel fairly disingenuous - in favour of a more traditional, typically 'Christmassy' 'saving Santa' story which honestly feels a bit out of place here. It's a real shame that the crux of the narrative is glossed over for this finale, especially considering that the focal relationship and its themes are actually really juicy - in terms of both comedy and character (indeed, pretty much every major player comes full circle in terms of their arc). It's an entertaining experience, nevertheless, and a pop-culture staple, too. Its problems pale in comparison to its successes. It's delightful, a quintessential Christmas classic. 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good film,"Ferrell has mastered a delivery that plays to multiple audiences at once, allow him to sound wholeheartedly sincere yet uproariously stupid in the same breath, yet uniquely lovable either way. In between the inevitable more kid-friendly slapstick (and thankfully only one burp joke), Ferrell is never crass about Buddy's childlike approach to life, mining it for the utmost of wide-eyed truth, and he's all the funnier and more adorably charming for it.The rest of the cast, thankfully, are game to echo Ferrell's spirit. James Caan is pitch-perfect as the curmudgeonly Scrooge too wrapped up in exploiting nuns and orphanages to pay attention to his giddy elf-son, while (a jarringly blonde) Zooey Deschanel showcases the luminescent, quirky charm that would shortly catapult her into stardom (she even sneaks in a couple of songs for good measure). Ed Astner's gruff warmth makes him the most definitive Santa Claus since Richard Attenborough, and the hangdog charm of Bob Newhart lends the film's narration a perfectly relaxed airiness.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Fun Comedy For The Holidays,"Elf is a really enjoyable comedy for the holidays. The story is nicely written. The heart would come to the right place when Buddy meets his real father for the first time. The setups are really creative for Christmas. Sometimes the movie would add some nice mix of animation that tributes the classic Christmas specials. The characters are very well developed and serve a purpose to Buddy's journey. And this would contain the most hilarious humor for a Christmas film. In fact, I can really tell the actors had fun with this movie. This would be worth a watch for those that are in a Christmas spirit and need a good laugh. This is probably one of the funniest Christmas movies out there. Merry Christmas.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

There was a bottle of Coca-Cola, a box of Pop-Tarts, a jar of M&Ms, Lite-Brite toys, and Legos. Oh yeah -- I forgot the Isotoner gloves and the authentic NFL jersey. I'm sure that I have even forgotten a few.

I can watch this movie multiple times of year without getting bored at all. I love all Christmas films, but this is probably the best. Unfortunately, the older I get, this film becomes less realistic so for some it may make them emotional, but I guess that just proves how strong this movie is. It has a great message. There are some questionable times in the movie where Will Ferrell comes off as a bit sarcastic, not really living up to the elf he's playing, but this should probably go over young children's heads. There are so many great lives in the movie...it may have only been released about 15 years ago, but it's certainly without a doubt a classic, and Will Ferrell is at his best.

A Holiday Classic Full of Heart and Laughter,"Elf, directed by Jon Favreau and starring Will Ferrell, has become a modern Christmas classic. The film follows Buddy, a human raised by elves at the North Pole, who travels to New York City to find his biological father. With its mix of humor, warmth, and holiday magic, Elf is a must-watch during the festive season.Positive Aspects:Will Ferrell's Iconic Performance: Ferrell's childlike enthusiasm and physical comedy make Buddy one of the most memorable holiday movie characters ever.Perfect Holiday Atmosphere: From the snowy North Pole to a beautifully decorated New York City, the film fully embraces the Christmas spirit.Great Supporting Cast: James Caan as Buddy's grumpy father, Zooey Deschanel as his love interest, and Bob Newhart as his elf mentor all add depth and humor.Heartfelt Storyline: Beyond the comedy, Elf is a touching story about family, belonging, and the magic of Christmas.Endlessly Quotable: Lines like ""The best way to spread Christmas cheer is singing loud for all to hear"" and ""You sit on a throne of lies"" have become holiday favorites.Negative Aspects:Over-the-Top Humor (for Some): Will Ferrell's exaggerated performance is hilarious for many, but it might feel a bit too silly for those who prefer subtle comedy.Predictable Story: As a holiday film, it follows a familiar redemption arc, though it executes it well.Some Dated CGI: The effects used for forced perspective in the North Pole scenes aren't as seamless by today's standards.Final Verdict:Elf is a joyful and heartwarming Christmas comedy that has earned its place among the holiday greats. Will Ferrell's performance, combined with a charming story and festive visuals, makes it a must-watch every December. While its humor may not be for everyone, its undeniable charm and holiday spirit make it a film that continues to bring joy year after year.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Perfect Holiday Movie for All Ages!,"Will Ferrell stars in this Christmas comedy known as Elf. Buddy lives his whole life as a misfit Elf helping out Santa in the North Pole. One day Buddy, who is taller and clumsier then the other Elves, realizes he is not a real Elf and decides to go out and search for his real dad. Only knowing how his life was back at the North Pole it was a huge change in his life when Buddy traveled to the big city of New York. His journey is conveyed by hilarious humor when Papa Elf has to explain to Buddy that the, ""yellow snow was not for eating and the gum under the railings was not free candy."" This movie contains comedy and romance and is good for all ages! I give this movie 10 stars because it is trying to show the loving relationship between Buddy and his father. The movie was successful in trying to bring out the kid in everyone by using jokes that are funny no matter how old you are. Hidden beneath all of the comedy was a lesson in which although someone like Buddy may be unique, they still can fit in and belong somewhere in the world.Will Ferrell is absolutely very funny in this movie. The way he can act like a kid is phenomenal. No other actor could have made Buddy the Elf come to life and walk us through his journey as a misfit, sheltered Elf at the North Pole, through his many adventures searching for his dad in in the big city. With Will Ferrell's other movies such as Step Brothers and Talladega Nights, his role in Elf is a different side of him most people have never seen. In this movie he falls in love and develops a relationship with his brother that is unlike any other. Being 30 years old and dressing in an elf costume everywhere he goes is only a little part of this movie that makes it so funny. Being used to wearing his outfit around the North Pole, it was hard for Buddy to understand that his costume was not appropriate for the work life.I recommend seeing it with children because they will not stop laughing. Buddy, ""traveled through the candy cane forest¬Ö"" This is just some of what he says to capture everyone's imagination. Not only is the movie extremely funny but it is the perfect movie for the holiday time. I enjoyed this movie with my family because in the movie the actors develop multiple relationships. This can show people that someone can replenish a relationship that was once lost. To me this movie is trying to convey to the audience that with all of this comedy, there is something deeper. Buddy is trying to build a relationship with his father and get to know his brother. Along the way of finding this, he stumbles across a woman in the department store where she is one of ""Santa's helpers,"" who he falls in love with. His weird role is enhanced when he does not know how to ask her out on a date.This movie is worth seeing. An adventure, a love story and Santa Clause all mixed together in a delightful holiday treat. Will Ferrell helps make this a movie that is sure to be enjoyed with you family each Christmas.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good family Christmas comedy,"Elf was better than I expected, and when it got going, it became good. Nothing amazing, or spectacular, but good. It entails a charming comic charm and Will Ferrel was superb as Buddy. I do have one major gripe about this movie though, its production design (in the North Pole scenes). Its blatantly obvious it was low-budget, to me it had little charm, only the actors did that. I especially loathed the awful animatronics, the kind you'd see on a day-time BBC kids program, cheap plastic toys made to look integral with the actors, it was a major setback in my opinion. I think its $30m budget should have been bumped to $40m, and it would have made for more charming and magically inventive sets.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A nice children movie,"This movie was for a long time in my watchlist but I never got interested to watch this movie until today when I gave it a try. I enjoyed this movie to the fullest. Though, it was childish story which your grandma may tell you while sleeping it was entertaining to watch. You laugh at the scenes where comedy is happening and feel the scenes where love and drama is happening. This shows that the direction was great. The story and the screenplay was simple but good. The performances by the cast members was good especially Will Farell, he was just great.Overall, you should give this movie a try if you haven't yet.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Better then I thought it would be,"Elf is undeniably a beloved holiday film, filled with festive cheer, quirky humor, and a charming performance by Will Ferrell as Buddy, a human raised by elves in the North Pole. His wide-eyed innocence and relentless enthusiasm for Christmas create plenty of laugh-out-loud moments and make the movie a staple for the holiday season.The film's heartwarming message about the importance of family and holiday spirit resonates, and the supporting cast, including James Caan and Zooey Deschanel, add depth to the story. The whimsical production design captures the magic of Christmas, and the upbeat tone keeps the movie light and enjoyable.However, while Elf excels in charm, it occasionally leans too heavily on slapstick humor, which can feel repetitive. Some of the jokes are hit or miss, and the storyline, while sweet, is fairly predictable. The film's pacing also lags at times, particularly in its transition from North Pole fantasy to the real-world setting.Overall, Elf is a fun and family-friendly holiday movie that's worth revisiting each Christmas season, even if it doesn't quite achieve timeless perfection. It's a solid 6/10 for its cheerful spirit and feel-good appeal.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Humbug,"The small children surrounding me didn't laugh at -Elf-.  Their small mouths grimly  wired shut, they didn't laugh at the ""zany"" hi-jinks, they didn't laugh at the ""jokes,"" and  they certainly didn't smile when Will Ferrill played ""cute.""  I can't blame them.  -Elf- is a  derivative, predictable march through a series of contrived mishaps and ham-fisted  doses of insipid tenderness.  James Caan is horribly miscast and fails to display any of  the warmth that his part calls for.  He's not even a good straight man.  He's just joyless  and angry, rushing through his lines.  At least, Bob Newhart does a decent job as a  fatherly elf.  And the special effects were pretty good.  I've never seen a better flying  sled.  Still though when the lights came on, the children and I felt more holiday despair  than joy.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Seasonal favourite,"I watch Elf with my family along with other christmas classics every year and this one has it all- quotable lines, likeable characters and motives, and especially with Will Ferrell, eccentric but wholesome humor. I also love these kind of movies where the protagonist goes on some adventure to achieve their goals and we get to see all the people and places they interact with. This one in particular encapsulates the culture and atmosphere of early 90s to 00s New York, much like Home Alone 2 and Coming To America.No matter how many times I've seen this it always feels like a journey to see all of the people around Buddy change.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
chest nuttiness,"occasionally hilarious Christmas movie...loaded with raucous slapstick, well performed.we all know ""where it's going"" from the gitgo and Will Ferrell is up to the task. some of us were raised by wolves...well , Will was raised by Elves...or by Santa...not sure.yes, it turns out he's the biological/full grown pixie son of James Caan, a struggling to stay afloat New York Publishing exec. he needs a sure winner by DEc. 24th or it's the unemployment line on the 26th. will Ferrell just expedite that trip? picture runs a little long...Caan...is it me? he's just not engaged. maybe TIm Allen should have played the Dad. he's not extra animated either, but we *expect* that of him. who knows if Caan intentionally held back to let Ferrell dominate the show? I liked Caan in HONEYMOON IN VEGAS...he should have brought that kind of energy top this flick.absolutely fabulous, breathtaking special effects!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Hilarious Christmas fun,"Jon Favreau's Elf is as snappy as holiday comedies come, mainly thanks to Will Ferrell's pretty damn hilarious performance as Buddy, a human baby stranded in the north pole and raised by pint sized elves as one of their own. Ferrell can be overbearing at times with his often hard to swallow brand of abrasive humour, but there's always moments where he reigns it in, sticks to the script and gives us magic. I think that this being a family film dictates that he especially needs to play it close to the chest and gives him a comedic track to run on without derailing into the desperate realm of cringy improv and sticking to the screenplay's wonderful jist, and not smothering it in ego and comedic decadence. It's a wonderfully sweet script as well, seeing Buddy travel from the north pole to bustling Manhatten to locate his long lost human family. His cranky birth father (craggy, immortalized James Caan) wallows in lukewarm disbelief as Buddy follows him everywhere, including back home to spend time with bis wife (Mary Steenburgen) and kids. He sorta kinda finds work in a mall due to his inherent elf-ness and gets himself into all kinds of trouble, until he catches the eye of a hired elf played by adorable Zooey Deschanel, who's got herself a case of the Christmas blues. Ferrell's upbeat, manic tone combined with Zooey's dry, laconic yet amused personality makes for perfect chemistry, especially in their odd, compelling rendition of 'Baby its cold outside'. Buddy blunders his way from one austere NYC situation to the next with shiny naivety and blind, trusting optimism to hysterical payoff, a dynamic which sits at the core of what's made the film so successful over the years. The only bad note for me is a terrifying animated version of the north pole that looks like Wallace and Gromit got drunk on rum and eggnog and dreamt some creepy version of Santa's homestead, complete with eerie talking seals. Director Favreau participates in a cameo as Caan's family doctor, Edward Asner shows up as a jolly enough Santa, and Bob Newhart steals many laughs as Buddy's awkward surrogate elf father.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Typical Christmas Movie,"This movie had all of the usual formulas of a Christmas movie; all the redeeming qualities. However, unless you have to take the kids to see a movie, don't see this. It isn't worth it.The movie is well casted, however, and Will Ferrel made it. He was the only reason why I liked it at all: ""You're sitting on a throne of lies!"" And James Caan is always a great choice, but being that it is a typical Christmas movie, if you want to get into the holiday cheer, see something worth while.And one more question. Why, oh, why did Jon Favreau direct this. He has so much more talent than to go this far and direct a holiday kids movie. Jon, why?5/10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Jon Monsarrat review: Slow, awful, not at all funny","Elf is a throwaway comedy in which it feels like the actors aren't really trying. Every line is flat. The first 20 minutes of the film is in narrative format. Narrative is a crutch for a writer, it's the opposite of ""Show, don't tell"". There is something really off with the pacing.And the bits with Bob Newhart looking sad and unenergetic are really boring. How can anyone find that funny? It shocks me deeply. Maybe the film picks up (as Star Wars I: The Phantom Menace did after the first 20 minutes). But I didn't get that far. I like the occasional kids film but this one was awful. For Will Ferrell films, see Anchorman instead.Who should see Elf:-- Kids only, and maybe not even kidsI'll give Elf a 4 out of 10 which is the highest rating I'll give a film I couldn't sit through all the way.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Christmas Comedy-filled Gem!,"Despite me growing up with this beloved Christmas classic, I went into my probably thirtieth rewatch with fresh eyes and a critical mindset. But wow, I could not stop laughing throughout the entirety of Elf. Whether it is Buddy the Elf doing the dumbest things that make you burst out laughing to the heartfelt redemption of the father character or the really cute romance between Buddy and Jovie, Elf is such a fantastic film on many levels.What makes this film so endearing is that it is just so incredibly funny. There are moments where you will burst out laughing, which is exactly what I was doing in my theater. Ironically, I think Will Ferrell isn't the funniest guy in the world and believe him to be heavily oversaturated in American comedies, but he was incredibly charming here.Minor complaints: First fifteen minutes have some horrendous CGI, cringe scenes, and really odd elf stuff that differs from the rest of the film, which is perfect. Once Buddy arrives to New York, all is good. Buddy makes some really dumb child-like decisions. Why would he eat chewed gum off the rails in New York city? Also, the implied Christian messages here are a little annoying. Like the fact that Santa's sleigh used to run of human spirit, but nobody believes anymore. But the film actually plays off of the religious undertones a lot, without specifically advocating for or against Claus as a Christian savior.Regardless, Elf is perhaps my favorite Christmas film of all time. The complaints are minuscule compared to how hilarious this film is to you. I will forever play this in my household each year.Also, Zooey Deschanel is only the most attractive woman from 2003. Wow. My first childhood crush.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Elf is fun,"This film is directed by Jon Favreau who has made his mark as a director of low budget films like ""Made"" and also as a character actor but this is his first effort at directing a mainstream Hollywood movie. He does a commendable job and as I watched this film I kept having the feeling that he purposely made the most commercial film that he could. Favreau as an actor has mostly appeared in small roles. As a director his small films are lucky to play at art house theaters and I seriously doubt he's getting rich hosting ""Dinner For 5"" on the Independent Film Channel. It looks as though he wanted to make a crowd pleasing film that will ultimately be playing on some cable channel for the rest of our lives. I'm not knocking this decision at all, it's a smart move and he's become a major Hollywood player with the success of this film. Even the script was carefully written to insure that WHEN this plays on television there will be nothing to edit out. The closest thing to a bad word is uttered by Caan when he says ""Hell"" once towards the end of the film. This is a fun film that does have undeniable charm and its heart is definitely in the right place. It's sentimental and corny but thats part of the appeal. The script doesn't try to hard and the energy and flow of the film keeps at a constant pace, it doesn't try to go over the top which is refreshing. Ferrell is a natural performer and his dopey wide eyed expressions never grow old. This film must be doing something right because tough guy James Caan is believable as a caring husband and father. Very old fashioned story that never raises itself above lightweight status is nonetheless funny and charming. Like I said earlier, this film will be playing on television every year for the rest of our lives!",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Cute *May Contain Spoilers*,"Elf by my usual standards was not what I would call a good movie. Do notinterpret that the wrong way. I enjoyed watching it very much, and I have found myself quoting lines from it for days afterward. It just didn't have the substance that movie needs for me to classify it as good.Will Ferell was great as Buddy the Elf. While I watched this movie I found myself wishing I could be as carefree and innocent as the character Buddy is in this movie. Granted he didn't know any better, but that's part of the humor. I think everyone wishes they could be more like Buddy to a degree, and that's whatmakes this movie so charming.The length of this movie was rather short, but that's probably a good thing.Charming and cute though this movie was, any longer than 95 minutes and Iwould've made up an excuse to leave.Overall I think it might become a Christmas classic, but maybe not one to watch every year.7 out of 10 stars",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Funny Christmas Movie.,"Review:
'Elf' is a Christmas comedy film directed by Jon Favreau.
Possible one of the funniest Christmas movies to come out of the 21st Century. This is a movie I watch all year round, not just around Christmas time.
The film centers on Buddy (Will Ferrell), a human who was adopted and raised by Santa's elves. He learns about this and heads to New York City to meet his biological father (James Caan) while also spreading Christmas cheer in a world of cynics in the process.
Will Farrell makes his character funny without being annoying to the audience (as he feared he might be from the trailer). James Caan is good but has to work with the scrooge character of the film and thus gets fewer laughs.
It's refreshing to see a story where others are encouraged to rise to the level of the main character instead of him being overwhelmed and dragged down by the majority of society. There is nothing I dislike about this film. It's a perfect family comedy that has the Christmas spirit at it's core.
Overall, the film is very funny in the beginning, and gets more Christmassy as it goes on. The performances are top notch and could have been carried away with the cheesy comedy.
5/5",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Instant Christmas Classic,"'Elf' is my third favourite Christmas movie. Consistent innocent laughs throughout. Will Ferrell delivers a wonderful performance as a misfit elf in a brand new big world. It's impossible not to fall in love with Buddy the Elf.Sometimes we need a reminder to be a lot nicer to one another. As naive as Buddy is, all he tries to do is be nice to everyone he meets, and spread Christmas cheer. This film is a great yearly reminder of that.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Christmas Is Arriving soon, And a Big Elf Learning about his life!","Well, the movie is certainly essentric, and is a bit overboard at times with the comedy moments inside the film, but Elf is always a good fun time. Just like a Christmas film should be. Will Ferrell isn't a bad actor either, and his comedy style is abit hit or miss. But Elf is a Hit, Well sorta. For me, it is a bit overbearing with all the slapstick in the film, with all that being said, it's definitely a fun Movie.But the premise of a drunken Elf, or presumably so. We start of the film with some narration. Then we see the baby Elf (Buddy) somehow crawling his way to Santa's Sack. Which is hillarious, as it is completely unrealistic. How Santa is blind to the fact that a kid can seemingly crawl whilst being unnoticed is rather strange. But It's in order to move the plot along. We then see Buddy as a giant Elf.Out of the ordinary, and a lot older then most of the other Elfes. But still has the Knowledge of a 7 Year old, with a wild imagination. But, Can get most of the awnsers right. Now, Buddy the Elf wants to find out where his real mother and father are.The Little segment before he arrives at the destination, is a Fantastic scene. I really do have to admire some of the props in this segment, they really do a good job of this. The settings popping up on the screen is picturesk. And really moves the plot along, but in a really interesting way. It looks like a scene from a book, and it's done perfectly well here.But, as I said previously he's still a child in reality, and not a middle-aged man. He's a bit silly, clumsy and overjoyed. Which, he acts drunk from now on. Like who goes into a coffee bar, and says ""Enjoy Your Coffee"" and then walks out. He also goes sleeps in a shop. It's Hillarious. And he's generally always excited.We learn that he was in some kind of Orphan, and that his grumpy father, and sweet but not a very generous mother want nothing to do with him. Even his own Brother at first acts as if he's some complete stranger. The problem is, Buddy doesn't realise this so he finds it out for himself. His household don't believe in Santa, but Buddy does. Also persuading his love interest that Santa is infact real.And in this sappy heart-warming venture. By the end, his family are happy of his existence. And also gains himself a girlfriend. Despite acting like a drunken person for the entire movie. Which is Hillarious how he was even this crazy. Although the film is by no means perfect it's certainly a fun Christmas Comedy.He also has a sundae for Breakfast, with M and M's and his favourite Syrip. With a drink of Coke. And Pancakes. This definitely shows how this movie at times can be very unrealistic and over-the-top. But it's nice to see a different side of food, and not just a normal meal like Scrambled Eggs on Toast. They, definitely went to the extreme with it. But they are fun scenes, just purely baste on how weird and wacky the scenarios are. So definitely, atleast in my mind Will Ferrell is playing a drunken Elf for most of the movie. Who knows how he got a love interest.Talking about his love interest. A beutiful young, Blond haired girl. Who hates any signs of interaction, yet for some reason works in a small Shop. Very believable. Its like the writer forgot to check the Script he wrote beforehand. But atleast something does stay consistent. She loves to sing in the Shower. And Buddy also sings along.Would I recommend this Film?,Yes, but not quite a firm yes, 6/10 Decent.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I love Will ferrel and Jon Favreau but I hated the movie,Didn't laugh and just wasn't into it.  I found the elf character to be more annoying than funny. I was told that this movie was really funny but I guess I'm just not easily amused. Towards the middle of the flick I was secretly hoping that the elf would go into a diabetic coma with all that sugar he was eating!  I thought the stop motion animation was a nice touch however I wouldn't recommend this movie at all!  2/10,2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Funny for children, but made for adults.","View from the Second Star: ElfElves, it seems, are good for one of three things. Building shoes while the shoemaker is asleep, making cookies and tea in trees, or manufacturing presents for all the good little girls and boys in Santa's workshop. ""Elf"", starring Will Ferrell, is the story of a human baby who snuck into Santa's toy bag while he was delivering toys to an orphanage. Santa, the kind hearted old fellow that he is, upon find this child in his toy sack, had this human baby raised in the North Pole amongst the elfish as one of their own. However, when a now fully grown Ferrel, learns of his mysterious history, he sets out for New York city to find his father and his past. Well actually not his past, just his father. sort of.This movie was funny - and anyone who says it was otherwise isn't me. From intro to the credits, I chuckled my way along the twisted bewildering path down which Ferrel leads the audience. The costume alone was a slap-in-the-face; it had me giggling at least once every fifteen minutes. Will Ferrell is hilarious: his expressions, his mannerisms, and this innocent little Elf routine: gold my friends, gold. He was good on Saturday night live, he's great in Elf.The story itself isn't really much more than a vehicle for Ferrell's parade of cutesy insane behavior. A workaholic father, a mom who cares, and a son who needs a friend, clich√© if ever there was; yet somehow, a six foot elf-man really brings the whole thing together. No moment to cheesy, no ""Dad I love you"" ending. Its obvious that this film wasn't created to cater to the family audience; I think, moreover, this film was designed specifically not exclude the family while appealing Ferrels main fan base, the teens and twenty somethings, at the same time. We've seen comedy designs like this before; Shrek anybody? Another example would be Shrek.The only grievances I have for this film revolve around the late third and forth quarter where things begin to slow down comedy wise. The ""I'm an Elf in the city"" routine works beautifully, but one can only laugh at the same thing for so long. Aside from the wrap up being a little boxy, the lagging denouement, this film's marginal errors are hardly noticeable to the always entertained eye.A ridiculous setting, a heavily recycled story, and a man dressed in yellow tights. This movie has no point, but who cares - I sure didn't, and I usually care too! It works, and it's funny. Good for the kids, great for the dates. Not doing much Friday night, or any night for that matter? Why not go see Elf; if you don't have many friends you can always find people to sit with there.7/10",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Fun, Clean but hilarious christmas movie anyone can enjoy","This movie was a big part of my childhood and was something I would always sit down and watch countless times through all times of the year. It was one of those movies that really captured the Christmas spirit. Will Ferrel's humor isn't for everyone so some people won't appreciate the film as much as others, it is a family movie so don't expact anything too audacious, but the jokes and gags are defenitley satisfying and funnyI do think that this is a slightly underrated Christmas film which is overlooked but I do think it can be compared to films like Home Alone and The Santa Clause when it comes to it's levels of comedy. It's also a very nice looking film that makes good use with many of New York City's locations. It's a fine Christmas movie with cute and funny moments. Again some people will find Will Ferrel's humor in this film to be cringeworthy, but again it fits the movie and the character of Buddy the Elf, so if you enjoy this type of humor, you should love this film.

Seeing him bring the spirit of Christmas to those who had none got them ready to see Santa. Now that they're older, they still get a thrill from watching the movie and now they get some of the jokes they didn't get when they were younger.Will Ferrell is perfectly cast as Buddy- an man-sized 'elf' with childlike wonder in New York City for the first time. James Caan playing his unbelieving father and Zooey Deschanel as the cute love interest are both great in their roles as they indulge Buddy and his beliefs while not quite sure if he's mentally ill or just crazy about the holidays.

A Modern Holiday Classic,"Will Ferrell has escaped the curse of most SNL veterans who try to transition to major motion pictures (at least those who have tried to make the jump in recent years) and manages to produce the most consistently funny films of probably any of them (including Mike Myers).""Elf"" is destined to be a holiday classic, one of those you watch every year around the holiday season. Ferrell, a human baby adopted by elves (some scenes of him with his elf dad, played in a dead pan performance by Bob Newhart, provide the film with some of its funniest sight gags), goes off in search of his real father, a search that takes him to NYC. The joke of course is that Ferrell, wandering around the streets of New York in his elf costume and eating gum off of subway station railings, doesn't seem out of the ordinary in a place like NY, where people are used to crazies, and where every department store has a troupe of workers dressed as elves anyway.He finds his dad (played by James Caan), falls in love (with Zooey Deschanel) and helps save Christmas when Santa's sleigh malfunctions due to a lack of Christmas spirit. It's all very funny and harmless, with a sense of humour that manages to satisfy both those who like their Christmas cheer served warm and those sarcastic cynics (like me) who watch ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" and root for the Grinch.Favorite line, delivered when Ferrell gets a job in the mail room of a children's book publishing house: ""This reminds me of the North Pole, except that it smells like mushrooms and everyone looks like they want to hurt me.""Grade: A-",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"A Fun Movie, But A Little Overrated.","Elf is already one of the most popular Christmas movies of all time, so in a way, this may already be kind of a pointless review. But I am going to review it anyway, since I haven't before, and this can be for the people who haven't seen it, or the people who may want to revisit it.Elf stars Will Ferrell, playing an elf named Buddy. When he was a baby, he snuck into Santa's bag while living in an orphanage and ended up in the North Pole, so one of the elves offered to raise him.As Buddy gets older, he learns that he still has a father (played by James Caan), and feeling like a misfit at home, he decides to go to New York to see him, only to find that there is little Christmas cheer there. Not for long...To start with praise, this is a really fun movie with my iconic scenes. Mention Elf to someone and see what they quote. They may say: ""World's Best Cup of Coffee! Great job everybody!"" or ""I'm in a store and I'm singing"", or ""He's an angry elf!"", or even: ""Oh, wait, I forgot to give you a hug!"" This may rank with It's A Wonderful Life as one of the most quotable Christmas movies of all time.Because of the lines I've mentioned and the goofy situations Buddy gets himself into, Elf is also a very funny movie. While writing this, I took a break to read the Quotes section on IMDB and found myself smiling and giggling at the favorite lines of others. Even now, the humor still works overall.Elf also contains many great actors. Will Ferrell is a mixed bag for me, I like some of his work and some of it I don't. However, Elf is easily one of my favorite of his works. James Caan does a fine job as his Dad, who is a grump at Christmas Time. Although, it makes it kind of odd (in a funny way) to later see him in a movie like The Godfather or Misery later on in life.Actors like Zooey Deschanel, Ed Asner, and Bob Newhart do great in their parts, as well as the other actors. Jon Faverau, the director, even has a cameo as a doctor and a Narwhal. (""Bye, Buddy! Hope you find your Dad!"") And to think in 5 years he would direct Iron Man!Despite the charm Elf has, I do have an issue with it now as an adult who grew up on this movie. Let me explain:This movie came out when I was 5, and there is no way to count the amount of times I have seen it in the last 18 years. My uncle had the DVD, and most Christmases included watching it, up until I was about 12. Let's assume that's 6 Christmases, since we may not have watched it EVERY year. There were a few times I saw it at school before winter break, let's say about 4 times.I also got the movie on DVD for Christmas when I was 11 or 12, but I think I used that DVD once. I also have a friend who owns it and we've seen it twice together. That alone makes for about 13 viewings that I can remember, again in 18 years.That is where my ""flaw"" with Elf comes in. There's some movies I can see again and again, and as I have gotten older, I have realized that this isn't exactly one of them.It's still a fun movie, but for lack of a better term, my viewings of Elf are somewhat tainted due to how many times I have seen it. For example, when I was a kid I used to find this funny:""Okay, everybody, Santa's coming...""""SANTA! OH MY GOSH!... I know him!""Which is cute and all, but I dare you to watch that a dozen times in a row and not get annoyed. That is how that scene feels now, kind of.Does that make it a bad movie? Not at all. I just don't have the same appreciation of it as I did in say, elementary school.On that note, Elf released in theaters on November 7th, 2003. One of my favorite Christmas movies, Love Actually, happened to be released on the same day. I have gladly seen that about 5 times, it's that wonderful and charming. Elf doesn't quite do that for me on that level.So do I recommend Elf? Of course. I'm not a Scrooge or a Grinch for crying out loud! But I would have higher suggestions for Love Actually, It's A Wonderful Life, Scrooge from 1970, Prancer, and other personal favorites.I will most likely see this more times later on, and I'm okay with that. Is it one of my favorite Christmas movies? Not exactly. Is it still a good time? Yes. Elf is like Buddy's favorite food- spaghetti with syrup and sprinkles. It's super sweet, but not to be digested in large amounts.Note: This is intended to be the first of 25 Christmas reviews- one posted a day.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"The Elf movie is not fit for children, or adults!  It's disgusting!","I am really sad, that I bought the Elf movie for my 8, 10 and 12 year old children. As they watched it, my middle child alerted me, ""Mommy, they're saying and doing bad things!"" I felt ashamed that I had bought the movie and I clicked it off! I told my kids, that I was sorry, and that I didn't expect the movie was going to be vulgar.I know that another viewer said this, but I'm going to repeat the warning: Please do not buy this for your children. The Elf movie is not fit for them, nor for any moral adult either!I can't understand how anyone could give the Elf movie a good rating. Only perverts could do that! It makes me sick, that there are few good movies today. It's hard to find a decent movie now. Few are rated NR, or G, but that's all that I will buy from now on.Please do not buy the Elf movie. If you are a normal, caring person, like I am, the film will be a waste of money and it will just make you upset, so don't buy this!",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
6.5/10,"Thirty years prior to the events of the film, a baby crawls into Santa's sack at an orphanage. Santa unwittingly takes the baby back to the North Pole, where it is decided that Papa Elf (Bob Newhart) will raise him. The baby, named Buddy (Will Ferrell), is raised unaware that he is actually a human, until his enormous size and poor toy-making abilities cause Papa Elf to tell him the truth. The old elf reveals that Buddy was born to Walter Hobbs and Susan Wells and placed up for adoption, that Walter never knew Buddy was born, and that he now works at a children's book company in New York. Immediately and full of optimism, Buddy sets out for New York to find his father.""Elf"" is self consciously structured in the most academical and basic way screenplays are written, it is screen writing 1-0-1 and it knows that, so even though it cannot be commended for a remarkable depth, there is just no resisting the charm and the comedy this film has to offer with what is possibly, still to this day, Ferrel's best performance.For someone who has always been somewhat of a Ferrell critic: I have rarely been able to enjoy his comedies and sketches, this film really surprised me and that is exactly because Ferrel is cast perfectly in the role of an over-enthusiastic human who thinks he is an elf. His zany and over the top comedy and his exaggerated facial gestures fit this film perfectly and grace us with moments of really good comedy. Favareau knows how to build upon this and has always the right camera set-up to enhance the comedic effect. He uses the classic shtick of people or objects entering or exiting into frame to incredible effect and even does some innovative things with the technique that really surprised me and had me rolling with laughter.The film also has a classic Christmas message and story: the characters by the end need to save Christmas and to do so they have to believe in the Christmas spirit. It is standard stuff, but the film is written very effectively and its colorful characters navigate through a sufficiently original premise and set-pieces which make for an undeniably pleasant flow. You care about everyone involved thanks to some solid work from all the performers. Yet, once again, what really pushes the film a notch above has to be the comedy, it is inventive and always different, it does not go for the same gag over and over again as it would be easy to do with a fish-out-of-water story.As I said, ""Elf"" cannot be praised for bringing to the table something new. The structure is predictable down to every emotional beat. There isn't a sense of overwhelming emotion involved with the characters and their struggle is never really given depth exactly because we know how it is going to go.Still, the fact that the film is self conscious about that helps it build around a pleasant family movie which is also a very good Christmas comedy with enough flare to keep you pleasantly entertained for the whole duration.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Takes a nose-dive the last 15 minutes,"I was pretty cynical about watching this movie, but not having anything else to do, I did, and was quite pleasantly surprised by the terrific and innocent feel of the first half of the film, as well as some great performances by Farrell and Caan.But something must have happened with the studio, or the script because the last 15 minutes spirals into a terribly contrived and generic Christmas film.

Great Christmas Comedy for the Whole Family,"After crawling into Santa's bag as a baby, Buddy, played by Will Ferrell, gets raised by elves in the North Pole. However, as he gets older, he soon realizes that he just can't live in an elf's world. He decides to go to New York City to find his real dad, who happens to be on the naughty list. But Buddy soon realizes that New York is nothing like the North Pole, and once again, he struggles to fit in.I found the film to be very enjoyable and entertaining. Will Ferrell was the perfect choice for Buddy, and you just can't help but laugh at the crazy things he does in New York. Eating gum off the sidewalk, attempting to use an escalator; the jokes are funny for children and adults alike. The ending is thrilling and kids will surely love it; adults likewise, despise some unnecessary sentiment thrown in. So overall, the movie is nothing spectacular, but it is a fun and refreshing Christmas comedy for the whole family.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Funny,"I decided to see this movie instead of the overhyped Cat In The Hat.  From what I read, I made a good choice.  I though Will Ferrell was funny on SNL (it has suffered in his absence) and he is funny here too.  I actually believed he was this oversized elf looking for his natural father.  And it turns out to be Sonny Corleone (actually James Caan, the actor who played Sonny in The Godfather though that would be a movie worth seeing).  Many people think Caan is miscast, but I don't agree.  Caan is a perfect cynic to Ferrell's believer.  The other interesting casting is Bob Newhart as an elf and Ed Asner as Santa Claus.  It's interesting to see them in a movie like this.  See this movie again and again.  7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
good holiday fun,"This was a funny holiday film with great performances all around. Will Ferrell gives one of the best performances of his career (and one of the funniest) as a human raised by Santa and his elves. When he was a baby, he crawled into Santa's sack, which explains how he got there. Now that he's an adult and six feet tall, he realizes he's no elf. He gets Santa's permission to go to New York and find his father, who is on Santa's naughty list. Once he arrives in New York City, however, he has a tougher time adjusting to the ""human"" world than he ever imagined. He tracks down his father (well played by James Caan) and convinces him of who he is. Initially a jerk, having Buddy (Ferrell) in his life makes Cann make some changes in his life and priorities. He is originally totally immersed in his job. I think this was a wonderful family film for the holidays and really recommend it.*** out of ****",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Very mixed review.,"Stars: Will Ferrell, James Caan, Ed Asner, Zooey Dechanel, Bob Newhart, Amy Sedaris, Andy Richter, Kyle Gaas, Artie Lange.Let me start by saying that I thought all the performances in this film were good. Will Ferrell was good, James Caan kept the movie afloat, Bob Newhart was a great presence. With such a great cast, I'm amazed they made such a mediocre film. The character of buddy the elf is kind of a one note joke, ""fish out of water"" character that really has no development in the film. Buddy is a human, who was raised as an elf, that goes back to New York to visit his birth father who never knew he was born. In New York he acts like an idiot, getting hit by cars and eating gum off the bottom of benches, etc. Buddy meets a girl played by Zooey Dechanel, who has a problem singing in public. I guess this movie is good for kids, but I found it to be very stupid. I thought Bob Newhart's narration (through the beginning and at the end) was a nice touch.My rating: C. 94 mins. PG for crude humor and mild language",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Generous dose of Christmas spirit.,"30 Years ago Buddy became the first human to set foot in Santa's workshop. In an orphanage, Buddy was just a baby when he sneaked into Santa's sack. Santa decided to raise him as an Elf.Buddy (Will Ferrell) always believed he was an Elf, just much bigger than the others. When he overhears elves calling him a human, Papa Elf confirms Buddy's fears. His mother has long since passed away, but his biological father lives in New York. And so Buddy embarks on a journey to the city.Buddy's father is publisher Walter Hobbs (James Caan), and happens to be on Santa's naughty list. When Buddy finally convinces Walter he is indeed his son, Walter lets him stay with him. But with Buddy unaccustomed to city life - and with the mind of a child - this proves to be no easy task.Plenty misadventures and funny moments ensue. Although 'Elf' is indeed slapstick as expected, I surprisingly enjoyed it more than anticipated, and there were indeed many truly funny moments. I thought Will Ferrell was perfectly cast as Buddy, the Elf.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Buddy the elf, what's your favourite colour?","Jon Faverous Elf, is a hilarious Christmas classic. Me and the family love to watch it every December, and it never gets old. By this point I have pretty much mesmerised every hilarious word that has come out of buddy's mouth. For example, Buddy the elf what's your favourite colour, what's a Christmas gram I want one, wait if your the real Santa what song did I sing for you on your birthday, wow your an angry elf. And many more. Every single word, sound, or action that Buddy does makes me and the whole family crack up. And the perfect actor was chosen to play this amusing role Will Ferrell. Not only is it funny, it has some good Christmas themes like having some Christmas spirit, to help Santa's sleigh fly, and the best way to spread Christmas cheer is to sing loud for all to hear, and to love and respect your family.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Needed More Time In The Workshop,"Can a real Christmas movie get made in our cynical, charm-free 21st century? Probably not, if ""Elf"" is the best stab at it so far.Up in the North Pole, Buddy the Elf (Will Ferrell) discovers he isn't an elf at all, but a displaced human orphan who found his way into Santa's bag at the end of a busy Christmas and was then raised in Santa's workshop. He undertakes to reconnect with his biological father, Walter Hobbs (James Caan), a gruff Manhattan executive who has found his way on Santa's naughty list.Odd to step back in time and see Will Ferrell in this early starring role, playing so resolutely to PG sensibilities that he almost seems made of gingerbread. Unless you own Keebler stock or have an aversion to watching spaghetti being eaten with maple syrup, there's little here to offend you.Alas, ""Elf"" is a film that thinks it's way cuter than it actually is. The idea of hearkening back to the stop-action TV Christmas shows I grew up with back in the 1970s is pleasant enough, and so is seeing NYC all dolled up for the holidays. But the story is a one-joke premise stretched well past its limit: Ferrell doing his man-child thing wearing an elf suit in the big city.One sequence demonstrates for me the limited nature of the film. In it, a children's book author played by another future big star, Peter Dinklage, comes to Caan's publishing house office to help concept an idea. Buddy spots him and immediately calls to him as a fellow elf, thus sparking a WWF rumble in the conference room.Sure, Dinklage is a little person and so the joke gets a bit of a laugh, but not anything to build deeper humor from. Why not, since we know Buddy is an overgrown kid, move past that and have the two get into a spirited disagreement about kiddie fiction, or what weather conditions are like on the North Pole? Instead, it's a short joke, some mayhem, and then cue the next scene.The film has a lot of go-nowhere moments like that, whether it's Buddy getting mistaken for a store employee at Gimbel's or Buddy's stop-motion pals on the North Pole. Caan deserves credit for playing his part with a deft lightness I wasn't expecting, and indeed most of the supporting work is fun. I especially enjoyed Bob Newhart as an especially sedate elf who looks after Buddy.There are also some funny bits for fans of Ferrell's wilder roles. Watching Buddy get into it with a department-store Santa (Artie Lange) who he accuses of being a fraud (""You sit on a throne of lies!"") is good for a few laughs, even if it devolves into another rumble. Zooey Deschanel is sweet as Buddy's left-field romantic interest, and the ending actually manages to be rousing, shot as it was literally in the ashes of 9/11.But manipulation is kind of at the heart of this film, both when it's working and when it's not. For all his evident good taste and desire to please, director Jon Favreau seems at a loss when it comes to finding that next gear and giving ""Elf"" a sense of wonder or of mission. It's pleasant and light, and often amusing, but still leaves you with the feeling of a misfit toy.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An unexpected pleasure!,"I signed on to this site now to check if Will Ferrell received any awards for his portrayal of Elf. He really tapped into his inner child for this one, because he is spot-on in this role. Its a difficult job for any adult actor to convey such innocent charm. The supporting characters are good, the directing very good, and the writing is excellent. I loved the run home to hide in his bathroom in his undersized house when he had his feelings hurt. The film was weaker in its second half, but Will Ferrell makes Elf such an endearing character that I've watched it repeatedly for just that.I really don't care for Will Ferrell's other movies or characters, but this was a wonderful performance!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A cute Christmas movie,"This movie came out when I was young, nine or so, and I remember giggling and laughing through this film. C'mon, it was cute, I loved it and still do. But, this is just my personal opinion. I'll give an overview of the movie.The Plot: The overall plot was...cute. Nothing amazing, just a typical Christmas tale. It tells the story of a young man who was raised by elves, and once finding out who he 'truly is', a human, sets out on a journey to meet his real family. And, before he sets out, Santa gives him horrible news. His father is on the naughty list. Buddy greets this by yelling 'NO!!!' as loudly as he can. Finally, he sets off to New York to find his dad, and meet his brother, a little boy played by the adorable Daniel Tay, and his father's new wife. Overall, it's a sweet plot with a sweet ending. No miracle, but it's cute.The Jokes: If you're looking for jokes that you'd find on Comedy Central, then don't both with this movie. But if you're looking for primarily kid-appropriate, Nickelodeon-like jokes, then look no further. This is the movie for you. Children from about five/sixish to eleven should enjoy this movie, along with a handful of preteens/teenagers (such as myself).The Acting: Okay, the acting's not great. It's adequate at the most. Will Ferrell plays his regular yell-out-lines role, though his facial features and comedic timing are pretty good. Zooey Deschanel's good, not perfect, but good. She definitely evens out the movie without trying to overuse comedy or burst out in exaggerated lines like a certain actor in this movie who was mentioned earlier. James Caan was probably the best in this movie. No, his performance wasn't Oscar-worthy, but it was better than the majority of the performances. He believably plays a spiritless man who's in denial of having Buddy as a son, and never really trails out of character. Finally, Daniel Tay, who plays Buddy's brother and, as we see later in the movie, good friend, is absolutely adorable in his snow hat. His acting's pretty good, not perfect, it was just a regular child performance. However, his performance is pretty much brushed aside because he's overshadowed by his adult co-stars. The other cast members were good, not great, and I must add that Lydia Lawson-Baird, who only says two or three lines, will practically melt your heart with her sweet presence upon screen.Overall, it's a cute movie, good for kids. Don't watch this movie expecting something Oscar-worthy. If you're looking for a kid-appropriate movie, then this is the movie for you.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

In fact I really can't imagine any other actor they could have cast better than him for this role. There is enough heart and magic in this movie to please both adults and children equally and make it a family must watch during the Holidays.

Will Ferrell shows tremendous potential in this paint-by-numbers Christmas movie,"When I first saw the Elf trailers, my initial reaction was ""oh great, this looks pretty bad"".  Judging from the low quality of the trailers and the fact it was opening up on the same weekend Matrix Revolutions was opening I had little faith in this film.  But after watching it actually take out the titan it shared a weekend with and continue to stay near the top combined with the positive reviews and excellent word-of-mouth I decided to see what made Elf so special.Well, what I can basically say about Elf is that it takes almost every single Christmas movie cliche and throws it together to make a two hour movie.  We have the ""disgruntled man who needs to be shown Christmas spirit"", ""Santa is unable to deliver presents so main character must help him"", plus with a sappy ending that reeks of positive spirit.  But what I believe prevented this from turning into another I'll Be Home for Christmas is that Will Ferrell shows so much potential as a comedian and as an actor and his performance did save this film.Of course, many of the good jokes were spoiled in the trailers which I personally hate when it comes to any comedy so that did impact my perception of Elf's humour a lot.  But what I was seen for the first time was very humourous and the way that Ferrell brings the Buddy the Elf character to life is amazing.  All he needs is one consistantly good film and his career will take off, I guarentee that.  I'm saying that because I only see potential in Ferrell, Old School was too short and the jokes were badly paced while this one just feels like another Christmas movie.  Considering the immense success of Elf however, I can honestly say we will be seeing that one film very soon as demand for Ferrell goes up.  The choice to make James Caan the father of Buddy was a pure genius move since Caan still has the ability to make his character seem rough around the edges, (though his ""good ending"" was a little forced).  A lot of Ferrell's scenes clicked and many of his jokes did indeed hit and that is what I feel makes Ferrell so gifted.Basically, what I'm trying to say is that Elf is a basic Christmas movie with little surprises but Ferrell's performance truely shows his potential.6.5/10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great Family movie for people of all religions!,"Will Ferrell is a comic genius. Only somebody with his talent could develop naive Buddy the human elf into a great family film. The film is done with a lot of heart and sometimes is even corny but it is a great family film. There is rarely expletives or violence in the film. Will steals this film easily from stars like James Caan, Mary Steenburgen, Ed Asner, and Bob Newhart. If you're looking for a good holiday movie without any preaching, this is it. I wish Artie Lange was doing more acting like this than the Howard Stern show. He is an untapped comic genius in his own right. Artie Lange is the John Belushi of our generation and sadly he has some of the same problems. Will Ferrell is worthy of the success. He is brilliant, likable as Buddy.

"Stay for the humor, leave if you want any substance","Christmas 2022 day 7. A movie I really don¬¥t know if I've watched before. I know it¬¥s been on tv and such but I think this is the first real active time I've sat down and seen in, and that is recommended.Elf is in no way special and has a very fractured plot that culminates to a, what feels like unearned ending, but it¬¥s still so funny. This is one of the comedies where you brain should be turned off and just enjoy it, think about it just a little bit and it falls apart.We follow Buddy. A human who was brought back to the north pole and was raised by elves. He doesn't fell like he fits in an goes to New York in order to find his real dad.The movie feels like it was written by 3 different people and the plot feels like it¬¥s in east and west. The beginning conflict has noting to do with the later conflict and overall, the plot is one big mess. It can make the movie feel aimless and just being events happening. But it is a comedy and a Christmas movie so maybe don¬¥t think too hard about it. Sadly it got to me and the handling of fitting in, workaholic dad, girlfriend trouble and the ending seem not to fit together at all.I loved the beginning the most. The first score is good and fun, and the production design of the north poll is so fun. This is where the experience is the purest and not tainted by the movie trying to have a plot.I also really loved Buddy¬¥s outfit. It makes every scene his in with normal people so much more fun and a real clash of color and style.I think this movie could have been kind of more decent if it had stuck to one of the Christmas clich√©s plots better. It would have been clich√©, yes, but overall, a better written movie.But the movies humor is so good, and I laughed so many times. Normally Will Ferrel is a 50/50 for me in terms of humor but he is perfect in the role of Buddy. He plays the unaware fish out of water perfect and there are so many jokes and gags that land perfectly. Some don¬¥t but for the most part the humor is sublime.And that¬¥s why I would watch this again. This is a good brain turned off movie where you can do something in the background while it¬¥s going, since you don¬¥t really have to follow the plot since it barely matters. The humor is good and that is all that matters here.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

It's hard to describe just how much I hate this movie..,"Seriously. Will Ferrell comes across as some kind of retard who shouldn't be allowed anywhere near kids, let alone as one of Santa's Elves.I suppose my experience of this film is worsened by the fact of being stranded in a cheap motel in Canada during the holiday season while my ""companion"" insisted on watching this. She thought it was ""cute"". Nuff said.This is just such a loathsome, nauseating and at times, diabetes inducing, nightmare that I am at a loss for anything more constructive to say.I think I probably despise Will Ferrell even more than Jim Carrey after being exposed to this abomination, although I will admit they both give me the major creeps in very similar ways.I am pretty open minded about films. I didn't even mind Battlefield Earth or Barb Wire that much and I like all kinds of obscure art-house films as well as some of the lowest rated trash. But this? I just don't get how ANYONE can give this film a rating above awful..",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Actually, i only see Ferrel in maybe 3 or 4 movies, most of them in minor roles, and this was his best appearance that i ever known.I bet Favreau directed well for this movie. Two thumbs up for his first big project movie.maybe there's one thing to criticize that the love between Buddy and his father it was showed too clich√© and it was too easy to solve it.

Just delightful - even for a bitter old atheist!,"So, aside from falling instantly in love with Zooey Deschanel when I first saw Elf way back in 2003, this movie still gets 10 stars from me because each and every year I watch it at least twice... and cry.It's like watching Tinkerbell come down from atop the Matterhorn at Disneyland, the penultimate scene in Elf. It awakens inside of me memories of youth, innocence and memories of a time when everything was new.Obviously I am cheesy and weak - but most of the year I am a bitter, aggressive atheist who compares believing in God to believing in Santa.But not when I watch this movie.I love the story, Mr. Narwhal, Bob Newhart (a god as true as any!), and Zooey singing. I love James Caan and Mary Steenburgen in this film too! Everyone inhabits their roles so seamlessly in my mind...And seriously - when was the last time you saw an 'elf' fly down a conference table to kick some ass? Anyhow, I am rambling.

Fortunately there were only four other people in the cinema (surprising since it was the opening weekend), and they didn't seem to mind me busting a gut.I heartily recommend for other Ferrell/snl fans.  Both the physical comedy and dialogue were of top-notch hilarity.  I even almost cried a couple of times (and not just from laughing).  See for yourself.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Santa's Six Foot Helper,"I'm sure most of us could admit we have stretched our legs out into an almost split position while getting on an escalator or hopped across a crosswalk only touching the white squares. Or maybe even yelled out ""Santa! I know him!"" when you see one at a local mall, all because of this hilarious film we saw years ago and still continue to watch today around the holiday season. The movie Elf, featuring the hysterical Will Ferrell, is unforgettable for most. As we watch a so called ""elf"" adventure from the North Pole to find his biological father in New York City. Although this adventure isn't as smooth as you might think. A six foot tall elf named Buddy who claims he's pals with Santa and wears a green elf suit with neon yellow tights underneath, hopping around the crosswalks of Manhattan, doesn't fly with most uptight New Yorkers who are rushing to their next location.Thanks to his perpetual sugar rush, we see Buddy run around the streets, stores, and malls of New York as his dad sends him away so he can continue to work. After much convincing and a doctor visit, Walter, Buddy's father is confirmed his real dad. He treats Buddy with little respect and love initially, but grows to know and love him more and more throughout the film.Directed by Jon Favreau this film highlights the sweet stuff, looking into family background and overcoming past issues by discovering the history of their family roots and spending quality time with one another. Plus maybe a blood test or two!Will Ferrell does a fantastic acting job as he seems to have a passion for his character Buddy, never playing him down to be too much of a nut job. Will is always in action, waving to hardened New Yorkers and doing circles in revolving doors, he is really quite hilarious. The script is killer as well; a film where most people you know can quote a line, as he uses funny and memorable phrases to captivate the audience and make you chuckle.Now let's talk about the costumes. Considering this movie came out in 2003, the fashion sense was quite different than now but they fit the directors purpose. Buddy struts his uniform of an elf suit, bright tights, and a pointy hat daily, which is fitting and quite laughable.Lastly I'd like to touch on the overall setting throughout the film. It was a bit animated and dull to start off with at the North Pole, for example a weird-looking narwhal popping up out of fake water to wish Buddy good luck on his journey to find his father, was a bit unnecessary I'd say. But after Buddy arrives, it develops into a beautiful and festive New York background with glimmering streets and snowy nights.One of the best parts of the film is the music, it's familiar, holiday themed, and filled with upbeat sing alongs that are well known by most. A song can do a lot in a film, it enhances the good and the bad. It makes a happy moment more happy or a sad moment more sad. Overall music can affect one's emotions more than the actual scene itself. Elf's music choices really get you in the Christmas spirit!Sure, Elf is a predictable ending and maybe a bit too feel-good, but overall an extraordinary movie with few complaints. It covers issues on biological family, and is a witty Christmas movie entertaining to family and warming to the heartstrings of the audience, after Walter finally accepts his son. Besides, if it ended any differently it would be like finding coal in your stocking on Christmas morning.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

More suited for kids,"It's Christmas time and being a massive movie fan I decided it would be appropriate to watch some Christmas movies. I hadn't seen Elf so I thought I'd give it a go.So Will Ferrell plays a human who was brought up by elves and decides to go and find his real family.Now there are a few Christmas movies which I enjoy but unfortunately this isn't one of them. I found it minimally funny. In fact the humour was a bit too childish for my own liking.I was never really a fan of Will Ferrell. I found him a bit silly and I don't think he fitted the role.

I wasn't much a fan of Ferrel, at the time (hadn't seen The Good Guys or Talladega Nights, yet), and so I didn't have an interest to see the flick. But Jon Favreau made it (the director of Iron Man-as well as the parent of the MCU). My intrigue began there, and I finally saw it. Loved it ever since.The cast is fantastic. The music choice is fantastic. The colorfulness of the film is fantastic. The wit of this script is so perfect.Now I'm still trying to get my own family to watch the film, since we all love Christmas movies.To see something so creative be released in the early 2000s is still shocking, to me.

Was not believable,"I could not believe this movie at all. So many of the comments are about what a wonderful movie this is, and I watched this with my children in great anticipation, but I kept wondering, would anyone want to watch this more than once? I like sappy Christmas movies; they are fun. I even like fantasies based on a silly premise. To work, however, there must be some semblance of believability.The Elf character was so much over the top, that even as a non-human in a human body, he didn't quite fit reality. From the premise in the movie, elves are hard-working, optimistic, and encouraging, but they are not stupid. It was the other characters, though, that really stood out. When Buddy was doing his silly stuff, the other characters just stood there as if they were waiting for him to finish his lines, instead of reacting as you would expect New Yorkers to react to a wacko like that.James Caan was believable, but no one else was. That has to be laid at the feet of the writer and/or director.My opinion is clearly in the minority, but I thought this was one of the worst movies I've seen in a very long time.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Elf,"Elf is, in many ways, the perfect Christmas film. It's filled with joy and heart. It's funny and emotional. And most importantly, it embodies Christmas cheer. While some bits of humour didn't work for me, the overall joy that I felt while watching this movie made me forget about that.The thing that I always look for in holiday movies is whether they can put me in the right mood. Be it for Halloween, or Christmas, or something else. But for Christmas especially, I think it's crucial, it's what makes or breaks the movie. Elf, fortunately, succeeded in putting me in just the right mood, and it did so very well. All the Christmas songs, the gentle snowfall, the Christmas lights and beautifully decorated trees, made it truly feel like Christmas. And while all movies related to the holiday manage to do that, it's not enough on its own. To really make it feel right, there needs to be some heart in the film. That isn't quite as easy to do as all the other aforementioned things. For the film to have heart, and for it to shine through to anyone watching, it has to connect with its audience.The story in Elf, which follows a human raised as an elf in the North Pole, tells about family. And family is how this film connects with the audience. Buddy, the elf in question, eventually learns that he was placed for adoption, but that his father is in New York. Buddy then leaves the North Pole on a quest to find his dad and connect with him. It's a story that is full of heartfelt moments and challenges. And since Christmas is, at its core, about family, the story in Elf couldn't have been any more fitting. As such, it's no wonder that this has become one of the most beloved holiday films. It's easy to fall into its warm embrace, and enjoy the antics of Will Ferrell, as well as all the wonderful heartwarming moments that this film is full of. Elf succeeds brilliantly at what it set out to do, and it will, without a shadow of a doubt, become one that I will visit, if not every Christmas, at least frequently.As recommended by Rafael, I watched the Elf episode of Netflix's The Holiday Movies That Made Us. It was a great look behind the scenes of the film and the whole process that it took to get the film done. And while there are interesting and funny insights about how the scenes on New York's streets were made, what moved me the most was the story of David Berenbaum, the writer of Elf. The story behind this movie and the reason it is like it is, really encapsulated why this movie works so well. Without going too deeply into detail, Berenbaum lost his father at a young age and wanted Elf to be a movie about reconnecting and searching for a father. It's a beautiful story on its own, and it really made me appreciate this film, and its story, more. So if you have the chance, and you like this film, I would highly recommend checking out The Holiday Movies That Made Us on Netflix.To be completely honest, I have never been a massive Will Ferrell fan, and that's probably one the reasons why I put this film off for as long as I did. However, having now seen it, I'm glad I did. It's a wonderful Christmas film for the whole family, filled with holiday cheer, heartwarming moments, and a good message. It did what I wanted it to do, that is, put me in a very Christmasy mood. Indeed, Elf has very quickly become one of my favourite Christmas movies, and I'm glad that I know that something like it exists.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"""You're not a cotton headed ninny muggins, you're just...special.""","A classic Christmas comedy. This is also one of my first movies when I was younger with Will Ferrell doing a major part. The rest of the actors were also good, including Bob Newhart as Papa Elf (and even the guy who played Ralphey from A Christmas Story as one of the elves in this movie!). It's a funny plot about a human raised by elves who grows up at the sweet and cheerful (but secret) place known as the North Pole, and who then heads to the more ultra-modern, upscale, slightly dangerous place known as the big city (NYC). Strange for the elf at first, but he eventually fits into it more as time goes by. The movie as a whole turns out as a comedy for the most part, but it's also got some touching spirit and joy (like Stepbrothers, but more Christmas-y). Some of the music in the intro and background of the film were pretty neat, plus the animated characters were also ""cool"" as well at the North Pole.

Definitely in the bottom of my list of good Christmas movies.,"This movie is completely puerile from start to finish. A complete waste of my time. Will Ferrell is not at all funny.

Puerile yes, but it has its moments. I like that this film has many Christmas songs and the opening credits too are backed by some nice music which is why I didn't skip that part even. But the rest of the film is simply too silly and poorly written. Maybe kids will enjoy it to some extent. But if you're an adult don't expect much.

I am so disappointed with this movie that I'm sending a photocopy of my ticket stub to New Line Cinema to ask for a refund.

"It doesn't matter if it's not Holiday Season, Elf charms any time of the year","""You sit on a throne of lies!""Elf is one of those rare comedies that grows on me each time I rewatch it. I remember I enjoyed it the first time I saw it, but I love it even more now. Not everyone is a fan of Will Ferrell's man- child character, but seeing him wear those yellow tights and his green elf suit is hard to resist. He is hilarious in this movie and at the same time charming. Elf is not just a comedy that aims for cheap laughs or plays on one gag, it is also wickedly smart and brings out the Holiday spirit in everyone no matter how much of a Grinch or Stooge they are. There are so many great scenes and memorable quotes. The funniest scenes in the film are the ones where Ferrell calls out a fake Santa in the department store where he has been hired, and when he mistakes one of his father's associates (Peter Dinklage from Game of Thrones) for an elf. Those two scenes were great, but there were so many more hilarious moments playing on his confusion. The love story is also sweet and Zooey Deschanel shines in every scene she's in. James Caan plays Ferrell's father (who's in the naughty list) extremely well. Elf has turned into a Christmas classic, but the great thing about these comedies is that you don't need to wait for the Holiday season to enjoy them. Jon Favreau has proved he can direct some great films and he has a great sense of humor. It's been 11 years since it first was released and it continues to be a joyous experience.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

'Tis the Season for Your Elf Humor,"Who doesn't want to see a movie of Will Farrell dressed as an elf wandering the streets of New York City? Will Farrell stars in the funny, family friendly christmas movie Elf as the main role of Buddy the elf. Buddy is a human who was raised by elves after sneaking into santa's bag at an orphanage. Buddy spends most of his life, into his 20's living in the north pole thinking he was an elf. When he comes to realize he's not the same as the other elves, and he's really human, Buddy sets off to find he real dad in the big city of New York. Being raised by elves, Buddy struggled to fit in on the streets wearing his daily elf clothes and acting as he would have at the north pole. Buddy's unique personality made it difficult for him to connect with his workaholic father specifically, but his wife was happy to take buddy in as their adult-child. Even with his different lifestyle, Buddy is even able to find love in the big city.
Will Farrell has starred in many movies during his career that has created him the reputation of a funny, child-like actor, including in the movie ""Step Brothers"". Step brothers follows the lives of two forty year old men who live at home with their parents, have no job, and act like a 12 year old. Farrell has also been known for his incredible wide range of character impersonations. His goofy hair and looks helps Farrell really play the role of a goof. Will's bubbly, christmas loving character, is met by his mean, workaholic, christmas hating father who is played by James Caan. James has had many ups and downs in his career, but he is most known for his acting in The Godfather.
There are a number of jokes embedded throughout the script of elf. Although many of them are funny and make the audience laugh, there are a handful of jokes that are just not good. Besides the occasional bad joke, the jokes are made to be funny to a little kid, while also being able to make their parents laugh. The way the movie script was written, the majority of the time the jokes are very discreet and missed by the audience. Although this makes it better, because every time you re-watch the movie you are guaranteed to hear a new joke.
Overall, Elf is a great, hilarious, family friendly movie, and although it is a christmas movie, it is a great pick for any night of the year. See what it's like to live in New York City as an elf who came from the north pole. Whether your 7 years old or 70, your sure to love this movie. Buddy the elf has spread the christmas spirit all through New York, he was even able to get his snobby father to enjoy a little christmas caroling.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The Elf Who Saved Christmas,"(There Are Spoilers) Buddy the Elf, Will Ferrell, never seemed to fit in with his fellow Elfs in Santa's, Edward Anser, workshop at the North Pole. Being a couple of sizes bigger then the Elfs that he lived and worked with at the toy factory Buddy felt out of place and with his overly big hands he was clumsy in making toys as perfectly and delicately as your average Elf. Buddy considered himself to be, to the horror of his fellow Elfs, a ""Cotton-Headed Ninny Muffin"".One day Buddy's dad Papa Elf, Bob Newheart, came clean with the obviously confused Buddy and let the truth come out: Buddy your not an Elf your a Human. Buddy,were told, was left at the steps of an Cathloic Orphanage to be brought up by the Nuns there. One Christman Eve Santa came to town and Buddy slipped into his bag of toys and ended up in the North Pole and was secretly made to think that he's an Elf by Santa Papa Elf and all the Elfs working there. Now with the truth about him and his real dad Walter Hobbs, James Caan, a greedy and unfeeling children's book publisher who's, O' My God, on Santa's naughty list! Buddy crosses the seven levels of the Candy Cane Forest and past the Sea of Twirly Swirly Gumdrops and finally goes through, on foot, the Lincoln Tunnel to the magic city, New York, to finally meet his dad who he never knew up until now.Looked at as ""Some kind of Nut"" at first Buddy's good and child-like nature, as well as his belief in the Christmas Spirit and Santa Claus, wins over everyone that he meets. From his dad Walter to his step-mom Emily Hobbs and younger brother Michael, Mary Steenburgen & Daniel Tay,as well as Jovie, Zooey Deschanel, the girl who he worked with as an Elf, what else,at Gimbel's Depertment Store. Through Buddy's skills as a toy maker as well as his all around good nature he made believer's of everyone in New York City that there is a Santa as well as a Christmas Spirit. Buddy did it with a little help from his newly found and made friends who at first didn't believe him and even thought that he was just a wee bit mentally unstable. Heartwarming Christmas Movie with Will Ferrell perfect as Buddy the Elf who saved Christmas with James Cann as his grouchy but later Santa believing dad.Jovie who has a beautiful singing voice but was too stage frighten to sing in front of people, she only could sing in the shower, was so motivated by Buddy's actions to open up her voice in public at New Yorks Central Park, singing a Christmas Carol, where everyone in the park joined in including Buddy's at first apprehensive dad Walter.

Exactly what I wanna see in a live-action Warner Bros. Christmas comedy,"I know New Line Cinema is the studio that released the film, but New Line is still an acquired property of Warner Bros, since 1996.This is one of my favorite Warner Bros. films next to the Lego Movie. Will Ferrell, for the most part, is hilarious. His performance of Buddy Hobbs is fantastic.Similar to Arthur Christmas, this movie is one of the reasons why Christmas is one of my favorite holidays. The story is awesome, the humor is clever, it has some emotional moments, the writing is well done, and the characters are memorable. It may be better than Buddy's Musical Christmas, but that honestly isn't saying much.Overall, this film is fantastic. Great Christmas film for everyone who enjoys Christmas.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Awful,"Was really looking forward to this movie.  Was really disappointed.  5 people got up and left 1/2 way through.  By far the worst film since Gangs of New York and the English Patient.

Pure Christmas Magic,"Elf is full to the brim with Christmas spirit. It would not be the Christmas season without watching it multiple times. Will Ferrell gives 100% to the role of Buddy and the supporting cast is excellent. The filmmakers could have gone real raunchy with the movie and I'm so glad that they didn't. Rather than rely on cheap humor, the bits in this movie are quick, witty and hilarious.Along with Home Alone and a few other family favorites, this is one of the most quoted movies in my house.

Having found hisperformances hilarious in `Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back' and`Old School' my expectations for his performance in this film werestill fulfilled thankfully, despite it this film actually being pretty dire. It all moves along well enough and is moderately entertaining, butthe end was a little too much to stomach for me with the obligatorysentimental christmas message.

"""Buddy the Elf, what's your favorite color?""","Christmas movies go into two categories. There are the ones that become classics and sometimes become a part of a family's Christmas tradition. Then there are the ones that are just there for the season, like the ones made for TV or just some that have been forgotten. This movie is definitely one that will become an instant success in your house around the holidays.Elf is the story of Buddy the Elf (Will Ferrell) who is essentially the spirit of Christmas as we like to see it. Buddy is a human living in the North Pole because he found his way into Santa's sack of toys. Growing up around elves, he began to notice some differences between him and the other elves. When Buddy's adoptive father Papa Elf (Bob Newhart) tells Buddy that he isn't an elf, he sets out on a journey to New York City to find his father Walter (James Caan), the publisher of children's books who doesn't really know the meaning of Christmas.During his time in NYC, Buddy shacks up with Walter and his family. He gets a job working as a department store worker in their Christmas department. There he meets Jovie (Zooey Deschanel), the girl who catches Buddy's eye with her kindness and great personality. Buddy tries to get his father off of Santa's naughty list and bring his family closer together.Ferrell is absolutely perfect as Buddy. His childish character is hilarious and what better than letting a ""kid"" run free in New York City. A place full of new experiences like traffic, rotating glass doors, and elevators. His character really does embody the spirit of Christmas. To be good, sing songs, and celebrate. Although Christmas has gone commercial, this movie is a great way to feel good around the holidays. The relationship between Buddy and his father is an awkward one at first, but grows over time. Whenever they are near each other it is a laugh riot. Ferrell is always hilarious and truly makes the movie. Nobody could have been Buddy better than Will.Elf is a joy to watch over and over again. Soon after you see it you will be quoting it all day long. It's addictive in a good way. Ferrell has been on a roll with movies as of late and this is a Will at his best. He makes being a big kid look easy and fun. Elf has comedy and is appropriate for the whole family. This movie will make you feel all warm inside even in the North Pole. Elf is a winner.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I have been doing this every year since I was a teenager. No Christmas without Buddy the elf.It is something you can watch with the family or on your own.The film covers romance in a charming way without overdoing it or getting cheesy.

Sweet Little Christmas Movie,"Elf is a sweet little movie about Buddy who is raised by elves in Santa's workshop on the north pole, but Buddy isn't an elf, he's in fact a human and as such dosn't have the same nimble fingers as the other elves. When Buddy is told by his adoptive elf father that he's a human he goes to NY to find his birth father, here mayhem ensures because life here is very different than what Buddy is used to, furthermore Buddy has to save or rekindle the Christmas spirit.Plot wise this is an okay little story, however as a fantasy buff, I was a bit disappointed by the elves, whom have more in common with a Gnome or Halfling than Elves who normally are about the same height as humans. Jon Favreau does capture the normal dislike between Dwarfs and Elves but as mentioned the elves in this movie has nothing to do with the general look of elves. The effects are so-so, what little there are anyway. The acting is also so-so with Mare Winningham and Zooey Deschanel performing best but in no way spectacular.All in all a sweet little movie to waste a Christmas Holiday with but nothing more. 5 out of 10",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Good, Clean, Classic Christmas movie!","Anybody who knows me knows I'm hard on Will Ferrell. However, after seeing this movie I have Ferrell fever! Ferrell proved himself worthy of the comedic giant status he has earned by portraying the naive over-sized ""Elf (human)"" named Buddy, a human adopted by an elf who is raised in the North Pole and somewhat reeks havoc on the elf community with just his sheer size. After having a talk with his father, he embarks on the mission of a lifetime to find out who Buddy the Elf truly is! Being fueled with nothing but sugar and a pure adrenaline rush, Buddy ends up lost in the big apple, unintentionally reeking havoc along the way, finding someone who graciously opens his home to Buddy only to have the door slammed right in his sweet little elf face after good intentions turn into bad reality. Along the adventure he proves to every stuffed shirt stuck up businessman the true Christmas spirit lies within your heart, and Santa Clause really does exist and is fueled by the pure joy of Christmas. This movie has become a staple in our yearly Christmas line up. Kudos to Ferrell for making a family friendly comedy unlike some of the other great actors that have come from SNL.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
wasn't expecting this!,"I never had the urge to watch Elf. I saw the adverts, thought it an over-americanised piece of tacky, vulgar crap. So when my music teacher decided she was going to make us watch it, I wasn't looking forward to it. The fact she claimed to have watched it 6 times since buying it, before I saw it, was worrying, and the fact she wanted to show it to her GCSE music class was just as odd. But she had bought us chocolate logs (there are only 10 people who take music) so we all settled down to watch it (""if anyone asks, we're studying film music!"").And wow. I mean wow. This film was one of the funniest and most touching films (considering what I thought it would be) that I'd ever seen. There are so many scenes that made me laugh out loud to count. And I can truthfully say that at certain points at the end, our entire class went ""awww!"" (the fact that we're all girls shouldn't factor into this.) The advert for this film doesn't do it justice at all. There's a plenty of humour in it to satisfy any adult (or 16-year old) as well as the kiddie laughs.Will Ferral makes this film what it is. His child-in-a-grown-mans performance is admirable and everyone said that they would marry him just for his sweetness in this film. That said, Zooey Deschanels snarling attitude definitely brought a satisfying ring to the film, with her witty put downs of Buddy the Elf and her portrayal of 'teen angst' is fantastic.Watch this.

Very nice Christmas movie.,"This is a nice movie to watch during the Christmas season, perfect for the whole family. Here, a man named Buddy raised as an elf at the North Pole is sent to the U.S. in search of his true identity, after growing to an unusual large size for an elf. He finds his biological father, played by James Caan, but must convince him that he is his son. When he interferes with his job, the father must decide: son or job. Thrown into the mix is Jovie, played by Zooey Deschanel, whom Buddy falls in love with.The story is fun, with a catchy music score and funny characters. I especially like the snowball-fighting scene and the people's reaction when they discovered that there is really a Santa, who was flying away on his sleigh. I also like the fact how they depicted the North Pole as a real place, providing imaginary scenery and ambiance. This movie brings out the true Christmas spirit in everybody, though fictional in reality, everybody should have something to believe in. This movie could of used more comedy, though.But overall, a good family get-together movie.Grade B+",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"2022, yes, you need to watch it to feel the christmas spirit.","Reviews are for people who cant decide if the movie is for them or not, at least that is why i read user reviews.Well, i must have lived in a cave in the last decade because this movie avoided my attention, since i do not have a TV.I mean Will Ferrel is not really my favorite actor, but i enjoyed some of his work, when you see him dressed as an elf on the movie poster, that is not really making you want to watch the movie, but i have heard so many people talking good things about it that i gave it a chance, and you should too.Here is why:
The movie is made by Jon Favreau.It is hard to believe that this man has such a talent, even back then, no wonder he managed to build such a career over time.The movie has another actor, who is well known today, but i have never imagined that i would see him in this movie, so i will not spoiler it for you : )The movie will make you laugh out loud, feel entertained, and it will touch your soul with that juicy christmans spirit if you let it.There is something for everyone in the movie, for the kids and adults both, highlighting what is important in the christmas, and Will Ferrel does a good job creating a path for you as you follow him and his ""advanture"" reconnecting with his dad and falling in love for the first time.I would call this movie a classic for christmas.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Ferrell tries his best, but the writing is unambitious and mediocre","So-so film with a few really funny moments. It always seemed like the comedy could have gone two steps further than it did. There are tons of missed opportunities and jokes that are built up without payoff (the news broadcast at the end of the film is a perfect example). Elf earns points for being a decent family film in that it has almost no objectionable content ¬ñ one very long belch is about it. It's nice that it doesn't resort to gross-out humor, but it could certainly stand to be less lame a lot of the time. Will Ferrell, a former Saturday Night Live actor, stars as a human who is raised by elves until his enormous height compared to the other elves makes this fact all too obvious. When Ferrell finds out that his father (James Caan) lives in New York City, he goes out and finds him. It becomes a standard fish-out-of-water comedy. The writing is half-hearted, so the weight of the movie ends up resting wholly on Ferrell, who does his damndest to carry it on his shoulders. I've always been a fan of Ferrell, even if he did create a couple of truly obnoxious characters on SNL. He actually does a fine job in Elf, playing a truly manic but sweet idiot. The filmmakers should have trusted Ferrell more, because it really shoots itself in the foot when it begins to concentrate on a very cheesy and unbelievable crisis in the elf's newfound human family. Ferrell has run away from home, and Caan and his family think they can find him in New York City ¬ñ which, of course, they do. And Ferrell (along with his family and his girlfriend) have to convince the people of NYC to have faith in Santa Claus so his sleigh can fly. They do this by having the girlfriend (a very cute Zooey Deschanel, who might look a bit too much like Reese Witherspoon to become a star) sing 'Santa Claus Is Coming to Town' on the news. I was enjoying the film, but this kind of formulaic garbage just ruined it. It's nice to see Bob Newhart, Charles Durning, and Andy Richter. One of my favorite comediennes, Amy Sedaris, was also there somewhere, but I must have missed her (was she one of the elves?). 5/10.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Elf Review,"Elf, a movie directed by Jon Favreau features Buddy The Elf (Will Ferrel) as a human who was adopted by Santa Clause and his Elves at birth. His massive size has always hindered his elf-like talents but he is accepted by them none the less. When Buddy learns of his biological father (James Caan) being on the Naughty List, he is sent to New York city on his quest to regain his father's compassion. The film plot and storyline are somewhat predictable, but in an endearing way. Ferrell does a great job of really taking on a character with a ton of different quirks that a lot of actors would not take on as well as he did. His love interest in the movie, Jovie (Zooey Deschanel) is somewhat of a weak point acting-wise in the cinematic adventure. Her monotone voice does little for the vibrant aura of the surrounding actors and she has little to no relevance to the plot or events that take place during Buddy's antics. Overall, the movie is a great family film but also is a movie that is great for all ages. It has elements that appeal to a large variety of demographics and is slowly becoming a holiday classic that can be viewed on television multiple times during the season.

Better than my already high expectations!,"This is the family movie hit for the holidays! I was very excited to see this movie as I am a big fan of SNL and Will Farrell. He did a superb job in this movie and the supporting cast was excellent. I had already had such high hopes for this movie that I wasn't sure if it could get any better, but it did. The storyline is a classic ""make you feel good"" theme. I would recommend this movie to anyone and it is one that I will add to my personal collection when it comes out on DVD and it will be one of those movies like Christmas Vacation that I will watch several times around the holiday season every year. Take the whole family to this show. It's worth every penny. :)",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Elf: A Modern Day Classic,"During the holiday season, a yearly tradition done by many is to watch holiday movies. A few of these classics include Home Alone, A Christmas Story, and National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation. However, I believe one to be above all the rest. Elf, which was released in 2003, is the greatest Christmas movie of all time. There's a reason why Elf is always played over and over again during the Christmas season. It's a true modern classic. Because of its strong characters, wonderful humor, and amazing atmosphere, Elf deserves the title as the greatest Christmas film ever made.
Possibly the most compelling element to make Elf the quintessential Christmas movie is the strong characters, and the relationships they have. The main character, Buddy, played by Will Ferrell, is a whimsical, happy-go-lucky, naive Christmas elf who lives in the North Pole. After finding out that he was adopted, he comes to New York City to find his real father. This character could have easily come off as obnoxious and annoying. However, it's quite the opposite. Buddy's kind-hearted innocence is what drives the film. His pure, bubbly, Christmas spirit clashes with the real world, which leads to some amazing moments, like when he eats the chewed gum off the rails to the subways. Buddy's father, Walter Hobbs, played by James Caan, is a stuck up, dull, and stern businessman who is the perfect contrast to Buddy's personality. Their interactions are some of the best of the film, because despite being complete opposites, their chemistry works extremely well. The doctor's office scene, for example, displays how different these characters really are. The whole time, Walter is trying to get Buddy to sit still for the doctor, but Buddy's hyper-activeness prevents this.
Jovie, portrayed by Zooey Deschanel, is another character that plays off of Buddy very well. When Buddy comes into the Gimbels store and meets her, she is creeped out at first. This leads to some hilarious situations , like the ""Baby It's Cold Outside"" scene, and the ""I'm in a store and I'm singing"" part. Eventually, Jovie warms up to him, and finds his childlike wonder very charming. (Spoiler), She even marries him in the end!
All of those characters are exceptional in their own way, but Buddy is the main reason why Elf is so amazing. In an article written by The Guardian, authors Dee Cannon and Lyn Gardner state that ""Great acting, like great writing, is often in the eye of the beholder, but audiences almost always know when they are in the presence of something special"" (Cannon and Gardner). When Elf was released in theaters, it was an instant hit, and Buddy captured the hearts of millions. This was due to Will Ferrell's acting, and it was so special that it can't be re-captured.
Another major factor why Elf is the greatest Christmas movie of all time is the stellar humor. I can safely say that there are about one or two jokes that did not land for me. The rest hit, and they hit hard. The key examples include when Buddy screams ""SANTA"" at the top of his lungs when the Gimbels store manager announces that Jolly Ol' Saint Nick will be arriving at 10 A.M., or when Buddy makes his famous candy spaghetti amalgamation. Both the New York and Gimbels montage, the mail room scene, the snowball scene, work clothes Buddy, and the ""Angry Elf"" scene are all so funny that they are impossible to describe. The wonderful aspect about each scene is the variety of comedy that is present. There is slapstick, dialogue, visual, and even subtle adult jokes. The scene that I find the funniest is when Buddy is walking towards the Gimbels store, and gets run over by the taxi. Now, at its core, this movie is about clashing the happy-go-lucky spirit of Christmas with the mundane parts of the real world. Not only does the scene portray that feeling perfectly, but it's also only a couple of seconds long. It starts with an exterior shot of the Gimbels store slowly panning down to the streets, while the song ""Sleigh Ride"" is playing. As the camera pans, we see Buddy walking in the middle of the street to get to the store. Then, the music stops abruptly, as Buddy get smacked by a Taxi, and his entire body shoots up vertically. He quickly gets up and exclaims ""Sorry!"" The scene is perfect because it represents the dichotomy of the film in a short and sweet way. They don't delve on the joke too long, and it is cartoonishly pulled off, which makes it even funnier.
While I have been praising the moments of the movie that everyone knows, there are MANY underrated moments in the movie. Some fantastic examples include when Buddy claims that he got a full 40 minutes of sleep, when Buddy tells his dad that he loves him, and Walter just says ""ok"", and when Buddy lights up every single button in the Empire State Building elevator and claims that ""It looks just like a Christmas Tree!""
Now, the icing on the cake that ensures Elf as the greatest Christmas movie of all time is the wonderful atmosphere presented in the film. This wonderful atmosphere can be traced back to Jon Favreau, who is the director of the film. When regarding Buddy, Jon was quoted with saying ""if I made the world that he was from as though he grew up as an elf in Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, one of those Rankin/Bass Christmas specials I grew up with, then everything fell into place tonally"" (Susman). Jon is one hundred percent right. By making the North Pole setting feel exactly like those old stop motion Christmas specials, it creates a innocent tone. Also, by creating a bustling and mundane New York City environment, the perfect dichotomy of fantasy and reality.
In the wide landscape of Christmas movies, there are a lot of gems. However, all of them pale in comparison to Elf. Elf deserves to be called the best Christmas movie of all time because of its compelling characters, witty humor, and amazing atmosphere. Elf is one of those films that have stood the test of time. It will continue to be enjoyed for generations to come.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Worst Film Ever?  Possibly.,"What did I miss? Well, for starters, I missed the last half of the movie because it was so bad I had to ask TiVo to delete it.This movie was so terrible I assumed that IMDb would be spilling over with bad reviews. Will Farrell was trying so hard, but falling so short. Bob Newhart provided the only 3 laughs in the first 2 minutes of the intro, it was downhill after that.Christmas movies get under my skin anyway, but this one was the worst one. I know I'm just ranting here, but I had to get this off my chest.The scene with Bob Newhart and Will Farrell looking at Santa's sleigh and the rocket boosters was like a comedy lesson that Bob was trying to teach to Will, but to no avail. The student just wasn't getting it.Bob: ""See, Will, uh, comedy is just a matter of, uh, uh, tim-ing!"" Will: ""YA MEAN LIKE THIS! HUH? DO YA? DO YA?"" Bob: ""Uh, no, Will. No, I don't. Hey, let's just forget it, okay?"" The plot just seemed to drudge along like a molasses sandwich. I just couldn't take it anymore. Especially not to see good actors like Bob Newhart, James Caan, Ed Asner get dragged into it. It's not that I hate Will Farrell, I think he's okay, but this movie just stank.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Wonderful Christmas movie!,"There are some Christmas songs that are just right and will be on every Christmas compilation album for 30 years. They'll be played on the radio every year for 30 years and people will listen to them/sing to them/dance to them at their work Christmas parties for 30 years. Well this is that but in a movie. The ingredients are right and like Home Alone, A Miracle on 34th Street and The Santa Clause it will be a long running favourite Christmas movie in my house for......probably 30 years. Why is everything 30 years? I don't know it's just an approximate number.The story follows Buddy the elf who after discovering he's actually a human but was adopted by elves travels to New York to find his real father. He fits in New York like a Terminator would fit in at a tea party, which makes for a lot of the laughs. Of course eventually the film moves on to being heartwarming, touching and even a little exciting. There's even a chance for Buddy to save Christmas before the movie is finished.This is another film where the acting is good allround and as I said earlier it has the right ingredients to make you feel good at Christmas time.

A Wonderful Movie For All Ages,"A Wonderful Movie For All Ages""Elf"" is one of the best holiday movies I have ever seen. It is a hilarious comedy that is great for all ages. The director Jon Favreau did a fantastic job with the plot line, comedy, and casting the roles for this movie. Buddy the elf played by Will Ferrell is really who makes this movie though.For example this movie is about a baby orphan named Buddy(Will Ferrell) who finds his way into Santa's sack on Christmas Eve and is then raised as and elf in the North Pole. As Buddy (Will Ferrel) grows up he realizes he is different from the other elves and Santa finally thinks he is old enough to know he is not an elf and that his real dad lives in New York City. Buddy ( Will Ferrell) then goes on a quest to find his father (James Caan) who does not know he exists, but his elf like qualities don't exactly fit in in New York City. This movie is a great holiday movie with a fun plot line.In addition, to a good plot line this movie also has hilarious comedy. On Buddy's journey to find his dad he is oblivious to everything going on around him. He has this cheerful enthusiastic attitude every where he goes and it makes this movie hilarious and an amazing experience to watch.Although many people may think this is not one of Will Ferrel's best performances, this might be because they are used to his usual roles in more adult type movies. Elf is a great movie for all ages and is especially good for families. When you watch it you can just feel the Christmas spirit surrounding you.Furthermore, I believe the actors that were casted in this movie had the perfect personalities for their roles. They all did a outstanding job and they are what make this movie so good. All of them put a lot of effort into their roles and play them very well.In conclusion, this movie is one of my all time favorite Christmas movies and will be shown on TV for the rest of our lives. I also believe it will become a classic that our kids will watch in the future. This is a need to see Christmas movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Since elves only exist in our ""La-la Land,"" I guess makers of this film wanted to make this a comedies for adults, yet it has ideas that kids love which is one thing- elves. The languages in this movie was appropriate for adults, but it offends young children under 8 years old (you'll have to see the movie in order to find out, because I don't want give ANY examples). If you've gone to the official site for Elf, you'll see that some of the screen shots for this movie is interesting for children, though this movie has some humors that adults can handle. Also, seeing Will Ferrell as a human raised by elves makes me laugh ALL THE TIME. I love to see this movie again.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Elf Script Review (No Spoilers),"The script for Elf the movie was, in my opinion, an amazing read. There was no point during my read that I was not interested and it only kept me wanting to read more. The way Jon Favreau so cleverly put together this fantastic piece of literature was so interesting and hilarious. I might actually have to read this again because I love it so much. I have never read something so intriguing, thrilling, and funny in my fifteen years of being alive. If there would be any piece of literature to recommend it would be the Elf Script because it is, in my opinion, the best. The character development of Buddy the Elf is my favorite aspect because he was funny, quirky, and lovable, he might be one of my favorite characters I've read about. The plot was also enjoyable and the way it was scripted was brilliantly delightful. If there is any way to entertain yourself it would be this fine piece of art, in my opinion, from the read to the movie it is an amazing experience I wish I could forever relive. I strongly encourage you to pick this up and read or even watch it, either way, it's a joyride that I'm sure you won't regret. "" Whoo! That's strong! Must be two percent!""

Fun movie,"In this xmas themed comedy, Will Ferrell plays a man raised as an elf who travels to New York to find his biological father.  As silly as that sounds, this is actualy a pretty funny and amusing film that works because of Ferrell's conviction in the role and some funny bits of stunt casting including James Caan as the daddy, Bob Newhart as head elf and Ed Asner as Santa!  A funny film that the kids will love and you will actualy enjoy. GRADE: B+",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Love This Movie,"This movie is great! It's good-natured, funny, and gives us some Christmas spirit. Elf is set in the present day, so technology is the same as it has always been. It also gives a nice complement to Scripture by showing us that Christmas is not about receiving, but giving. Although it never truly gives a reference to the Bible, it has a good message and is not sending people a wrong one. I highly recommend this movie because it's just downright hilarious! It's become such a classic when Christmas time is around. Everyone should watch this movie because the main character, Buddy, shows us how to be filled with Christmas spirit and how to always want to help others and not just ourselves.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A classic??? Hardly!!,"I watched this for the first time after seeing it high on many 'top Christmas movies' lists. It was pants. Will Ferrell is VERY annoying and the humour is definitely aimed at four year old children. I know many adults think this is hilarious but it really isn't. How this is regarded as a seasonal classic is beyond me and the predictable soppy ending was awful. One or two mildly amusing moments does not make for a classic.
I genuinely prefer the much derided 'Deck The Halls', at least it has funnier moments.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A Good Holiday Film,"Elf, is a fun Christmas film starred by one of the most famous comedians, Will Ferrell. I remember seeing this movie on November 22nd for my dad's birthday after we saw Master and Commander and I was expecting this film to be a very stupid holiday film but it was far from that. It was actually really creative and joyful, just like all Christmas movies should be. This movie really put me into the Christmas cheer and I was very ready for it. I remember posting this comment like 6 months ago but it got deleted and I haven't posted it again since then and so now here I am posting it once again.

Do not waste your time. And do not waste your money. What is your first clue that this is an awful movie. It is about a grown man who thinks he is an elf. Please.

I like to whisper too.,"this was a comedy delight, if not for december but for the holidays. Elf is about a giant human who works in santa's work shop as an elf after being taken accidently in santa's bag. Will Ferrall is really the reason to see this film, i admire his work since SNL and since than, he has done a great job of making everybody wet their pants. Anywho, the film doesn't really concentrate on your average holiday movie, its more of finding the ones you care about. In the case, Elf finds his estrange father (james cann) after leaving the north pole and wants his father to accept him the way he is.Nice comedy, not to stupid or subtle.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Awsome,This movie by far was the greatest movie to laugh outloud with. I went to see this saturday and it was sold out we went to get tickets at 3:45 and had to buy tickets for the 7:15 show. it was packed so we had to sit in the front. i telling you this movie was great. Buddy the Elf is hilarious hes so stupid yet hes so sweet. Having a 6'4 elf is funny. but when he sees his dad for the first time he has no idea that his father in fact thinks he a baffoon. i think everyone should see this you'll laugh out loud.,10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
disappointment,"Will Ferrell was definitely not the usual funny guy he is on SNL.  This movie sucked.  I laughed a couple times, but there were parts that dragged on.  It's not worth going to the movies to see.  I had high expectations but was let down.  The fact that Ferrell doesn't ""wink at the camera"" and actually portrays his character well makes this movie a terrible one.  I gave it a 4/10.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Delightful for the kids and Surreal for the adults,"If it wasn't for the tacked on and plot driven love story this would be the perfect Christmas movie. Farrell is at his absolute best and Buddy is a great comedic figure. There is so much glee and Christmas spirit that comes from Santa's biggest helper that it is hard to not get swept up in the cheesy Christmas laughs, fun and cheer.I just re-watched this today for the first time in over a decade and it struck me how there is a lot of surrealist moments in the film-Leon and the other parodies of the classic Christmas cartoons for example-that make the film really work for older folks. It's not just silly kids stuff, but there is a subversive edge to a lot of it. Notice how Santa was ready to deal with a mugger for example. I had either forgotten or didn't pick up on this quality when I first watched the film.This film just flies by; neither the director nor screenwriter puts too much time into any one joke or gag. Unlike a lot of SNL comedies it doesn't feel like a skit stretch out way to much. It is always amusing. It warms the heart a little bit too. Caan manages to make the climax work despite the weaker writing.This will be added into my Christmas rotation.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Charming, often funny, fantasy Christmas movie.","Papa Elf (Bob Newhart) tells a story about a thirty year old man named Buddy (Will Ferrell), who lived in the North Pole. Buddy is the only human begin living in that area, since Buddy as a baby accidentally crawls on Santa Claus' (Ed Asner) sack. Buddy is raised by Papa Elf, when Buddy finally realized that he is human. Buddy decides to find his real father, who lives in New York City. His father Walter Hobbs (James Caan) is a humorless working business man, who has an family of his own. Since Walter has an wife named Emily (Oscar-Winner:Mary Steenburgen) and their son Michael (Daniel Tray). Buddy finds New York City to be an whole different place, since some of the people, he meets are cold-blooded. Buddy decides to bring Christmas cheer to the New Yorkers, especially his father and make them believe that Santa Claus truly exists. At the same time, Buddy falls in love with a shy department store worker named Jovie (Zooey Deschanel), who has an lovely voice. This is one adventure in the Big Apple that Buddy will never forget.Directed by Jon Farveau (Iron Man 1 & 2, Made, Zathura) made an amusing Christmas movie that is somewhat different and fresh, thanks to a very likable performance by Farrell. Which Farrell is absolutely charming and child-like in his role. Deschanel is lovely in her role as Buddy's love interest. This movie has some very funny vignettes and an strong cast in the supporting roles. Caan does his best in a underwritten role. Asner and Newhart has some moments in their scene-stealing roles. Peter Dinklage has one of the funnier moments with Farrell is the biggest laugh of the movie.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer (Also in Pan and Scan) and an good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. The Single Disc DVD, the only special feature is the original theatrical trailer. ""Elf"" is certainly one of those movies will play during the Christmas holidays. ""Elf"" isn't a perfect picture, it has some flaws. But it is Farrell's amusing performance gives the heart in the right place, which it will delights kids and adults. ""Elf"" is a very good movie to watch, especially during Christmas.

"One of the Sweetest and Most Entertaining Christmas Movies around,","Elf is a fantastic movie with a very well written plot and a great comedic cast. It's a film that I always insist on watching at Christmas time, because it's just so much fun, I never get tired of it. The humour remains constant throughout while still managing to be sweet and very charming.The only thing I ever felt was missing from Elf was more tension between Buddy and Jovie's relationship. It's too perfect, when they meet up there is a bit of conflict, but shortly after that they have no real issues, they should have made them split and convince the audience that they were not getting back together, so that it would feel more fulfilling once they did.The performances in this film are outstanding and everyone suits their roles perfectly, whether it be James Caan as a business executive who struggles with the responsibilities of being a father, Zooey Deschanel as a complicated girl who is confused with the idea of falling in love, Bob Newhart as the father of all the elves, or Edward Asner as Father Christmas himself. Everyone plays a character that suits them and their own characteristics or personalities perfectly. The highlight of the movie is of course Will Ferrell, he is funny, charming and very lovable, though the movie may not be that old, Ferrell's performance as Buddy the Elf is already iconic, we can relate to him on several occasions, whether it be his sense of optimism, trying to find the good in everyone, or even just his love for Christmas, there are several aspects that make him one of the most beloved characters of any Christmas movie, and Ferrell is to thank for most of that.Sweet, heartwarming and very, very funny, Elf is a perfect film to watch at Christmas time that the whole family will enjoy.When Buddy, a human raised by elves in the North Pole, learns that his real father lives in New York, he heads off to find him.Best Performance: Will Ferrell",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Not quite a classic,but worth the watch all the same.","Buddy the Elf(Will FArrell,still not yet a star at this point)has never truly been an elf. But raised from infancy in the North POle and knowing nothing other than the Elf lifestyle,he is as true a helper to old St.Nick as any of the other workers that are. At full adulthood and finally starting to realize that he's not like the others back home,he sets out for New York City to find his true family,mostly his father(JAmes Caan),now a Department store exec. I suspect that one need only see the trailers to figure that when Buddy finds his true father,a host of blissfully nutty events ensues.No surprises in this film,from the hi-jinx promised to the obligatory romance for BUddy,personned in this case by a bored but decent department store worker(Zooey Deschenal,neither too sweet nor too sour). The casting is so letter perfect it seems almost brainless:Bob Newhart as Buddy's adoptive father,Ed Asner as Santa Claus,MAry Steenburgen as Caan's understanding wife,Andy Richter and Kyle Gass as Caan's underlings,Amy Sedaris as Caan's sweet secretary and Peter Dinklage as a very un-elf-life storybook author who looks like he could be a perfect ringer for one of Kris Kringle's workers. Director Jon FAvreau's movie moves as easily as any,and while I personally wouldn't call this a ""new classic""(though it would still seem like MIracle on 34th Street compared with another holiday themed film that came out around that time,Bad Santa)in Yule flicks,this makes for perfectly fine holiday themed entertainment.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great Christmas Movie!,"Elf is one of the better Christmas movie I have seen. The only movies associated with Christmas that are better than this are the first two Home Alone movies. This is nothing Oscar-worthy but it is a feel-good holiday film. I think Will Ferrell is an mediocre actor at best but I feel this is his best role.This is about a human who was raised in the Arctic by Santa and the elves. When he is thirty, he ventures out to find his real dad. Unfortunately for Buddy, his dad seems to have no interest in having him as a son.The acting is pretty good. I mentioned Ferrell before and I am surprised on how I actually liked him. The older guys like James Caan, Edward Asner, and Bob Newhart were wonderfully cast.Overall, this is a fantastic Christmas tale. It's definitely the best one this century so far.

Hateful, foul-mouthed Rosie O'Donnell playing Mother Theresa?I could not believe this mindless garbage got so many good reviews. SCARY. Then again, it explains a lot.Since Hollyweirdos always bleat endlessly about helping the needy and the indigent, I suggest that, instead of enriching themselves making rubbish like this they invest the money in feeding and clothing poor people in 3rd world countries.

"Great concept, poor delivery","Saw a preview showing and have to say that I was disappointed in the final product.""Elf"" is the story of Buddy (Will Farrell), who grows up at the North Pole after Santa finds him in his bag of toys after returning from another Christmas Eve. Buddy is raised as any other elf, but his human size starts to make life difficult. So off he goes to find his human father, played by James Caan. He soon finds that his real father already has a son that gets no attention.The story concept is interesting enough, and for that reason the first 15 minutes (which show the back story up through Will Farrell's departing the North Pole) are fairly entertaining. The jokes about Buddy's size are not overplayed as they could have been. There's an effective scene that involves Buddy and jack-in-the-boxes that was understatedly funny.Then, it all goes downhill. Farrell is effective as Buddy, doing a pretty good fish-out-of-water job in NYC. But a lot of the jokes that could have gone into the story seem left out. He seems to adjust way to quickly to his surroundings.Things get a little better as Buddy discovers love, both for the opposite sex and for his long, lost father. But again it seems like the director misses what he was aiming for. There are a lot of missed opportunities to flush out James Caan's relationship with his young son. Instead we are quickly shown the distance between them, with very little else to go on.The ending sequence is totally off the mark. The idea that Central Park would be deserted seems downright impossible, yet the movie progresses as if it's a real possibility.In the end, the movie just doesn't deliver an its hilarious possibility.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Elf provides gigantic laughs!,"""Elf"" is a movie about a big guy in a green suit that made some big green and made other filmmakers green with envy. Speaking of ""Made"", ""Elf"" was directed by Jon Favreau; the star & director of ""Made"" and star & writer of ""Swingers"". With the blockbuster status of ""Elf"", Favs is evolving into one of the superlative comedic directors of our generation. The star of ""Elf"" is not doing too shabby himself. And why not! He is probably the funniest entertainer working in show business. I am not ""toying"" with you! Of course, I am referring to Will Ferrell. His performance as Buddy, the lanky nitwit raised by elves who is now on a quest to find & bond with his biological father, was the paramount laugh riot work of 2003. It had me in stitches! (This way the elves could put me back together.) Another impressive showstopper was Zooey Deschanel as Jovie, the toy store employee who becomes Buddy's fem buddy. Deschanel is an actress on the up-rise who is definitely not on the bad acting ""naughty list""; even though this hot blonde could be naughty to me anytime. ""Elf"" also contains the best comedy scene of 2003; the corporate meeting scene when Buddy mistakes a surly publication executive giant (wonderfully played by dwarf actor Peter Dinklage) for an elf is honest to say as absolute comedic mastery. ""Elf"" is ""boy toy"" heaven at its best; I hope that was not taken in a certain context. ***** Excellent",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Thought I'd groan - but I guffawed instead!,"I have to say, the negative comments for this movie are out of line - way out of line. Especially since, based on the promos, I expected them to be right on the money. If I'd read those reviews before seeing the movie, I never would have gone to see it. Hold on - that's exactly what happened until now.Am I glad a local theater was having a free screening for kiddies and my six-year-old dragged me to see it. I have not seen a movie that provided so many belly laughs in years. I will now go buy the DVD.I am a newly converted Will Farrell fan, surprised to find myself saying so. Elf was jam-packed with subtle (sometimes even cerebral) humor I hadn't expected. I braced myself for the typical sophomoric toilet humor mixed with not-so-thinly-veiled sexual innuendo which seems to pass for comedy lately. Imagine my thrill to find the lowest comedy in this film to be an unimaginably long belch followed by a line that even drew a ""HA!"" from prissy me.OK, the reference to the short-statured man as an elf was pretty predictable, and in my opinion not terribly funny. But along with the eating of gross things, it apparently was there to toss a bone to those whose idea of humor might not have developed at the same rate as their physiques, and it certainly didn't cross the line the way some ""family films"" have.If you are a parent or family-oriented person who is looking for a wholesome good time with a fun Christmas message to get you in the spirit, this is a must-have for your video collection.If you are a would-be ""artiste"" or pseudo-intellectual who considers Spielberg a ""hack"", or if you prefer the frat-boy humor of lighting farts, and jokes about bodily functions, this is definitely not the show for you. You'll only relate to about 1/8 of the humor, and those parts are really intended for the younger audience. Also, you won't find sex, drugs or deep relationship twists. They managed to leave out angst and ""life sucks"" issues and don't even try to give any kind of ""film noir"" feel to a single scene. Nobody dies, and the only people who take themselves too seriously are the bad guys. There is a brief moment of ""violence"" in the toy store spat, but it really won't stack up to ""The Matrix"".So use your common sense. This is a feel-good Christmas comedy, rated G for the whole family. If you want something dark and gritty, or something with inane low-brow humor, watch something else. Why would you watch a G-rated Christmas movie and expect anything other than light-hearted, somewhat predictable fun with a happy ending? This film goes the extra mile with Farrell avoiding the trap of overacting, and balancing his right-on-without-quite-going-over-the-top character with the understated, inarguable talents of the rest of the cast. This is combined with special effects that are so well executed they go almost unnoticed (rather than slapping you in the face, they quietly contribute to the story, adding to the atmosphere rather than taking over the scenes).PS: I never thought I'd buy ""Lou Grant"" as Santa, but Ho-Ho-Ho-Boy was I wrong! -- OOPS. Too Punny; not funny. Trust me, the writers of Elf were much more skilled in their scripting!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Great Movie For The Family,"The main character of Elf is the hilarious Will Ferrell who plays the part of an elf that has traveled down to New York City, from the North Pole to find his dad.

Everyone finds Buddy as a joke, including his own father, because of his childish behavior and remarks, because he is a full grown man. Examples of this behavior are brought out by his elf outfit that he wears every day and how he constantly talks to almost everyone about personally knowing Santa. This is a great movie for all different age groups and not only a movie that should be watched during the Christmas season.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A Hilarious and Funny Christmas Movie! it's worth watching in 2019.,Elf was so funny i laughed so good at this movie Will Ferrell plays the character and He really did so great. and he made Miles mad and cracked him in that part when he was bothering his dad. and the loved the part when He said to Everyone and kids Santa was fake! LoL! I mean gosh I loved this movie besides the Other classic Christmas movie Home Alone.

Terrible!!!!,"The film offered so much promise, although it doesn't deliver.  The film offers nothing to anyone above ten years old.

Simply the best Christmas movie that I have ever seen.,"I gave Elf a 10 and I'm 48 years old.  I gave it a ten for the fact that it is the best movie in it's genre that I have ever seen. Although ""A Christmas Story"" and the old Alistair Sims ""A Christmas Carol"" are two other terrific holiday movies, most Christmas flicks are fairly weak.  I guess I must have been in the right mood to like this movie so much but everything worked so well in a film where everything had the potential to really suck.   Will Farrel is the major reason behind the success of this movie.  I could not imagine another actor being able to pull the character off.  Enough said. Go see it with your whole family.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Jolly old fun,"Surprisingly, ""Elf"" caught my attention. And in a very good way; Will Ferrell was very funny. The whole story just makes you feel good inside and makes you want to believe in Santa. Kinda crazy, I know. But seriously, I loved this movie. The acting is above average because it is just a feel good movie. So, I wouldn't say take it seriously and just have fun. I think that this movie might even go in with the holiday classics. It brought me back to the days of the grinch and a Christmas Story. Yeah, the story is a little cheesy, but it keeps your Christmas spirit going. So, I would highly recommend watching this around the holidays with your family. It's very funny and lovable.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
What is the personality of an Elf?,"Very silly.  Very funny.  A laugh riot much of the time.  However, it seemed to me that Santa and ALL of the real elves at the North Pole had normal serious personalities.  It was ONLY Buddy the human ""elf"" that had a five-year-old's personality.  So, what is the true personality of an elf? Sadly, this movie cannot offer a clear answer.I don't think it is possible for Ed Asner to be a warm cheerful believable Santa.  Tim Allen has the range to hit the warm fuzzy Santa notes.One other point, some people here seem confused about Buddy being a slow worker at the North pole, and a fast worker in New York.  The explanation for this is that Buddy is slow only if compared to real elves.  Compared to humans, Buddy's elf training makes him seem to have superior skills and abilities.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Don't be a Cotton Headed Ninny Muggins, go watch Elf","I rarely leave reviews TBH, but I've just seen the rating for Elf on IMDb and felt that I need to do my bit to get this a higher rating.
This is possibly the best Christmas movie made since the turn of the millennium. It is very well cast and Will Ferrell, in what I think was his first lead role, is sublime as the innocent man-child, raised by Elves. It is such an eminently quotable film (son of a nutcracker), sweet natured and has a lovely, underlying message that makes it perfect viewing over the festive season.
It has firmly become part of our annual Christmas routine now; put the tree and decorations up and then settle down and watch Elf. John Faverau is clearly a very accomplished director as his back catalogue is extremely diverse from kick starting the MEU with Iron Man, revitalising the Star Wars franchise with The Mandalorian to something as warm and fuzzy as this. I dare anyone to watch this and not be completely sucked into its welcome
lack of self consciousness.

But those are movies that I watch every single year and this year I wanted to do something different. So I Googled ""best christmas movies ever"" and Elf showed up. Reviews were amazing, trailer looked okay and it seemed like a enjoyable comedy. I could not believe it took me so long to find it, but I am not from USA and I guess that movie is not really big in our country. Anyway I watched it, but never finished. It did not find it sweet, cute or even funny. All right maybe little kids find it funny but for anyone over the age 10...

Enjoyable Christmas movie for the whole family,"This movie is all about the Christmas spirit, the fantasy genre in these kind of movies. I've seen this movie multiple times as a kid, now it was the first time as an adult. It's a really funny and enjoyable movie but childish in a good way, the nostalgia made this a lot better movie than it truly is. Will Ferrell does a great job with portraying it in a funny and an overall enjoyable way, catching the kid spirit. The soundtrack for the movie was perfect, using a lot of well known Christmas songs. CGI was actually decent and the stop motion animation they used on Christmas land had a charm, more fantasy and light hearted. The story was in a way original but also the same old Christmas story that have been told many times throughout the years. It works perfectly though with what it is supposed to be, a Christmas movie for the family that will make you have a wonderful time.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Best Christmas film,"This is definitely my favourite Christmas ever and the funniest, I've seen a trend with famous Chrismas films. Most of them are comedies.I love Will Ferrel in this he is the best performance in the whole film and is hilarious. Whenever it's Christmas we always watch this, the Jim Carrey Grinch and Home Alone 1&2.It also has a very strong plot for a film like this, which isn't overwhelmed by the jokes.I would give this a 9/10. My favourite film to watch at Christmas time and an hilarious film with some of the best and iconic scenes in a comedy ever. Love every bit. Why do these reviews have to be so long??? I was ready to end it after I mentioned the best and iconic scenes part.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Christmas movie that doesn't suck!   (***1/2),"Good Christmas movies are a rare find, great Christmas movies even more rare. At this point, I wouldn't yet count ""Elf"" among my very favorite Christmas movies, like ""A Christmas Story"", ""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation"" or ""Ernest Saves Christmas"" (that's right, I said ""Ernest Saves Christmas""), but I really loved it, and I think that it may join those other movies once it ages a bit. It really is that good.Will Ferrell is definitely an acquired taste, but it's hard to imagine anyone who wouldn't be amused and delighted by his very enjoyable performance as Buddy, a human who was raised by elves in the North Pole after he crawled into Santa's toy bag as a baby.Thirty-or-so years later, when Buddy has outgrown his elf surroundings, Papa Elf (a droll Bob Newhart) suggests he go to New York City to find his real father (James Caan).Naturally, there are no big curveballs thrown at the audience. There are lots of fish-out-of-water jokes, an innocent romance with a co-worker (Zooey Deschanel, who is great and looks much better with blonde hair than I expected), and a heartwarming ending, as expected. But this isn't the kind of movie that needs to be extra-original, and it more than makes up for its lack of originality with huge amounts of heart and charm.Having a pro actor/filmmaker like Jon Favreau directing (and not just some hack) is also definitely a plus. He gives a formulaic Christmas movie style and feeling, filling the soundtrack with lots of big band jazz and assembling a great supporting cast that also includes Mary Steenburgen, Faizon Love, Peter Dinklage, Andy Richter and KG! (Tenacious D fans will know who I'm talking about)All in all, this is a very fun, very pure movie that I heartily recommend to anyone who, like me, thinks that most Christmas movies suck. This is the real deal, and I know that because it made me feel like a kid again.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Shockingly good!,"So a few weeks ago my 20-something-year-old male friend mentioned how much he wanted to see this new movie Elf that was coming out and starring Will Ferrell.Immediately I cringe inwardly, but nod my head and mention that I vaguely recall seeing something about that film on TV somewhere. Wasn't James Caan in it too? Hmm. Maybe it could be good. Heh.. maybe.A little over a week later and this said friend is giving me a call. We decide to make plans for Friday, but why go out to eat again? After a few seconds of mentally listing the pros and cons of it, I just say it. I say, ""Didn't Elf come out today? Why don't we go see it since I know you want to."" A few hours later as we walk into the theatre, I'm praying that this movie will at the very least have more entertainment value than From Justin to Kelly. See? Not much in the expectations department.Okay, so to get to the point of all this.. GO SEE THIS MOVIE. It's slightly childish, slightly unbelievable, and very, very funny. I fell in love with it, and I cannot wait to be able to add it to my collection of DVDs so that I can pull it out every year around Christmas and get myself in the mood to start buying strands upon strands of Christmas lights.Will Ferrell is right at home as he prances across the screen in tights, picks used gum off railings in New York City, bounces across beds in department stores, and naively assumes midgets are elves. This film pays homage to other Christmas classics, it miraculously has a decent plot to it that, while cheesy, is cheesy in a very good way.In all honesty, I'm kind of hoping at least one of my other 20-something-year-old friends is interested in seeing this movie.

Its definitely the best movie of 2003. Also people say that ELF is the dumbest movie, but what comedy is supposed to be serious??? If you one of the many people who actually enjoyed the movie and Will Ferrill, it was probably because of the same reason i did.If you one of the many people who actually enjoyed the movie and Will Ferrill, it was probably because of the same reason i did.

ha ha ha ho ho ho yuk yuk yuk,"When an SNL movie comes out, I always worry that it's going to have a few ""good bits"" in it but struggle as far as genuine narrative is concerned. Take ""LADIES MAN,"" for instance. ""ELF"", on the other hand, rocked. It's both genuinely funny and sweet. It does have two problems, however. I think if they had a second chance to do this movie, they would get rid of the ""gross bits""--the long Coca-Cola burp, the drunken mailrroom romp, the eating of used chewing gum--and play up the elfin stuff like the snowgunslingering, the bond between brothers, the Elf's really sweet tooth, his sweet infantile love for his father, and give us more of Bob Newhart's very touching Papa Elf. The second problem is the very weak, overly theatrical nonsense at the end with Santa's sleigh and the singing (off-key!)in the park. I know they needed to somehow conclude the movie, but that ending was childish--I think they lost the adults in the audience on that one. On the whole it is still a movie I watch every chance I get--I just shut it off right before the end.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The Moose Hole - Review of Elf,"Christmas seems to be arriving earlier every year. Halloween and Thanksgiving are now the forgotten holidays as stores and businesses strum up garland and other holiday decorations in order to prepare for the hopefully fruitful shopping season ahead. The movie industry must be thinking the same thing starting this year especially after the success of last year's The Santa Clause 2, which opened the first weekend of November to nearly $30 million. New Line offers up their pre-holiday treat entitled Elf, which features the former Saturday Night Live comedian Will Ferrell, who has recently become a new rising star in Hollywood. After the dismal first half of the year with flops like A Man Apart and The Real Cancun, the studio bounced back in the second half with Freddy vs. Jason, Secondhand Lions, and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and hopes to continue the trend until their mega-success The Return of the King opens near Christmas. Can Elf do that? If it's anything like The Santa Clause 2, it easily could but the Ferrell's comedy faces a lot more competition then Allen's did. Not only does the film open up against The Matrix Revolutions, the yuletide feature goes head to head with the highly publicized The Cat in the Hat and Disney's The Haunted Mansion later this month. Until then the film will have to build up pretty good word of mouth for it to still hear cash registers ringing come Christmas Day, let alone Thanksgiving.The story focuses a larger then usual elf who learns he is actually a human and travels to New York City to find his father. Up at the North Pole, elves are busy getting ready for Christmas but there is one elf that is learning that he doesn't quite fit in. Buddy is not the typical elf, his large size being the biggest factor. He eventually finds out from his adoptive father that he is actually a human that as an orphan baby climbed into Santa's gift bag one Christmas Eve and found his way to Santa's Workshop. After learning his true origin, Buddy travels to New York City to meet his father and be part of a real family. But this is easier said then done as his father is a real Scrooge and is prominently found on the naughty list. Buddy, who has never been to the human world, is unfamiliar with many of the things we are accustomed to like revolving doors and food products that don't include sugar. The unusually happy elf must find a way to change his father's workaholic attitude and help his new family find the true Christmas spirit. The story for Elf, though on the predictable side especially as the feature starts to wind down, works surprisingly well. This happens mostly in part to Ferrell's performance but there are also plenty of moments that come off as hilarious even without the lead starsThough the feature doesn't have an exceptionally large cast, the film doesn't have to with some lead characters picking up any slack left over by that. Will Ferrell, who was featured earlier this year in the hit comedy Old School, once again proves he has as much comedic timing and talent as he ever did on Saturday Night Live and probably even more so. Ferrell is able to make Buddy the elf both lovable and hilarious without pushing the personality of the character too far as to make him annoying and pathetic. James Caan, who takes on the role of Buddy's real father, has the grizzly workaholic business man down pat. The only problem lied not with Caan's performance but the character itself in how quickly the character changed his attitude at the end without really having a change-of-heart experience. And a big highlight came from the performance of legendary comedian Bob Newhart as Buddy's adoptive father. Newhart looks like he had a lot of fun with this role and gives a delightful performance that many will remember despite being only a supporting character rather then a lead.Overall, Elf joins the ranks of such holiday features as The Santa Clause and Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas that shows Hollywood is still able to make a yuletide classic as good as the old days. It's the wonderful atmosphere and Will Ferrell's exuberant performance that makes this film a delightful treat for the whole family can enjoy without one member of the family being alienated by certain material. There are relatively few complaints that can be made about comedy. The only one that is prominent in most minds would be that film tends to be bit predictable at the end of the feature but the filmmakers pull it off so well that many write it off and they should. The slightly-predictable ending shouldn't ruin the overall amusement and delightfulness that the rest of the film presented up to that point. Ferrell's over-the-top performance should be a decisive enough reason to venture to the local movie theater and see Elf but if you are not truly convinced, here may be a better reason: Elf will keep the children busy for an hour and a half while the parents do their Christmas shopping. Smart, huh?!My Rating: **** ¬Ω out of 5 (Grade: A-)",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Christmas, baby, Christmas","Greetings again from the darkness.  Director Jon Favreau (the greatness of ""Swingers"", also the doctor in ""Elf"") provides the seasons first touch of holiday spirit.  Will Ferrell is perfect as the wanna-be/thought-I-was six foot three elf.  This film works because it has a nice little story (actually a couple of them) that provide the framework for some classic comedy scenes.  The VERY attractive and talented Zooey Deschanel (""the Good Girl"" ""Mumford"") is very good as Buddy's co-worker and friend.  I am looking forward to seeing just how good of an actress she will become.  She has the look to play a love interest or the bad guy/girl role.  A wonderful supporting cast helps make this one work.  James Caan as the Scrooge character and Ed Asner as Santa are both perfect, as is Bob Newhart as Ferrell's adopted elf father.  The key role of Caan's son/Ferrell's brother Michael is played well by Daniel Tay (played Harvey Pekar as a kid in one of this year's best films ""American Splendor"").  Also nice to see Peter Dinklage (from another of this year's best films ""The Station Agent"") in a bizarre, yet brief role as an angry, children's writer for hire.  This is definitely one you can take the whole family to.  There were kids in the audience from ages 2 to 80.  Go with the Christmas spirit, as this is not Shakespeare!",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"I laughed, I cried ...","As an absolute non-fan of Will Ferrell's comedy, I was dragged kicking and screaming to this movie, so my enjoyment of it came as a huge surprise.

There were some very funny bits, but my greatest delight came from James Caan as the straight man in this script -- after I saw him a completely phoned-in goon in ""Mickey Blue Eyes"" a few years ago, I never wanted to see him again, but he was terrific in ""Elf"".

This ELF will go far!,"After seeing it's main star was Will Farrel and some trailers on TV. i had preconceived notion that this movie is just going to be another horrible comedy like they all have been lately. But, then i read the reviews and they were positive saying the movie was actually good. so i thought we should give it a chance, and we decided to go see it sunday afternoon. So, my conclusion is that this movie exceeded all my expectations and was one of the funniest movies i've seen in a long, long time! ""Elf"" was hilariuos...so hilarious i was shedding tears, and i'll have to say that the whole theatre agreed as they were rolling out of their seats. The movie was such a breathe of fresh air from all the other lude and crude comedies that have been coming out of hollywood the past couple of years. Will was perfect as the dimwitted elf, and James Caan as the selfish anti- Christmas father was also.

I was surprised,"Will Ferrell seems like he will dive off the deep end of a 3 foot pool just to get a laugh. And, this was no exception. And I have to admit, I was laughing almost the entire time.Will just can't make a typical family movie. He injects not only humor, but humor that makes you cry when you watch.

I don't normally like this kind of movie but Elf won me over,"The concept made me yawn. I knew what was going to happen before I even saw it. I decided it would be stupid, boring family tripe. But I was 100% wrong.Yes, Elf is predictable-workaholic father who realizes his work has taken away from yadda yadda yadda. BORING. But Elf does it with a wit and spark few movies have. It was syrupy sweet-something I'd usually despite-yet it won me over with fast paced humor, energetic performances, and a script that was lovingly written.The casting is perfect, but the script deserved the praise-the level of humor and heart is surprising. Give this movie a shot-you might be amazed at what thoughtful writing can do!***1/2 out of ****",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Didn't make me change my mind about Will Ferrell,"This movie is often showcased as a ""good"" Will Ferrell movie. Well it didn't make me change my mind about him. He is surely a polarising comedian. If you like him, you'll probably like this movie. If you find him unfunny and cringy as I do, well this movie is just more of the same, except in new york, at christmas.Seeing how old this movie is and how successful it got, I guess it is the birthplace of Wills schtick that he then exploited in a bunch of movies to come. He plays a juvenile, loud obnoxious person with a complete lack of empathy or ability to read the room. If you don't like Will Ferrells sense of humor, avoid this movie as it is not any different. I guess, watch the Anchorman instead, that one I could stomach and even found pretty funny.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A holiday holiday,"""Elf"" was yet another Will Ferrel film that I thought from previews was just going to be silly and stupid.I've learned by now to get over my prejudices going into ""Silly and Stupid"" Will Ferrel films. They almost all are that. But somehow they are also funny, and tell stories with more depth than I would ever have imagined. By the way, the same phenomena happens with me regarding Adam Sandler movies. I always think they sound horrible, and I always have far more than my average share of laughs for a comedy.In Elf, its unimaginable that an actor of Ferrel's age can bring off the complete naivety required for a human raised at the North Pole who enters American society as an adult. Yet he brings it off the same way be brings off all of his unlikely sounding roles.Of course, in the process the people he interacts with learn that a little naivety and purity of heart can be a good thing. Yes, there is both slapstick and (mild) gross out comedy, but overall this is a quite entertaining movie, and a suitable Christmas comedy for kids and parents to watch together.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Great Family Christmas Movie for ALL ages,"I love this movie. Now, I am one of the stereotypical snooty film majors who tend to sneer at most Hollywood fare, let alone seasonal movies (Santa Claus 3 anyone?). However, this movie is hilarious and touching at the same time.I received this two years ago for Christmas and proceeded to watch it with my teenage siblings, my middle-age parents and my elder grandparents. All of us enjoyed the movie (even the teenagers, who are very fickle, let me tell you). How great is a movie that can bring together the whole family, on their own free will? Will Ferrel is a comic genius. I love his mannerisms and his style of comedy. I was skeptical about this movie at first, because I wasn't sure how anyone could pull off a Christmas movie and make it sensational. BUT THEY DID! I have even enjoyed this with my fellow peers in college (we made a drinking game to it¬óevery time you see a Christmas tree...drink!....yea, i know, we're college students, so sue us).I just wanted to convey that this movie is enjoyable by any age. I own it, I watch it every year and I never get sick of Ferrel's zany comic routines.WATCH IT!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Second is that it was summer and close to 10 years since this movie came out. And all the kids loved it.So do we! We quote it between us often, especially the classic scene with Peter Dinklage.

Brand New Christmas Staple,"""Elf"" from actor/director Jon Favreau is a delightful holiday movie which benefits greatly from a strong comedic performance from Will Ferrell in his first solo lead role.An orphaned baby on Christmas Eve crawls into Santa's sack without his knowledge and is taken to the North Pole. When discovered it is decided that the toddler will stay and be raised as an elf but as the years pass he realizes that he is different from everyone else and sets out to find his biological father who works as a children's book publisher in New York. And then as they say the fun begins.The humor is not aimed squarely at children which makes it the perfect family comedy and not at any moment does Favreau play down to a younger audience.Ferrell is the perfect choice for the title role. He's not over the top like Jim Carrey or smug like Mike Myers. He brings a childlike innocence to the movie but never delves into the juvenile.The production design in the North Pole sequences are quite schizophrenic with differing styles but somehow it all gels together due to familiarity. Familiarity is the key to this movie. It's a completely new story but with characters, settings and situations you know from years of watching Christmas movies and holiday specials.My bet is that ""Elf"" will also become a Christmas staple much like ""It's A Wonderful Life"" and ""Home Alone"". You'll look forward to seeing it again and again in the future at year's end.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Overrated,"Cloying, annoying, and insulting. But great if you are a) eight years old b) born in 1955 or so c) male.Every character is predictable and simplistic. Obvious NYC jokes that no one else would understand - and for that matter, every joke is obvious, and obviously written by a 35-year old White Guy (tm). Ugh.Not really sure what I was supposed to do with this movie-it's not satire, it's not comedy. It's more like a kids' book for adults that you are supposed to watch when totally stoned. Avoid it if you have half a brain or don't want to be hit with sexist, simplistic and stupid jokes. No. Just No.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I feel that no matter how many times you watch Elf, it never grows old. It's decorations in the city of New York along with the location of the film were attention grabbing. Its US Box Office profit was at $173,381,405. I predicted that Elf would have been more successful that 205th on the list. It has Will Ferrell in it, who is a very well known actor; which makes it all the more surprising.

Pretty darn good!,"This movie was really very funny. The beginning scenes, with Will Ferrell living in the North Pole with other elves, was a bit corny, and I was wondering where exactly this movie was going. Fortunately, it went in exactly the right direction, and it had some fantastic comedic moments. Ferrell is hilarious as a hyper, super-polite elf who has no idea how to act in the human world. He is fascinated by glowing elevator buttons, terrified by an escalator, amazed at the size of human toilets, and basically awed by everything that normal people take for granted. The supporting characters are good too (especially Bob Newhart, who delivers all the goofy narration with a deadpan straight face), but Ferrell steals the show. He is a riot.I truly believe this movie could become a classic Christmas film. I could not help but like it, even though it was a little on the hokey side. I highly recommend it if you're looking for a fast, funny movie that anyone can enjoy. I give ""ELF"" 8 out 10 stars. Now, go see it.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Wonderful movie,"*""Elf""* (2003), directed by Jon Favreau and starring Will Ferrell, is a heartwarming holiday comedy that has become a modern Christmas classic. Ferrell plays Buddy, a human raised by elves at the North Pole who sets out to find his real father in New York City. The film blends slapstick humor with genuine sentiment, making it both funny and uplifting. Ferrell's performance is full of infectious energy and charm, making Buddy's naivety endearing rather than annoying.The movie's success is also due to its memorable supporting cast, including James Caan as Buddy's skeptical father, and Zooey Deschanel as a kind-hearted department store worker. The colorful, whimsical set designs and festive soundtrack contribute to its overall Christmas spirit, making it a perfect holiday watch. While some may find its humor a bit too goofy at times, *Elf* remains a beloved film that emphasizes the importance of family, kindness, and holiday cheer.Overall, *Elf* is a delightful, feel-good movie that appeals to both children and adults, offering laughs, warmth, and a festive spirit.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Buddy is completely obnoxious, the movie loses all ""joke"" and ""fun"" the minute you grow past the age of 5. No way people find this funny. Action? Not really. Romance? If you hate yourself, maybe.

The people who made this defective Hallmark DisneyXD lovechild are burnt pieces of toast, and if you think this is your favorite Christmas movie, you also have the humor and comprehension of a burnt piece of toast. Plot is not made well. It looks like there was effort, but that effort should've been put in by real people and not cats on keyboards. If this is what people can write off as silly movie, though, maybe the cats on keyboards would do better. It's completely unwitty and contains 0 holiday joy.

The story follows an orphaned human boy raised by elves at the North Pole.

The backstory is beautifully narrated by Bob Newhart, who shines as the father figure and narrator. James Caan is perfectly cast as the grumpy ""villain,"" delivering dry, annoyed reactions with precision. The Peter Dinklage sequence remains one of the most memorable moments in the film.The costumes, sets, and overall aesthetic immerse you completely in the whimsical world of Elf, and the budding love story adds a charming touch.

"The first truly great Christmas film since ""A Christmas Story""","Of course, ""A Christmas Story"" is in a class by itself, as it's one of the best films ever made about growing up in America - not just a holiday flick. ""Elf"" is a more typical Christmas movie, just an unbelievably good one. I pity any other Christmas movies coming out this year; they will suck almost by default after this.The secret, I think, are director Jon Favreau's smart choices. He keeps Will Farrell and James Caan in character 101% of the time - he never allows them to comment on their characters in any way. Both play it absolutely straight and it works like a charm. Favreau also deserves some Golden Genius Award for casting Ed Asner as Santa and Bob Newhart - one of our national treasures - as Farrell's adopted Papa Elf. Both are priceless and will be long remembered for this movie.Favreau's other smart choice is to keep the length of most scenes very short; he gets in, gets the laugh and gets out. It's very easy for this type of movie to become embarrassing or even cruel for the ""special"" character at the center. Favreau knows this and never lets a scene drag on long enough for our amusement to turn to pity.As a film in general, ""Elf"" isn't important enough to rate more than a 7 or 8, but as a Christmas movie, it's a 10+.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
So funny,"Watch ""Elf"" a few times and it instantly becomes a favorite Christmas movie. At least it did for me. Nearly everything about this film is funny. An Elf (Will Ferrel) leaving the North Pole to find his real father (James Caan) is just the setup for this film. From there to the end it's straight laughs. So many great gags are formed by Ferrel's ignorance to the real world and other peoples' reactions to him. It's fast-paced and very funny. Some minor drawbacks include some gross sequences with Buddy the Elf overindulging in sweets in unappetizing ways, as well as an unnecessary scene in which he gets into a fight with a midget-sized famous author with a temper. Aside from that, it's one of the most enjoyable films I've seen in quite some time. I've seen it at least four times, and it's still just as funny. Not only is Will Ferrel well-cast for his role, but it's also great to see older stars such as James Caan and Bob Newhart make a comeback for this back. Watch it next Christmas or you'll miss out on an annual treat that is very charming and fun. Great for the whole family, and for just about anyone.***1/2 out of ****",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The evolution of Christmas Movies,"""Elf"" has made such an impression - from Will Ferrel's rollicking brand of humor to Jon Favreau's excellent work behind the scenes - that it will hopefully reignite a genre that includes movies that have become staples - the kind of films that you have to watch year after year.From ""It's a Wonderful Life"" to ""A Christmas Story"" and now to ""Elf"" the mantle has been tossed. Annual viewings will be a must.Incorporating elements from the stop motion christmas specials of our youths, paying homage to George Bailey's contemplative bridge scene -- and even employing little Ralphie as an Elf - all master works of some genius powers that be.We won't even discuss the movie version of ""The Grinch"", but how about allowing Jim Carrey to redeem himself starring as George Bailey in a remake of ""It's a Wonderful Life""? The Donna Reed part would be fittingly played by Reese Witherspoon. I realize it's treading on sacred ground here to even consider recasting the movie, but why not?It would be great to see a resurgence in well done holiday movies, perhaps even claymation specials, and I don't mean cheesy sequels like ""Rudolph's Shiny New Year""...where are the great stories and writers out there? Where are the people with the imagination?

The story then fast forwards 20 years or so and Buddy leaves the North Pole and travels to New York to find his real Dad (who happens to be on the naughty list!!).Will Ferrell does an incredibly good job at playing his part and the supporting cast are equally as good.

A Guaranteed Good Time With Every Watch,"""WOW! The worlds best cup of coffee. Congratulations guys! You did it!""This film truly never gets old. I've loved it since I was a kid and it's honestly one of my favorite Christmas movies and I am a huge Christmas movie guy. Will Ferrel is absolutely great in this film and does amazing with the innocence of Buddy the Elf. I definitely had a few real laughs watching this movie. There are some really funny parts. It's also SUPER quotable and there are lots of memorable scenes. Although the third act is where it goes downhill imo but it's not bad. I thought the relationship between Zoey Deschanel and Will Ferrel was a little rushed tbh. Would she realistically fall for him? Maybe. But I do always love the end when everyone is singing in Central Park.I thought the special effects with the elves in the North Pole compared to Buddy was really well done. And the set and stop motion characters in the North Pole were amusing as well.Overall, Elf is a great film. It's heartwarming, funny, innocent, has great music, and is one of my favorite Christmas stories. I just saw it in theaters because they are playing Christmas Classics. It was a lot of fun. Definitely still holds up but I didnthink the story gets a little rushed towards the third act.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Needed Holiday Comedy,"I really didn't think Elf would be that great.  Yes, Will Ferrell stars in this movie as Buddy the Elf.  This Saturday Night Live alumni did wonders for the movie Old School.  Now he set his sights on a comical family/Christmas movie.  But I didn't know if the plot line would be that great.  Would it make me laugh so hard I spit out my $4 soda, or would I just be sitting there waiting to go home?  I guess I needed to go check it out to know for sure. Well the movie did not disappoint.  Sure, it had some of its moments where you were like ""that's so played out"", but most of the movie was full of happy Christmas joy.  Edward Asner was the perfectly cast Santa Claus, one of the best recent Santa castings.  James Caan as Buddy's father was very... what's the word... naughty.  You really despised his character for the most of the movie.  But that's what they were getting at.  And the biggest wow of the movie was Zooey Deschanel (Jovie).  She did an awesome awesome awesome job with the whole singing aspect of the movie.  She also was great in the acting aspect too.  She's the type of girl I could see myself hanging out with, which is a good thing because I love to relate to a character in a movie. This story was awesome.  One of the best written family movies in a while. School of Rock is the only family movie of the last few months which I think is written up to par with Elf.  You'll want to check Elf out if you are in the holiday spirit and ready for a laugh riot.  Watch it now, and then check it out again once Christmas hits.  You'll really enjoy that.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It was like a mirror on my homelife,"Our 4 year old son acts just like Will's character.  I thought my wife was going to pee her pants while laughing so hard!  Great movie, recommend to all who see the funny side of honesty!  He HAS to have a 4 or 5 year old boy in his life to act so perfectly!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
