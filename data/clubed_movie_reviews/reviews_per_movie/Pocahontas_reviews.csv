An underrated masterpiece,"I'll admit: This is not my top favorite Disney movie. Probably not in my top three. But this movie is still good.I'll also admit I don't usually choose to watch this movie. But when I do watch it, I see that this is an INCREDIBLE Disney movie with INCREDIBLE songs telling an INCREDIBLE story. I really do like this movie, even if it's not my favorite. And Pocahontas is SO pretty. And I love the hair movement in this movie. It really bugs me when cartoon hair barely moves whatsoever, but this movie's hair is more realistic. Plus it's entertaining while telling history that's (kind of) accurate. Thank you for reading my review.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A couple of minor flaws, but this is a beautiful film!","Why on earth is this movie rated so low? It's even rated lower than some of the DTV sequels. That shouldn't happen. It is historically inaccurate, but why should that be an issue? All I want is a visually stunning film with great music, and that's what I got. The animation is splendid. America looked so rich in colour, and the colours were so bright. The songs are sometimes the weakest element of an animation. Here it is the main reason why this movie is so memorable. ""Colours of the Wind"" is one of the most beautiful songs I've heard, and I've sung it before. Pocahontas's singing voice is none other than the Broadway singer, Judy Kuhn, who was absolutely terrific. When I was 12, I tried to sound like her. The incidental music is also definitely the most lyrical of the Alan Menken scores. The weakest element of the film, is actually the character development. The protagonist, voiced by Irene Bedard, is very well done, but most of the other characters are not as effective. Mel Gibson has a singing voice, but his speaking voice is too monotonous to my liking, and Ratcliffe isn't a very likable or memorable villain at all(one of Disney's blandest villains actually), despite enthusiastic voice work from David Ogden Stiers. But Meeko and Flit are great fun, and Grandmother Willow was good too. Don't say this film is racist. Some of the imagery is fantastic in the songs of war and animosity, and the film has a great love story and message. The ending was actually quite effective and poignant. In conclusion, one of the least memorable of the Disney movies, is so worth watching. 8.5/10. Bethany Cox",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Another triumph for Disney in the '90s...,"Perhaps there should have been a disclaimer at the start of the movie saying: ""Loosely based on the true story of the Indian princess"" and then there wouldn't be all this fuss about a Disney movie not sticking to historical facts. First of all, when you go to see ""Pocahontas"" knowing it's a Disney animated feature, do you really think you're going to see an accurate depiction of events? It's not meant to be a documentary--take it for what it is, a charming, completely enjoyable work of art with stunning visuals, great songs (by Menken and Schwartz) and an uplifting tale that has a message for kids and adults. What more could you want?Definitely a must-see Disney film for the whole family. Should create an interest for kids to learn about the actual events if they are so inclined. As entertainment, it's top-grade Disney with a hauntingly beautiful score that would fit well into any Broadway musical. The songs are splendid: 'Just Around the Riverbend', 'Colors of the Wind', 'The Virginia Company' -- and the artwork combined with the music for the gold-digging number is outstanding.Belongs up there with 'Beauty and the Beast' and 'Hunchback of Notre Dame' as one a serious film fan should not miss.",,Anonymous,Animation
Disney's romanticised take on the Pocahontas tale!,"As with all Disney films, this was a warm and charming movie with some fun set piece sing songs, and your stereotypical big baffoon baddies and your clean cut and heroic good guys!It's a family film and it doesn't get too hung up on being historically accurate. It does romanticise the tale of Pocahontas, and she is tied very much to the land and her people, and has a heroine's role at the end, as supposed to just being a Princess looking for Mr Right.She does of course meet a man at the end, but it's not your typical Disney ending. Much like Mulan, this was a period when the role of Disney Princess was changing.It's worth mentioning the animation, it is fantastic with the shape and movements of the key human characters, absolutely flawless.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Wonderful musical from fictitious version of true story.,"Though not entirely surpassing the Lion King this was some of the best music ever experienced in an animated musical. Pocahontas is the daughter of a chief who wishes to find her path in life. She feels it her duty to keep peace between her own people and the intruding British who are hoping to find gold as did the early Spanish explorers. She finds herself falling in love with one of these new visitors and uses this relationship in attempting to prevent a potential war. But can she stop the greedy settlers from their determination to find Gold, and can she convince her Father that they should try to live in peace with their new neighbors? You may be pleasantly surprised. Between the music and the animation Pocahontas is a classic Disney film that should be included in every video collection. Just don't expect to learn any hidden truths about American history. Take it for what it is.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
I forgot just how beautiful this movie is...why is it so underrated??,"I haven't watched Pocahontas in maybe ten years, but I was feeling nostalgic one day and popped it in. I could not believe how truly BEAUTIFUL this movie is, in every aspect.MUSIC: Aside from the songs everyone knows (Just Around the River Bend and Colors of the Wind) every single other song in the film is wonderful, with soaring harmonies and Broadway quality singing. Everything was masterfully written and executed. The music alone is reason enough for this to be adapted into a full out Broadway musical, but don't worry...the music is brilliant but it doesn't scream ""MUSICAL!"" like Hairspray or Mamma Mia.ANIMATION: Drop. Dead. Gorgeous. Every single frame is such wonderful eye candy, and the camera work serves the sweeping storyline extremely well.STORY: Dramatic (with it's humorous moments of course), romantic, and it carries a very important message of peace, maturity, and fighting against ignorance and prejudice from BOTH sides. This is possibly the Disney movie with the greatest message for kids.HISTORIC ACCURACY: Yes, Disney changed the true story quite a bit, but if you look to Disney for accurate re-tellings of historical events you have a serious PROBLEM. This movie is more 'Inspired by' than 'Based on' and since the true story is about a 13-14 year old falling in love with 30-40 year I think we can all appreciate that they took some liberties with a KIDS' MOVIE.All in all, I really don't get why this isn't revered as a classic right along with The Lion King and Beauty and the Beast.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"""I'd rather die tomorrow than live a hundred years without knowing you.""","Disney take on the story of Pocahontas and John Smith. I just saw this for the first time since its initial release. My feelings back then were somewhat lukewarm but, to put that in context, my tastes were more narrow then and I was not really into Disney or anything that felt even slightly like a 'chick flick.' Now I'm happy to say I recognize what an enjoyable film this is. The animation is wonderful with so much beautiful imagery that it took me by surprise because I didn't remember that from my first viewing. The scene where John Smith first sees Pocahontas will take your breath away. The movie makes excellent use of lush colors. Some scenes are saturated with purples and blues -- it's really stunning. Pocahontas herself is gorgeously drawn. She's easily one of the most striking Disney Princesses ever. The score is evocative and lovely with one great song (""Colors of the Wind"") and some other forgettable ones. The voice work is wonderful, especially Irene Bedard in the lead. There are nice touches of humor throughout with a talking tree and playful animals that seem to have stepped right out of Bambi's forest. The emotional stuff is where the movie really knocks it out of the park, whether it be the romance between Pocahontas and Smith or little brilliant scenes such as when Powhatan feels his wife's spirit in the wind.The cause for much criticism and complaints about the film come, of course, from the history police. The movie is historically inaccurate, which should come as no surprise to anyone over the age of four. I'm never one to get all that worked up about historical accuracy in movies (let alone cartoons) anyway. You want to be entertained, watch this movie. You want to learn more about history, open a book. One charming reviewer here said the movie was guilty of whitewashing genocide. What a shocker that Disney didn't want to make an animated version of Soldier Blue! Look, it's a cartoon loosely based on people who lived and died 400 years ago. Unclench your fists, take a breath, and stop relying on Hollywood to educate your children and getting ticked off when they don't do it the way you want them to. It's a good animated film and I think everyone who isn't looking to get angry about as many things as they can before they die should see it.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Even better 10 years later!,"Recently I started watching this again with my 4yr old son and fell in love with it all over again! The music is outstanding (I especially love the ""Colors of the Wind"") and the entire movie is a visual treat! I know many have complained that the movie is a European version of an event and demeaning to American Indians, but from what I've read, Russel Means (voice of Powhatan) was happy with the final product and its portrayal of Native Americans. Whether or not it is historically accurate, it is great entertainment and I believe the overall message of peace and acceptance between peoples is timeless good advice. All in all, a great addition to the Disney catalog of movies.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of the better modern Disney films,"Yes, this is surely one of the better modern Disney films. The story is straight and well focused on the two main characters. We have some sidekicks here, the little dog and the raccoon. Both works very well, with loving little gags and without any tendency to crude jokes, that often seen in modern Disney-films, i.e. the stupid fart-joke in ""The Lion King"", which, in my opinion, disturbing this good movie too much. ""Pocahontas"" match the spirit of the older Disney classics well. I love especially the impressionistic, colorful sequences. It is a wonderful way to tell a story with colors, pictures and music rather than dialogue. A technique, that was first used in ""Fantasia"" and than pushed up to the utmost perfectionism in ""Bambi"", and later get lost in the most modern Disney movies. And there is another detail, that i like very much: The villain is not really a totally cruel villain. He had his own problems too, and he was more driven by the demand of his company to find gold under all circumstances. The film did not focus exactly on historical facts, but come on, it is a Disney film, and it had is dark and sad scenes too. As i know, this was only the third Disney-movie (after ""Bambi"" and ""The Lion King"") in which a important character died, which is not one of the villains. Fortunately the end of the movie is ""not typical Disney"". it was done very well in a wonderful closing scene, but without that the... but i will not spoil it for you! But some disappointments are here too: ""Pocahontas"" can't mess with the detailed Animation and deep characters of the older Disney films, especially Disney's ""Big Five"": ""Snow White"", ""Pinocchio"", ""Fantasia"", ""Dumbo"", and especially ""Bambi"" are invincible in the detailed animation and the characters. In ""Pocahontas"" all of this is far simpler done, perhaps to decrease the costs of the movie and not because the animators can't do it better. Overall, i give it 7 out of 10 stars and i hope, that modern Disney will come back to movies of this high quality in the future again.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A mature Disney romantic drama,"I read the poster's comments (the one from Paris) and had to laugh, because I completely understand him. I went away for school in Europe in '95 when the film came out, and when I came back Pocahontas was the rage. You know, the way all Disney films were back then-there were commercials, songs on the radio, stuffed animals, etc....until the NEXT Disney movie came to dwarf it until a lame sequel or TV series came out. So let me tell you, I was skeptical about Pocahontas.I saw this a year after it came out and instantly fell in love with it. It's a mature Disney animated feature- (in my opinion) even more mature than Japanime films I have seen. The love story seems very real-there is a sort of chemistry between the leads that you can feel.The soundtrack is one of my favourite parts about the movie. Every song matches perfectly with the spirit of the time and place..a new world in the 1600's.Finally..whoever had the idea to cast Mel Gibson(and Christian Bale) is a genius. Love those voices!One aspect of this movie often overlooked is its dreamy editing. It is so consistent throughout and rivals many critically acclaimed films with great editing.See it again, and remember: ""You can own the earth and still, all you'll own is Earth until you can paint with all the colors of the wind.""",,Anonymous,Animation
"A mature animated Disney feature, and a beautiful film","This is somewhat unique, for a number of reasons. Perhaps most importantly, it is, as my summary states, mature. Gone are the talking animals, the show-stopping musical number(as were a staple of the Disney cartoons of the time), and the themes, the tone, is more serious. This is the only Disney animated feature actually based on a true event. There is still humor that the children can laugh at, and it's still much more simple and easy to take in than a lot of entertainment, but this has things for the grown-ups, as well. This seems to have lead to it being somewhat overlooked and less popular with kids. Another difference is how realistic the look is. The characters, the movements, faces, everything, it all looks far more real than other animated pieces. The animation is magnificent. The colors are used well, and quite subtly, in key sequences. The acting is good, and Bedard and Kuhn, the speaking and singing voice of the title character, respectively, are both excellent. Gibson isn't a bad singer, and he fits the character of Smith, both in attitude and voice. The majority of the actors lending their voices to the Indian characters are actual Native Americans, which is definitely an impressive and note-worthy detail. The music is great. Characterization is nicely done. For a film that's about an hour and fifteen minutes, sans credits, we know more about these people, and understand them better, than you'd expect. The plot is well-written, but of course it is a fictional recounting of the actual story(this is Disney, after all). The pacing is marvelous, it never really drags. The DVD extras are a mixed bag... not all are well-produced or aesthetically appealing(or even introduced properly). The multi-language reel, though, is well-cut and well-done, both idea and execution get high marks... although as much as I dislike Danish dubbing, I'm not sure that I was as relieved as I was insulted that the Danish voice was not part of it; the Swedish and Norwegian were! Also, the interactive adventure can amuse, and may inform. I recommend this to anyone willing to watch Disney, especially the more mature audiences. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"It has its songs, its attempted humour and its out of this world ideas but it fails to be anything too fantastic.","Pocahontas was the first Disney film that I'd seen in quite a while and I had forgotten the enjoyment and magic that Disney films can often give you. Although I've probably seen most Disney films over the years, it was interesting to revisit this particular title after so long and view it with a more adult mind.One thing that you notice right away is that Pocahontas is not as epic as previous Disney films. There isn't a lot of animation and that cliché 'every effort is put into every drawing and thus; every frame' seems to have fallen through the net this time round. Because of this; the animation looks not only dated but it makes some of the characters (namely the lead heroine Pocahontas herself) ""kinda' funny lookin'."" That feeling that this is not as epic as previous instalments is also present. I don't know if Disney were going for the whole neo-realistic look or something since this is based on a true story (something Disney rarely do) but the actual drawings do fall a little flat. Hey, maybe they were putting all their animation effort into Toy Story from the same year; you never know.The film is clever and at the same time interesting at the start. We spend enough time with the sailors across their voyage and the protagonist is pretty obviously presented to us as John Smith since not only is he the one that saves a fellow sailor from drowning (Voiced by Christian Bale, no-less) but he's also voiced by Mel Gibson  more than enough evidence to suggest this is the leading man. Also, we get a peek at the native American's way of life which, unless you've studied pre-colonial America, is going to look pretty alien to you. This is the film giving us an even amount of time with either 'side' and is dangling a proverbial carrot in front of our faces, tempting us to make a link with either the sailors or the natives.The film is, overall, a very sophisticated story about friendship, trust and ultimately: love and the fact it's between two people from very different backgrounds and ways of life is all the more pleasurable. Even though it is a true story, Disney takes the material and makes good with it. What I didn't like though, was the fact that the animals whom are supposed to act as the films comic relief are actually more annoying than funny. I appreciate that it's 'just for kids' but where a proper love story is unfolding, two bumbling animals in the shape of Meeko (Pocahontas' racoon) and Percy (The English governor's dog whom he doesn't even realise is missing towards the end) attempt to ruin what it is that's going on around them. The fact they don't talk means that their actions have to make up for any amusing dialogue they might have had and when you have to rely on actions to make you laugh, you have to rely on slapstick and that really misses the mark in this film.The songs are impressive in their own right; like I said before, they're not as epic as previous films and consist of characters running through forests or boating down rivers with not much happening around them and with the same shades of colours and shapes used consistently. This is not like The Lion King (I Just Can't Wait to be King) or Aladdin (Never Had A Friend Like Me) where lots was going on and, arguably, better songs were presented to us. The willow tree was also something I had a bit of a problem with. Although acting as the mentor for Pocahontas, I felt that it broke too far from reality and wasn't even used that much anyway. I feel the film would've worked better had this character been a really elderly native American whom Pocahontas could've trusted but again, the prospect of a talking tree in a Disney film gets the kids in.Even if I was a little let down by the climatic battle scene since I didn't really 'feel' anything (when I felt I was supposed to have many emotions raging at once), the film sticks to its roots and has the ending that many of us probably wouldn't have liked to have happened. This is a strong Disney addition and shouldn't be overlooked.On a side note, if you liked this then check out 'A New World' (2005). It's another Pocahontas film and funnily enough, stars Christian Bale as well.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
John Smith,"I first wrote this review, after I saw Pocahontas (1995), in the theaters, back in 1995. This does include some 2023 proof-reading. This Disney film, tries to explain the historical story, about the relationship between the beautiful Indian princess Pocahontas (voice of Irene Bedard), and the British colonist John Smith (voice of Mel Gibson), as an animated, family adventure. When the ship, the Susan Constant, which is carrying John Smith, lands in the new world, cultures between the colonists and the native Indians, immediately begin to collide. When the Indian chief, who is the father of Pocahontas, declares war against the greedy English, Smith is caught in the middle and Pocahontas, has to save his life. Of course, they also fall in love. No surprises there.In Pocahontas (1995), there is a definite lesson, implanted into this story, about the way native Americans, were portrayed in history. Also, it explains how prejudices can be very harmful and to watch-out, for suspect portrayals of them, in older stories or history books. The film does try to mend those wounds. The story in Pocahontas (1995), is fair to good. The story does have that typical, sad Disney conclusion and it is, no Lion King (1994). There is a slow pace in this film and the music, tends to be a little dull. The overall film doesn't match the normal, fun-loving standards of a Disney film. Even the color-scheme, used in the animations seemed a little bland. The fluid motion, witnessed in the Lion King (1994) and even in classics, like Pinocchio (1940), was not evident in Pocahontas (1995).Pocahontas (1995), is entertaining for kids and there is a level of maturity, that can keep adults in the story. There are some very funny moments in the film too. It is an average animated film though and it had mixed reviews, when it was released in 1995. It is one of the more weaker Disney animated efforts, that were released in the late-1990s. However, Pocahontas (1995), is still a good enough film, that it does deserve a watch. It has an interesting level of cultural sensibilities/insensibilities, that helps to draw an interesting contrast, between the year the film takes place (1607), the year it came out (1995), and how we feel about these situations, almost 30 years after its release.6.3 (D+) = 6 IMDB.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
The greatest underrated Disney's gem !,"When this movie came out (in 1995), I thought : ""Another one ""big stupid kiddy Disney American colonialist propaganda movie"" ! Nobody thinks no more about a love story between an Indian girl and a colonialist ! The indians were exterminated by the colonialists ! Not loved by them ! Everybody knows that !""And I didn't watch such of silly movie, of course ! I'm not a stupid man !BUT, there's a week ago, the daughter of my sister (9 years old), forgot that DVD in my home. I thought : ""Let's see this stupidity, just to laugh at the most ridiculous Disney's movie !""I watched it. And I cryed. This is the best Disney's movie, and maybe the best movie, I've ever watched !How can you criticize it ? Have you lost your children soul ?!!Of course, just after watched it, I thought : ""Well, that's good. Better than I thought. But that's all"".But the next day, the song of the old ""mother witch"" remains in my mind ! I decided to watch it again, and again. Now, I've seen this movie about 20 times in one week. That's incredible, I think I'm a fan !!!!For me, in general, the worst part of a Disney movie, was the songs. I've always hated them. For the first time, I found the songs were the best part of this movie ! I listened to every songs of this movie, and I think, they are all good, and even, great ! Also the music ! It's an Mozart's opera !Graphics are good, but the editing is better ! The first encounter between Pocahontas and Smith at the falls is a pure master-piece ! And the movie's references are plenty ! The ""3-voices song"" of ""savages"", reminds me the ""rumbles"" of ""West Side Story"", and the final ""goodbye"" reminds me the final of Spielberg's ""E.T."".I don't know if this movie was done ""for children"", but I know I cry every time I watch it !Thanks for Mike Gabriel, Eric Goldberg, Alan Menken, Stephen Schwartz, and the Disney Company to have kept their ""children soul"". I was wrong and they were right. And I'm happy of that.Well, I quit you now, I need to watch this movie again... Goodbye ! :-))10/10 !!!!!! of course !",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Definitely not their most exciting film.,"The biggest problem with Pocahontas is that it's boring and predictable. How they managed to make a movie about colonialization and racism so boring is a mystery to me. And you can predict every step the movie takes from the romance to clash of the two parts and what triggers it.The character development is one of the big sinners here, because the main characters and the villain are either boring or stupid. Mel Gibson's performance as John Smith just sounded monotonous and detached and his romance with equally dull Pocahontas just felt forced. And yet there are not very much more to them than that romance. But the way they ended it all was pretty well done. The villain was the generic money hungry white man. Ratcliff had some pretty cringe-worthy lines which made him sound really stupid. His singing voice is good, but the lyrics to his song-sequences are either just generic (Mine Mine Mine) or over simplified serious topic (Savages).The animation is a highlight along with the songs. Colours of the Wind is an amazing song and delivers the most magic in the movie and Gibson's singing voice in Mine, Mine, Mine isn't half bad. But that is surface level aspects of a movie, and if a story isn't very engaging or exciting it ends up lackluster.The list goes on, because aside from a couple of beautiful songs and eye-popping animation, Pocahontas has remarkable problems which makes it fall into the category of wasted potential.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
And you'll never hear the wolf cry to the blue corn moon...,"What can I say... When I was a kid, I didn't like Pocahontas. In fact, I was disappointed with this movie. Because, to me, they HAD to be happy ever after! The years have passed, and I'm 19, and I felt really stupid because I didn't like this movie. Oh my god. This movie wasn't made for children, It was made for grow ups. It's language... a child would never understand the message. A child would just enjoy the animation, Meeko and the songs.

When I saw ""Colors of the wind"" I cried. When I heard ""Savages!"" I got chills. How Disney did that? Kids, don't watch this movie. Grow-ups, GO NOW AND WATCH.

"Beautifully Drawn, Lightly Sketched","Watching Pocahontas again, I'm reminded of both its strengths and its shortcomings. On the positive side, the animation is undeniably stunning. Disney really knows how to paint a picture, and the lush landscapes, vibrant colors, and flowing animation all makes it a visual treat. There's a certain beauty and warmth in how the film captures nature, especially in scenes like ""Colors of the Wind,"" which remains one of the most memorable moments in Disney's animated history. The movie also has a lot of heart, with themes of love, understanding, and the desire for peace woven throughout. It's clear that the filmmakers aimed to tell a story that resonates on an emotional level, and in parts, they succeed.However, the film does have its flaws. For one, the story feels somewhat superficial. It tries to tackle serious themes of cultural conflict and harmony, but often glosses over the deeper complexities in favor of a more simplified narrative. I couldn't help but feel that the film played it a bit too safe, avoiding the real grit that could have made the story more impactful. The portrayal of the characters, especially Pocahontas and John Smith, is somewhat one-dimensional, and I found myself wishing for more depth and nuance in their development. Additionally, the pacing can be uneven at times, with the plot dragging in places and rushing through others.Overall, Pocahontas is a beautifully animated film with moments of genuine emotion, It's a visually stunning movie that hits some of the right notes but misses out on delivering a fully satisfying story. I appreciate its heart and the effort to convey a meaningful message.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
The declining renaissance?,"So after a run of successful films and a monster hit with The Lion King, it was up to Disney to keep the goods coming. Sadly Pocahontas didn't turn out as the crowd pleaser the studio hoped it would and it ended their hot streak by being something of a critical disappointment. It's not difficult to see why however. This was a very different take in a number of ways and dealt with actual historical events for the first time, so people were ready to scrutinise the film if need be. Credit must be given to the team behind it for taking such a risk at their peak and though it has its good points it definitely isn't up to the standard of its predecessors.I think most people are familiar with the story. A group of British settlers, amongst them is John Smith, come to new found land with dreams of finding gold and eliminating savages. Smith meets and bonds with one of the natives named Pocahontas, as they begin to see that both sides can get along and avoid bloodshed. Here is the issue I have with this story, it has been done to death. It's the typical white men invade the land, one realises his mistake and they all see that the inhabitants aren't savages. We've seen it numerous times before to the point where you know exactly what will happen, making it totally uninteresting. They needed to do something truly different or experimental for this story to be engaging, which they sadly don't.This could be salvaged if the characters are interesting, but they're not. Pocahontas (Irene Bedard) is as bland as they come. They try to make her adventurous and free-spirited, but she has no personality and just comes across as a bit of a moaner. John Smith (a monotone Mel Gibson) is equally as bland. I know he's meant to be a normal guy, it's just that he's a complete bore and does almost nothing of note throughout. If your main characters are like this then it's not a good sign. The natives are simply okay and a lot of Grandmother Willow's (Linda Hunt) dialogue seems very out of place. Thomas (a young Christian Bale) is likable enough and Ben is quite funny thanks to Billy Connolly, but there's a dearth of appealing characters.The villain is very weak too. Ratcliffe (Disney regular David Ogden Stiers) is another guy who is completely fuelled by greed and just wants gold. He has absolutely no character beyond that, he isn't funny or threatening and he's only there to provide a bit of conflict. Another issue I had was with the animal sidekicks. There were far too many 'cute' moments, where there's a bit of slapstick or they do something silly and it clashes badly with the relatively serious tone. Plus given the themes of nature I think the animals should talk and it would make sense, it's strange that a tree talks but the animals don't. The songs are pretty bland for the most part, not remotely memorable and there are a few too many that get in the way. Though I will say 'Colours of the Wind' is excellent.You might think I hate this film, but I don't and there are some very good areas. For one the animation is simply incredible. It is easily some of Disney's best ever. I'm not sure what it is about the colours but they are so vibrant that they almost leap off the screen and the backgrounds are just beautiful to look at. Simple things such as the rivers and the trees are animated gorgeously, while there's lots of sky blues and pinks that create a lovely colour palette. It's clear that a lot of work was put into the visuals and it certainly pays off. The characters are drawn more to look like real people which is also nice. Alan Menken's score is very effective and sets a good mood when it appears. There's also a strong atmosphere at certain points, especially in the quieter scenes, that I wish ran through the whole film.Even though I don't think Pocahontas is a particularly good film, I can see why others do and it does have things to admire. I respect Disney for trying something very different to their usual work and I think the animation is a massive strong point. However it suffers in its two key areas, with a story that was already stale when it came out and with characters that it is almost impossible to get invested in. Not to that mention some of the decisions to take with the story are questionable and it is all over the place in regards to its take on history. It is very much a mixed bag, especially given Disney's successes at the time, but it's certainly an interesting addition.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Decent entertainment, very pleasing to the eye.","For as much bad press as Pocahontas got, I must say I really disagree with the people who call it flat and lifeless. I thought that after the exclusively tan Lion King, the fresh blues and greens of the foggy Virginia woods were quite beautiful to behold. No one can deny that this is a very beautiful movie, almost exquisite in its animation. Although John Smith is nowhere near as handsome as he thinks he is and peoples' eyes have a strange tendency to all but disappear at times (Look at Smith, Nakoma and Kokoum to see what I mean), it is very very pretty.Unfortunately, if they'd just waited a year or so after The Lion King, I think it would have gotten much better ratings. As I see it, it is a very interesting story, if a bit tired at times. Pocahontas is a fine heroine, she's very courageous and likeable, and unlike Jasmine and Nala from the previous two Disney films, she's much more than just a pretty face. The love story with Captain Smith is actually done rather well despite the fact that I really disliked the Smith character. I'm not sure why they made him so flat and one-dimensional in contrast to Pocahontas' rich personality, but I didn't find him at all interesting.The cute animal mascots were allright, if totally out of place in the otherwise dark world. They would be funny to little kids, but they're pretty annoying to a mature viewer.I didn't really care for Chief Powhatan, he was a little too dense considering the circumstances. I'd say my favorite characters were Nakoma, Pocahontas' best friend and Kokoum, the personality-less warrior. At least those two had some decent tension. I also really enjoyed David Ogden Stiers' duel performance as Governor Ratcliffe and his cute little yes-man, Wiggins. Those two characters truthfully provided the best entertainment of the film, and it might have been a better movie if they'd replaced some of the preachiness with more entertaining scenes of those two plotting.All in all, it doesn't really take much intelligence to watch it, but it does have elements to appeal to a mature viewer, and besides, the songs are very pretty and of course, it's a splendid piece of animation.",,Anonymous,Animation
"Folks, It's Not History","We must start with the foundation statement that this is not an historical retelling of the story of early America. We don't know what went on at that time, so we are off the mark at the beginning. Can you imagine the dark times that were involved in this era, with a group of settlers trying to establish some kind of community, and a Native American presence confused and afraid what was going on. So what Disney did was turn this into a folk tale which oral traditions have been doing forever (e.g. Paul Bunyan or John Henry or, more appropriately, Davey Crockett). I mean they sing and talk to trees. The romance had to be very strained. Throw in the search for gold and the greed, and you have a classic love in the face of barriers story. Also, there are a couple of terrific songs in this film. No, it's not ""The Lion King"" but many very good films are not ""The Godfather"" either. It doesn't mean they can't stand on their own.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Too straight-forward to leave any lasting impact,"Disney hit a rut in the late-90s with a string of critical and audience failures that began with Pocahontas and lasted through Hunchback, Hercules, Dinosaur etc. It was also one of two historically- inaccurate movies starring ""Mad"" Mel Gibson that came out in Fall 1995 in the UK. Both of which I never got to see until much later.From a technical standpoint there is nothing wrong with Pocahontas, as a matter of fact it's far more colorful, atmospheric, and grown-up than The Lion King, which came out a year before. But in the process it lost much of its younger audience and now only seems to appeal to adults. The story lets everything else down. It's so bland and generic when it could have had the moxie to go much further and be just a tad more complex. It certainly had the visual energy to back it up even it were to try and fail. Alan Menken's score is also horrible and totally inappropriate to the scenes he is supposedly enhancing. Songs come and go, some last only a few moments. If feels like instead of letting the visuals speak for themselves Disney decided that characters talking to each other (at the audience) as a means of delivering exposition was too obvious so instead this dialogue is sung. The songs are exposition. Rarely do they allow any visual storytelling to stand alone. John Smith's first encounter with Pocahontas at the waterfall being the best example of what the film could have been if only.Despite being historically-inaccurate (why is she not topless?) it really only details the first half of the Pocahontas story. The second (and more tragic) half is (sorta) detailed in the cash- grab sequel that nobody remembers. I cannot imagine anyone being smitten by this film unless they are already familiar with Pocahontas as the stripped-down story is hardly likely to win over anyone new to this slice of romantic history.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great film!,"Whatever happened to the ""golden ages"" of Disney- when everyone seemed devoted and dedicated to what they were putting out there for people to see? Now they only care about making money, thanks to Eisner (who is FORTUNATELY gone).Anyway, what was I saying? Oh yeah. Back to the movie: *SPOILERS* I think what separates this Disney movie from the rest is that it has more adult elements. For example: Pocahontas and John Smith don't end up together in the end. In basically ever other Disney film I've seen, they all have the ""let's live together and have babies and live happily ever after. The End!"" sort of movies. Pocahontas has a distinct realness about her that separates her from the rest of Disney's protagonists. For once, Disney depicts an independent woman who knows what she needs and can fend for herself. As for some of the reviewers saying Radcliffe was ""weak"", I disagree. He truly depicted what most money(and land) hungry conquerors were like: they wanted land to expand their empires, wanted money (gold at the time), and didn't want others to occupy it that weren't like them (both in physical appearance and social class).I also have to add that the animation and soundtrack are absolutely breathtaking. Whenever I watch this film, I feel like I can connect to the environment, and the songs aren't cheesy at all. I was 4 and a half when Pocahontas came out, and I liked it for different reasons (such as Meeko, Flick, the Barbie dolls, merchandise, etc.) than I do know. As a teen, I see this movie as a true piece of art in cinema that should never be forgotten.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
It's okay.,"I really don't enjoy this movie much, just some of the songs like ""Mine,Mine,Mine"" and ""Just Around The Riverbend."" But the plot isn't the best out of the other Disney movies. So, I say it's not something that would be a good movie to watch so many times. I saw it in the theater, and didn't enjoy it to much. Only certain parts of the movie are funny. The songs are good, but the plot isn't very good. I saw it a few times, haven't watched in four years, so that tells you something. I just think it's not the best out of the Disney Movies, like Lion King, Toy Story, and other movies. So I give it a 5, it's alright, but not good. That's all I have to say about it.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Absolute Rubbish,"The historical facts are that John Smith and Pocahontas never had any kind of romantic affair and in fact she married a white man named Rolfe. There is absolutely no mention of a romance between the two in any primary source of the time. See Smith's ""A Generall Historie"" from 1624 for the most complete primary account. The myth of a romance was a creation of romance writers who felt the need to narrativize the relationship between the two into something that would sell. In reality, she was an ambassador for her people and even traveled to England to meet the queen, with Rolfe. So if Disney and the like want to make some movie about a white guy and native woman in love-great go for it-but that is no reason to distort history for our kids, whose parents are most likely not informed enough themselves to contradict the movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not a basic Disney movie,"The plot of the movie was very interesting and kinda different than any other Disney-princess movie. The storyline was very well written, it was something new! The characters were very interesting, well-developed and some of them were really likeable (especially, Pocahontas!). The effects of the movie were nice, it was a well edited movie. Gladly, it was the first movie that included an interracial couple. The love story between, Pocahontas and John Smith was very well-developed and they were meant to be together..! I have to admit, that the soundtrack of the movie was really good. The opening scene of the movie was kinda intense. The ending scene was expected and it was very emotional.

"OK, I think the low rating is very unfair!.","'Pocahontas' is certainly not among the best films to come out of Disney but in my humble opinion it deserves more than 5.7. I found it to be very charming, with wonderful characters, fantastic animation, stunning visuals, sweet chemistry between the lovers, lovely songs (Colours of the Wind is breathtaking), and simple Disney entertainment. I liked the way it ended, somewhat differently from other Disney films.My only complaint is that I didn't like it when one of the Indians got killed and how Pocahontas was more concerned about never seeing John. Also the father forgiving John immediately was unrealistic. More character development was required for us to at least understand the father's character. The dialogues were a little clichéd. It was also strange to see Pocahontas communicating with John in English.Having read about 'Pocahontas' I found it very unfair that it was labelled a racist film. Where was the racism? If anything, it's about bringing people together. It's about unconditional love that can exist both within and between races. I also think it was very unfair that the film was trashed for not being historically accurate. Come on, it's a Disney film for kids not some kind of epic film. Perhaps the unconventional ending (quite non-Disney) was too much to take for some people.However, except for the flaws I mentioned, I think it's a great film and one can really enjoy it especially because of the visual beauty and the beautiful songs and I loved the characters Percy, Meeko and Flit. They provided some memorable comic relief.",,Anonymous,Animation

"Pretty and with good music, but not very good overall","After the huge success of The Lion King and the three films preceding it, Pocahontas effectively ended Disney's Renaissance in 1995. They've never been able to recover from it, relying instead on Pixar to carry the mantle (although I would argue that Disney has had a handful of films in the past ten years that rival, and are probably far better than their run from The Little Mermaid to The Lion King). Pocahontas has a few things going for it. Honestly, it's one of Disney's best looking films. The colors in particular are gorgeous. And the music is good, too. Not great, but I like it far better than the music of the The Lion King or Beauty and the Beast, both of which have horribly overrated music. The music of Pocahontas did, in fact, win two Oscars, for both score and Best Song (""The Colors of the Wind""). While I can sit through a film with such merits, the bad stuff really weighs it down. Disney really shouldn't have tackled a historical story, no matter how mythologized. And they REALLY shouldn't have added cutesy animal sidekicks. That's the biggest crime of the film by far, the raccoon and hummingbird that follow Pocahontas around, getting into trouble, and the bad guy's pug, all far too anthropomorphized. If Disney had attempted to make a more mature movie, it might have worked, but then maybe they couldn't have padded out the runtime with the animal antics. The film also suffers from a good amount of mid-90s political correctness. The conflict boils down to ""Argh! We're the evil white people and all we want to do is kill savages!"" and ""Ugh. We're noble savages who like corn, or, as we call it, maize. We love animals and nature and crap. Look, there's a talking, magical tree over there. And check out my daughter's pet raccoon! Isn't it funny?"" It's all terribly insulting. Still better than the boring The Lion King.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A remarkable, wonderful film, but that shows nothing of historically true.","This is certainly one of the most notable animation films that Disney did in the 1990s. It has an undeniable quality, with exquisitely done animations, great songs and fun suitable for children and adults. However, its impossible to get around an undeniable fact: all that the film portrays is fiction, imagined around names of historical characters who actually existed. The connection between this film and historical facts ends in these names. Everything, absolutely everything else, was created in the minds of Disney's writers and creators. So pay attention, history teachers and parents: don't think that this movie has any connection with history. Another problem of the film is to approach in a very stereotyped and slight way the two confronting cultures (the colonizers and the Native Americans, its understood). But since its a children's film, this kind of lightness is forgivable.One of the highlights of the movie is music. Several of his songs were remarkable, especially for my generation, who was a child when the film was released. ""Colors of the Wind"" is perhaps one of the most poetic songs used in a Disney movie, it stays in the ear with great ease and the animation used during the music is excellent. In fact, the synchronicity of visual animation and music is something very well made. This movie is great if it's seen as an entertainment fiction, like an animated children's movie that does not show anything true.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"weak, inaccurate, dull","This Disney version of the story of Pocahontas is meant to be entertaining and fluffy rather than a realistic historical perspective. This story is about Pocahontas and her relationship with a white settler in American history and about trying to prevent battles between the native Americans and the new settlers. This film leaves little to be desired with its cast of annoying characters and a story and romance that is difficult to really get into and appreciate. Instead of being a hero, it seemed as if Pocahontas was reduced more to a romantic love interest.

The songs were unmemorable, as were the characters, and the story was rather boring. Meeko and Flit were, and still are, the most boring characters Disney ever created. Who gives a flying flip how cute they are? A snoozer of a Disney movie. Even The Black Cauldron was better than this movie.

An insult to American History,"Having grown up less than 50 miles away from the site of the original Jamestown settlement, I was initially excited about seeing Pocahontas. After all, I'd been going on field trips to Jamestown since I was 5, and we'd been taught the history all our lives.  So yeah, I was excited. Then I saw it.  Even at age 11, I knew it was a horrible film.  First of all, I didn't understand why a 12-year-old girl had been given the body and measurements of a Barbie doll (bust: 78, waist: 6, hips: 42).  She was no grown woman, she wasn't even a teenager, yet Disney saw fit to Barbie-ize her.  And John Smith wasn't this wonderful, gorgeous, benevolent hero type. He was actually known to be very cruel and strict with his men.I realize that this is a children's movie and Disney is more out to entertain than educate, but I thought it was a bit insulting to the history of the story.  I mean, if they wanted a Native American/Colonial romance story, couldn't they have made up fictional characters?  They made everything ELSE up.  Maybe somebody should make a film about Michael Eisner or Roy E. Disney falling in love with a real-life 12-year-old and having a romance with her...  I bet nobody would find THAT entertaining for children.Also, getting away from the  gross historical inaccuracies, I didn't like how they concentrated so much publicity on the fact that Mel Gibson voiced Smith.  Yeah, so he's a big-name movie star.  Get over it.  They did the same thing to Robin Williams for Aladdin and it got them into trouble... I guess they just never learn...  I also just thought the quality of the film itself wasn't as good as previous Disneys had been.  The music was very good, I'll admit that, but the rest of it was just kind of bland. Perhaps I was just biased against it from the get-go.I just thought this film showed a complete lack of respect for the REAL people portrayed in it...  What's Disney going to do next, a jolly jaunt about the Salem Witch Trials?  Turn Rebecca Nurse into a voluptuous 16-year old and make her fall in love with a young, handsome, non-crushed Giles Corey and have them help everyone to escape the jails (and gallows) and live happily ever after?  Ugh, I shouldn't even say it, they'd probably DO it.And on another side note, I don't think any of the people who made Pocahontas have ever actually BEEN to that part of Virginia, otherwise they'd know that there is NO waterfall like that ANYWHERE around there.",,Anonymous,Animation

Governor Ratcliffe is just greedy throughout the film. But I did like his song.

I know Disney was trying to make the film serious, but we could have had a couple comic relief scene's.

It's also interesting to hear a young Christian Bale involved as Thomas. Billy Connolly appears too, though only minorly.The animation and music are the key parts to this.

Boring and offensive.,"I couldn't even finish this movie. The story is so bland and uninteresting. All the musical sequences are ear-gratingly bad. Even some of the voice actors sound bored. The most enjoyable moments are some of the random slapstick with the animals, but even that gets boring after a while. I don't see how any child would be entertained by this, never mind an adult.The historical inaccuracies just add to the misery that is this movie. I'm not expecting the peak of realism from a Disney Princess movie where magic wind translates languages, there is a talking tree, and raccoons and hummingbirds understand situations - but they could've at least made up new names and a fake location or something. This movie is kind of sanitizing the horrible things that actually happened in history. On top of that it doesn't even do it in an interesting or creative way. It's just dull.I will give credit where credit is due. While all the human faces are straight out of the uncanny valley, the overall look of this movie is very good. The visuals are georgeous.

Love and happiness versus pride and violence.,"The Native Americans were portrayed inaccurately, but when did anyone care about history and politics in a Disney movie. Something is endearing about the character of Pocahontas, who prefers levity over rules and traditions. She always takes the more challenging and interesting path as opposed to her more old-fashioned parents.This of course leads us to the tree of wisdom which guides Pocahontas and the climax in this movie when she creates a ceasefire is a standout moment. It does heavily follow the formula that The Little Mermaid started and it lacks a memorable villain, but it's a solid entry in the Disney universe nonetheless.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Pocahontas = propaganda,"I give Pocahontas a 2 only because of the entertainment provided to children. I am appalled that Disney would produce a film with so many inaccuracies to our history. What is worse, is knowing so many children walk away from this film believing Pocahontas saved John Smith's life, that she was in love with him, that he was some wonderful English man. None of this is true. Pocahontas was only about 9 years old, 2nd, her father was not killing John Smith, he was adopting him as a son and third, they never fell in love with one another. At any library one can find a book on letters from John Smith. But please keep in mind as is true with most English writers from this period, his information is biased. The very least Disney could have done was to ensure to its audience at the beginning of the movie ""what you are about to see is fictional, none of the events, time lines, or ideas are factual.

Perhaps the only bad Disney animated movie I've seen,"The only redeeming elements are the standard gorgeous scenery and character animation (at least concerning the titular character) but everything else is so...blah.  It seems the cute little animal sidekicks are there just for the sake of being cute and funny (there was absolutely no reason for that dog to even be in the movie.  So he starts out as the bad guy's pet but then befriends the raccoon - who cares?)  Considering the deep subject matter, the cute animals come off more as ""cutesy"" than cute.Considering the subject matter, why did they even tackle it at all if they're going to put a heavy sugar coating on it?  I can't fathom taking a heavy historical subject and basically making an idyllic fairy tale of it. Oh well.Anyway, a few other things that bothered me: 1) language barrier apparently not a problem (I think it's supposed to be inferred that Pocahontas ""magically"" learns to speak English - oh brother) and 2)Tom, the kid with the hat tells Pocahontas that John, after being wounded, has to go back to England because he has no chance in America - what do they have in England that can heal a musket wound that they don't have in America?

Nice,"It is interesting the detail that ""Pocahontas"" was produced by the main team of Disney animators at the same time that ""The Lion King"" was being made by team B, in the end ""The Lion King"" becomes the greatest animation of all time in as ""Pocahontas"" is just a common Disney design. This does not mean that ""Pocahontas"" is bad, on the contrary, it is very good, but something is missing here that is left over from other titles in the same studio. The 90's were marked by the best Disney animations: ""The Lion King"", ""Mulan"", ""Aladdin"", ""Beauty and the Beast"", among others ... All beautiful, with great stories, remarkable and unforgettable music, and lots of magic! This magic is lacking in ""Pocahontas"", for example: the soundtrack is beautiful, but not as much as that of the other films. The plot does not seem to fit, the film has a serious problem of rhythm, it drags on too much and when it seems to go forward, it is very fast and it ends. This coupled with a few other factors makes the film look a little ""unsalted"". However, ""Pocahontas"" is very rich, has a beautiful history and deals with strong and current themes such as racism, but it does it in a weak way. The protagonist couple is unsympathetic, the little animals are irritating and the villain is one-dimensional, all of which contributes to a certain lack of interest. The impression it gives is that of a very good idea but poorly executed, or done without will, perhaps a little more whimsy would deliver another memorable Disney work. I know it looks like I hate the movie, but that's not it! Pocahontas is great and a lot of fun. It's just a shame that it is the weakest among so many other striking titles from the studio at the time of its release!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Full of colors but not colorful enough ...,"Only one year after ""The Lion King"", that can be considered as the pinnacle of Disney Renaissance, was released the groundbreaking ""Toy Story"", that would pave the way to a whole new generation of animated films. 1995 was the year of the 3D revolution, which -let's face it- didn't leave much room for 'the first animated Disney feature based on a true story'.I don't intend to be ironic, because on its own, ""Pocahontas"" is a decent film with some solid animation but as much as I respect and appreciate the fact that the film tried to detach itself from Disney roots and deal with more adult and historically relevant material, I'm just sorry that it didn't succeed on the field of entertainment as it did on music and imagery. Something was missing and the movie did to me the same effect that an appetizing dish served in a beautiful plate but failing on the most crucial test. 'Pocahontaste' lacked the little extra spice, a pity when you consider how dazzling the cinematography was.I insist on the imagery because it contains such a great escapist value that if only for that, it's hard to maintain a negative opinion toward the film, ""Colors of the Wind"" and the shot of Pocahontas rafting on the wild river is such a powerful image that it deserved a more interesting story to build around, especially since the film was intended to be a romance. But the romance proved again to be a tricky genre for Disney films as the least likely to entertain or to inspire empathy, unless it's saved by comic relief elements, scene-stealing sidekicks or memorable villains, which ""Pocahontas"" didn't have. And go entertain a bunch of candy-eating kids in the movie theater with an Indian princess who falls in love with a British soldier, when one year before, it was about the coming-of-age story of a young lion who to become the king, and when a bunch of toys were living a great adventure.""Pocahontas"" was meant to fail because of its own story, too historically loaded to introduce some fantasy elements and when it tried, it didn't go too far. When you make a tree speak through the soul of a deceased grand-mother, why not make the little animals speak for God's sake?! I have nothing against the raccoon and the hummingbird, but I'd be damned if they made me even smile once, their cuteness was on the same level of Disney's 1932 ""Flowers and Trees"" and whoever created them should have remembered that if a character doesn't add anything significant to the plot, at least, he must have some redeeming qualities, and 'being cute' isn't one.The secondary characters were so weak, that even the running gag involving the little rivalry between the raccoon and the dog didn't work for me, and although I watched the film only one year ago, I doubt that would have made me laugh either when I was 13, and certainly not as hard as Rafiki, Timon, Pumbaa or Genie, Abu or the magic carpet. And even if we give ""Pocahontas"" the benefit of doubt and consider that many other Disney films featured forgettable sidekicks, I doubt they also had forgettable villains. And since the thrills and interest of the story is driven by the antagonist, ""Pocahontas"" deserved more than a buffoon like Ratcliffe, not in the same league than Ursula, Jafar or the flamboyant Gaston.I hate to sound so technical, but there are some tacit rules established since the release of the first animated feature: every ""Snow White"" needs her ""Seven Dwarfs"" and ""Evil Queen"", and they might even be more important. While the princess is the emotional core, a good Disney film is judged on its capability to scare and to make people laugh, and if it can work with bland and even dull heroines, it can't without strong supporting characters. Not all the Disney movies were romances of course, the others were generally quests or coming-of-age stories driven by young characters: Bambi, Pinocchio, Arthur or Mowgli whose identification was much easier, probably the key of ""The Lion King"" and ""Toy Story""'s appeal.""Pocahontas"" had nothing special to impact the memories, and if it didn't sink into oblivion, it's probably a miracle due to the high quality of the film. But the story is just too mature: not enough fantasy, not enough colorful characters, it's even as if the writers were trapped by the content of their own stories, victim of this politically correct depiction of Natives, so angelic that the movie falls into a sort of reverse racism with the whole communion-with-Mother-nature stuff, so defining of the 90's and so hypocritical when you consider that the animators didn't embarrass themselves with depicting some Arabs in a stereotypical way in ""Aladdin"", while they were more sensitive about the portrayal of Natives for obvious reasons.The result is a sort of animated ""Dances With the Wolves"" so noble-spirited, so wise, that it's almost offensive not to love this film, when you take it from an adult point of view. But that's the problem because Disney films are precisely about awakening the inner child inside us, and while I'm writing this, I try to remember why I didn't want to watch the film when it was released, when I didn't know anything about the stuff I just wrote. And I just found out why: the movie that tries to be the least possibly offensive is still offensive, because with her geometrically drawn face, I never found Pocahontas pretty at all, and she was probably the least physically appealing of all the Disney princesses.And that, my friends, is so offensive in my opinion it canceled out all the good intentions...",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Absolutely Amazing,"I am sixteen years old, I recently pulled this film out of a box I found when moving. Remember, I was 5 when this film came out in England. My first reaction was...""wow"" I understand that Disney is well loved and when I was 5, this was just another favourite film, now I can safely say that it is my ultimate favourite film, there is so much depth that is just not obvious to a typical 5 year old.Like ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" it shows serious in-depth prejudice, the British settlers do not want to associate with the Native Americans and vice-versa. The British settlers want to completely take over and change the Native American's way of life. The depth touches me emotionally and along with the love story in all the political controversy, i found myself sobbing as the lovers parted knowing that they were unlikely to see one-another again. I know I am sixteen and probably too old to enjoy Disney, but quite frankly, I could not care less.I watched this film with my sister-in-law as a 5 year old, the other day, we sat together and watched it again as a memoir of the ""old days"" again, we both sat in tears, it's just a pity that the sequel did not match up to the historical context!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great music enhances a story refusing to exit Disney's rules for safe film-making,"I hate to admit, but Disney's Pocahontas, a film near and dear to my heart, is indeed severely flawed. Aside from the film's wonderful beautiful imaginative score, the true core of the film, the character relationships, and the depiction of another culture are frighteningly one-note. Pocahontas can be considered a true children's film. There isn't really anything of substance to engage a mature viewer outside of the die hard Disney/children's entertainment addicts, and admittedly without the film's inspired songs, it would be pretty banal. The film truly aims for a satisfactory portrayal of Native American Indians. Nothing objectable, nothing indecorous from what we expect from Disney. Unfortunately, the story and characterization fall along the same guidelines. The film establishes the Native American society as very close to nature, and that the invading colonies basically aren't. The cultural gaps between the protagonists are hastily filled with several occurrences of Disney 'magic' and the like. The film is missing a true human core. Most of the criticism seems to come from the fact that the film is grossly inaccurate on the real story of the pubescent Indian and the fully grown settler. I find such criticism unfair and irrational. The film doesn't aim to please devout historians, but more importantly, Disney has no intention of creating their first PG-13 animated cartoon. And here the film succeeds in that children can watch a film with the name ""Pocahontas"" that hints to the familiar story taking place in Virgina, a noticeably 'flat' Virigina. Which brings me to a not very often mentioned criticism. The 'Virgina"" in the film resembles some place in Colarado. I admire the film's stylization, but I have a slight qualm on not being able to appreciate flat Virgina in it's own beauty. It seems even more problematic in a film who's major theme seems to be nature and the often overlooked wonders of it amidst rapid industrialization and economical corruption. That minor criticism seems to personify the bigger picture in why the film 'fails'. It settles for a shallow look into culture and prejudice that's easily accessible to children but leaves adults unmoved, aside again from the amazing music that the Disney Co. does finest. And really, the music makes the film, not-really-profound dialouge aside.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
"The Late Masterpiece of Disney Animation...and even more dazzling in the ""10th anniversary edition!).","I have long been saddened by seeing this visually stunning, and emotionally enthralling animated classic be labeled ""Disneyfied History"". It was so easy to take a brave attempt at broadening an art and chop it down because it is not a documentary on the subject, or because it dares inject a bit of magic, whimsy, and humor into a ""True Story"".As the filmmakers stated from the beginning, this was intended to be a dramatization of the LEGEND of the ROMANCE between Pocahontas and John Smith. NEVER was it intended to be a 100% accurate documentation of the Historical events that happened (or MAY have happened) in the earliest days of ""Jamestown"".What was attempted, and what was achieved in rapturous beauty, was the most naturalistic and richly detailed Animated interpretation of nature, human figures, and a multi dimensional star crossed romance that rings true Emotionally if not historically.I very much hope that anyone interested in the art of animation will take another look, or see the superb 10th anniversary edition...which gives the lead characters the love theme that they were so rudely denied.This is a breathtaking, intelligent film that stands up well against the sublime ""The New World"" (another, even LESS appreciated film treatise of the Pocahontas tale...that was largely overlooked in 2005).It is to be treasured for it's superb songs, bewitching beauty, and unappreciated insights into Native American culture....and for being the most Dazzling Animated Film this side of ""Fantasia"".I am writing this as the Re-birth of Disney ""traditional"" ""Line Drawn"" animation is marked by the release of ""Enchanted"".It would be so wonderful to celebrate by acknowledging this film as the ultimate peak reached by the art (so far!!).",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
This one needed to grown on me,"Pocahontas was Disney's first attempt to have a story with people that have really lived. The problem however is that captain John Smith and Pocahontas might not ever have met in real life. I have no problem with the story at all but in this case they could have used fictional characters and not making it seem that this happened for real. The movie felt not like Disney except for the songs. The Colours of the wind is probably one of the best Disney songs ever. It's the classic Romeo an Julia story between a native girl and colonist man. This theme might have been done so many times that it gets boring at one point but I think it was done well here and makes you think, yes what if native Americans could have kept their land and culture? This movie needs multiple viewings to be liked, for me anyway.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
What a drag,"This is one of the worst things that has ever come out of Disney animation studios. What a bore. No amusing and witty characters in this one. After the movie I was really depressed because of the ending and the movie in whole.And apparently the whole story is bogus. No matter, in any case this movie really sucks. I remember every Disney movie I have ever seen. There's always something memorable in every single one. Pocahontas (and ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame""!!!) are like a bad Robert Zemeckis movie. They don't exist, at least in my mind. Don't bother seeing this one.         3/10",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
The worst Disney film I have ever seen!,"This is the real reason why I don't watch that many Walt Disney cartoons anymore.  I haven't seen ""Hercules"", and I'm not interested in ""Tarzan"". Basically, I think that the animators ran out of ideas, came across the name ""Pocahontas"", and suddenly thought they had a real movie in their hands. There is nothing new to any of the Disney films these days!  All of them run on the same formula; villain, hero, love interest, comic relief, and musical numbers.  I was so bored with this film, I don't even remember what happened during the course of the movie, nor did I care!  They really slipped up this time!  Sure ""Pocahontas"" was a real person, but that doesn't mean make it into a ""full-length animated feature""!  The music is not uplifting, like the heavenly score of ""The Lion King"".  The heroine, which is of course, the title character, really didn't impress or grab me.  The villain, oh forget about him.  He's just an annoyance.  John Smith does a good job, of serving no purpose.  The only character I liked in this film was Meeko, the pesky little raccoon.  Otherwise, this film went down before the first 5 minutes were up.    No new breakthroughs in animation and computer technologies were made either.   It's a shame, because Disney could've made it better, and I liked some of the other animated films, like ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"". I also hate to admit my disliking this movie, because my older sister really liked it.  But, to be perfectly honest, this was the worst Disney film that I have ever seen!  It's boring, undeveloped, uninteresting, and lacking in the qualities that a truly great Disney film owns and carries with pride! It makes me sad, because it ruined my faith in the Disney films, and my belief that they could ever make a great animated film ever again!",,Anonymous,Animation
"Not Infuriating, Well done animation and music","I feel like most people just agree that this movie is boring, which is very much is. I do kinda also get that people don't like how inaccurate the story is. I just kinda see it as an fictitious adaptation. I don't really think this movie was really trying to be accurate, because to be honest the Pocahontas story isn't really that historically documented. I like how they use the beautiful Native American America as the setting. I think it is very well made. The colors and landscapes are just amazing. The first time I watched this movie, I actually kinda like in spite of the overall negative reception. I wouldn't say I LOVED it, but it was okay. It is indeed boring, the characters don't really possess much personality. The entire movie feels very drawn out and thin. Some of the songs are amazing, such as Colors of the Wind. I would not be lying if I said this song kinda skewed me into liking this movie, cause without out it I would probably hate this movie. Everything in this movie is actually really forgettable besides it. But this song is just a gem.There really isn't a lot to say about it, but it isn't really that bad and the animation is amazing. But the romance, characters, and historical paralleled message about the harsh treatment of Native american's are overall poor.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Indian reservations,"Just watched this film on a rainy stay-in Saturday afternoon and it fitted the bill nicely. A romanticised re-telling of the celebrated romance between English soldier John Smith and Indian princess Pocahontas, it entertains in the main even if it occasionally panders a little too much to the pre-teen market with just too many cute animals whose presence you think may, in true JarJar Binks style, have had more to do with spin-off merchandising than enhancing the narrative. The overly-idealised images of the dashingly handsome, heroic and muscular Smith and the gamine and exotic beauty of Pocahontas for me somehow manage to somehow belittle their characters, at the expense of credibility and I suspect, true audience sympathy, but in its favour, the film arrives at a not completely happy-ending which is to its credit.Of course, being a Disney film, there has to be an identifiable bad guy for our hero and heroine, here personified by the greedy, avaricious figure of Lord Ratcliffe who has commissioned the expedition in a last-gasp attempt to strike it rich with the discovery of gold and also enhance his failing social position at court back home. Again however, he's too broadly painted for my taste, massively corpulent and duplicitous from the start. Likewise the contrast between the uncaring colonialists and the innocent native Indians comes across as clumsy and clichéd too.Maybe I'm being too severe, as all Disney animated films seemingly must posit, for the kids as much as anyone else the big moral of good versus evil, but being based this time on a true story and not a fairy tale, felt more subtlety could have been observed in the telling.On the plus side, the songs are good, with clever lyrics, even if you're not exactly whistling them after the film is over and the animation is fluid and engaging, although again i didn't recall too many ""Wow!"" stick-in-the-memory moments immediately afterwards. The voice acting too is mostly good although Billy Connolly's too-old and overly-recognisable broad Scottish accent jars occasionally.Maybe I'm being over-critical and it's easy to slightly denigrate the film with reference to previous Disney classics, but while pleasant enough, this didn't feel like one of the studio's very best outings.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

"No way, Jose...","I saw this with my family in theaters the week it came out, and I was incredibly disappointed.  The rest of the family hated it, too, which was odd considering we've always loved Disney animated films since forever.It was a bunch of things that made this movie sour.  There was no real plot... I mean, Pocahontas and John Smith must try to reconcile harsh feelings between the settlers and the Native Americans, but it proceeded slowly and didn't flow real well, and other than the fact that everyone must 'try to get along', there really WASN'T a plot.  There was also the violence; two people are shot, and some of the more passionate scenes were a little overdone.  I think the thing that confused most of the folks was how Pocahontas magically spoke English all of a sudden; one moment, she couldn't understand John Smith, and the next, she could suddenly converse with him.And the ending was awful.I'd say this ranks as one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  I usually expect more from Disney; if you want a really good Disney movie, rent The Lion King or Mulan.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
After a nine-year absence...,"... of watching this movie, I literally forgot everything about it.. except for ""Colors of the Wind."" So I was able to view it quite objectively.Okay, let's get one thing straight: this film is BY NO MEANS HISTORICALLY ACCURATE! Pocahontas wasn't a young woman when John Smith met her, but rather a young girl; she never fell in love with Captain Smith (there are some scholars who speculate on whether or not he actually tried to *rape* her); Pocahontas wasn't her real name, but a Hebrew nickname meaning ""playful one,"" given to her by the English (her real name was Matoaka); and I could go on and on about the history they got wrong in this movie. I suppose that, if I were an American Indian, perhaps I would be offended by this portrayal of Pocahontas, but since I'm a Euro-American with a very small part of American Indian (my great-great grandfather was a Blackfoot, adopted by an Irish family; and my great-great--uh, great?--grandmother was a Cherokee who walked the trail of tears), I can view this movie with less of a bias.The reason that I hadn't seen this movie in nine years was because, back when I was a little kid (I'm sixteen now), I cried. I was so used to Disney 'happy-endings' that I was saddened by the outcome of Pocahontas. And I refused to watch it ever again, so my mom sold it at the next garage sale. But after watching it now, I can appreciate how Pocahontas isn't Cinderella: she doesn't have a spare glass slipper so she can marry the prince; she's not Sleeping Beauty, who can just be kissed by her true love while she rests in ageless sleep; and she's not The Little Mermaid, whose fins are miraculously turned into human legs by her father so she can marry a human prince. Pocahontas and John SMith came from two very different worlds, ones that would fight for hundreds of years over the ownership of the ""New World."" I am glad, actually, that the ending isn't stereotypical Disney, but rather bittersweet and unforgettable. I love the fact that this is a Disney movie for emotionally mature audiences. I don't recommend it for children under thirteen.The music in this movie is amazing. ""Colors of the Wind"" won the Oscar, but I honestly think ""Just Around the Riverbend"" and ""If I Never Knew You"" are better! It's not just the wonderful melodies that add to the magic of Pocahontas, but also the deep, dark lyrics.I give this 8/10. Unfairly underrated.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"I found a video online that is ""Colors of the Wind"" but dubbed into 17 indigenous languages of the Americas.","It's difficult how to know how to approach this exactly. Its existence alone is a pretty interesting lecture I bet.Suffice to say that the plot is unusually austere but they handle the guilty white man learning better narrative better than any other thing.Not always captivating but the songs are inspirational, the atmospheric design of the forest and spirits are transcendent and and the girl herself plays the ""plucky"" heroine quite agreeably.

The songs is the only good thing.,"The songs for this movie are great and are a welcome treat between the mind-numbingly boring plot and the, quite frankly, dull looking animation. I remember watching this in the cinema as a child and only enjoyed the swirling winds animation when Pocahontas sings ""Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?"", otherwise the animation lacks shading which makes everything appear flat.For some reason, all the good characters just end up very bland and boring. And they have too much dialog for me to sit through, I'm certain more than 75% of this movie is just talking. Thankfully the sidekick animals don't have any words to speak, it was the only way I could even put up with them.I much more enjoy the soundtrack rather than the actual movie, even the instrumental pieces are wonderful.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A fairy tale, not a historical tale, but kids will enjoy it.","Pocahontas is a beautifully scored and  breathtakingly animated movie. The songs were lovely, Irene Bedard was moving and sincere. So why was I so disappointed?  Perhaps because I live within walking distance of the Jamestown National Historical Site and Jamestown Settlement.  Perhaps because I know that the animators spent many months doing extensive research on the sites and then ignored much of it. If you come to visit, you'll see Jamestown is beautiful, but don't expect the sweeping vistas and towering cliffs, and certainly don't expect to see any moose wandering around (we're a little far South for that)!Bring your children to see the real story if you can...or at least read the real story to them...it's just as interesting as the Disney version, but less marketable.How disappointed was I?

Pocahontas's Story,"To start things off, this is one of Disney's best movies. You can not beat a good old classic Disney movie. This film is not only entertaining, but it is also based on the history of the real Indian, Pocahontas. The story isn't hard to comprehend. In the movie, Captain John Smith sails to the New World of Jamestown Virginia with a group of settlers and falls in love with Pocahontas. That's pretty straight forward. It has amazing songs and animations, the story was great and the twist at the end, this isn't the typical Disney princess movie where the guy saves the girl. This is based on a real life person, it's so hard not to like it. If there was something negative to be said about this movie, it would be that it's not entirely historically accurate. But, that's okay because that gives Disney room to use some of their own creativity to make the movie entertaining. Which I think they did a fine job doing. I would really recommend watching this Disney movie first before seeing any other ones.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Good Movie with Great Animation,"I never saw this movie as a kid, mainly because I thought it would too girly and/or boring. I had read reviews that were positive and mixed. Eventually, I decided to watch it and I don't think it's as bad as others might make it out to be.The best thing this movie has going for it is the animation. The drawing style seems to stand out from some of the previous Disney movies that came out before it. The backgrounds are beautiful to look at, especially the nature ones and the characters are pretty well- drawn too.Some of the songs are pretty good. My two favourites are ""Just Around The Riverbend"" and ""Colors of The Wind"" (both the movie version and the cover version by Vanessa Williams). The other songs are good, but I just like these two the most. This is the only movie I know of where Mel Gibson sings and is surprisingly really good.Pocahontas is a decent Disney female lead character. There's not a whole lot new to her compared to some of the other Disney female characters prior to her, but she's beautiful to look at and she's interesting enough that she's not much of a bore.The rest of the human characters are okay, but again, there's nothing really too special about them, including John Smith and the villain, Governor Ratcliffe.My favourite character is Meeko, the raccoon that usually stays near Pocahontas. I love how he changes expression so quickly and looks so cute doing it. He's also delightfully mischievous, giving Percy (Ratcliffe's dog) and Flit, the hummingbird. The scenes with these animal characters are pretty funny and enjoyable to watch.I'm not very familiar with the story of the real Pocahontas and I know this film gets criticized for its historical inaccuracies. The only inaccuracy I know about is that Pocahontas was about 11 or 12 years old when she met John Smith who was in his late 20's or early 30's at the time. The movie has Pocahontas as a woman in her late teens or early 20's for obvious reasons.Overall, I think Pocahontas is a pretty good Disney animated movie. I'm glad I saw it and I see both the good and bad of this film. It does have a slow pace at times and doesn't quite have the level of energy and fun that some of the other Disney films before it had, but it's still pretty good and I definitely will continue to re- watch it for years to come.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Disney Oscar bait,"Pocahontas (1995) is popularly regarded as the film which led to the death of the Disney Renaissance. While I am of the opinion that this period reached its peak with Beauty and the Beast (1991), I do agree that this misfire marked the beginning of the end of Disney's second golden age.While the animation and color palette are gorgeous, and the musical numbers are classic, the character design is overall unexpressive. The story is recycled and dull, and the characters are all one-dimensional. Pocahontas and John Smith may be the most uninspired lovers in the Disney canon, generating little chemistry.Then there's the historical inaccuracy. The real Pocahontas' life was nothing at all like what is depicted here and I feel it was insensitive of Disney to turn such a painful and bloody part of history into an animated fairy tale for the family crowd. Altering an adult novel like The Hunchback of Notre Dame is no big deal, in my view, but whitewashing over history is much more problematic.Of course, this movie is also pretentious, trying to be so much more epic and important than it is, trying its best to top the maturity of Beauty and the Beast and nab another Best Picture nomination. It failed miserably and only started the beginning of the end for one of Disney's most triumphant decades.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Less fondly-remembered of Disney's catalogue, but deserves more credit","Made during the era now known as the 'Disney Renaissance' between 1989 and 1999, Pocahontas is one of the least fondly remembered of a wave of films that also included the likes of The Little Mermaid (1989), Beauty and the Beast (1991) and The Lion King (1994), all of which are now considered giants of the Disney back-catalogue. It received mixed reviews upon its release, with some seeing a bravery in the films desire to tell a more serious story, and others lamenting its lack of memorable musical numbers and three dimensional supporting characters. And 'mixed' is precisely the way I felt when the credits started to roll.In 1607, a ship named the Susan Constant arrives at the New World carrying settlers and fortune-seekers from England. Led by the dastardly Governor Ratcliffe (David Ogden Stiers) who means to strip the lands of all of its riches so he can return to England as a success, the ship also carries the dashing John Smith (Mel Gibson), the captain seen as a hero by his crew-mates after saving young deck-sweeper Thomas (Christian Bale) from drowning during a storm. Further inland, the beautiful and free-spirited Pocahontas (Irene Bedard, with Judy Kuhn providing the singing vocals) fears the prospect of marriage to stoic warrior Kocoum (James Apamunt Fall), arranged by her father and tribe chief Powhatan (Russell Means). As tensions between the settlers and the natives grow, Smith and Pocahontas form a romantic bond that will shake the foundations of both camps.Pocahontas deserves to be applauded for its refusal to gloss over the racial aspects of a story aimed primarily at children. Smith isn't simply the traditional square-jawed Disney prince, and early on boasts about the amount of 'savages' he has killed during his adventuring. There's clearly blood on his hands but, through his relationship with Pocahontas, learns of the value and importance of nature, as well as the peaceful ways of her tribe's culture. The song Savages has both sides portraying the other as, well, savages, demonstrating their natural fear and distrust of a culture they know little about. Yet there is a distinct lack of fun to the film, with only Pocahontas's animal side-kicks providing some much-needed light-hearted comic relief. Outside of the two leads, the supporting characters are wafer-thin, with Ratcliffe paying the moustache- twirling villain, and Powhatan the wise, mystical old man. It's also unlikely you'll be whistling the songs afterwards.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Not a bad film, just lacking in some parts.","Pocahontas (1995) is an animated musical crafted by Walt Disney Pictures and loosely based on the life of a Powhatan woman called Pocahontas. It narrates colonization by English settlers and Pocahontas' encounter with one of them, John Smith. Upon meeting, they begin to fall in love with each other. As external pressures increase on each side, both Pocahontas and John face issues that keep them apart.The film itself has beautiful, vibrant colors but the animation just falls flat sometimes. There are many songs composed by Alan Menken and subsequently won an Academy Award, that being ""Colors of the Wind"". The romance between Pocahontas and John Smith brought a fresh perspective on accepting people's differences and unlearning prejudices. However, the characters themselves were a bit uninteresting. Those non-human, ""side-kick"" characters were exasperating at times and their antics got old quickly. Finally, the messaging about accepting others differences in order to live amicably is a necessary one but historically untrue as the power of love did not stop the atrocities committed by the English.This film is evidently not one of Disney's finest, but it tried to be different and bring a fresh perspective. There is nothing wrong with trying, all it needed was better execution.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

While not having such immense impact as the two previous Disney animations, ""The Lion King"" and ""Aladdin"", ""Pocahontas"" still provokes the mind and questions how and why the Natives where mistreated by the settlers. A quick answer would be the times when those events occurred, but that will never excuse the actions themselves.As with any Disney animated feature film, the songs are what everyone should be looking for, and ""Pocahontas"" delivers with a beautiful original soundtrack, winning two Academy awards, one for the everlasting song ""Colors of the Wind"".""Pocahontas"" is a good Disney movie, but it will not make the top ten list.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Not the love story, but the freedom she has was something that I personally longed for. Also the way the native Americans find wisdom and guidance in nature. So much can be learned from them.

"Not the greatest Disney film, but much better than some would have you believe","You know what, all you overly sensitive American critics out there. You're right, the Native Americans portrayed in this film are either a mishmash of different tribes, if not outright wrong. You're right, there are no majestic hillsides and mountains on the shores of Eastern USA. And yeah, there sure are no talking trees there either. You know what, as well? I don't care! It's a Disney film. I don't think ancient Chinese warriors were lead into battle by tiny dragons who sounded like Eddie Murphy. Neither do I think that Ancient Greece was the birthplace of gospel music.The fact that the story took liberties with the source material is no reason to dismiss a Disney film. On the other hand, the fact that the story itself has some major problems, is.But, even though this film is pretty much the most hated of the Disney Renaissance films, it did get a lot of things right as well. There are no mountains in the Eastern USA, but they sure do look pretty as the backgrounds of this film. The animation is all around flawless. The more simplistic character models take a minute to get used to, but after that they look very good. The songs are also very good, with Colors of the Wind being one of my all-time favourite Disney songs. And even though the Native American shown here don't bear as much resemblance to the real thing as some would like them to, I always thought they were pretty cool. They had a flourishing civilization going on, yet it was clearly different from the European one. They were fearless warriors and the movie shows these two peoples as equals, both in their capacity for good as well as for evil. That's a very good lesson to teach to children.But unfortunately the story isn't one of Disney's better ones. It's too simplistic, too safe, too what you'd expect. Most of the other Renaissance films took chances, delving into some rather dark places in the process. They weren't simply cookie cutter films produced to make money. I don't get that feeling from Pocahontas. Because, when you get down to it, what's the most basic plot an animated film could tell if you had to tell a story about the colonization of America? Easy, you say. An early pioneer comes to America from Europe, meets a cute Indian girl, the two sides resist, tensions rise, but of course eventually you'll have your happy ending. Well that's Pocahontas.And they had so many options to go with. They could have shown us time, even years, passing as these two peoples slowly learned to tolerate each other, with Pocahontas and John Smith working as the bridge. They could have increased the amount of supernatural, now we only have Grandmother Willow. They could have drawn inspiration from actual Native American legends and myths. Anything but this poor man's Romeo and Juliet.Nevertheless, I do think it's a good film. Sure, the characters and the story are not as good as they could have been, but they're still good enough. And, as stated, the production values and technical aspects are pretty much flawless. Not deserving of its scorn, would be my final word.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Hard core hate from a true Disney fan,"Yes, hate is a strong word but to whatever extent hate can apply to a film I hate Disney's Pocahontas.

And I'm happy learning corrections to that story sometimes as new evidence is presented over time. Those who want to blow that off and pretend that movies (or children's movies or Disney movies) can't portray history and be good movies or that people who want to see history not turned into a sewage by Disney have something wrong with them and need to just get over it are not helping matters with their strawmen and their useless and foolish insults.This is not about a few mild inconsistencies or poetic license. This film is so wrong in so many ways that to say that they pirated the names of historical figures and made up bald face lies about them while diligently working to not accidentally say much of anything true about them would seem closer to the reality of the movie than any other description I can think of. There is truly no justification or rational that can work for how hard Disney worked to cover over the history with falseness.And although they really try to portray Pocahontas and her people as better and the ""white people"" as wrong and bigoted they still manage to portray mostly only lies about Pocahantas and her people thus robbing them of their dignity and the related beauty that exists and is easily conveyed in the true history. Historically there were flaws and virtues in all the real characters. They were all humans. And they could have all been treated respectfully by any storyteller who saw at least a small part of the real value in this little episode of history.This movie was abysmal when my kids were young. Now that I have rewatched it just once from being a somewhat mellowed out grandma who thought maybe it's not as bad as I remember ...well it just reignited the heat of my initial anger at Disney for robbing the real Pocahontas. Her true story is both beautiful and tragic. It deserves to be told. I hope all those cursed with having seen this steaming pile of lies later get the chance to experience some of the essence of the real Pocahontas from more worthy storytellers.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
powerful love story!!,"I have to admit, when this came out when i was 5, it wasn't one of my favourite Disney films... least i don't remember it being.But recently, I've been watching all my Disney films again (a way to get away from GCSEs meh!) and Pocahontas just got me!! I loooved it!! The songs were stuck in my head for ages. And the love between Pocahontas and John Smith just aah!! Sooo romantic. The line ""Pocahontas, id rather die tomorrow, than live 100 years without knowing you"" is one of the most beautiful quotes I've ever heard. The ending is so sad tho, most Disney films they live happily ever after, but john smith has to go back to Britain. Its very sad :(I really do believe this film is probably the most beautiful Disney film there ever was. Its weird, now that I'm older, i understand it more, so maybe thats why it wasn't one of my favourites when i was a kid, because i didn't understand the love, the history.However I BEG OF YOU!! if you love this film, PLEASE do not watch the sequel. It will ruin it for you, i promise.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Weakest Film of the Disney Renaissance,"Pocahontas is the 33rd full-length animated feature released by Walt Disney Pictures in 1995. Billed by Disney with the tagline of ""An American Legend Brought to Life"", it is the story of the free-spirited Pocahontas who seeks to convince her father Chief Powhatan to make peace between her Native American tribe and the English settlers of the New World of Jamestown that arrive in search of gold and prosperity. During the production of this film, then Chairman of the Walt Disney Studios Jeffrey Katzenberg regarded Pocahontas as a home run film film for Disney in light of what he thought to be the more mature story in comparison to ""The Lion King"", which was released a year earlier. However, while it was the 4th highest grossing film world-wide in '95 and did pretty well on the home video market in '96, this film didn't quite live up to the standard set by its predecessors like The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and The Lion King. However, while it's my least favorite film of the storied Disney Renaissance era, there were still some things that I actually liked about the film which I will highlight in this review.I'd say that like most of the Disney films that came out before (and especially during) the Renaissance period for Disney, Pocahontas is very strong in the music department! Before I ever saw this movie, I remember being in awe of the song ""Colors of the Wind"", which is the scene that appeared in the previews for the VHS of The Lion King. In spite of the shallow character development (which I will highlight in this review), Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz did a fantastic job on the songs and the score in this movie. For me, the song ""If I Never Knew You"" takes the cake for best song in this movie and it's only sung in the credits for the theatrical version of the film. I liked how deep the lyrics are as they highlight the meaning behind John Smith's line ""I'd rather die tomorrow than live 100 years without knowing you"", which he quotes to Pocahontas right before he is to be executed the next dawn. I do wish that they left the song in the final cut of the film, but it is on the special edition DVD/Blu-Ray version. I also enjoyed the song ""Savages"" mainly because it highlights the animosity that the settlers have towards the Native Americans for capturing John Smith as well as the animosity that the Native Americans have towards the settlers and John Smith for the death of one of their own (even though it wasn't him that pulled the trigger). The song serves as a reminder to us that we should never justify killing/wanting to kill someone out of hatred just because they might be different than us.Now for the weaknesses of the film. Oh boy, where to start! While the movie is based off of the Native American legend and the Disney animators did the right thing by going to Jamestown to get the inspiration for their animation, they definitely missed the ball in a few areas. Let's touch on some of the historical inaccuracies for a bit. In 1607 (the year that the settlers arrived to Jamestown and which the movie is set), Pocahontas (who was born in 1596) was around 10-11 years old when she met John Smith, who was 26-27 years old at the time. Did that matter to Disney though? No, because they just had to make this a love story in the vein of Beauty and the Beast and Little Mermaid. However, unlike Pocahontas, those stories are fairy tales. This is key part of American history and now that I'm older I definitely think that Disney did a great disservice to children by taking what could've been an educational introduction to the Native American legend by giving them a love story that didn't happen in real life. Anyways, as far as character development is concerned, while not nearly as dull, wooden, bland, and static as Aurora, Snow White, or Cinderella, Pocahontas (voiced by Irene Bedard) is still a pretty boring and one-dimensional character with very little motive to her, which is a shame with her being the main protagonist and all. While also underdeveloped and one-dimensional, I found her best friend Nakoma to be a much more interesting character than that of Pocahontas. The rest of the Native Americans such as Chief Powhatan (voiced by Russell Means) and Kocoum (who is your basic stereotypical jock placed in colonial times) were pretty flat and boring too. I actually found the settlers to be much more entertaining, mainly the comic screwball Wiggins! As far as John Smith (voiced by Mel Gibson) is concerned, I would've much rather seen him portrayed with the harsh and gruff exterior that he showed to his men in real life. The best characters in this film were Meeko, Flit (voiced by Frank Welker), and Grandmother Willow (voiced by Linda Hunt), who is by far one of the wisest characters that Disney has ever created. Another thing that made the four films which preceded this one (and a few that came after it) was a strong, round, and dynamic Disney antagonist. In this one we get Governor Ratcliffe (voiced by the late great Disney legend David Ogden Stiers). While he did a good job (as he always does) of voicing the character, Ratcliffe still remains a forgettable villain when compared to the likes of Scar, Jafar, Hades, Frollo, and other villains in the Disney catalog as he lacked that despicable, disgusting nature that is trademark of a memorable Disney villain.So, while I think that this movie as a whole is the weakest of this era of Disney magic in regards to story (not being historically factual) and character development (being shallow and one-dimensional), it was still a decently animated film with great songs and music that deserves at least one viewing. Not my favorite (even though I did own it on VHS growing up), but still worth showing to your kids on family movie night! Rating: 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Hunt for the Real Story of Pocahontas,"Pocahontas directed by Michael Gabriel presents a fictionalized chronicle of the arrival of the English settlers in Jamestown, Virginia in 1607.  Led by the greedy, bombastic Governor Ratcliffe (voice of David Ogden Stiers) and Captain John Smith (voice of Mel Gibson), the explorers have come to the New World in search of gold.  They promptly begin cutting down trees, digging holes, and preparing to kill Indians.  Meanwhile, a young woman, Pocahontas (voice of Irene Bedard), observers the newcomers with a mixture of curiosity and trepidation.  Her father, Chief Powhatan (Russel Means), is certain that the landing of the white men means war.  The only hope to avert a battle between the Indians and English settlers arises out of the romance that develops between John Smith and Pocahontas.Anyone who expects historical accuracy from a Disney animated film should be ashamed of themselves.  In reality, Pocahontas was a 12-year old girl with over 100 siblings from her father's many marriages as chief of the Powhatan Indians.  She had a break with her father and moved to another village when she was 14 where she is rumored to have married the Kokwam from the movie. Pocahontas was captured and held in captivity by the English for ransom, which was never paid in full.  She was moved to another English settlement where she fell in love with another Englishman, John Rolfe, whom she married in a peacemaking marriage between the Indians and English.  Rolfe converted Pocahontas to Christianity and he went with her back to England where she was honored and met the king and queen. Sadly, though she died in England before she could return back to America.  Furthermore, John Smith in real life was a bit of a professional adventurer as he had endured many escalades in the Mediterranean where he was captured as a soldier. He was then forced into slavery, which he escaped from and traveled all over Europe to return home to England.  He was the only man to come over to America actually on three ships that had any real leadership experience, as the other men on the voyage were noble gentlemen. Smith whose stories were known to be a little sketchy at best alledgedly was scouting the land outside Jamestown when Indians captured him.  Smith awed the Indians with a compass he had with him and was depicted in the movie as the spinning arrow in Pocahontas' dream. Nonetheless, Powhattan imprisoned Smith for some time before sentincing him to death.  Then according to Smith as he was about to be struck by the ball over the head as shown in the movie Pocahontas jumped on top of him and pled with her father to spare Smith.  Yet, there never was any emotional relationship between the two as was falsely depicted in the movie.  Smith did go on to become a sort of adopted son to Powhattan after his capture until on another scouting mission his gun powder exploded in his pocket forcing him to return home to England for treatment.  In the film, the material culture was fairly well done.  The Indian village was recreated fairly accurately with the depiction of the longhouses but a log wall that surrounded the village failed to be portrayed.  In the summer the Powhatan would live in wigwams, which were left out of the movie.  The clothing of the English was accurate, as were the loincloths and moccasins of the Indian men.  However, the Indian women did not wear tops to their dresses as shown in the film.  The natives did possess primitive tattooing techiques but not advanced ehough to make patterns like the one seen on Pocahontas' arm and were more likely to paint their bodies.  In addition to the bows seen in the film, the Indians possessed spears, tomahawks, and small knives for weapons. As shown in the movie, there were dug out canoes in Indian society but most of the fishing was done with nets not spears.  The English at Jamestown had basic shovels, axes, and picks as seen but no wheelbarrels.  The ignition system of the matchlock guns used by the English was well portrayed yet the lack of accuracy of these guns was not shown.  The Indians were in fact leery of the English when they arrived and did initially skirmish with the white men as shown in the movie.  The Indians' concept of property as communal and the white's as personal was depicted as well.  Furthermore, lacosse was played by the Indians but not the version shown in the movie as the games were huge spanning several miles at a time.A recognizable message can be seen in the movie Pocahontas as the need for tolerance between those of different races and cultures is evident throughout the film.  The director, Michael Gabriel, shows this by initially having the English and the Indians, who are from very different cultural and ethic backgrounds skirmish and prepare for battle.  Yet, he has John Smith and Pocahontas unite these two different cultures together.  They show how misconceptions or ignorence about the other culture caused this amnimosity, which once they actually interacted with each other was nowhere to be found. In addition, this film is a reflection of the values of the 1990's when it was produced as it gives a more accurate and politically correct representation of Native Americans in the film.  The character of Pocahontas was physically modeled after Irene Bedard, a woman with Indian heritage who also did the speaking voice of Pocahontas.  In addition, Native American activist Russel Means did the voice of Chief Powhatan.  This was done in part to assure the support of Native Americans who could have protested and made a big to do over the changing of the actual story, which the moviemakers did not want to occur.Technically the film is very sound.  It uses visually creative techniques in its animation that are leading the way for the movie industry.  The scenery, which may have been a bit exaggerated in its depiction of Jamestown, Virginia, is beautiful, as are all the characters in this full-length animated color film.  The music by Alan Menken throughout the movie is electrifying in greatly adding to the overall experience.All in all, Pocahontas is an enjoyable viewing experinece that I would recommend to both kids and adults.  The question about the movie lingers whether the lack of a happily ever after ending will hurt the movie in the eyes of audiences.  Pocahontas is sure to entertain viewers and hopefully by transporting both kids and parents alike to another time and place will inspire children to learn the actual history of this legendary story and their parents to teach them the real account.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Pocahontas review,"Pocahontas is a movie in the Disney Renaissance about the story of the Native American of the same name. Since it's Disney, they have made it where it appeals to younger children and is likely not too historically accurate. The actual story could be way darker/more mature. I find the ending came by a little quick but the story overall was okay. It really shows how the British colonizers and the Native Americans have interacted. They wouldn't have liked each other as they just hate each other's people (colonizers want the native Americans' land). I find that the most historically accurate part of it. Obviously the Native Americans didn't just magically know English. Those two things are the first things that come to mind that's historically accurate or not. This is definitely way more of a Disney film than a historical one, so it's definitely more for the classic Disney fans.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
It's Stupid,"Pocahontas is very possibly Disney's worst creation. This movie has two (count them: two) redeeming qualities. 1: The music is pretty cool. Not astounding, not amazing (it doesn't even come close to The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King, or even freaking Aladdin), but pretty cool. 2: The animation is nice to watch. Again, not astounding, not amazing (nowhere near as cool as The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King, or freaking Aladdin), but it is a high point of the film. Other than that, it blows.The biggest problem with the movie is that it pretty much takes US history and Native American history and rapes it. Pocahontas, instead of being like 13, is a full 18. Why? So she can have a love affair (something too often milked by Disney) with John Smith, whom is basically worshipped in this movie. Granted, I don't think historical accuracy should make or break a film, but here, it's WAY off. It's like if a movie depicted George Washington with superhuman strength. We kill Native Americans for gold, Pocahontas and John Smith communicate through freaking *magic*, and coastal Virginia is abundant in cliffs. Cliffs!And it's also saying something if I didn't even find this movie very entertaining when I was younger. Not because of the historical inaccuracies, but because it's just stupid. The characters are bland as sh*t, all of the parts concerning magic are nonsensical, and the storyline is wholly undeserving of its ""epic"" depiction. I put the word ""epic"" in quotes because even though they did try to make it look epic, at the end of the day, it just didn't happen.So, Pocahontas's biggest problem is that it's stupid. I feel like the filmmakers never bothered to read any history or anything about this subject. At all. And the characters are dull, the voice actors aren't really all that interesting, and the dialogue is pretty much worthless. Not Disney's best endeavor. Very possibly Disney's worst.3/10",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Unforgettable animated film!,"Great lead character!Other characters like Powhatan, Grand mother Willow, Nikoma and the animals all add a depth to the story and really contribute to an atmosphere of spirits ( Pocahontas' mother in the movie is actually the wind).The star of this movie however is without a doubt the score composed by the ever-so talented Alan Menken. Songs like "" Just Around the Riverbend"" and ""Colours of the Wind"" are worthy of any other great Disney song, and ""Savages"" is an intense number, which shows the collision of two hates, with flame and smoke symbolising warfare, and the end of the new world with the colonisation of the modern world. The best song in the movie is the one played during the End Cred its, ""If I Never Knew You"", a truly beautiful love song that captures the essence of the film and the love between Poc and Smith.All in all, this is a very underrated movie, one of Disney's finest, with a good moral message in it as well, it is a must-see for all children out there. As for us adults, it's educative to us too, but more so, it makes you giggle.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A pretty work of fiction.,"Is this a historical rendition of the Pocahontas story? Not in the slightest. Putting that aside, it is beautiful to look at and had a strong cast, with many of the primary vocal performances for the Native American characters played by actors of Native descent. The music is beautiful, and the animal characters add levity to some of the more serious scenes.The long and short of it is that you should not go into this Disney Classic with the hopes of learning actual history. The lessons in the film center around respect of nature and compassion for others, no matter their background. It has a narrative that shows how ignorant things like racism are, and that we can be better.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Disney history,It's 1607 London. Governor Ratcliffe leads an expedition looking to find a mountain of gold in exploiting the new world. Swashbuckling ship captain John Smith (Mel Gibson) encounters native princess Pocahontas and they fall in love. The two sides are on a collision course to war and only the two lovers can stop it.History as Disney princess drama can be dangerous territories. This one papers over some stuff leaving a questionable rendering from a kiddie history book. Ratcliffe is imbued with all the cartoon villainy. John Smith is the square jawed soldier with limited charisma and Pocahontas is the perfect heroine. The English side is not that compelling. It's too broad and too Disney. I find the native side much more compelling. It would serve the movie well to concentrate more on their point of view. It doesn't need the scenes from the English side. This does have the great song Colors of the Wind by Vanessa Williams as is in the Disney tradition. This is more Disney than history lesson. That's the only concern I have with this movie. Kids wouldn't understand the liberties taken with facts and adult wouldn't find this that compelling.,6.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Pioneering for Disney's cultural diversity, an animation wonder with still relevant messages today. Not historically accurate but it never meant to be.","A mesmerizing spectacle of colors, contrasting cultures, music and absurdly-well animated characters. While not historically accurate, at the time it meant Disney was finally focusing on making more culturally diversed movies with an almost pitch-perfect tale of two people from different worlds who when meeting opened their hearts and had an eye-opening realisation: that they weren't so different after all.While those who criticise this movie would do so by comparing the historical accuracy of the historical figures these characters are meant to portray, need I remind them that it is a loose adaptation of the story in the same way Disney has adapted every single film ever since they began making them.There are tons of documentaries faithful to the story and tons of books that can be researched for a more historically accurate depiction of the characters. Animated movies have thrived on using colors to emote, nature-based symbolism and many child-friendly ""gimmicks"" for the younger audiences to provide engaging and heartfelt stories that would speak not only to them but adults too. Even if the age of Pocahontas was different and she wasn't ""over-sexualized"" as some have put it, would it still be okay for them to see her with 3 animal friends, a grandma willow tree that talks and the incredibly mesmerizing colors of the wind?Surely, some of the logistics of the story may be hard to grasp at first, for instance how would two different cultures communicate in the same language, but just like Disney gave voices to animals in many of their movies in order to make it more accesible to children especially, here a sequence was dedicated to sort of ""explain"" how would they actually communicate. And so goes for other elements that might seem ilogical, the movie is not trying to be a perfect depiction of native americans and the arrival of english men to their shores, it is a tale that serves as a vessel for an important message involving interracial interactions and acceptance of what is different and unknown to us.All in all, many animated movies, and especially Disney, have never been known to have the most accurate adaptations to the source material. Granted, it might be wrong to use well-known historical figures or fictional characters and stories to tell a tale that would otherwise also function and have the same impact if the main character wasn't called Pocahontas, but it's not like Disney is known for that. So for those who complain about this sort of thing, I might as well tell you that I'm personally a big Spider-Man fan and to this day there hasn't been a non-animated faithful adaptation of the source material but that didn't take away from the gratification of seing its essence captured in the ones that were made.IN CONCLUSION, don't judge a book by its cover, this movie is well-paced, well written and acted, the animation is so engaging and hypnotic it still holds today and the themes from the symbolism of the arrow to the non-conflict-but-deep-resolution conclusion is original and impactful. The movie is meant to be taken lightly as some aspects are glanced over and most pieces fall into place in many occasions, but the songs are not forced and enhance the message it tries to send, the characters feel real and I just can't get over the little gestures and mannerisms in the animation of the characters. It is a classic of animation and a trully well-crafted movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A visually stunning tale of cultural encounter,"""Pocahontas,"" the 1995 Disney animated film, tells the story of a Native American woman and her encounters with English settlers. Voiced by Irene Bedard, Pocahontas is a free-spirited and brave heroine who seeks harmony between her people and the newcomers. The film explores her relationship with Captain John Smith, voiced by Mel Gibson, and her efforts to bridge the cultural divide.Visually, ""Pocahontas"" is a masterpiece. The animation captures the beauty of the American wilderness with vibrant colors and fluid motion, bringing the lush landscapes and serene rivers to life. The film's soundtrack, featuring songs like ""Colors of the Wind"" and ""Just Around the Riverbend,"" is both memorable and moving, enhancing the emotional depth of the story.While the film is beautiful and the message of unity and understanding is commendable, it has faced criticism for its historical inaccuracies and oversimplification of complex cultural issues. Despite this, ""Pocahontas"" remains a captivating film with strong performances and a heartfelt narrative. It's a Disney classic that offers a blend of romance, adventure, and thought-provoking themes.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"""Johnny Smith and Poker-Huntas"" was the only interesting portrayal that I've seen","It was one thing for Disney to make animated features of self-proclaimed fictional stories (""Cinderella"", ""Aladdin"", etc.). But it's going too far to make a fantasy story and try to pass it off as history. That's just what they do with ""Pocahontas"". While they prided themselves on treating Indians more respectfully, the Indians come across as noble savages (meaning how white people prefer to view them, even if it is a positive portrayal). The images are very modern: Pocahontas is a princess with giant breasts and a skinny waist (a Barbie doll, if you will), while John Smith is a hunky dude.Around the time that the movie came out, I participated in a review of it on a local radio station. Having recently studied the history of Jamestown*, I could see that the movie got little if anything right, and so I challenged almost everything that the other reviewers said. The fact is that Disney - a corporation with kiddie entertainment as its main purpose - is not ready to tell the real story of what happened, and may never be ready to. As I understand it, when the English people first saw Pocahontas, she was naked and bald. The English, meanwhile, lacked any hygiene.All in all, if you want a realistic portrayal of the events surrounding the Jamestown settlement, this is the last version that you'll want to watch. But Terrence Malick's ""The New World"" isn't much better, lasting way too long and plodding the whole way through. The best version that I've seen is unfortunately one of the more racist ones: the Merrie Melodies 1938 cartoon ""Johnny Smith and Poker-Huntas"", starring Elmer Fudd's prototype Egghead as John Smith. As this cartoon was directed by Tex Avery, it was naturally chock-full of sight gags, the sort of stuff that one would expect to find in a Marx Brothers movie or a Leslie Nielsen movie. While it did contain the average stereotypical portrayals of Indians, it was one of the cleverest cartoons that I've seen.Now, I understand that some people might assert that ""Pocahontas"" doesn't have to be totally realistic. Maybe so, but the problem is that it claims to be based on historical events. I, for one, do not consider a fantasy pretending to be history very appropriate. In summer, 1995, Mel Gibson starred in - and directed - another less than totally accurate historical movie: ""Braveheart""; well, that one was much more accurate than this one. Just avoid this one, OK?*John Smith eventually had to return to England after getting injured in a gunpowder explosion. Without him, the rest of the colonists decided that they no longer had to do any work. Come winter, the settlement totally collapsed",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
What a world of difference! Excellent! Disney finally gets it right!!,"I just got this 10th anniversary edition today and I LOVE it! The additional scene with the beautiful love song ""If I Never Knew You"" brings the movie all together and it makes much more sense with the scene. For years I had heard that there was a 'missing scene' in this movie, and I remember thinking how the original scene in the teepee between Pocahantas and John Smith seemed so abruptly cut short and terribly truncated. About 5 years ago on ABC, The Wonderful World of Disney showed Pocahantas with this 'deleted scene', but it was not complete. At the time it featured 'live' animation of the view of the hole through the top of the teepee, and stills with voice-overs from Mel Gibson and Irene Bedard. The big deal at the time was that it featured Mel Gibson singing, and I remember seeing an interview with Mel at the time saying (sic) ""I got to sing a love song but they cut the scene!"" But the funny thing is that I could swear that I read that this scene was complete at the time the original was released, but cut just before the release. (Anyone know about this?) I guess it doesn't matter now because the Disney Co. finally restored this very touching and beautiful song to this anniversary version, and it makes the story so much more real and compelling. There is also a reprise of the couple singing the song just before the end and it is the icing on the cake. I'm not always pleased with Disney DVD releases, but this one they got right! Also, they had the sense to release it in the widescreen ratio so you get to see the whole, beautiful product in all of its glory! (They should do this with all their releases!--How about a widescreen special edition of MoonSpinners? Hint-Hint!) Also, you can watch the original theatrical release on this DVD, but I don't know why you'd want to! P.S. Mel sings beautifully!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Definitely a film that distinguishes itself from other films outside the company, if not within it.","Disney was arguably at the top of their game in the early to mid-nineties, maybe even rivalling their original Golden Age back in the beginning. The secret to this was a somewhat new, but still rather basic template that most of their greats embraced: an array of catchy and moving songs, sweeping score, beautiful animation, engaging story, a mixture of lively and sympathetic characters and a diverse sense of humour that spreads across a broad age range. An ominous thing to follow up, which is exactly what Disney did with this, their first animated feature based on documented history, that of Pocahontas, the American Indian Princess romanced by the soldier John Smith, part of a crew of early European settlers trying to purge the New World. Their love is one that births in the midst of a conflict between the ever consuming and greedy settlers and the peaceful but weary Powhatan Indians. Can their love spawn a realisation that both sides can teach each other so much more than they can destroy?I won't pretend to know anything substantial about the history of the New World, or what really did happen between Pocahontas and John Smith, and even if I did, I'd still base my opinion more broadly on the quality of film presented and the story that it's trying to tell, even if it might be far from established truth, which Disney is no stranger in. Saying this however, ""Pocahontas"" does represent a very sanitised version of the relationship between the European conqueror's and the Powhatan Indians. The main gist of what was happening at the time is present, but it hardly reeks of authenticity. However, Disney went to great strengths to give an accurate portrayal of the Native Indians in their film (due to oversensitive PC disputes over their previous films' cultural portrayals) and they do a commendable job as most of the attire and cultural behaviour looks to be quite authentic and raw.""Pocahontas"" contains most of the commendable traits previously outlined, only this time it downplays the playful elements. This is a serious tale of tragic love, racial tolerance and a slightly overused conservationist theme. Some of the establishing characteristics of the Indians are a bit over done. The Powhatans seem to have a Utopian life, typically in tune with nature and with each other, which is good and all, but comes off as a little forced. However this is only glaringly apparent in brief moments. Plus some of the lessons to be learnt throughout the film can sometimes seem heavy handed, too obviously amplified for the kids' benefit. And my last gripe, the resolution at the end seemed lazy and convenient, plus the language barriers encountered by the two races, while handled in an outrageously but suitably intriguing way early in the film, become inconsistent and implausible later on.But ""Pocahontas"" does have undeniable positives. The animation is a change in style that harks back to the angular, stained glass look to ""Sleeping Beauty"". It works beautifully and gives the West Virginian forests a grand majesty, along with the characters who also look great. Colours are vibrant and often reflect the mood of the more intense scenes. CGI is used sparingly but most prominently in the character Grandmother Willow, a standout in this film for artistic and technical prowess. We also have three cute sidekicks, all of which are silent for a change. We have Pocahontas' Meeko the raccoon, Flit the hummingbird and General Radcliffe's Percy, a smug pug. The physical antics of these guys reflect the main conflict in the story, which is a nice touch. Their lack of dialogue also lends a far more endearing quality to them.The romance is handled well and does generate a sense of tragedy. The conflict between the races, while sanitized historically, is still very well done, with both sides having negative and positive traits that are rightfully juxtaposed throughout the film. But overall the narrative seems simplistic and heavy handed at times when representing racial equality amidst the conflict and its spiritual vibe towards peaceful living with nature.Voice work is as always with Disney quite flawless, with regular David Ogden Stiers giving a level of pompousness and greed to the villain General Radcliffe; Mel Gibson fits his role as John Smith to a T (with a surprisingly good singing voice too); Irene Badard also gives strength and life to Pocahontas; Linda Hunt does a grand job with Grandmother Willow (sorry), and last but not least, Native American activist Russell Means gives authority to Chief Powhatan.What I found to be the greatest asset of this film is its astonishing music. Disney regular at this time Alan Menken composed the score while together with Steven Schwartz wrote the lyrics to the songs. They were deservedly rewarded two Academy Awards for Best Song (""Colours of the Wind"") and Best Original Score. The songs are at times lively and beautifully sombre (including the Special Edition's ""If I Never Knew You"", adding a lot more depth to the romance), the stand out been ""Colours of the Wind"", a powerful tribute to nature's misunderstood beauty and providing one of the film's most rousing musical sequences. The score itself once again fuses all of the major songs into a fantastic tour de force that at times erupts with emotional potency (particularly at the end). Really a musical highlight for the Disney formula.""Pocahontas"" is a step down from ""The Lion King"", along with all of the renaissance offerings, suffering not necessarily from its historical inaccuracy (although that was and still is pitted against it) but from a few niggles and sloppy ends in the screenplay. The fact that it's a jarring change of pace from the previous films' more lightly handled methods of story telling could have also lead to the general lack of popularity. Nevertheless, this is a commendable achievement with Disney's trademark outstanding music, beautiful animation, strong voice work and great characters.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
generally unimpressed: started the decline,"I don't know why they make such a big deal about this film. the sole thing i like about this film was Colors of the Wind. I saw a sneak peek of this film while watching The lion king on video and was excited about an American film, a great break from the recent films where the main settings were in Austrailia, France, Arabia, and Africa. Overall i was unimpressed primarily due to the fact that they try to make it too much of a movie. Later when i learned that this film was predicted to follow Beauty and the Beast's footsteps and Beat lion king, i was increasingly disappointed. There were a few good films during the post lion king years(Hercules, Toy story, Tarzan) but this film started the decline to where Disney animation is today. Could've been better. :[",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
Quite good actually,"Pocahontas and the Lion King were on the drawing board at the same time. The studio did not have much faith in the Lion King to start with. The idea of a Shakespearian tragedy in the Animal Kingdom, may have sounded too pretentious, whereas a beautiful tale which dapples in American history sounded far more enriching. Needless to say the public thought otherwise.Pocahontas was actually the last of the 20th century Disney animated features which I saw. I first viewed it five years ago. Had I seen it when I was six or seven (as I did with most of the others) I probably would have fallen asleep in five minutes. The movie's biggest weakness (and the only one I can think of) is that its effectiveness as a family feature is middling. There is a sense of mysticism and sophistication to it which may be beyond children's ability to appreciate. It is more mature than juvanaille There are no talking animals here. Instead we are offered a talking thousand year old tree, which is absolutely beautiful and further enriched by Linda Hunt's voice, but to a kid, it is more likely to come across as a wrinkly and off putting. Something else which Pocahontas sells is environmentalism, which is also beyond young children's reach. Each generation changes but I think the minimum age for Pocahontas is nine or ten.Quite frankly, I really liked it. Even though it follows a few schema like the good guy, bad guy, this motion picture seemed quite authentic. It is not afraid to get its hands a bit dirty for better emotional quality, Pocahontas at times can be quite violent. There is arguably more gun play here than in any other Disney animated feature. The musicasl numbers are not exactly sing along tunes, they feel more like songs, pieces of art, rich and warming, (sometimes a bit preachy) but effective.The romance between Captain John Smith and Pocahontas felt equally heart warming, just as much so as Beauty and the Beast. Of course it reeks of historical inaccuracy, when you know that the real Pocahontas was ten when she met Smith. Literally, she is not a princess, but she has still earned her place in the Disney princess arsenal. Of all the names in that arsenal (Cinderalla, Snow White, Jasmine, The Little Mermaid) Pocahontas is the strongest and most like a woman (as opposed to a girl). If all the Disney princesses were to race, she would win by a landslide, while most on the other contestants would trip over their gowns.The films comedic value also differs from many of its contemporaries. It feels more quirky than goofy/humorous. If you should ever have a hummingbird flying at your face at 100 miles an hour, just hold up a biscuit for a shield. Seeing as young children prefer the latter, this too contributes to the unfortunate lack of praise for Pocahontas. It is not regarded as one of the great Disneys, but it's still a fine watch. It certainly moved me.",,Anonymous,Animation
Pocahontas is brisker than the colours of the wind.,"Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon? No, me neither, and after watching this you wouldn't have either. Reason being is due to the extremely rapid pacing for a ridiculously short animation. These two fundamental detriments makes this a slight misfire from Disney. Captain John Smith sails across to ""The New World"" where he encounters Pocahontas who he madly falls in love with. The indigenous population is under threat from the wave of modern colonisation. Disney clearly have good intentions as they fictionalise the account of Native American Pocahontas in order to illustrate colonialism to a younger generation. The basic storytelling allows the intended audience to swan dive right into this romantic epic with the colourful animation and harmonious musical numbers. Let's face it, ""Colours of the Wind"" and ""Just Around the Riverbend"" are two of Disney's strongest original songs that imitate the natural idyllic environment that the animation conveys. For the more mature audience, the racial overtones throughout the narrative just aren't dealt with carefully. John Smith exclaiming ""I prefer hello"" as Pocahontas teaches him about her own linguistics just seems so careless, leaving a bad aftertaste. Pocahontas is one of the more famous Native Americans, the historical depiction surrounding her and the indigenous culture was highly inaccurate. However, I have to give praise to the narrative for carrying a surprisingly thoughtful message that allows the viewer to meditate on what is being shown. The use of colours plays a major role in this, especially when the colonials are deforesting the picturesque woods in which a dark blood red shade swamps the background. I appreciate the lack of humour, it enhances the seriousness of the film. The romance between the leads, much like the whole film, is brisk and feels slightly underdeveloped. The primary antagonist may metaphorically represent modernisation, but is hardly memorable. Having said all that, the film isn't necessarily bad, just underdeveloped and misrepresented.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Classic Disney,"It's a shame I watched this movie 14 years after ""Avatar"" was released as it is clear that Cameron's blockbuster was heavily inspired by this animated musical. There isn't much to say about it, actually - ""Pocahontas"" is exactly what you would expect from Disney: great animation, a simple story, one-dimensional characters, traditional humor and a clear moral. Of course, the picture is very naive, but let's not forget who the target audience is - nonetheless, the 80 minutes passed quickly, which is quite a compliment for a movie targeted at much younger viewers (maybe an additional 20 minutes wouldn't hurt, as the ending felt rather abrupt).",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Disney's adaptation of the historical story of the Native Princess,"Here is another underrated and underappreciated classic from Disney, which became another favorite of mine. The film was based on the known facts of the historical story of the Indian princess Pocahontas and the folklore and legends that surround her. In particular, it presents a highly emotional and dramatic account of the meeting between her and John Smith.This film is also the first Disney film to be based on a real historical character; although there are no suggestions in any of the historical records that Smith and Pocahontas were ever lovers, this romantic version of the story appears only in fictionalized versions of their relationship. But I do love Disney's take on them, and they have become one of my favorite Disney couples. Although I don't want to change history.Admittedly speaking, I don't have a favorite scene because I love the whole film from beginning to end. And you know, it isn't ironic that the gay servant actually knows why the natives attack the settlers.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"""So...serious.""...-The only Disney cartoon feature that gives me a melancholy feeling","This past Sunday I saw 'Pocahontas' again on video (yes people, I still do not have the DVD) after many years. For some time I've just avoided this movie. The renewed acquaintance brought out the same melancholy feelings as 12 years ago when I saw it in the cinema the first time. I've always been a sucker for Disney animation and this remained so as I grew up. I was exited about the 'second flowering' of Disney that began with ""Little Mermaid"" and I really looked forward to Pocahontas at the time. Looked to me that Disney were exploring new grounds again.But in 1995 I was of the verge of a depression and seeing ""Pocahontas'worked as a trigger for that. Mind: I liked the heroine, the animation, the music and -what I felt- the chemistry between the leads. But it was also a heavy-handed, toxic-serious-content movie, and did not at all give me that uplifting feeling that Disney cartoons usually give me. It is not merely because of the not-so-happy ending (actually I applaud a break from the 'formula', a bold move) but the fact remains that, after all, Pocahontas and John Smith were historical characters, and it is hard to put that out of my head while seeing this straightforward 'Romeo-and Juliet'story 'inspired by' actual events. The notion that the fragile peace between colonist and Indians, owing to Pocahontas, was only short-lived, gives a melancholy feeling of sorrowful regret"" as a reviewer (I believe from Variety.com) remarked. Still I like the movie for what it is, and I applaud the Disney studios for trying to break away from the usual 'safe and tried' fare. ""Pocanhontas' was not the kind of film that most people expected or wanted from Disney, and it is no surprise that it got many hostile reviews and that it divided the critics. I could also point out the weak points -plot holes- in the story, but lots of reviewers have done that before me. Suffice to so say that I found the reason to send John Smith back to England quite absurd. Would it really benefit the health of a badly wounded man to be at a ship at often rough ocean for four months? I think not!-------- additional remarks (16 Nov. 2007):I have purchased the SE DVD now and I must say I'm happy that they put the song ""If I never knew you"" back in the movie. A little word also for the zealot historians and others who trash this movie because it is not exactly an actual historical account and thus accuse Disney of misinforming people. I think that anyone watching Disney's 'Pocahontas' and thinking afterwards ""Oh, this is how it all really happened"", must be either a small kid or very stupid. If the songs don't give you a clue that it's nothing more than 'inspired by', the talking tree might do the trick. Anyway, who are the historians to accuse Disney of confusing people about the truth if they themselves cannot agree on whether the real capt. John Smith was truthful in his accounts of his adventures in Virginia? Think about that!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Good story,"ehhh... im sick of so many people whining about the ""historical accuracy"" of the film. May I remind you  people, that this isnt exactly a biography. not 100% word-by-word accurate, but a movie for CHILDREN.If you want a detailed no-nonsence, truth and nothing but the truth  story of Pocohontas, flip on the discovery channel.I think it would be inappropriet for a film by disney to have the hero john smith ""raping"" a 10 yr old girl.This isnt at all a bad film, and while it may not tell the ""accurate"" story of what happened, it tells a valuable story about friendship, love, and choosing the right path in life. The characters are not ""dull"" or ""flat"" as others have said. John Smith was portrayed as couragious, and brave (for taking the fall for Thomas after he killed Kocooum), and Pocahontas is likeable,and brave for saving John,and stopping the war that would have devestated her people.Im 17, and i still love the movie.

One of the more mature Disney films,"When Englishmen come to her land in search of gold, Pocahontas finds love in the arms of John Smith.This Oscar winning romantic drama from Walt Disney is one of the warmest and adult themed animations in the genre, and has a heart warming story and some beautifully crafted songs.The narrative centres around the beautiful independent Pocahontas, who we first see diving off a hill into a gorgeous river, and viewers are instantly thrust into her life as we see what's on her mind. Pocahontas is a great central character to have, as she embodies a very strong woman with her own mind. Her thoughts and feelings are well executed and are inspirational to women of all ages and is one of the strongest Disney characters ever created, right up there with Snow White.With ideologies of love and war, this is one of the most mature Disney pictures to date with plenty of adult themes and a strong sense of realism.The concept of love is excellently observed by director Mike Gabriel as we see the central character in many close shots, and a careful approach is used when she sees John Smith for the first time.The idea of loving the wrong person has been covered in many films before, and here Pocahontas falls in love with the enemy, a man who has come over with a group of men in search of gold and wish to take over her people's land. This battle of minds is also a fight over culture and humanity a very strong and issue driven drama which really makes you think come the end of the film.Slight disappointment as the narrative lacks at points and the ending feels rushed but thankfully isn't as daft as some other animations which rush into clichés.This film is also memorable for the fantastic soundtrack, and particularly the Oscar winning Colours of the Wind, which is the best part of the film by a mile, a really strong sentimental moment in the character's lives, and dives deep into the romantic genre and will make the weak at heart shed a tear or two.Not the most entertaining Disney, but the different approach and the strong adult focused themes of love and war are strong and engaging.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A wonderful and magical film,"I have grown up around Disney films all my life and even to this day. i still find myself watching them over and over again, because that is the magic within these Disney films that has been created for us to enjoy. No matter how old you are you can't deny the fact that you have watched them again from time to time. Pocahontas is truly one of my favourites. It allows children's' imagination to run wild (but i guess that's what all Disney films do) but this one captures the true essence of how people should treat one another ... equally. The music in the film just highlights it even more about how wonderful the film is and leaves you singing it for ages non-stop! Even if the story has been created from what has already happened children will learn more about history when they are in school. So let them feel free to let their imagination run free while they still have a chance of not knowing the true aspects of what really happens in life as we know it. So i say watch these films; let your imagination run wild, filled with joy and laughter for you are never too old or too young to enjoy a good Disney film once in awhile!",,Anonymous,Animation
A gross glorification of american genocide,"While this movie has very nice, pretty songs and lovely animation/ visuals, I very strongly dislike it. I think it is frankly a nasty glorification of a chain of horrific events in the history of the continent and spreads the wrong idea entirely. The real girl this was loosely based off of had an immeasurable amount of trauma and so did her relatives and friends and I think this movie is just kind of pointless and gross and does not accomplish anything good for how settler and native relations are historically perceived. Also I think it's stupid how they could just magically speak the same language with the power of their hearts like come on 😭🙏 . Also there was clearly not a lot of effort put into designing the native characters and practices to be anywhere near historically accurate.

Worth Watching,"I have to say that the 90s were like a golden age for the Walt Disney Company. Most of the movies that were released by Walt Disney Company in the 90s were good. Especially 'Pocahontas', this is a very good movie for the whole family. It's worth watching and especially for racialist people; they may end up knowing themselves better after watching this movie. The plot is about a Native American girl 'Pocahontas' who starts a romantic relationship with an English adventurer 'John Smith' out for gold in the land where Indians live with other men. Actually John Smith and the other men are fooled along with their leader who insists that there is gold hidden in the land; when in fact there is no gold. However, this issue starts a fight between the English men and Indians, and after Pocahontas revealed the truth to John Smith about the gold myth clearly, the both try to stop the fight between the two teams.This movie shows that hatred and war aren't always ways to solve a problem. It gives a rich message to people from all ages. If you don't have this film then buy it, even if it was expensive, trust me you'll not regret it.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Michael Eisener's PC views at it's best. >_<,"This movie is almost unwatchable for the main reason it's completely inaccurate to what we know about Pocahontas and it's full of one-sided political jaunts like protecting the earth and animals. The only redeeming points about this movie are the music, the relationship between Meeko, Percy, and Flick, and Christian Bale in yet another Disney film. Alan Menken and Steven Shwartz first pair was a great job, but I can't take the PC in this movie. Mel Gibson was great, I love David Ogden Stiers as Ratcliff, and of course I loved Meeko.

I recommend this movie to anyone who likes love stories or just a good movie. I will never figure out why this movie is so underrated.

A Beautiful Story,"Alright, yes this isn't the true story of Pocahontas, but why would Disney make a movie about what really happened?  Disney patched it up to make it more appropriate for the audience, just the way it has in other stories.  The original story of The Little Mermaid has Ariel's character kill herself in the end because her prince marries someone else.  Disney doesn't ""do"" that crap so stop whining about Disney not including the little part about John Smith raping Pocahontas, etc.As for this movie, by far my favorite aspect of this movie was the art.  The wind blowing the leaves, the mist over the water, everything like that far outweighs any other Disney movie prior to that.  Sure this movie didn't exactly have a ""happily ever after"" ending, but I enjoyed every minute of it.  The songs were beautiful and the connection between John Smith and Pocahontas is far more stronger than any other leading characters in a Disney movie.  This story has a moral to it and it leaves you thinking afterward.   I'm sorry there were no songs like ""Under the Sea"" or ""Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo"" but this story is a lot more deeper than that.And I disagree with the guy who said the songs took away from the story.  If anything, they enhanced it.  If you want something simple, go rent the Power Puff Girls movie-- if you're mature enough to want something more, then rent this movie.

Probably the biggest letdown of all the animated Disney films I saw in my childhood,"Being a big Disney fan as a kid, I saw this movie on the big screen during the summer of 1995, when I was just under nine years old. It had been a year since I had gone to see ""The Lion King"", an excellent film which I got a copy of on video shortly after it first came into stores. However, I was probably less impressed with ""Pocahontas"" than I had been with any other Disney film I had seen before. Because of that, I never saw it again until over a decade later, after rediscovering Disney. Unfortunately for me, I have found that the movie really isn't much different for me now than it was back when it was in theatres.In 1607, John Smith leads a crew from England to the ""New World"" in search for gold. Meanwhile, in the land where this crew is headed, Chief Powhatan wants his daughter, Pocahontas, to marry Kocoum, a great warrior who has just lead the tribe to victory in a battle. However, Pocahontas thinks Kocoum is too ""serious"", and does not wish to marry him. Lately, she has been having a recurring dream about a spinning arrow, and believes it means that change is about to come. Seeking advice, she goes and speaks to Grandmother Willow, a talking tree, who tells her to listen to her heart. Very soon, change does come when Smith and his crew arrive on western shores, near the village where Pocahontas and her tribe live! As unlikely as it may seem, when Pocahontas and John Smith meet, they soon fall in love, but since Pocahontas' tribe and Smith's crew both view each other as enemies, this relationship will be hard to keep!One problem I have with this mid-nineties Disney effort is that usually when I watch animated Disney films, both early and recent, I can expect some good humour, but not so with this one. There is quite a bit of attempted humour here, usually involving Meeko (Pocahontas' pet raccoon), Flit (a hummingbird), and eventually Percy (a spoiled dog owned by Governor Ratcliffe), but these gags rarely ever work at all. Personally, I think the funniest part is when Grandmother Willow scares two of the sailors off, which doesn't involve any one the three animal characters, but I think I can expect to find funnier gags than that in most of Disney's animated features. Aside from the lack of humour, the story seems pretty shallow at times, and seems like a rather simple commentary on racism. The songs in the film are probably not the worst bunch Disney has even done, but they've certainly done better. The most memorable song is probably ""Colours of the Wind"".Some may criticize ""Pocahontas"" for its historical inaccuracies, but in my opinion, that is certainly not its biggest problem. It have pointed out quite a few things that I think reduce the entertainment value significantly. Now, the film does have some reasonably suspenseful moments here and there, the relationship between Pocahontas and John Smith isn't too bad, and I can't complain about the animation, but apart from that, it really doesn't have much going for it. There are some Disney films that I don't like as much as I used to, but ""Pocahontas"" is the only one I can think of that I didn't seem to like much in the first place. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying it's a horrible movie that both kids and adults should avoid, but the fact that I didn't even think much of it in my childhood just might really say something.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
"WITH ""If I Never Knew You"": 10/10. WITHOUT: 6/10.","My review of this film will definitely be met with some disagreement due to its controversial consensus: that if the song, ""If I Never Knew You,"" had been in the movie as originally planned, this would be a masterpiece 10/10 film, and without (which is what happened), it is a 6/10 film.A little history, to explain this.At the end credits, there is a pop song entitled ""If I Never Knew You."" Although without research one would think that this is just a pop song meant to market the movie, that is not true. In fact, that song is based on a song that was originally in the movie, sung by Pocahontas (Judie Kuhn) and John Smith (A surprisingly mature-sounding Mel Gibson) on the night before his execution. The scene was cut because the test audience Disney used, consisting mostly of impatient youngsters, got restless during the song. So as not to seem uninviting to children, Disney cut the song. One would wonder why they did this considering that they wanted ""Pocahontas"" to have a more mature, more adult feel than their previous films anyway. They were literally hoping for a ""Best Picture"" nomination.So, without the song, what do we have? A film with superb animation, music, acting, dialogue, and characters, but a weak and unbelievable romance. This is crippling to the film because the romance is central to the story. The film is ABOUT that romance. I remember seeing this movie in its original cut, without the song, and thinking that the romance was stupid because it seemed weak. Why would Pocahontas be in love with some guy she met just a few hours ago and who, quite frankly, expressed curiosity in her culture more so than love towards her? This would be a good friendship, but not a good love because there's no emotion in it. The romance comes across as an obligatory, ""make-the-film-complete"" romance that many people feel has to be in every major Disney movie. The romance feels like it's there because it has to be, not because it's real. This earns the movie a less-than-stellar 6/10.With, ""If I Never Knew You,"" however, it is a whole different story. It is beautifully written, animated, and sung. It does not further the plot, but it definitely does further the emotion. One can definitely believe that Pocahontas and John Smith are in love, rather than forcing us to take their word for it. In this cut, there's also a reprise of the song at the very end before Smith leaves which echoes this love.At the end of the first version, my reaction was, ""meh."" At the end of the second version (the one that includes ""If I Never Knew You""), I was uncontrollably sobbing.I had cried over a film that I had known the lines to forward and back when I was younger, but never had an emotional reaction to. This song makes the movie feel much more complete, and I would even venture to call this Disney's best film if one includes the song. Some people, especially those who haven't heard the song, might think I'm overreacting, wondering what kind of difference a single song can make. I know I felt that way about people who said this before I viewed the second version. Trust me, watch the second version. It's like watching a different film. For that reason, my final grade for ""Pocahontas"" is 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

The two that stood out to me the most were: 1) just because someone is different than you, it doesn't mean they're a threat, and 2) the earth is naturally beautiful and it is a gift that we must protect. It tackles the subjects of racism, xenophobia, and environmentalism in tasteful and meaningful way that even children can understand.Many characters from both sides of the film's main conflict experience meaningful arches that ask moral questions of the viewer. Neither side is entirely right or wrong. Both lie in the moral grey which makes the conflict more thought provoking and can lead the viewer to forming wildly different opinions on it depending on their world view and feelings towards the themes of the film. It begs a few rewatches for that reason alone. Also the music is really good, some of the best Disney has ever done.So yeah, the movie is historically inaccurate but the message and music is good. And if anything, it's inspired many people to study the history of the Virginia Company for themselves.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A different Disney Movie..,"I watched Pocahontas on video and really enjoyed the movie. The movie is visually splendid. Pocahontas is based on real life characters but is not expected to be historically accurate since it plans to cater for an audience spanning the entire age spectrum. The story-tellers and animators have collaborated beautifully, creating characters aimed at specific age groups, each enduring to convey the same message. The musicians and lyricists creating one of the better Disney musical compilations. This movie should be watched without the expectation of seeing the normal Disney formula in action.",,Anonymous,Animation

Romanticized nonsense....,"Now to be clear I am very aware this is not claiming to be historically accurate but I still question why. Romanticising this bloody chapter in American history just stinks of bad taste in my opinion. I shouldn't really be surprised as America are very good at doing this and have even created a national holiday around it. Also as proud scotsman I find it hard supporting a film that celebrates British colonialism, animated work of fiction or not.Setting all that aside I genuinely found very little to enjoy about this film. Pocahontas herself was a fairly well rounded individual faced with the same fate as many of her female counterparts in previous films, unwanted marriage and a lack of choice in the outcomes of their lives. Of course she does rise and find her own path but this type of story is just growing redundant now in my opinion.Definitely my least favourite Disney outing thus far.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
Lovely film,"The movie has a talking tree and people are complaining about it being inaccurate? Get outta here
Introducing kids to new cultures wasn't particularly easy when our options were so limited back in the 90's. This movie introduced me to Native American culture and I've been fascinated ever since.

Refreshes Your Imagination,"Many People before me not only cited, but complained about the fact that this movie was historically incorrect. But most forget that this movie was mainly targeted for children under the age of ten. Unlike Shrek and Monsters Inc. which tackles the task of entertaining both adults and children, Pocahontas was made for young girls. Yet many still complain of things being unrealistic and made for ""children with short attention spans."" This is the type of movie in which you are supposed to forget about reality, refresh imagination, and revive your child hood dreams. This movie is great to watch with your children, nieces, nephews, and younger brothers or sisters. Just sit back relax and watch with the amazement that a child would. Forget about the fact that it's not true to history there are plenty of other movies about Pocahontas to stay true to it.

A downswing in the Disney Renaissance whose animation and music struggles to elevate its story problems,"In 1607, the Virginia Company under the stewardship of Governor Radcliffe (David Ogden Stiers) sets sail for the new world in the hopes of finding gold. Along for the voyage is the dashing and heroic John Smith (Mel Gibson) who's fabled for his status fighting Indians. Meanwhile in the world, Pocahontas (Irene Bedard) is the free spirited and headstrong daughter of Chief Powhatan (Russell Means) who wants Pocahontas to marry his bravest warrior Kocoum (James Apaumut Fall) despite Pocahontas' reservations. Pocahontas has a recurring dream of a ""spinning arrow"" and confers with a magic tree named Grandmother Willow (Linda Hunt) who tells her it may be regarding her destiny. When the settlers arrive Pocahontas and John Smith have a chance encounter and form a romance, but can their love survive tensions and unease between the Settlers and the Natives.1995's Pocahontas was a massive project for Disney animation beginning development in 1990 with Rescuers Down Under director Mike Gabriel after concepts for a musical set in the American West and an adaptation of Swan Lake failed to materialize. After Beauty and the Beast unexpectedly earned a nomination for Best Picture at the Academy Awards, Jeffrey Katzenberg hoped to repeat the feat using Pocahontas as a potential Awards' hopeful due to Lion King and Aladdin being too far in production at the time. The movie had originally flirted with a more exaggerated style similar to that of Aladdin but executive inference caused a number of directional changes with mandates calling for Pocahontas to be aged up significantly from her age in real life, making the animals mute as opposed to speaking, and adding a level of maturity to the central romance between John Smith and Pocahontas. Pocahontas was released in 1995 to decent financial success but only made about half of what The Lion King had made the previous year despite that film being made by Disney's ""B-team"" and the prospects for Best Picture nomination were quickly dashed with Pocahontas receiving mostly mixed reviews with even positive reviews qualifying their praise saying it wasn't as good as other previous Disney Renaissance films. There's a lot of craft and artistry in Pocahontas that works, but the main story doesn't resonate all that much.By this point in the Disney Renaissance, critics and audiences were beginning to notice the formula established with Disney's Little Mermaid that had been repeated to success in Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin with the more ""active"" princess character which was seeing notice in the mainstream public such as when Animaniacs spoofed this film with the song ""Same old heroine"" where they called attention to the seeming interchangeability of 90s Disney female protagonists. I'm not sure how much I agree with the criticisms of that song because there were to a degree some differences in the characters of Jasmine, Belle, and Ariel so while the ""bones"" may have been similar there were at least variations in what was on them. I think the reason Pocahontas sticks out as a target for that formula is because Pocahontas by comparison to previous 90s Disney Princesses feels a lot more muted and less expressive with not as much of a defined personality, despite being the titular character I actually felt John Smith had more of a character even if it was a swaggering action hero archetype.The movie tries to tackle themes of prejudice and hatred but does so in a very ""safe"" way with the movie trying to paint the conflict in a case of ""bothsides"" with the song ""Savages"" heavy handedly showing both the Natives and the Settlers referring to one another as the term and featuring really forced lyrics like ""they're not like you and me, which means they must be evil"" carrying the weight of a sledgehammer but leaving the impact of a feather. It's rather apt that Katzenberg sought to replicate the critical success of Beauty and the Beast because everything that movie did right is something this movie does wrong. Both Pocahontas and Beauty and the Beast deal with themes of prejudice and looking beneath the surface, but while Beauty and the Beast handled that by putting characters in the foreground and making the theme in service of those characters, Pocahontas puts its message in the foreground and makes its characters in service of the theme.I will give some praise to the songs and the animation with ""Colors of the Wind"" usually being what most people take away from this movie even if a lot of everything blurs into the background, but they don't really stack up against predecessors. With Pocahontas there's an attempt at making the style of the movie more grounded giving the characters smaller eyes and harder features and expressions and you don't get a strong sense of character from the animation the way you got from previous films because a lot of the energy feels really muted. I'm also not crazy about the stylistic changes making this ""closer"" to reality as elements like the mute animals play relatively pointless against things like magic wind that breaks language barriers or the talking tree Grandmother Willow whose appearance always unnerved me due to an appearance that features two large voids where the eyes should be making what's supposed to be a nurturing maternal figure unintentionally creepy.Pocahontas is one of those Disney Renaissance films I'm personally not a fan of even despite the clear effort on display. Maybe there was a way to salvage this into ""Best Picture"" material, but considering how much executive meddling was going on behind the scenes that sort of thing tends to swing films AWAY from Best Picture possibilities.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Little historical accuracy, so what?","Pocahontas is an enjoyable and extremely well-written film with depths and sublime animation and music. On the backdrop of a wild and beautiful native American land, the movie tells the story of love, self-discovery and misinterpretation. Sets in Virginia, North America in the 17th century, the movie is about Pocahontas, an Algonquin woman who struggles to find her path in the world, when a British ship reaches the village in its attempt to seek gold in the new land. After meeting a settler, John Smith, she quickly gets acquainted with him, but is torn between the disagreements of her people and the newcomers on Smith's side.I can understand that people are upset it did not accurately illustrate the events of what Europeans did during the Age of Exploration but this movie clearly sets out to achieve none of that. By using this setting to pin two opposite forces - white Europeans and Native Americans - against each other, the film tackles the idea of communication. As opposed to the close and cooperative relationship between Pocahontas and John Smith, the lack of understanding and communication between the two groups of people has resulted in subsequent events of anger, disagreement and violence. Many people take Pocahontas and John Smith's ability of talking to each other despite different languages as racism towards 'Indians', however, I feel like this is not the case at all. The decision to reduce the language barrier is important to express the story with better comprehension, especially for young children.The thing I love about the movie is the very realistic portrayal of characters from both the sides. Unlike Avatar (which evidently ripped off this, a-hem!), Pocahontas equally tells the view of both the tigers and the hunters. No one from the colonizers is one-dimensional and purely evil. All sailors, even though at first consider Native Americans savages and inhumane, are each painted as down-to-earth workers who are essentially exploited by the capitalists and oblivious of what native Americans really are. The Governor, invading the land for the sake of money, doesn't vainly target Indians for fun, it is only he thought that they hid all the gold. From the Native Americans' perspective, we are introduced to the characters - Pocahontas, her friend, her father, and soaked into their lives, their relationships and beliefs. We relate and feel for Pocahontas when she struggles to find the right path. We smile when she and Nakoma play with each other on the boat. The movie makes us care and fear for them upon the arrival of outsiders instead of dehumanizing the invaders (like Avatar did) to make us feel bad about the threats posed to the village.Alan Menken, once again, proves his magical talent for writing film scores by the timeless pieces in Pocahontas. 'Just Around the Riverbend', 'Grandmother Willow' and 'Colors of the Winds' are atmospheric and resounding songs that perfectly describe the greatness and enigma of nature; 'Steady as the Beating Drums' infiltrates the cultural village lives of the natives; while 'The Virginia Company' and 'Mine, Mine, Mine' imitates in rhythmic power of the crew's work. While strengthening the flow of emotions and visuals in the movie, the soundtrack really stands out on its own with these unforgettable hits that I found myself hooked on after watching.Great as it is, the movie has noticeable flaws. Pocahontas and John Smith's romance seems inorganic and rushed at some points. Their relationship is admirable in many ways for mutual respects and understanding for each other, but it should have stayed that way. Pocahontas' path of life, guided by nature, ultimately leads to John Smith, which makes her work of reconciling the two groups of people less relevant in the story. This makes Pocahontas more like a classic Disney princess who needs love than a heroine who leads her clan away from destruction.Given little credit among Disney productions, Pocahontas, however, is one of my favorite animated movies. The film is a modern-par and meaningful story about love and conflicts, with great animation and humor. If you forget political and sociological history and take it for what it is, you will find the ride compellingly as epic, light-hearted and fantastic as any other Disney classics.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

2 and a half out of five.,"This is middle-level Disney.  While the true story of Pocohontas is interesting, this is not.  Not even with a stunningly designed and animated title character.  (Animator Glenn Keane has come a long way since Ariel of ""The Little Mermaid.) Songs are so-so, ditto the supporting cast.  Some real visual interest is there in ""Colors of the Wind,"" and the scenes of the shaman's predictions illustrated by shifting designs in the smoke.  Grandmother Willow (literally a willow tree) is merely an annoyance, partially animated by computer, and therefore a visual anomaly compared with most of the rest of the movie's look.  The language barrier between Smith and our heroine is solved in a completely unconvincing way.Better than Mulan, I guess.",,Anonymous,Animation
Ehhh.,"One of the first inaccuracies of the Disney movie, Pocahontas, is that her name really was not Pocahontas, which many folks may not know. Her actual Powhatan name was Matoaka. Pocahontas was a nickname given to her by the English settlers which meant ""spoiled child"" or ""the naughty one."" Many only know her as Pocahontas, which I must say that was what I thought her name was until now. The setting of the film is very fairytale-like and very animated to make the scene look more appealing. If one actually analyzes the setting in the movie, they will see many wrong geographical landscapes. They clearly did not do much research on the geography and environment of Jamestown. In the movie, Pocahontas is seen a top of huge cliffs and mountains which was wrong because the land of Jamestown is mostly and relatively flat. They make the environment a more dramatic scenery than it truly was. One other geographical inaccuracy is the fact that the Disney movie shows moose, bald eagles, sunflowers, and other animals and plants that clearly were not in the town of Virginia. Also, Pocahontas is seen near a waterfall in the film, but Jamestown did not have waterfalls like the one in the movie. Aside from the geographical inaccuracies in Pocahontas, Disney portrays the Powhatan culture as a stereotypical Indian tribe which many Indian tribes were nothing alike. The men of the tribe did not wear feathers and neither did they wear skirts. Most of the Indians wore close to nothing of clothes, but they cannot show nudity in a cartoon movie. Also, Disney made their houses look like regular Indian longhouse which is not what they lived in. This movie disrespects a lot of the Native American culture. It is also believed that the Native Americans had a wonderful relationship with the animals which was most likely wrong. Yes, they may have had a better understanding of the habitat and animals, but it was not like they portrayed in the movie. In Pocahontas, Hollywood makes one believe that the Indians and English settlers were all mean to each other which is inaccurate. It was actually the English men who did not like the Indians and invaded the Indians land, brought war, diseases, and other unwelcome changes. It shows in the movie, the Native Americans preparing to fight the 'paleface demons' which makes them look equally to blame for the troubles between the two. Clearly, the English settlers were to blame for the invasion. Much of the tribe, like ninety percent, died from the diseases brought to the lands because they were not accustomed to those sicknesses. One of the historical accuracy was how the settlers acted in the movie, Pocahontas. They were there for ""Gold, God, and Glory"" which was very true. Also, the Englishman sang a song when they arrived to the lands about the Indians. One of the lyrics from the song quotes, ""Savages, savages, barely even humans,"" which the English settlers did think of the Native Americans during that time. The Disney movie also does not show Pocahontas helping the English settlement in Jamestown. If it were not for her support, then many more of the settlers would have died. One of the biggest historical inaccuracy in the Disney animated film, Pocahontas, is the romantic relationship between Pocahontas and John Smith. She was portrayed to be this young woman and him to be a young man. More than likely, Pocahontas was ten to thirteen years old and John was in his later twenties, which that is a huge difference than what the movie makes you believe. So, when one thinks that, one must think John Smith was a pedophile, but truly they had no romance between them. The movie makes one think that they meet at a waterfall and instantly fall in love, but more than likely they did not meet that way considering there was not a huge waterfall like that in Jamestown. Close to the ending of the movie, Pocahontas, one sees her throw herself on John Smith to save him from getting killed by the Powhatan tribe because she was in love with him. That was wrong. She did not have to save John Smith nor was she in love with him. At the end of the movie, the Disney movie makes you believe that she was torn between staying with her father and the Powhatan tribe or leaving to go to England with the man she loves. That was not the case. Pocahontas was kidnapped by English settlers and became a Christian, she was baptized and given a new name, Rebecca. She became married to a John, not John Smith, but John Rolfe. Then later in her late twenties, she became sick with some disease like tuberculosis and died. In conclusion, the Walt Disney movie, Pocahontas, was a wonderful movie. But the historical background and how Pocahontas was portrayed was entirely inaccurate. Many say this is one of the most inaccurate historical movies out there in the nation and after finding all the material that was wrong, I must say I agree with others. Even though it was a great animated, fairytale movie, that does not make it factual.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of Disney's best,"Pocahontas is set in 17th-century North America. It's a beautiful movie about the clash of gold-seeking European colonizers and a Native American tribe.American history tells us what happened between the two groups was not pretty.

Pocahontas,"Pocahontas takes itself a bit more seriously, and if you're looking for that then you're in the right place. But therefore it does sacrifice some of its humor. Besides that though this is a really solid albeit short entry and I ended up enjoying my time with it a lot.Visuals and animation, well it can't be understated this is a beautiful movie, even more so due to some really stylized and colorful scenes. It was a feast for the eyes and really drew you into the moment. The animation is top notch. Whilst it's movement is incredible, some frames look a bit awkward especially Pocahontas can change a lot. The opening scenes of the movie were stunning, as was the finale, as was the ''war'' scene.Music was a big plus here, Alan Menken does it again and brings an incredible score. Really fell in love it with, it simply elevates the movie, the visuals, everything. And every other song that was here worked for me, they were just good.Story and length, based on a story with real characters it feels a bit more non Disney-like towards the end especially. If you know nothing about what it's based on you get an incredibly open ending which I can imagine some find frustrating. It's runtime will catch you by surprise as well because of that. It's a short movie. But keeps it's pace up well and doesn't have any wasted scenes. Regarding some characters though it feels like we needed a bit more communication. Like how Pocohontas's father forgave John without explanation. Also Pocahontas and John at first can't communicate due to language, but very quickly they can. I figure this was just needed, but a extra scene or a bit more handwaving would've eased the transition. Nitpick though.Over the years views on the decimation of the Indian tribes by the first settlers and conquistadors has hardend. This movie in that regard isn't avoidant to that fact and actually highlights it. Some details get lost in the Disney transformation but the core message stay correct.All in all I really liked it.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Good But Not a Classic,"Pocahontas (1995)*** (out of 4)Disney's version of the relationship between Englishman John Smith (voice of Mel Gibson) and Pocahontas (voice of). This here was the studio's 33rd film and while it's far from a classic, overall the animation is good enough to make it worth sitting through. It should go without saying but history buffs might want to stay away from this but then again, this here is a Disney movie so I'm not sure why people should come into this wanting a documentary. I remember when the film was released there was a lot of promotional material about how respectful the film was going to be towards Native Americans and for the most part I think this is very true. I thought the film did a pretty good job at showing the good quality of both sides and the film managed to give enough of the history to where young kids should be able to enjoy the film as entertainment as well as get a fair idea of what happened during this period. I think what works best about the film is the animation, which shows the studio at the top of their game. I really loved the dim blue colors that highlight the majority of the film and especially the scenes inside the woods. The beautiful red skies is another major plus and there's no question that the characters all look extremely good and well-drawn. I thought Gibson did a very good job with his vocal work but the rest of the actors are fine as well. The animal creatures are another plus with the raccoon certainly being the standout. I think there are some major flaws here including every single song. There really wasn't a single one that impressed me and this is somewhat of a shock considering the hot streak that the studio was on. POCAHONTAS isn't classic Disney but fans of the company should at least be entertained by it.",,Anonymous,Animation

One of My Favorite Disney Movies Of All Time,"When I bought Lion King in 1994, and saw the Pocahontas Movie commercial, I really really hated her. When her commercial came up, I fast forwarded it all the time. Then, a year later, I was hooked like hell! I wanted to get the movie very badly! When I got it finally in April 1996, I was hooked like holy hell! The plots just beautiful and the songs are incredible, I'd hum them and sing them in my head all the time. The eighth time I saw it late at night, I cried, and believe me, I am NOT one to cry. It is about a beautiful Indian princess by the name of Pocahontas who falls for an English white sailor named John Smith. They fall for each other and admire each others' culture. Especially John Smith, who is dazed at Pocahontas' long hair and ""copper skin"" and exotic Native American culture. (I guess it's because he's so white) And Pocahontas seems dazzled at the English culture. It is kind of like Jungle Fever (in which I also commented on, just click on my name), but less sexual and the ""victims"" of the ""fever"" are more ""in depth"" with each other. Anyway, five years later, I still think it's a lovely movie, but now I'm more grown, and I grew out of it.The plot just seems less lovely and more sappy and sentimental, but when I was 10 I loved it! It will always be my favorite movie, though. I read her biography and I know that the movie couldn't be more off in accuracy. First of all, Pocahontas was only eleven when she met John Smith. He was an old raggedy man with red hair. They were not lovers, John Smith was her honorary brother. When she was barely 21 she married John Rolfe and moved to England. They had a baby boy named Thomas, she died at 21  But still, I understand they had to make it Disney material for the children. And the plot is definetly meant for children. Five years ago I would have given it an 11 on a scale of 1 to 10. Now I'd give it about a 7 or 8. Go see it!",,Anonymous,Animation

The best song was Colours of the Wind but the rest ranged from fair to awful. The romance between Pocahontas and John Smith did not fit. I was glad the film ended the way it did.

An outstanding film for anyone. Truly incredible and beautiful,"I watched the movie about three days ago for the first time and I have to say that its just a great movie. It has excellent songs and can be enjoyed by all ages. But be warned: The true story is FAR different then in this movie. Its hard to have the same respect for the film knowing that most of it is fictionalized. None the less, its an extraordinary movie and you should definitely watch it. However, you should do some research on the true story if you want to fully understand what the film is about. Some say that it is so far from the true story that it can't even be considered to be the same story. But the fact is that Disney wasn't interested in facts. They just wanted to make an enjoyable film and they delivered. Now for the music: The song ""Colors of the wind"" is a truly beautiful song and has a powerful message and I can see why it won so many awards. ""Savages"" is also a good song. I can't say that there are any faults with any of the songs in this movie. I get agitated when people cut down the film for the fact that its not exactly historically accurate. But the fact is that Disney simply couldn't make a film appropriate for all ages if they had used the actual events. For example: You can feel the chemistry between John Smith and Pocahontas very strongly.In the movie they both meet as young adults. You simply would be unable to feel the chemistry on that kind of a level if John Smith was 30 ad Pocahontas was 12. Now I know what you saying: "" This is a Disney movie.

Stephen Shwartz and Alan Menken weave a lovely tale through their lyrics and orchestration, and the animation, in my opinion, is some of Disney's best.

"An Amazing, Underrated Masterpiece","Pocahontas is an amazing movie. I honestly don't think I'd be who I am today with out it. I don't understand why so many people don't like it. The animation's beautiful, the songs are to die for, and the story is great. Yes, it doesn't follow the true story, but that wouldn't really make a good kid's movie, would it? It's a Disney movie, people. Disney. And I fail to see how it is racist, either. If anything, it is the complete embodiment of anti-racism.The story is about European exploration and relations with the Natives in America during the 1600s. We watch as the heroic Captain John Smith travels on a ship with the greedy Governor Ratcliffe across the fierce Atlantic waves to the Virginian Coast, where they set up camp in search of gold. Not to far away is a Native village, where we meet Pocahontas and her friends and family. At some point later, John and Pocahontas meet by a waterfall. Taken by surprise, John crouches low, and prepares to shoot the princess, but stops after she looks at him very majestically and commandingly (not in a mean way, just like ""you will not hurt me""). This starts an unsuspecting romance between the two, and eventually causes the Natives and the Europeans to clash, because each think the other are savages. Pocahontas, with the help of Grandmother Willow, realizes that fighting must stop and she must follow her heart. She teaches John this through the beautiful and moving song ""Colors of the Wind"", my personal favorite Disney song of all time. A terrific battle scene ensues, accompanied by ""Drums of War."" I won't give away any more.But does this really sound racist to you? This movie is about stopping racism and prejudice, how love can overcome any obstacle. HOW THE HECK IS THAT RACIST?????? People are also saying it's an overdone storyline, but the only movie I can think of right now that has the same basis would be Last of the Mohicans, which is hardly a children's film. And, anyway, doesn't everything get a little repetitive these days? I've also read some things that say this movie is sexist. Because Pocahontas apparently throws herself and John or something. So basically, wouldn't every other princess movie (with the exception of Beauty and the Beast or maybe Aladdin) be the same way? Don't all of the princesses pretty much throw themselves at their princes?Back to Pocahontas, this movie is my childhood. I remember watching it when I was little, I was obsessed. I would call knots in trees Grandmother Willow, laughed at Meeko and Flick, I sang and danced to the songs. And now, a fourteen year old, Pocahontas remains one of my favorite movies. Honestly, we need more movies like it. Killing has become so popular these days, and now we've lost sight of the importance of peace and love in the world. I know, I sound very cheesy, but it's true. I wonder if everyone in the world, right now, watched Pocahontas right now they might think twice before polluting or killing.I think Pocahontas is great for both kids and adults. All though the message may be a little deep for kids to wrap their minds around, they'll love the animation, animals, songs, and action. Maybe they'll even have some understanding of what's really happening. Adults would enjoy again the animation and the surprising maturity of the plot, and of course, the music as well.This movie is a must-see for children and adults alike, even if it is a ""kid's movie"". I know I'll be showing my kids when I'm older!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Tires to hard to be epic,Disney tired to make another Oscar best picture nominee like beauty and the beast and you can see they tried hard maybe too hard to make that happen. I think Disney got to cocky with beauty and the beast and then the lion king and they wanted this to be an epic film and it overall just end up being ok. I found the plot to be the weakest link maybe if this film was made now in 2021 it could of been better but in the 90's they made it so blah. The songs are meh too except colours of the wind but even that is just ok in my mind. It's not a bad Disney film it's just an ok Disney one and it wouldn't be on my fav Disney lists that's for sure.,5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great old classics,"when i saw this movie the first time, i found it beautiful, it has been my favorite movie through all this years, it's just beautiful, i cant get it how the hell it is rated with 6.3 stars. because she is the most beautiful and the bravest girl of all time! i haven't seen this for a long long time, and i can tell you for sure that this is one of the best animations of all time, because this is full of teachings, a true love tale, and above all they leave us with a big expectation of what happens next, because, you see, it doesn't matter if there is a sequel, for me Pocahontas 2 is like it has never existed, because every time we see this movie we will think of how great the human spirit can be, how great this movie makes us feel. and i know that you may not understand or agree with all I'm saying but, this is from the bottom of my childish heart, and no matter what happens ever, i will let my intern child live, and my children, if someday i have some, they will certainly see this good all classics.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Deserves More Recognotion,"Released in 1995 'Pocahontas' will forever remain in the shadow of 'The Lion King', however it does deserve more credit than it gets. Not as strong story wise as its critically acclaimed Disney predecessors as 'Pocahontas' was Disney's first attempt at portraying a true story and one that is fundamentally very serious. Despite the obvious problem that the film has in providing genuine humour once again Alan Menken proves a sure fire hit in the music department this time teamed with Stephen Shwartz, together they produce a score filled with emotion. Overall 'Pocahontas' doesn't match the brilliance of 'The Little Mermaid', 'Beauty & The Beast', 'Aladdin' or 'The Lion King ' but deserves the title of a Disney Classic none the less. Not as child friendly as other Disney films, the doomed romance story line is more suited to an adult film but still proves to be compelling viewing and provides some extremely emotion felt and unforgettable scenes.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Some distinct failings here..,"Most people can this film immediately for it not being historically accurate, even though it never claims to be.  Personally I don't understand why a film that uses loose renditions of characters that once existed is immediately saddled with the burden of being historically accurate down to the smallest nuance.  (Will someone please find me the ""Based on a True Story"" that is subliminally hidden somewhere in the credits of this film?) ""Pocahontas"" suffers for other reasons, namely a lot of very flat, murky backgrounds that do not provide interaction the way The Lion King's did. Everywhere you look in this film, there is a black and bluish green haze that is supposed to represent the unspoiled American forests of old, and characters who dash around it as though they actually understand that it's just airbrushed cardboard standing up to block the viewer from seeing grips on their coffee break.   Yes, this whole movie is an animated version of soundstage filming, and one gets the sense that the only way those trees could be alive would be to have one actually sprout a face and start talking.  What a shame that it was only during the musical numbers that the creators brought vividness to this potentially beautiful landscape, and left it very dreary everywhere else.  Really, the songs are the only parts of this movie that have passion in them, and it doesn't help that most of the main characters (including John Smith and Chief Powhattan) are kept as flat as the backgrounds.  Right when the dialogue starts to get interesting and personality threatens to appear, the scene is interrupted by various forms of interruption which seem to interrupt solely for the purpose of curtailing the development of the characters.  There is something corny about the climax of this movie as well, that the two warring parties are singing as they prepare to kill one another.   The animals characters are endearing, but it's the humans that are necessary to make this film successful, and not one of them has half the charm of Meeko.  Worth renting for the music and some clever scenes, but this one's just not powerful or moving enough to be a classic.",,Anonymous,Animation
A Timeless Classic,"Despite its historical inaccuracies, Disney's Pocahontas was a wonderfully vibrant tale of love and courage. The animation was breathtaking, to say the least. One thing that I focus on when seeing a movie for the first time is the music - does the music go well with the theme? To answer this question, all the songs were brilliantly conveyed through their lyrics and melodies. Up there with the other Disney classics, Pocahontas deserves to be cherished by generations to come.It's amazing how they pick the perfect people to voice the characters; Mel Gibson (along with the others) did a great job. As one of the few movies that will make you cry, it will leave you with a warmth in your heart and a tear in your eye.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Girl who is responsible and with character,"Most of the animation movies are about immature girl falling in love with a stranger from another place and then leaving with the crush into his own world. Although that's where the movies end, i am always curious about what would happen after the movie!! This is where i found the ending of the movie very good. it showed, she has character, leadership, strength and is caring for her people. Another aspect I liked was how she sneaked out, and he sneaked out, and both tried to keep it secret, it makes it more realistic.Also I liked the honesty in the movie, how even a sincere guy thinks the natives are savages, uncivilized, and how the captain came for gold, greed and land, and who wanted to wipe out the ""race"". Although in reality that is exactly what happened, in the movie, things turned out better. At least it made me believe and hope that may be something like this actually happened, somewhere in the world. Remember British did not just come to America, they did colonize practically the whole world.And overall the lesson is good, just because we are different does not mean the others are savages, or inhuman. Just because a group has more technology, does not make them civilized either. And there is more to life, nature, spirituality, the 4th dimension, than just materials and wealth. And ""sometimes the right thing to do is not always the easiest one"". Its a good watch, but its definitely not for children, its more for thinking adults!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Listen to this film with your heart,"If you can get past the inaccuracies in historical detail, you'll find that the heart of this film's message is respect -- respect for our natural world, respect for each other, and respect for our cultural differences.If your children are old enough to understand history and discern the difference between truth and fiction, they should know that events did not really happen as the movie depicts, and they should be taught the sad story of this country's indigenous people.A fundamental belief of native Americans was an unceasing acknowledgement of their God-given natural resources.  And although in reality the early settlers were not out to plunder this land for gold, (it was tobacco and escape from religious persecution, I believe,) the film's fictitious motive helps illustrate the adversarial relationship between the Indians and Whites that ensued for the next two centuries.John Smith's explorer's curiosity and Pocahontas' open heart transcend the physical and philosophical differences which provide the story's conflict. I was surprisingly touched by the song ""Colors of the Wind"" the first time I heard it.  It is a love song about life that tells you to look at the world around you and appreciate it with more than just your eyes.  There's even a Zen-style paradox to the lyric ""paint with all the colors of the wind"" which children may come to understand in their own way better than adults.Reviews about this film are filled with criticisms about the plot line, characters, and how the film offends history.  The film's message of tolerance, respect, and acceptance is an important one for young minds. Ignore all the other stuff and listen to this movie with your heart.By the way, all the performances are top notch, but I especially enjoyed the talented David Ogden-Stiers (Charles Emmerson Winchester from TV's M*A*S*H*) as both Governor Ratcliffe AND his own side-kick, Wiggins!",,Anonymous,Animation
typical Disney fare,"Well, what Disney does it does quite well, but don't go expecting anything other than your standard Disney movie. This film is clearly in the same vein as all the rest and if you're looking for something simple, short and suitable for children you could do worse. Unfortunately, that's all there is to this movie.

The worst theatrically-meant animated Disney piece ever. And I have (literally) seen everything Disney has ever animated.,"There are not enough words in the English language (or any other language, for that matter) to properly sum up this movie's awfulness. As a professional in the animation industry, I am appalled by this film and its complete lousiness (not to mention wildly stupid and inexcusable historical inaccuracy) to the point of silence. So instead of the usual carefully-written commentary, I'll sum it up in one word simply because that one word is the best way I can think of to sum up POCAHONTAS in cooperation of all of the IMDb's review guidelines:Avoid.That's it. Really. I'm serious. No huge comments from me, suffice it to say that everything negative you've ever heard about this disaster is true. Little wonder that it alone has come so darn close to sinking the entire Disney animation department and its performance track record. From here on out, The New Disney would struggle to keep the audience that it had always taken for granted.I think I hear poor Walt spinning in his grave.",,Anonymous,Animation

Where I live, we don't have trees that tall. I found them impressing. And for the story... I'm not that familiar with American history, so I'd never heard of Pocahontas before. That's why I don't judge the story on historic accuracy, I simply consider it a beautiful Romeo & Juliet-like story. And after 4 or 5 viewings, I even started to appreciate the slow pace.

An insult to the true story of Pocahontas,"Although children would not care about the historical accuracy of this film I was bothered by Captain Smith and Pocahontas' relationship. For one, when Captain Smith arrived in Jamestown in 1607 Pocahontas would have been 12. It was tribal ritual to ""capture"" someone and ""rescue"" them. Captain Smith had a very special relationship with Pocahontas, but it was more of a father-daughter relationship. In all my studies that I have done on her, I have NEVER read that she was raped by Captain Smith. Also, the Little Mermaid is fiction, not a fairly tale.The real story of Pocahontas is just as romantic as the Disney one. She was a strong young woman. For God sake she was taken and held captive. She learned to adapt to her changes and she did eventually meet and fall in love with John Rolphe. She was also married, not betrothed in real life to a man from her tribe. This was arranged by Powhatan.The animation was beautiful and the songs were nice. I just wish that someone, someday would tell HER story. I give this 3 out of 5 stars.",,Anonymous,Animation
Boring,"This movie has very little going for it. There's the historically inaccurate problem that numerous reviewers have already addressed ad nauseum, and personally? I don't go to a Disney movie expecting a history lesson, but that's just me. The characters are boring and uninteresting, and the story is boring and uninteresting. I find it odd that everyone in the movie has a different accent, although we only have two groups. Since the Native Americans are speaking English, which they wouldn't be obviously, I give them a pass. The Englishmen are all over the place. Some have American accents, a few have English, one is definitely Scottish, it would be less distracting if they were just all American or English. I know there's supposed to be a great moral, but the story is so tedious the moral gets lost. Overall it's just tiresome, monotonous and lifeless.

Weak Disney cartoon.,"Somehow, this 33rd animated motion picture is one of the weakest Disney cartoons. Though, good animation, good acting and the best (and surprisingly, only good) song titled: ""Colors of the Wind"", which won a Golden Globe and Academy Award is what saves the movie. It appears that Pocahontas falls in love with explorer/adventurer John Smith (Mel Gibson, who helps this movie a lot). Then, Smith tries to save Pocahontas' Indian tribe after he and his team can't find anymore gold in the ground. Pocahontas barely stretches out to 80 minutes; this cute animals business is a mess; the movie can't confess that it's based on a true story.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Underrated,"I'm still surprised that Pocahontas didn't get at least 8 in it's ratings. For a movie that was made in the 90's i think the animation is perfect with details such as the environment of America back then and mouth vocal accuracy. Not to mention the music, it gives shivers down my back, listening to songs such as Colors of the Wind, If I Never Knew You and so on. This movie show so much of two different cultures (Not racism in some issue) meeting for the first time. On the other side, the story on this film is suitable for a rather understanding children because the topic is not as easy as other Disney movies.

Not as bad as I expected....,"Disney films such as ""The Hunchback"" and ""Pocahontas"" are films I did not want to watch because I already knew--or at least sensed--that the historical context was going to be bent somewhat out of shape. I have not yet seen the Hunchback, but Pocahontas is an attempt to put a new suit of clothes on an old story. An attempt was made by the writers to at least put on the table the differing points of view of the arrival of Whites from both perspectives...the conqueror and the soon to be vanquished. Though conflict in this instance was averted, the Natives were going to ultimately be the big losers and, as if that weren't enough, within several years of the date of this story--1607--Jamestown would become the point of entry for African slaves, brought over as cargo to till the soil and build the new land under the rule of cat-o-nine-tails. But, Pocahontas deals with only a small fraction of time. Despite my mis-givings, I have to say the story-line was not overly bad, and I was amazed at the excellent quality of the film score. However, one cannot help but feel sorry for the Natives because, with the invaders cast as guys that were not all that bad, the indigenous peoples have a hand in bringing about their own downfall by accepting those who had lust for the land and for its riches without regard to the lives and well being of those who were already on the land and who had been there for millenia. If one is able to get past the facts, they may be able to get some enjoyment from this film. And I can only recommend this film to those who can cast aside their feelings for a time in order to watch it.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Love it or Hate it, it is one hell of a movie","I haven't watched Pocahontas in maybe ten years, but I was feeling nostalgic one day and popped it in. I could not believe how truly BEAUTIFUL this movie is, in every aspect.STORY: Dramatic (with it's humorous moments of course), romantic, and it carries a very important message of peace, maturity, and fighting against ignorance and prejudice from BOTH sides. This is possibly the Disney movie with the greatest message for kids.ANIMATION: Drop. Dead. Gorgeous. Every single frame is such wonderful eye candy, and the camera work serves the sweeping story line extremely well.MUSIC: Aside from the songs everyone knows (Just Around the River Bend and Colors of the Wind) every single other song in the film is wonderful, with soaring harmonies and Broadway quality singing. Everything was masterfully written and executed. The music alone is reason enough for this to be adapted into a full out Broadway musical, but don't worry...the music is brilliant but it doesn't scream ""MUSICAL!"" like Hairspray or Mamma Mia.HISTORIC ACCURACY: Yes, Disney changed the true story quite a bit, but if you look to Disney for accurate re-telling's of historical events you have a serious PROBLEM. This movie is more 'Inspired by' than 'Based on' and since the true story is about a 13-14 year old falling in love with 30-40 year I think we can all appreciate that they took some liberties with a KIDS' MOVIE.All in all, I really don't get why this isn't revered as a classic right along with The Lion King and Beauty and the Beast.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

** out of ****,"One of my least favorite Disney animated films, Pocahontas suffers from a weak story, weak characters, and only mediocre animation.  The scenery is very good at times, but the people look terrible.  Not only that, this film commits one of the worst sins of an animated feature, and that is having an extraordinarily lame villain.  There is nothing menacing, or fearful about him at all.  He's just annoying.  On a more positive note, however, I do like several of the songs.  Despite this, having a decent soundtrack does not make up for the numerous problems with the film, and unfortunately, there are many.",,Anonymous,Animation
The animation and music carries the movie,"One thing I've always admired about one of Disney's earlier 90s films, The Lion King, is that it balances everything perfectly. The music is great, the visuals are amazing and the story is well-developed and solid. The characters are distinct and interesting.Pocahontas is different. While the songs and background score are fantastic thanks to Alan Menken, and the animation is vibrant, captivating, and beautiful, the story and characters are weak. On the first watch it's easy to be swept away by the visuals and music and completely forget about how flat, generic and sometimes even cheesy the writing is. Apart from this, everything is so inaccurate, it's almost hilarious. From Pocahontas magically being able to speak English after one scene to John Smith's actions. Sure, it's a ""kids movie,"" as people like to say whenever negative aspects like this are pointed out. But these same people will gawk over Disney's greater films (The Little Mermaid, Beauty And The Beast, The Lion King), calling them some of the greatest movies of all time, so it's only right to point out that these beautiful animations aren't just for children, so a little accuracy isn't too much to ask. I'd say Pocahontas is more inaccurate than it is accurate, which is a problem. Many of the characters in Pocahontas are shallow, the man Pocahontas is originally supposed to marry, for example. The villian, Ratcliffe, is incredibly boring, nothing like some of Disney's memorable antagonists (Scar, Ursula, Jafar). You can tell that during this time Disney understood what people would watch and how to achieve success: Disney princess, animal sidekick, music, visuals, prince, father forcing daughter to marry someone she doesn't want. The script is predictable and bland, the pacing slightly strange. The visuals and music are so overwhelmingly beautiful, though, that it's easy to forget that without them, there would be nothing but a historically inaccurate, dry and generic story we've seen dozens of times before.All that being said, I can understand why someone could enjoy the movie. I love the music and the way the vibrant animation flows. Colors Of The Wind is beautiful, one of my favorite Disney songs, and Just Around The River Bend is also a passionate song that is incredible, paired with the fantastic visuals. The score is also amazing, and I listen to it sometimes. If you are a person that watches animated films for the visuals and/or music and completely disregards the story, then Pocahontas will probably be a 10/10 for you. Sure, it's entertaining and it looks and sounds good, but behind the curtain the writing feels half-done and the characters are flat, which is why it doesn't deserve a high rating.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Nice message,"This movie can help a person understand how to be a good listener. The actors had some time in the forests to share their thoughts. Someone wanted to say that they were a 55 year old cunning military man. He even had his own song (which called the natives savages). That was too hard to watch. I took my best lucky charm from my pocked and let it drop to the floor. Then Pocahontas climbed a tree and screamed like an eagle. The Military sergeant drives up in a ford f150 and peers up into the tree with a pair of binoculars (sees her strong face). Do you want to go to dennys for a coffee,' he yells. Then she points to him screaming at a high pitch. He panics and runs away with a waterfall of teas pouring from his mouth.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Historically inaccurate?... Who cares? This is Disney!,"This film does not do the expected job of transporting you back to the day when this historic legend really happened back in the early 1600s, instead, true to Disney form, it unravels yet another fairytale just with a Native American makeover. True there are Native American backdrops, some Native American music and, of course, Native American people but has been dusted with typical Disney fairytale magic and is not to be used as reference to the true story if you want it told accurately. But it wouldn't be Disney to bring the legend to life as such but to bring it to fairytale and fictional twists. Pocahontas' pets Meeko the raccoon and Flit the hummingbird would never have existed in true life, would they? Neither would Grandmother Willow. This was to be suitable for kids as well as grown-ups so Disney did their stuff and the result is very positive yet very underrated. The movie has received major criticism for its inaccuracy. Pocahontas and John Smith are lovers here and history states that they probably weren't at all and it is a known fact that Pocahontas was, in real life, much younger than in her Disney depiction (and not half as beautiful) and John Smith was much, much older than the handsome young man he is depicted to be here but what did the critics expect the film to contain - serious violence, serious war scenes, Pocahontas being held captive for a long time, Pocahontas being murdered at just 21? It'd be ordeal of a film experience for children and here we have a beautiful love story symbolizing the triumph of peace over war; plus brilliant songs, a haunting music score, lush animation and well-selected voice talents.As it is based on a true story, there is some drama here that could never be taken away, even from a Disney adaptation. Also, unlike other Disney fairy tales, we have a sad ending, a very sad ending. If I told you the ending I'd be telling! So you'll have to watch and find out. It is definitely worth your time - it isn't all doom and gloom and adults might also like it.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Although I pointed out that the actors playing the Natives in this film were in fact of Native origin, she still thought the film was insulting.Although I like the film and love the songs, I can see why this film has had some controversy. The film is probably the most adult Disney film in terms of content and although the film is supposed to be based on actual events, the film goes in an entirely different direction - another point my grandmother pointed out ""they could've been more accurate with the story"". So while I wouldn't rank it up with ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""The Lion King"" Pocahontas is a pretty good film but might not be interesting for the kiddies.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

"moving, imaginative and an animated gem","I loved this film from childhood, and still I only have to hear the music to me buzz inside!The plot is based on a (not too well known)true moving story about an Indian Chief's daughter and an English settler, trying to bring peace between their two different, but endearing worlds.In my opinion, this film is a Disney jewel, their best work ever, the likes of which we don't see any more. The film is comical, beautiful, moving and inspiring. It teaches children and adults alike about moral values and to create love not war. The evil Governor Radcliffe is a classic Disney villain, though not a truly terrifying as some are! His sidekick Higgins, and dog Percy bring the comic element to the film, and an amazing musical soundtrack makes this film a fantastic experience. Colours of the Wind particularly stands out as one of Disney's best songs and the film isn't as fairytale and clichéd as some animations are. Pocahontas is one of the better role models and her strong character modernises the film from a time when English women ere stifled. She is unafraid to speak out for what is right, no matter the consequence, but comes across an tough choice to make. With the help of Grandmother Willow, the magical Willow tree bringing a fantastical element to the film, as a wise guide to life, and Meeko & Flit her animal companions, we join Pocahontas on a magical quest for peace that should never be forgotten.To summarise, the film never gets tiring, the soundtrack is to be applauded and the language and morals are thought-provoking and moving. This film is not only for children, but deserves to be passed down through the generations as a piece of history.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

It's Not As Bad As Prople Said,"Pocahontas (1995)I remember the backlash when this movie was released, there was a big backlash about how the Native Americans were portrayed, depending on the article, it was rather insensitive at best or racist at worst. Personally I don't think it's that bad. It's not as good as the other Disney movies released around that time. Aladdin, Beauty & The Beast, Little Mermaid and of course The Lion King are vastly superior!! But it's not the awful movie you may remember!!I'll probably never watch it again in my life, and truthfully if my girlfriends daughter wasn't sat watching with me, I may have even turned it off, but I have sat through worse.Despite the critical mailing, Pocahontas grossed $141 million at the domestic box office, to end the year the fourth highest grossing movie of 1995.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
The special edition to this movie is a lot better than the original,"Pocahuntas is a 1995 Disney movie based on true life events about a Native American Princess who falls in love with a handsome English sailor named John Smith. I got this on DVD two years ago and I actually enjoyed this movie.I have the special edition if this movie and it features John Smith singing to Pocahuntas called If I never Knew You which was cut in the original 1995 version. The music is brilliant Alan Menkin & Stephen Schwartz(Enchanted,HBOND),the characters are great,the chemistry between John Smith and Pocahuntas is so romantic and very sweet I liked them in this movie,the story is very well put together as it centers on Pocahuntas who is the heroine of this film.I truly enjoyed this film but if you never seen the sequel then avoid as it isn't as magical or fun as the original masterpiece from Walt Disney pictures.Another thing is that I love the song If I never knew you as its so romantic and I never realized that Mel Gibson was a great singer. Trust me I have it on DVD for 2 years and its 100% better than the sequel which was just awful.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Courageous, Brilliant, and Uplifting! A #1 For Disney!","Some of the best animation in film history can be found here, and being arguable as having the 'best songs ever' in an animated movie!Aside from it's beautiful artwork, 'Pocahontas' (the movie) is beautiful itself. Surpassing 'The Lion King' as if it had never even existed. Who cares if the story doesn't go along with the true to life events of Pocahontas?

If one goes around knocking movies for that reason then you need not see any at all.Courageous, Brilliant and Uplifting! It will be hard to escape this one without crying.

This film is my favourite Disney - it is so beautiful and exciting!,"Genre: Animated film based on the real life of Pochahontas. Set in America with Native Americans.Personally, I don't see how this movie could have so many bad reviews. It is BEAUTIFUL AND EXCITING PLUS MUCH MORE!!!!!!!!This film is about a Native American woman called (obviously) Pochahontas. She watches English people arrive in America to take over. She meets one Englishman called John Smith. Can Pochahontas teach John how to respect the earth and not help take over (Sorry, you have to watch to find out, I won't keep you posted)?I absolutely love this film for five main reasons. Reason 1: I love all the characters, even the main baddie - he has a good voice etc. My three favourite characters are Pochahontas, John Smith and Meeko (I am one of their biggest fans). Reason 2: This film is based on real life. It is very interesting to watch the only Disney classic to be based on real life. Reason 3: I love the animation, drawings and backgrounds! They are beautiful and very life-like at times. Sometimes you feel very close to the Native Americans the animation is so good. Reason 4: I love all the songs, my favourite is ""Colours Of The Wind."" I also like ""Just Around The Riverbend"" (It's got my favourite quote: ""What I love about rivers is, you can't step in the same river twice. The water's always changing, always flowing.""). Reason 5: It isn't funny, yet it isn't serious either. It has jokes dropped in at appropriate times, which I like.So watch this movie, you're guaranteed NOT to dislike it!! :) ;) :()",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Animated epic narrative,"What will happen when British fortune hunters in the period of colonization arrive in the New World and are faced with ""wild and fierce"" Indians? ""Pocahontas"" wants to give the answer to this question. It shows two totally different worlds opposing each other, and misunderstanding on both sides - concerning language and ideology.The Indians in this movie are not described as the bad ones, but the Whites are not the good ones either.Both groups comprise sinister characters as well as such characters that walk through their world with open eyes and without any prejudice.On the Indians' side, this character, of course, is the chief's daughter Pocahontas, who falls in love with the British captain John Smith. And this captain,in my opinion, is the most interesting characters of all in this movie. How he changes from a man who doesn't care much about the ""wild"" to an enlightened person makes the movie some epic narrative, a work also for adults.The fact that it's not only a story for children is strengthened by the animated violence shown here which is not characteristic for Walt Disney. For example, a young Indian is killed by British gun fire.One last word about the voice talents: Great work! I loved the different accents of the British. And by the way: Have a look at the faces of the characters. Never before have I seen such a perfect coordination of voices and mouth animations.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Good Animated Movie,"I just watched ""Pocahontas"" for the first time and I enjoyed it. I don't watch many animated films and I am probably not the target audience, so I do find them somewhat challenging to rate. In terms of my engagement and enjoyment of this film I rate it an 8/10. The strengths here are the good animation and the lovely music. The story is somewhat mature for children featuring violence and conflict. I actually wished there was more peace shown in this film, like of the Native Americans helping the English farm and survive the winter. But it was a short film and it did a good job of sketching the characters and the scene. I was even impressed by the restrained pace and tension, such as when Pocahontas first met John Smith. Usually children's movies don't take the time to allow scenes to simmer and develop such as that. So all in all, this is one of the better animated films that I've seen, though I have not seen many, and I would recommend it if you're in the mood for something like this.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Underrated Gem Gets a new life in a new 10th Anniv. Edition,"I have always felt Pocahontas was an underrated gem. While critics were complaining that characters seemed soulless or too simply drawn, I was dumbstruck and heartbroken by the stillness and emotional weight of the minimalistic art direction, pacing, character interactions. It seems the movie is gaining a new fan base since its release, which is more than deserved. For a special treat (and to really get an idea of how far these animators were pushing the boundaries) check out the 2nd disk on the 10th anniversary edition, the extras includes a side by side comparison of that beautiful first encounter between Pocahontas and John Smith. If you were nuts about it before, see it here in its original charcoal storyboard.

"Beautiful movie, beautiful message about loving the earth","Pocahontas suffers from a dated depiction of native American tribes and the fact that it came out the same year as Disney's masterpiece The Lion King, but it's so much better than the Princess Movies that get more attention. Pocahontas feels like a real person with hopes and dreams and fears, the score is breathtaking and the animation is absolutely lovely. Yes, there are stereotypes, but on the whole it's not the most backward story from the 90s, and if you watch with a critical eye and a grain of salt, you can learn a lot about history and love and taking care of mother nature. Colors of the Wind is one of the best songs in the world.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
suchhhh a Great movie.,"I'am watching this in 2020, it was greattttt I really loved this movie, have to mention it was such a beautiful romance. Also i'm sad about the fact that all the native americans (Indians) got destructed and they don't exist anymore.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of Disney's most beautiful artworks,"I've fallen in love with that movie on the first time I saw it. The musical score is one of the best (if not THE best) ever seen on a Disney movie. The tale is not about the real Pocahontas, but rather about a Native American woman who shows the English settlers that there's more to life than just exploiting nature for their own benefit. The spiritual tone of this movie is certainly an aspect some people dislike, but that was the reason I thought Pocahontas was something special. She is talking to a tree, her best friends are animals - so we actually believe every single word she sings in Color of the Wind to make John Smith understand why he's on the wrong path.It's just a pity they cut the love song If I Never Knew You. Should Disney ever release a Special Edition DVD they could finish the scene, because it would really give the finishing touch to the story.Concerning those bad reviews about Pocahontas not being historically accurate, all I can tell you is, please don't force your children to watch things that show historical facts the way they were. It's the most important aspect of those Disney movies that they use stories people know and alter them in a way to give children (and adults) something to think about. Their movies wouldn't be this touching had they used completely new stories or the original stories (hunchback of notre Dame, The Little Mermaid). For example, here in Europe, Pocahontas is a totally unknown name. When I watched this movie as a 12 year old I assumed they had made up the story completely. So it should be a good thing that I went to read who Pocahontas really was. It's the same with Hercules, after I saw that movie I went to read Greek mythology. Disney has (or should I say had, since their recent projects are not like they were in the 90s) the precious gift of focussing the people interests towards the topics of their movies. I'll always appreciate this when I see one of their masterpieces.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

This was a film that was fine for its time.,"Hmm...this film had good intentions in trying to make peace with the American Indians that we have wronged in the past. The environmental films such as this and Ferngully, the Last Rainforest in the early 1990s also created a sense of being at one with mother nature. This is laughable now as our economy is more important to keep strong.The music, as with most Disney full-length animated features, is great! Home on the Range is probably the last of these kind of films now that we're all buying into the computer animated age. Both types of animation have their strengths and weaknesses. The full-length animated features that Disney mastered ran from 1937 to 2004. All that is left seems to be sequels that Disney cranks out.Pocahontas, is indeed overlooked, but it's a period film and no longer is relevant to most of our complex technological culture. Young children under five may find this boring depending on their attention span. A hyperactive child, for example will scope this flick for approximately five minutes. Scooby-Doo cartoons or other fast-paced cartoon action with plenty of colors and happy, friendy characters that don't kill each other are for kids. Emporer's New Groove is a great Disney example for fast-paced fun and exciting times in front of the boob-tube.Animation: 10/10 Story: 7/10 Fun Factor: 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Another Creative Disney Effort!,"We all know that the 1990's were home to the Disney Renaissance, in other words a return to form for Disney Animation. This film, Pocahontas is one of those films. But I view this film as the weakest of the bunch. It's not bad or anything, but I am very historically-minded and the historical inaccuracies just couldn't be so obvious as it was distracting at times. That being said, there is plenty to adore about this film. The songs, composed by Alan Menken, are incredible especially that song, ""Colors of the Wind."" The animation is lavish and it provides some beautiful sights in the Virginia Territory.This film tells the tale of Pocahontas and Captain John Smith and the romance that sprung up between two cultures, thus creating a clash. The English, led by Governor Ratcliffe, are bound for the New World in order to find gold. The Indians, led by Powhatan, has Pocahontas being married off to the greatest warrior of the village, but she believes she has a different path to follow.This film does have a solid voice cast. Mel Gibson does fine voice work as John Smith and I am very surprised he has a singing ability. The unknown Irene Bedard does a decent job as the titular character herself. We also get good supporting voice acting from the likes of Christian Bale and David Ogden Stiers.Overall, Pocahontas is a good movie with beautiful animation and wonderful music. But I am usually the one of the few that can overlook historical inaccuracy, but not this time due to it being blatantly obvious. Despite being on the B-tier of Disney movies, this film does manage to inspire and tell a tale of a forbidden romance. The film can be pretty funny at times thanks to the shenanigans of the raccoon and the Governor's dog. All-in-all, not a bad movie. Don't expect this film to be like the Little Mermaid. I rate this film 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great movie,"I recently just watched this movie and was shocked how great this movie really is. I'm surprised how negative everyone is about the historical accuracy. It's a Disney movie, an animated children's movie. Of course, it's not suppose to accurate. The point of the movie is to deliver a message to children, not to teach 6, 7, 8 year olds historical facts. Yes this movie is ""hollywood-ized"" but like I said it's a Disney film whose purpose is to entertain not to inform. It delivers a beautiful message especially with the song savages. Both sides sing the same song to show how similar they are. They had this message earlier with the song, ""Colors of the Wind"". Also, it teaches children to follow their hearts and not follow the crowd/mob mentality.If you're really judging this movie solely on historical accuracy, that is just plain dumb. I mean seriously, are you really trying to teach your kids history through a Disney movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great animation film based on History,"I loved Pocahontas and I thought it was a great animated film based on history of the real Indian Pocahontas! In the movie Captain John Smith (Mel Gibson) sails to the New World of Jamestown Virginia with a group of settlers and falls in love with Pocahontas (Irene Bedard) but the settlers led by Govenor Ratcliffe (David Ogden Stiers) and the Native Americans led by Pocahontas' father Chief Powatahn (Russell Means) wish to fight each other to protect eachothers' land so it's up to Pocahontas and her forest friends Meeko, Grandmother Willow, and Flit and John Smith and his dog Percy to bring peace between their people! The music is very wonderful written by Alan Menken and Steven Schwartz. Colors of the WInd always blows me away every time I hear Pocahontas sing it! My favorite scenes in the movie were when Meeko jumps into Percy's bath and eats all his cherries and Percy chases him and I also liked it when settlers Ben and Lon (Billy Connolly and Joe Baker) come into the forest looking for Smith and get scared away by Grandmother Willow. I just died laughing at those scenes! Disney did a fantastic job telling the story of Pocahontas through animation!

Whenever I see this film it's always better than I'd remembered.,"So why don't I have a better memory?  I think it's because the flaws in `Pocahontas' are of the kind most likely to be noticed by lovers of fine animation like myself.  The following paragraph will read like nit-picking, but I must write it and get it out of the way.The canoes, the GARISHLY coloured bark on Mother Willow - almost all of the computer-generated bits and pieces just look ugly and ill at ease in this hand-drawn world.  Just because we CAN use 3-D software, doesn't mean we MUST ...  And Disney's fabled character animation is a bit of a let-down, too.  The general character mould is meant to evoke a kind of cheap wood-cut, which is fine, but the style doesn't appear to lend itself to fluid or convincing or appealing movement.  The English crew have little personality, and the Native Americans might as well have been carved as drawn.This does NOT apply to Pocahontas herself.  (Who is, incidentally, a gorgeous babe.  This is not important.  I just thought I'd mention it.) During the scene in which she and John Smith first meet face-to-face we're as mesmerised as they are: it looks as if they're just standing still; but, of course, if they WERE just standing still, it wouldn't work at all. THAT'S animation for ya.  Meeko, the comic relief raccoon, is another triumph.  I've always thought Disney's animals to be far funnier than, say, Warner Brothers', largely because the animators are expressing the animal's character with the drawings rather than pasting gags on top of the character: were I to argue this case at length, Meeko would be one of my star exhibits.My only real complaint about the story is that we're rushed through it a bit too quickly.  Twenty more minutes - fifteen - could have made all the difference.  When will the day come when animated films aren't all the same length?  But it's moving enough even so.  If animation still lives in a children's ghetto, we should blame not the creators - who lavish more imagination and feeling on their work than is ever lavished on stuff like `Ten Things I Hate About You', to far less critical reward - but the audience.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Yet, it is unbelievable that people are complaining about historical accuracy in a Disney movie. I like the way Disney handled everything and gave it a more matute tone, compared to other films in their catalogue. Even though the plot is predictable, but it is still emotional and I literally cried at the end. The movie also carries important messages regarding respect and preservation of nature, even bringing awareness to ethnocentricity and how we can overcome it by being united. And of coarse the animation style is gorgeous! The music is also beautiful, and perhaps one of the best Disney soundtracks ever! In some of the scenes the music literally speaks for itself.

Strangely the cast has many a famous face with the likes of Thomas being voiced by Christian Bale (Batman) and John Smith being voiced by Mel Gibson (Braveheart) I think that goes to show that this film isn't really off a poor quality. Weirdest off all the film all though cartoon isn't very much a Disney princess type off child appealing film but I remember watching Pocahontas as a child and loving it especially Meeko the raccoon all though he doesn't say a weird he had me in stitches.

Pocahontas,"Every family has a black sheep. You know, the one who never really fit in and always gets criticized. And the ""Disney Animated Classics"" canon is no exception. The black sheep in this family? Pocahontas.Not because it wasn't profitable (there have been far less successful Disney classics) or accomplished enough. So, the real reason? The Lion King. No film could have been a worthy follow-up to ""The Lion King"" Disney was on a roll between ""The Little Mermaid"" and ""The Lion King"", and it was inevitable that the next film would be a ""let-down"" because it doesn't get any bigger than ""Lion King"". So Pocahontas had to be scrutinized on how it compared to its predecessor's box-office gross, soundtrack sales, video revenues and what not. All that, instead of being appreciated for what it is: a NEW movie. A DIFFERENT direction. A DIFFERENT style.The film is a majestic piece of work, despite its flaws. It has a stylized artwork reminiscent of ""Sleeping Beauty"". The drawing is very angular and the mostly turquoise backgrounds are imbued by the characters' warm look. The music is good, especially ""Colors of the Wind"" and ""Mine, Mine, Mine"". It's not as memorable as in the Menken/Ashman movies but it's still beautiful.The film's main flaw is in its storyline. Disney should have used the idea of an Indian princess falling in love with an English settler without naming them Pocahontas and John Smith and claiming it to be ""based on true events"".Aside from that, it should be enjoyed for what it is. It deserves more than a 6.0 rating. Maybe with time, people would realize its true beauty and learn to love it.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Appreciate it for what it does have: Solid animation, great songs, and a beautiful story.One other complaint that I feel is wrong is how Governor Ratcliffe is such a weak villain. That's wrong. He was a great villain. One person said that all he wanted to do was help Smith. That's wrong. Ratcliffe didn't go to fight the Indians to help Smith, he went to kill the Indians so he could get the gold. And personally, I don't believe he was the real big bad villain. The real villain was the concept of misunderstanding, just like the concept of temptation was the true villain in Pinocchio. Ratcliffe's no Jafar or Gaston or Scar, but he doesn't need to be.This movie doesn't deserve to be bashed the way it is, and I'd give it a 9/10 (It's not Aladdin, but it's good enough).",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Indian Disney Princess/Sailor Senshi is not historically accurate! Oh, no!","Did somebody really expected from a movie with a talking tree any kind of historical accuracy to begin with? The previous Disney Princesses were already not accurate to the novels they were taken from, nobody cared one bit. What matters here is if the songs are catchy, if the animation is good, if the story is entertainment and if the general theme of the Disney Princesses to purse a dream and stick to your own beliefs (read: that love, at the end, reigns supreme) when the rest of the world not only is against you but it is filled to the brim of violence (I can hear the Sailor Stars theme from Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon ringing in my head while I write this down...how curious) is well told and respected, and this movie ticks all the boxes in that sense. That's what matters, not any mumbo-jumbo about the depiction of Pocahontas not being historically accurate or not. I'm also baffled at the fact that somebody saw this as insulting to the american natives, because this movie agrees with some of the views of the latters about the exploration and exploitation of the american continent by the europeans so what was the problem? They expected Uncle Sam by Alex Ross and Steve Darnell in this? I don't get it. Also, kudos for the ending, that is how you ""subvert the expectations"" in the right way and you provide an interesting change to the typical Disney Princess format. It gets a well deserved moonie recommendation from me and my beloved tears.When and how are we going to get a 90's Sailor Moon/Disney Princesses team up instead of idiotic live-action or CGI remakes from those IPs no one cares about? That's the real question here. Toei and Disney please consider the option, your fanbase (it's the same) is going to be extremely pleased if such occasion is going to be provided.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of my faves,"As a kid this was one of my favourites, because of the songs and how beautiful it was. It's not made to be historically accurate, but the movie itself is beautifully made.I listened to the songs over and over, wore out the cassette and the VHS. The animation is visually stunning and well done. So much talent went into this movie.I was excited to share with my kids. They love the songs and the animals, like Meeko the raccoon, although still too young to understand the movie as a whole, as the plot is more mature, than the newer movies out today.Hard to believe this movie is 29 years old!!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Nice Disney film, but not as good as previous ones","This was a nice movie. After great Disney movies such as The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin and The Lion King I think my expectations were a little too high. It couldn't live up to those mentioned but this movie still is worth watching. Although the story isn't that much, a couple of nice songs, the voice of Mel Gibson, some funny characters including a dog dressed as an Indian and a beautiful animated Pocahontas make this a nice Disney to watch. 7/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Pocahontas analysis and review,"The movie is very spiritual and free. It talked mainly about the differences between the colonist and the Indians. In both eyes of the group they saw each other as savages. The Indians love their land and their people and see that the British want to take it for them so the British can search for gold. When the British first arrive they stat digging for gold and search for the Indians. As the British start to settle in to the new land and alarm goes off. The Indians are aware of the visitors so the Indians go to search them. One Indian is spotted and shot thus meaning to the Indians that the British are I good and deserve to be punished.Pocahontas, the main character, has dealt with a major loss in her life when her mother past away. From then on she has tried to find her path when a strange dream has kept coming up in her sleep. She is asked for her hand in marriage by a very serious non- spiritual soldier and says that this path hat she would take with him is not what she wants. So when she mat John Smith they were aware and alert of each other when they first met but soon found a strong liking in each other and this lead toward between the two groups.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Nope, sorry","I first watched this movie with some friends of mine at a party. We were planning to really watch it at first. Instead, we ended up riffing on it ""Mystery Science Theater"" style. We just couldn't get past how boring and uninteresting it was. After a while, we just stopped paying attention. It's not only that it butchers history something fierce. Several movies have done that. This one just couldn't get away with it. You see everything that's going to happen in the movie from a million miles away, which really just drains the fun out of it. Except for the song ""Colors of the Wind"", the soundtrack wasn't that great, either. And Grandmother Willow? She just seemed to be thrown in to be the person (I'm sorry, tree) who tells the heroine to ""follow your heart"". That's basically all she did! What was the point of having her there? Anyway, ""Pocahontas"" just didn't do it for me. Go see ""Hunchback of Notre Dame"" instead.",,Anonymous,Animation
"Good, just not great","I've said it before, and I'll say it again... Disney hit a really good streak in the late '80s, early '90s.  From The Little Mermaid (1989) to my personal favorite, The Lion King (1994), as each year went by it just seemed like they got better and better.  Pochahontas is when things started to go down hill (which is ironic, considering that The Lion King was actually considered to be the B-movie to Pocahontas while the two movies were being made).In contrast to what some people have said, this is NOT the worst Disney movie ever made (that, in my book goes to The Hunchback of Notre Dame). It's just not as great as the ones that came before it.  The animation could have used a little more work, and the talking tree was a bit much...but the music by Alan Menken is pretty, not as great as the music he did in Beauty and the Beast, but it's still good.  I liked most of the songs, the plot had my attention... and you have to admit Meeko IS pretty adorable.I'll admit, I don't know much about the true story of Pocahontas, so I can't judge from a historical point of view.  All in all, though, Pocahontas is nothing spectactular, but it is still worth watching.6.5/10",,Anonymous,Animation
Why did I wait so long?,"I knew I would love ""All the colors of the wind"".  That was ecstatic animation and compelling song.  That song rules the movie.  But why did I wait so long?  Someone told me she was a Barbie Doll.  I heard nothing good about it.  Face it, in Japan you can miss things.  What struck me when I watched this hidden mystery, is that we were reminded that we could listen to our heart as a practical guide, we saw the obscene focus on getting gold as compared to a world of spirit and name and relationship.  It may not be history, but it is true parable.The kids loved the animals and they watched it through.  It has to be OK, doesn't it.  I think back to Mulan and Lion King and agree, those films had breathtaking scenes and high drama, more than in this film.  But I won't concede: it was gripping and passionate.  The young love story may have had nothing to do with history, but knew quite a bit about flesh and blood. Maybe it was too naive and now that I see what everyone else says, maybe the characters are flat.  But she is solemn and connected.  Her opening dive was thrilling.  This animation does what animation is supposed to do: exaggerate to the summit.What would really happen if a person of vision and spirit among us lived like Pocahontas, an eye on the essential, an ear to the spirit?  Suppose we could take such participatory living as our own prerogative?It was much better than I expected it to be.",,Anonymous,Animation
Cant get enough,"Every time i see this fantastic film i seem to love it more and more. It makes me cry every time and the love story between Pocahontas and John Smith just takes my breath away. The song 'Colours of the wind' has to be the most meaningful and beautiful song ever written. Also the extra song, added in the special edition, 'If i never knew you' is just magical, it makes the viewer feel and believe the love between Pocahontas and John Smith. I know the film is not historically accurate but i don't care! The magic of the story being brought to life by the music, voices and animation makes this film one of the most brilliant films I've ever watched. Just one piece of advise: WHATEVER YOU DO Don't WATCH POCAHONTAS II: JOURNEY TO A NEW WORLD IT RUINS EVERYTHING!!!!!!!!!",,Anonymous,Animation
A Great Film! ...At First Glance...,"Pochahontas tells the story of a Native American girl who, with her tribe, lives on the coast of the eastern United States when the British arrive in their attempts to colonize the area. Curious because of a dream she's been having lately, she follows on of the Englishmen, John Smith, and the two fall in love. They have to work together to stop a war between the native tribe and the English, caused by their bias for each other.On the surface, this is a great Disney film. It has all the ingredients - good songs, good animation, cute love story. However, there are several issues with the film:Firstly, and I know many of you are sick of hearing this, but the historical inaccuracies. I know that Disney makes changes to everything, and they have to - they make children's movies! If kids saw the original version of The Little Mermaid, they'd probably be horrified! But I just can't overlook how much is brushed over in this film. I'm sure most of you are aware of the true story of Pochahontas - twelve years old, kidnapped by John Smith, carried back to England where she died of TB on the day she was supposed to leave and go back to North America, etc etc etc. I completely understand that Disney couldn't very well make *that* into a movie, but yet, every time I watch Pochahontas, the actually history plays in the back of my head.But hey, it's a kids movie. They don't know this stuff.My other problem is that Pochahontas is the start of the downfall of Disneys classic animation. You can see obvious cracks in what used to be fantastic films, and Pochahontas is the beginning of that. The songs, while great, feel forced in this movie - you sit there and question why they're just singing in the woods. Previous Disney movies pulled off the songs without you wondering such thing. Then there's the storyline.While Pochahontas would definitely be considered ""Classic Disney,"" particularly in comparison to animated toons they're producing today (Not all bad, but definitely different!), it has a definitive ""feel"" which separates it from it's predecessors. My only explanation is the seriousness of the plot. While all previous Disney films had serious issues going on in their plots, they still remained lighthearted. ""Pochahontas"" has to rely on a raccoon and a humming bird to provide the occasional comedic relief. For the rest of the film, you have America's predominantly white population having to watch about how their ancestors were murderers, and apparently cared about nothing more than gold (A generalization I didn't appreciate. While I understand that what the Europeans did to North America's natives was horrible, I find it hard to believe that every single person coming out of Europe had a cash register for a heart, and didn't care about the land at all). I'm not denying the validity of the topic, but it's a bit too heavy material for kids.I like ""Pochahontas."" While not being one of my all-time favourites, it's still a dang good Disney film, and it will always be considered a classic. However, this film can be plotted as the exact moment when the face of Disney began to change, and thus started it's relial on computer animation as opposed to classic, hand-drawn animation.",,Anonymous,Animation
Dramatic and exciting.,"This is a fine film. I think that if the ""Best Animated Feature"" Oscarcategory had been around then, this would have won it. It has greatanimation and fine charactars. This is a dramatic and excitingmovie, and it has some humour. I guess the only problem with it isthat it didn't stay true almost at all to  the story of the realPocahontas, but then what Disney film does?",,Anonymous,Animation
Really enjoyed this movie,"I never saw Pocahontas as a kid - as far I can remember. But after watching it for the first time I can say that I really liked it! The visuals are SO. PRETTY. Also I found the characters very charming (Meeko is so funny) and the music is fantastic (not only Colours of the Wind though, there are more beautiful songs).Despite that, it's not my favorite Disney movie. I don't know how to describe it exactly, but it's like there wasn't enough time for the characters to develop, what made it hard for me to emphasize with them. I expected a bit more from Pocahontas, but it's not a bad movie or whatsoever. It just misses the elements to stand out as a Disney movie for me, compared to classics such as The Lion King and The Little Mermaid.At the end I really enjoyed this movie and I like the message. It's not Disney's best movie ever, but in my opinion, it deserves more than a 6.7 rating.",,Anonymous,Animation
I loved it,"I don't know what it was. Maybe it was because it was the movie that came right after a fantastic movie, Lion King. Maybe it was because I had never heard of the story before. Maybe it was just because the TV and everything were constantly hyping it. Whatever the reason, I loved Pocahontas. I loved the music, story, charactors-everything! I got like a thousand Pocahontas products-tapes,songbooks,regular storybooks,games and lots more than that, even! It was a great movie because it showed that girls can achieve great things, that somebody you might not think can do something just might be able to. Great movie!(Just one note: A couple of the kissing scenes you should probably fast-forward through when you're watching it with little kids.)Anyway, all in all, great movie, I recommend it!",,Anonymous,Animation
Triumph in Character Construction!!,"I recently watched POCAHONTAS again, and I realized something new. It is a major achievement in characters. John Smith is a true blue hero, Ratcliffe is a very evil villain, who you never like once during the film, and Meeko is one of the sweetest and most endearing characters in any of the Disney films. While not my favorite Disney film, it is a major achievment in its characters.",,Anonymous,Animation
Will the real Pocahontas please stand up?,"My mother used to say I was descended from the real Pocahontas's tribe, but I never saw any evidence to that effect. Nevertheless, it interested me in looking up her story. The real story is that she was a hostage of the white settlers, assigned to Capt. Smith when she was a teenager captured from her father's house. Since this was a well-known Indian custom (and ancient practice among humans), there was little surprise or action proceeding from this kidnapping, and she was a hostage to peace between the Powhatans and the Europeans. It is unknown what Smith's and Pocahontas's feelings were about each other. Smith took her, still a teenager, to England dressed in English clothing of the time (and most of the true portrayals of Pocahontas are in English clothing). Smith did marry her, and Pocahontas bore him a child. She died of (I think) tuberculosis before she and her family could sail back to the US, at the age of 19, having been displayed at the English court as a reformed savage.",,Anonymous,Animation
"The inaccuracy is a con, the astounding animation, music, and voices are all pros to see this movie","Every other reviewer practically has talked about the historical inaccuracies in the film, so I'm going to spare the readers from that.It's not a film intended to be for a research history project, it's meant to be a tale of the spirit of who she was. I watched this for the first time in years today, and I analyzed the animation and music for the first time in ages, and realized how superior those things are in this film. When you compare it to other animated films, this one, along with Sleeping Beauty, looks real.I loved Menken's songs always, but despised most of his scores, particularly Aladdin. This is filled with beautiful drums and trumpets and strings. ""Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?"" is reminiscent when I think, can you see the images of the movie with just the score, and yes you can. This, as well as Beauty and the Beast and The Hunchback of Notre Dame are his crowning achievements as a score composer.Sure, it's inaccurate, but so is Anastasia. If you liked that one, you'll like this one. Even if you're like me and have mixed feelings about it, you should give Pocahontas a chance.",,Anonymous,Animation
"I'm sorry, but...","...I loved this movie, even though, after reading all of the intelligent reviews that have gone before this one, I feel guilty in doing so.I thought that POCAHONTAS was visually enchanting.  The colors and imagery of it all was perfectly vivid, and pulled me in, sad to say, until the ending credits.Of course the plot was abhorrent and nearly all just conjured up with the brains of those yucky people at Disney, but I overlooked that and just indulged in the cheap delight this movie had to offer.",,Anonymous,Animation
"Good movie, although historically incorrect","After falling in love with The Lion King, my family and I ventured to see Pocahontas.  Pocahontas, though not as brilliant as The Lion King, in short, was a good movie.  It was emotional.  It was moving.  It featured a handsome young man (John Smith) falling in love with a beautiful Indian woman (Pocahontas). What more could you want?  Touching, sweet, memorable...but incorrect.  In actual history, there was no love between Pocahontas and John Smith.  There was no rugged, blond young man or beautiful woman...instead, there was a young 10- to 12-year-old girl and a red-headed Smith who was a strict leader of his Jamestown crew.  Not the 1995 film Disney produced...In the box, without reference to its historical inaccuracy, Pocahontas was good...but a tad more serious than the movies before it.  It didn't feature a character as goofy as Aladdin's Genie, nor did it play upon comedy, like Aladdin and various scenes from The Lion King.The characters of Pocahontas were not as strong as other Disney movie characters either.  While Pocahontas was strong and daring, I felt her character did not completely develop itself.  It settled more on the love between her and John Smith.  Governor Ratcliffe was indeed wicked, but certainly not as terrorizing as Ursula (The Little Mermaid) or Scar (The Lion King).  Nor did I grow to love many of the characters... there was some stiffness about John Smith, and while Meeko made me laugh, I wished Percy and Flit would lighten up.  And Nakoma, Pocahontas' best friend, did not play much of best friend.  She was hardly in the movie, but when she was in a scene, I often wished she wasn't.The music was all right, but it definitely was not the music of Aladdin. The animation was all right as well...I love the colored leaves that floated towards the ship at the end of the film.Pocahontas, in short, was a good movie.  But I felt it didn't have the spark the movies before it did.  And sadly, the movies after it, The Hunchback of Notre Dame and Hercules, lacked whatever spark Pocahontas had as well.",,Anonymous,Animation
A love story between a Native American girl and an English settler in the early days of the North American Colonies.,"Don't get me wrong, this movie is one of those great Disney animated films that you can sing along to and just plain enjoy. The songs are amazing with great tunes and cheesy (but nice) lyrics. You can't really go wrong with the movie. However the story of Pocahontas and the English settlers is completely butchered in this film. I almost feel bad for loving it so much. All I can say is that the movie is great and it's for everyone, just that you should be cautious on how authentic the ""love story"" really is. As a matter of fact, you should be cautious on the whole story, because most of it isn't true at all. It's interesting to do some research after the film if you REALLY want to know what Pocahontas's story was.",,Anonymous,Animation
*a slight correction*,"In regards to my earlier message, I would like to say that what I meant by 'glamourized' Native American culture, was the stereotypical rituals, costumes, chants, etc. that may not have been exactly correct, but...more stereotypical.Just to assure whoever read my message that I did not believe the harsh treatment by the white settlers toward the natives in this movie to be 'glamourized'. Although it was not as harsh during John Smith's visit in the 1400's, I'm sure that by now, we all know that these natives have been treated far, far worse than the movie depicts in the centuries that came after, unfortunately",,Anonymous,Animation
Where are all the waterfalls? I don't see any waterfalls around here...,"I've lived here practically my entire life and I'm STILL looking for the waterfalls. And the steep cliffs. And the bears and racoons. And the talking trees.Take it from a person who lives two minutes away from the original Jamestown Fort. Take it from an obsessive history buff who worked at Jamestown for a year. While I watched this movie, I picked up 73 historical inaccuracies- and that was only when I was 11. Seven years later, after going through extensive history courses...I'm sure I could pick up hundreds. Some of the disneyfied innacuracies are understandable.... John Smith was quite unnattractive in actual portraits (red hair and a beard), and I must say the Fabio-esque cartoon was much nicer to look at. Pocahontas would have had a shaved head, and had tattoos all over her body- but parents don't want ALL their daughters looking like Joan Jett. Pocahontas' real husband, John Rolfe, brought Tobacco to Virginia- Phillip Morris would have been pleased if Disney included that tidbit, but most folks would not. However, some of the innacuracies are inexcusable. For one thing (Attention ALL tourists)- THERE ARE NO MOUNTAINS, WATERFALLS, CLIFFS, HILLS, SUNFLOWERS, ETC. IN WILLIAMSBURG! BIG topographical mistake- I think the animators might have read the directions to Williamsburg incorrectly and wound up in Charlottesville instead. Pocahontas was 11 years old in 1607- having a platonic relationship w/John Smith, yet having the girl foster a temporary peace would have made for a cute, feel-good, and powerful movie. But of course, we need romance. I need not bore you with more details about the inaccuracies... Finally, I would like to apologize on behalf of Native Americans. According to the Spokeane poet Sherman Alexie, he claimed that if Native Americans aren't depicted as John-Wayne savages, they're tree-hugging environmentalists. Not that it's bad, but the film totally stereotypes them. I think they should have gone into deeper character analysis, especially with the two main characters. I'm not saying to NOT watch this film- in my opinion, it's alot better than those stupid films ""Shrek"" and ""Monsters Inc."" After all, it might impel the brighter younguns to learn more about the REAL Pocahontas and maybe explore *gasp* HISTORY a little bit. But of course, as a former Jamestown employee, that was MY job, wasn't it? =0)",,Anonymous,Animation
Revisionist PC hogwash,"Just thinking about POCAHONTAS makes me want to vomit. Just because it's an animated film does not give it license to play fast and loose with the truth.
