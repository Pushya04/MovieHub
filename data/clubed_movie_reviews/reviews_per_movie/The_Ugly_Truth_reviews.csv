Funny But Predictable And Not For Those Who Are Easily Offended,"Truthfully, I'm not a huge fan of Gerard Butler, and I'm really not that familiar with Katherine Heigl, so I can't say that I went into this movie with particularly high expectations. But I have to confess that I was surprised. This is actually a very enjoyable movie, and at times (I'm thinking of the scene in the restaurant) it's downright hilarious. Heigl plays Abby, the uptight producer of a local Sacramento morning TV show who's always on the lookout for love but never finds it. Meanwhile, Mike (played by Butler) is the obnoxious host of an obnoxious talk show about relationships who gets hired for the morning show (against Abby's wishes) in the hopes of boosting ratings.OK. You can pretty much see where this is going to end up so it can't be considered especially original, and it's true that once it takes its predictable turn (which is thankfully fairly late in the movie) it becomes rather formulaic as opposites attract and romance blossoms, etc., etc. But the story goes on for a while before that angle gets introduced, and there's a lot of fun along the way, especially as Abby and Mike first become friends and Abby tries to reinvent herself with Mike's help in order to snare a local doctor she's attracted to (who's played by Eric Winter.)Yes, by the end it's quite predictable and the last 20 minutes or so become a little dull to be honest. But before then this movie does have a lot of laughs. Butler and Heigl also played their parts well and worked well together. It is at times (fairly often actually) a bit crude, so it's not for those who are looking for a sweet, innocent romance. But for a few laughs, this is worth watching. (7/10)",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"You want the truth? You can handle The Ugly Truth, a fine romcom, but be forewarned that it deserves its ""r"" rating","Abby (Katherine Heigl) is an intelligent producer of a local morning show in Sacramento, California. She lives with her cat in a beautiful, lushly-gardened apartment complex but, the lovely lady longs to meet Mr. Right. One day, bad news arrives, twofold. One, since the show's ratings have slipped, the owners of the station have decided to go in a new direction. And, two, that direction would be south, Abby believes, for they have hired a brash, I-don't-mince-words talk show host, Mike (Gerard Butler) for a reprise of his late-night call-in program, The Ugly Truth. Mike will do small segments of advice, where he will counsel women on what a man ""really wants"". Since Abby has a past with this gentleman (she had recently called the late night show to tell Mike to take a hike) the young producer is mighty peeved that he has been hired for ""her"" program. Instant dislike reigns supreme. However, Mike does seem to know about affairs of the heart, even in his twisted fashion, and starts to give advice to Abby, on how to ""catch"" the very handsome young doctor, Colin (Eric Winter) who has just moved into her complex. two doors down. But, since this requires Abby and Mike to actually converse and confide in one another, could it be that Cupid's arrows could go astray? This is a very raucous and funny romcom but. it is definitely not in the Doris Day tradition. Therefore, if you are easily offended or prefer ""sweet"" tales of love, with just a touch of spice, this one may not be for you. That said, the cast is really delightful, for Heigl and Butler make a most attractive. sparring duo and Winter turns heads with his looks and smiles. The supporting cast, with Cheryl Hines and the rest, is quite nice, too. Also, the Sacramento setting is lovely while the costumes are terrific and the production values high. As for the direction, it is full of energy and mischief, as befits a script that is clever but rather risqué. All in all, if you love romcoms or any of the stars, you will probably embrace this one with gusto. For the truth is, it is very romantic at its core, and that's the best ingredient a comedic love tale can possess.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Light entertainment. Unfortunately they cut the parts that would have made it great.,"If you're looking for a breezy, predictable romcom that pokes fun at gender stereotypes, ""The Ugly Truth"" will fill the slot. It's basically a watered-down rehash of the classic ""When Harry Met Sally"" gender war romcom (right down to the orgasm at a restaurant scene) with nothing really new. Unfortunately the angle that would have given it a fresh spin ended up on the cutting room floor. I'll get to that in a sec. First let's summarize the story.Abby (Katherine Heigl) is an uptight, prudish tv producer who is forced to work with a loud-mouthed, misogynistic talk show host named Mike (Gerard Butler). Each presents an extreme stereotype of the sexes: Abby is a control freak who expects her man to be straight out of the Hallmark Channel while Mike treats women like he's ordering at the McDonald's drive thru. The plot revolves around a bet: Mike tells Abby that if she follows his neanderthal advice, she can snare her perfect dream man.So there's an interesting sort of role reversal, where the prudish female is taking lessons from the neanderthal bro in order to achieve her ideal Hallmark romance. That itself was a great start, but this clever spirit of the film got lost when they cut a few critical scenes (I guess because those scenes focused on character development and didn't have enough zingers).The scenes that were cut showed exactly how hopelessly neurotic Abby is and why she keeps scaring men off. And they focused on the important, yet mostly lost, subplot of how fake Abby must become in order to snare her man. 4 or 5 scenes were cut, and rather than understanding the degree of Abby's ""Pygmalion"" transformation, we the audience are rushed through the process. Also cut are some scenes that show Mike to be more sensitive/human, giving his character depth which is otherwise lacking. The result of these cuts is, instead of this film showing more of a complex gender-role-reversal switcheroo, it simply falls back on the black & white stereotypes of men being neanderthals and women being prudes. Nothing exceptionally clever, but still entertaining enough.So in the end, yes, I can understand why the watered down message could offend some. What we get is mostly the male perspective of Mike, reducing Abby's role to being his clueless sidekick. And the rest is predictable.The angle of them on a tv set with a producer/talent relationship is interesting, but it's nothing really new if you've done your romcom homework. On that account I would sooner recommend ""Groundhog Day"" which has the identical setup--Bill Murray playing the narcissistic tv talent with Andie McDowell playing his more sensible-minded producer--except that Groundhog Day rightfully focuses on the narcissist coming down to earth, not the other way around which we see here.A final note worth mentioning. I've heard it said that any movie that ends with a hot air balloon is insulting to the viewer's intelligence. There is indeed a hot air balloon in this one. So be prepared...",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"One of the few all-around great love movies, both for women and men!","So as I was forced to watch this movie with my sister and her friend, the original stereotypical thoughts towards all love movies seem to be bursting throughout my head- corny: guy meets girl, girl hates guy at first, girl meets another guy then realizes that the first guy was the love of his life, girl goes back to guy and the movie ends with a touching make-out scene. Well, of course this was the case. HOWEVER, I wouldn't exactly call this movie a chick-flick. It seem to be the ""battle of the sexes type,"" and it did not disappoint. I can easily say that I had some great laughs in this movie; surprisingly, and I am not even a comedy/chick flick guy. The whole moral of the movie is something both guys and women can you relate to, and some scenes are just hilarious for all types of audiences. The whole plot of the story was actually pretty solid for this style movie. In fact, the approach of this movie is so unique that I believe it belongs in its own category. Gerard Butler gives an excellent performance, both funny and charming. The humor had tremendous variety that kept audience laughing hysterically at some points. Overall, I really do recommend this movie for the male audience (Especially couples) and guarantee that they will not be disappointed after seeing this flick.",,Anonymous,Romance
"Better than I expected, it's honestly not that bad, it had better potential though","Romantic comedies, I've said it before and I'll say it again, we always have the hit and miss formula that comes with this genre. For the most part it's a miss, we RARELY have a funny or original romantic comedy. It's been over a year since we've had a good romantic comedy and this year seems to be pushing the horrible movies of this genre. For example, we had The Proposal that was released this year and it was just awful and so simple. The Ugly Truth seemed to be heading the same way when I first saw the trailer, but when I learned that it was Rated R, I decided to try to give it a chance. Honestly, this movie was a lot better than I had expected, it actually had some really great laughs and is a heck a lot better than The Proposal. But once again The Ugly Truth fell back into the ugly formula of clichés that are just annoying and there were quite a few things that I would have done differently with the story, I'll first explain the plot.Abby, a TV producer, is coming home from another disastrous date one night, she happens to see a segment of a local television show, ""The Ugly Truth,"" run by Mike Chadway, whose cynicism of relationships prompts Abby to call into the show to argue with him on-air. The next day, she discovers that the station is threatening to cancel her show because of its poor ratings, and the station owner has hired Mike to do a segment on her show to bring them back up. At first, the two have a rocky relationship; Abby thinks Mike is crass and disgusting while Mike finds Abby to be a control freak. However she meets the man of her dreams, a doctor named Colin living next to her, and Mike persuades her to follow his lead. She agrees to his helpful advice and if he can get her the man she wants, proving his theories on relationships, she will work happily with him, but if Mike fails, he agrees to quit; he successfully guides Abby to be exactly what Colin would want. But being a romantic comedy, Abby and Mike instead fall for each other as usual, you know how the story goes.Now things I would've done different, if you don't want spoilers then don't read on: there is a child that comes into Mike's apartment, he and Mike get along great, I'm thinking that's his son; instead it's his nephew. I think this would have added substance to his character and made him more likable and would have had a better story on why he was so bitter on women, maybe like the mother left him or something. Second: I honestly would have had Abby chosen the doctor over Mike. Katherine and Gerad are great on screen together, but their chemistry for this film I felt was more of a great friendship than falling in love with each other. Her choosing Mike over the doctor was so typical, I would have had the doctor find out about what was going on and then take her back realizing that he still liked her very much and then Mike ends up with some slutty girl as usual happy with his shallow life, but still enjoying it. Third: no tired formulas, no girl best friend supporting everything the lead female does, no big kiss in front of an audience, no dramatic of finding out what a kiss meant. Fourth: why do we have gorgeous people claiming they have a hard time finding love or supposedly not having sex for a year? I'm not saying it's impossible, but I'm finding it hard to believe that girls who look like Katherine Heigl are having the hardest time finding love.But there are some positives in the film, honestly I did have a good time watching this film over all, it was just the ending that killed the movie. But even the little rip off of When Harry Met Sally where Abby is wearing vibrating panties at a company dinner and someone saying what was in her food to have the same effect, it's an old joke but it never gets old. I loved that this was a Rated R rom-com because the reason MOST of these movies don't work are due to the fact that they're too family friendly and very much unrealistic. Not to say that The Ugly Truth is completely realistic, but more so than most films. We have some sick jokes but get a great laugh, Abby is going to a baseball game with Colin, her crush, and she accidentally spills her drink on his lap and starts rubbing his pants to clean them and the kiss cam lowers in on them with a bad angle looking like she's just having fun with his hot dog. Honestly I think most of the theater had a hard time catching their breath on that joke, no one could stop laughing. Katherine and Gerad do have great chemistry on screen, I just think it would have worked better as a friendship. So I would say this is better suited as a rental vs. a theater view. It's a lot better than I expected but had more potential as it falls back into the same old tired formula.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
A very nice romantic comedy,"The Ugly Truth is a entertaining romantic comedy about Abby Richter, a romantically challenged morning show producer whose search for Mr. Perfect has left her hopelessly single. She's in for a rude awakening when her bosses team her with Mike Chadway, a hardcore TV personality who promises to spill the ugly truth on what makes men and women tick. Although I think the movie is a little predictable and with some corny moments, it is also very enjoyable and funny. The cast is formed by Gerard Butler (300) and Katherine Heigl (27 Dresses) in the leading roles. Heigl is like in her previous movies very good, she is made for this type of movies and Butler is a real surprise, he did excellent in his very first romantic comedy. In conclusion, The Ugly Truth is a very enjoyable comedy for men and women.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Nothing ugly about this show. Thats the truth.,"Over the years, i have found few romantic comedies suited to my taste. Be it live action or in the form of anime, romantic comedies tend to be very mediocre IMO with only a handful that turn out really funny and enjoyable. Through some unforeseen circumstances i ended up not watching ""Gamer"" starring Gerald Butler and instead watched ""The Ugly Truth"", also starring Gerald Butler. To be honest, it was my curiosity at seeing ""Mr 'This is Sparta'"" handle a comedy lead role that convinced me to give this movie a shot.THe premise is as such. Abby Richter (Katherine Heigl) is a perfectionist, ""control freak""-ish morning show TV producer whose show is on the verge of being canceled due to low ratings. One night, she comes home from a disastrous date and happens to watch a segment of a TV show, ""The Ugly Truth"", hosted by ""shock jock"" by Mike Chadway (Gerard Butler). Abby calls into his show and argues with Mike on-air, in response to cynical attitude about relationships prompts, which leads to her quite literally ""hating his guts"". The next day, she discovers that the station she works for has hired Mike to do a segment on her show in order to boost ratings. This kicks starts a very storm tossed relationship between the two which lends itself to numerous comedic turns. Sooner than expected, Abby just so happens to fall for her doctor neighbor and she grudgingly goes to Mike for advice at ""netting"" the man of her dreams(actually the only man who fulfilled her listed criteria). The unlikely pair cut a deal in that if she is She agrees to his advice and is successful, it would prove Mike's theories on relationships and she will work happily with him. However if Mike fails, he agrees to quit.Anyone with experience in this genre of movies can more or less fill in the rest of the story. Unlikely pair work together, more jokes, fall for each other, more jokes, Love triangle develops, tragedy strikes, touching finale. Finish.In this case, I would admit that the usual formula actually works to a certain extent. It allows the audience the satisfaction of actually knowing what they are watching, and getting exactly what they are expecting. This is not avant Garde cinema, but it is entertainment. Also the formulaic story allows one to focus more on the scripting and acting, which IMO is where this movie truly shines.Witty banter and a cornucopia of innuendo-ed jokes fill up most of the film. Sexual references abound but are written in such a tactful way that they do not come off as crass or crude. Most sexual innuendo jokes tend to be rude and sometimes offensive; thankfully thats not the case here.There is wit to the humor in this movie that utilities word puns and double meanings in their jokes to good effect. Thankfully, the humor is not over-played and the more serious moments of the movie are spliced very well into the overall narrative. The characters and situations are written in such a way that anyone could easily identify with them, which lends to a greater emotional involvement in the film.Stellar acting by the cast also helps. Special mention goes to Gerald Butler who proves to be an exceedingly versatile actor. He nails the carefree, in-your-face, yet internally bitter character of Mike Chadway to the point that it is easy to forget the actor playing the role and just become so involved with character himself. Katherine Heigl does a satisfying job as Abby, lending both her acting chops and eye candy to the complex lead role.My only beef with this movie is that it could have expounded on the relationship themes a little more instead of falling back on ""the usual thing"". Having a clearer conflict of ideals between Mike and Abby and maybe going deeper into the strengths and flaws of the ideas presented would have turned this film into a more thought provoking experience. ""what men really want"" , ""what women really look for"", ""loving the 'me you want to see' or loving 'the real me'"", all those little tidbits would have made benefited from a more central role in the film which would have given this movie a ""fresher"" feel instead of the stale standard story.I was personally very entertained by ""The Ugly Truth"" especially in the laughs department, not just because the jokes were extremely funny, but that they were also well written, witty and made sense without being offensive. I loved superb acting by the leads, excellent cast chemistry and an overall sense of escapism.At the end of the day, All i can say is that unless you are already a fan of romantic comedies or unless you have an open mind when it comes to various movie genre(<---like me), its best to stick with what you like. ""The Ugly Truth"" won't convert staunch action movie junkies or epic fantasy aficionados anytime soon, that's for sure, but just sit back relax and enjoy a good laugh that is easy on the brain. A hearty chuckle and a few quick tugs at the heartstrings now and then is good for body, mind and soul.Note to the ""not so proficient in English"" crowd: Keep your ears open for all the double meanings behind the jokes, its funnier that way.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Extremely crude but I love it!,"Gerard Butler is one of my favorite actors and in The Ugly Truth he's very inappropriate. Robert Luketic directed a fun rom-com that is very bold, charming, and energetic; lovable yet easy to hate. Katherine Heigl is gorgeous and delightful she's easy to enjoy; I need to see more of her!

Painful to watch,"This may be one of the most abysmal movies I have ever seen. It surprises and disgusts me that it has a rating as high as it does. First of all, it basically sets the feminist movement back to the 1920s. It is offensive to both genders and portrays women as up-tight whiny control freaks and men as heartless and and arrogant jerks who only want sex. I hated the main characters and I honestly didn't care what happened to them. The jokes weren't at the least bit funny. I did not laugh once in this movie, mostly just cringed at the horrible dialog. If you like annoying, unintelligent, and disgusting humor, by all means go out and rent The Ugly Truth. If you you like Romantic Comedys that are actually funny and not grossly insulting, I highly advise you to watch something else.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
A comedy for both sexes,"I saw this movie at a preview event last Friday night and it was hilarious. The sold out cinema was laughing hysterically throughout the movie. The movie is fast paced and does not drag. The comedy is ""r"" rated with a little raunchy adult humor that can be shocking at times but that is in line with the movies theme of male/female relationships.Katherine Heigl and Gerard Butler were both great in the film. Not a role that you would expect to see the King of Sparta, but Butler has great comedic timing complimenting his tough guy persona. And Katherine Heigl is once again perfect doing comedy.If you are expecting to see a typical romantic comedy you will be surprised, because this R rated film is geared toward the men in the audience as well as the ladies.

What Men and Women Want to See on Television,"In Sacramento, the producer of a morning show Abby Richter (Katherine Heigl) is a controller that has a checklist with items about the ideal man for her; however she can not find any man that fulfills her prerequisites.

Abby dates Colin but when Mike is invited to participate in the Craig Ferguson's Late Late Show in San Francisco, they get closer and fall in love for each other. But out of the blue, Colin arrives in Abby's room and she has to take a decision.""The Ugly Truth"" is a delightful romantic comedy supported by the beauty and charm of Katherine Heigl and her chemistry with Gerard Butler. The story is a sort of adaptation of Cyrano de Bergerac to the environment of a television in the present days and there is an acid criticism about what American people want to see on television. In the end, the ugly truth is that love does exist. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""A Verdade Nua e Crua"" (""The Ugly Truth"")",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Ugly Truth AKA Sexism: The Movie,"I like Romantic comedies, they humorous and never try to preach to much. Last good one I saw was Knocked Up and it was sweet. But according to the female lead in it was Sexist. Yes... okay what's your move Miss Heigl*Katherine Heigl stars in The Ugly Truth*There is no way nice way of putting this. There no kind way to lay this out. But this movie is freaking sexist. It paints men as sex crazed dogs, without an ounce of romance within them and everything they do is solely for sex. Move over Knocked Up, a film that made me laugh that was beautiful that really told a wonderful story.Here we have a film that speaks down to woman, objectifies them and actually says this is right. That all men want is sex therefore woman should accept this and dress like whores, act like whores and overall listen to misogyny.This film hurt me, it made me sick, I'm so glad only saw review because nothing about this movie appealed to me. The characters, the script, the music. It was all to paint men as sex crazed Neanderthals.I'm 19, I want love, I want a relationship, I don't want sex for sex sake. And I'm demographic this movie aimed at.Honestly it claims men only pretend to listen, that men only care what will get them laid. It doesn't have any nuances doesn't have any redeeming features and it's so contrived.How can you call Knocked Up sexist and then go to star in this? It's beyond me.There only one ugly truth here hypocrisy, making a film that attacks men rather than woman is just as bad as sexism against woman.Trust me girls, this movie isn't realistic to any degree of real people.So it just depresses me, how much people love this movie: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1142988/Gender wars is a pathetic use of anyone time, once you see people as anyone other than the shallow superficial crap you think of us as, then truly there will be less of this contrived and jaded nonsense.God this movie annoyed the hell out of me.Don't watch.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
"The truth isn't pretty, but Heigel and Butler keep it far from being ugly","The battle of the sexes begins as Butler teaches Heigel The Ugly Truth. Abby is a successful TV show producer with a perfect job and body. The only problem is she can never seem to find Mr. Right. In comes Mike, a perverted and demeaning correspondent for a TV segment called ""The Ugly Truth."" Mike willingly helps Abby land Mr. Right, but what she doesn't know is that the guy who she really likes might be the one standing in front of her all along. Though predictability and believability are the films biggest flaws, the chemistry and wit between Katherine Heigel and her co-star Gerard Butler keep it from being another run of the mill Romantic Comedy. There were many hysterical moments I found myself laughing at from slightly crude but inventive gags to scene stealing comedy by Butler himself. His perceptions on what men and women want manage to keep you on a laugh riot but are also shockingly true and honest. Heigel on the other hand plays the same role in most of her movies, but can still manage to keep a likable balance of comedy and drama between her as well. The supporting cast also sharing the spotlight (including John Michael Higgins) too managed to make me smile no matter what the situation was. For fans of Hegel's recent movies (eg: 27 Dresses) keep in mind that this is much cruder, vulgar and might not even be on the same league. Some will find the sexist stereotyping distracting and appalling but at the end it's message is that it's being who you are that matters, and that the one who likes you for who you really are (not by your looks) is the one that's right for you. All in all despite it's clichéd and predictable plot Heigel and Butler turn it into a refreshing, entertaining and welcoming rom/com.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
A chick flick your boyfriend will actually like!,"So a girl is looking for love, a guy is looking for raunchy sex. Not only is this the basis of the movie, but maybe also the real ugly truth. It's a very simple concept but how do you make a movie out of this? Some people would say that the movie industry is losing it's originality when writing but if you ask me this worked very well. Not only did a laugh constantly, there were parts where I doubled over laughing. In fact I would see this 20 more times in theaters before I even rented Bruno to see it again, and yes I think this could be a movie where you watch it more then once.Gerard Butler hasn't really proved to me what he can do with his acting skill till now, and I pray that he does more comedic roles. He was the highlight of this entire movie and for that reason, he will be offered more in comedy. Just try not to think of King Leonidas from 300 when you're watching it. Katherine Heigl was also good, maybe better then she was in Knocked Up, but still kind of same old Katherine.Now before the movie started I told myself that I would seriously mark this movie down a few points if the ending was as totally predictable as I thought it was going to be, but after how surprised I was, I decided to go a little easier.Conclusion: Girls, see it with a guy.

A Decent but Honest Look at Relational Ugliness,"26 July 2009. This romantic comedy had two gut wrenching bully laugh scenes along with a more in your face sexist look at the differences between men and women which in some ways could be closer to the truth than more ""enlightened"" people may want to admit. There are layered characters, not two-dimensional ones in this movie and by the ending credits we are provided with the authentic, honesty moral of relationships in this predictable but entertaining movies. It is understandable why most critics didn't have much positive to say, but this politically-incorrect sexist comments have at their core some resonance in how men and women actually feel and think. Interestingly the weakest scene seemed to be the more anticipated, highly expected interview on a late night show which didn't really seem to come off consistently with the tone of the rest of the movie. This is a movie that actually says what many of us want to say, but are afraid to admit, but also enlightens the mass audience with some actual relational truths by the end of the movie. Katherine Heigl and Gerard Butler do have their own chemistry and there is a hidden playfulness that comes out that for some critics might seem childly crude, but in many respects is so real. 8/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Disliked it intensely,"Now I do like this genre of film, but only when the comedy is funny and the romance touches or moves me. The Ugly Truth I am afraid to say, did neither.The film does look quite nice with striking cinematography and locations, but sadly that is the only praise I can give. I was disappointed in the soundtrack, I did find it very generic and forgettable, and in the direction which was so smug and unfocused.When it comes to the acting, it wasn't very good really. Katherine Heigl and Gerard Butler do try to bring some life into their roles, but the two have no chemistry together and it doesn't help that their characters(and all the characters of the film for that matter) are so shallow and clichéd that I couldn't care for them at all.The worst assets were the script and the story. The script is incredibly unfunny and mean-spirited, and the story is predictable and hackneyed with an ending you can smell a mile off. Also the pacing is so sluggish, and with everything else so poor the whole film was a dull chore to sit through, and on top of all that with how some of the characters behave and treat each other here some of it felt sexist.Overall, I disliked it, because I found it dull with a poor story and script with characters I felt nothing for. 1/10 Bethany Cox",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Crass chemistry,"Romantic comedies sometimes need so little to be somewhat successful. Here the key to success comes from the abundant chemistry between Katherine Heigl and Sam Butler, with an especially hardy performance by the latter. Uptight and rigid Abby (Katherine Heigl) works as a producer for a flailing TV morning show in Sacramento. On the verge of being cancelled it is time to experiment with extreme: the uncouth hard-hitting Mike (Gerard Butler), former host of cable programme ""The Ugly Truth"", the ultimate in-your-face reveal on relationships (churning out advice about men preferring their women to roll around half-naked in jello). Despite obvious distaste for Mike's cynical methods and views, Abby is forced to accept his brash on-screen attitude. Nevertheless, she soon finds herself taking love advice from the burly news host in a ploy to entice the 'perfect man'.Despite its somewhat misogynistic pretence, fortunately introduced purely for laughs sakes, not to preach about the banality of love, ""The Ugly Truth"" works surprisingly well. Mostly due to the well-strung pairing with great comedic timing and a underlying tension bringing about colours to the story. Heigl naturally fails straight into her comfort zone of being a stringent obsessing female, but her charm is relentless. Together they form a duo that makes any shortcomings of the mannered and formulaic script fade into the background. Fortunately also several jokes are extremely well handled, even if not particularly ingenious results of brainstorming sessions. Clichés may be especially annoying, but somehow with Heigl and Butler taking centre-stage, it becomes something of an enjoyable guilty pleasure. Not an entirely memorable one, but still above average TV fodder for comedic release.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Predictable and Not funny, But I like it","I have watched this several times and it is a ROM COM that follows a predictable formula. Furthermore, it never made me laugh at all. Part of the reason it never made me laugh is that is it so incredibly predictable. That said, the story took some deeper views of the relationships between men and women than most ROM COMs. The main relationship is between TV Producer Abby, and TV up and coming talk show or segment host Mike. In Abby we see a controlling women that scares men away, and furthermore, she has a hopeful view of finding a perfect guy someday. In Mike, we have someone running from any entanglements and seeking conquests. He has a negative view of women but still wants sex with them. He presents and ugly view of relationships, but has a sense of how to fix them to get to win win. As a side project, he helps Abby become the woman that men desire. But at the same time, she becomes someone she is not comfortable being. We also find out along the way, that Mike's negative view of women was forged by numerous negative experiences he has had in relationships with women.The final step to bring the movie to its very predictable end, is that Abby must lose her dreams and Mike lose his pre-conceived notions and take a risk based on the feelings they have developed for each other.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Yep I can handle ""The Ugly Truth""","Now I liked this romantic comedy, it was cliché at times and if you seen the trailer for this movie the chances of you knowing how just about everything is going to go down is pretty high, but still it is ambiguous and entertaining romantic comedy. Okay so Abby(Katherine Heigl) is producer of a local morning show in Sacramento, California. But she is a control freak and shallow which tends to turn most males off. Now I will say I don't particularly like Katherine Heigl as an actress but she actually fit in quite well with her role in this one. Anyways the ratings for the show starts to decrease, which isn't a surprise and the owner of the station decide to go in a different direction by hiring a brash talk show host Mike(Gerard Butler) who is a expert on male and female interaction and also the epitome of a alpha male. And Gerard Butler was just perfect in his role, even if his character is a know it all sleaze bag, but the thing is he is still likable and in this one even when he claims that he doesn't know romance or love, but that he is a master at lust and manipulation. Actually Gerard Butler is likable in just about every film he is in. So Mike takes up the offer to reprise his late-night call-in program ""The Ugly Truth"" for the station. And the battle of the sexes begins between Mike and Abby, and they have some good chemistry together with some good dialogue mixed in while Abby tries to have a affair with her neighbor who she thinks is her ideal guy. But since most guys have difficult time having a affair with Abby which isn't that shocking, Mike makes a bet with Abby and gives her advice on how to please her so called ideal guy. And while doing this Mike and Abby start to bond with each other. Now like I said, it's a predictable romantic comedy but I enjoyed it, it is wicked fun even if the ending seemed to be really rushed. It's a romantic comedy that both sexes will enjoy and have a good time with, it was just simply satisfying.7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Very Funny and Raunchy Romantic Comedy,"My husband and I saw this at a sold-out sneak preview on July 17. I haven't laughed so hard in a long time at a film and the audience seemed to find the film as funny and bawdy as I did. My husband was happy to watch a romantic comedy from the male perspective as well as the female for a change. The leads are attractive but not the usual ""perfect"" specimens we usually get in these films, and the situations, while often over-the-top, are quite humorously portrayed. The typical fairy tale elements seem to go by the wayside here and we're left with a harsher but very funny battle-of-the-sexes comedy for the times in which we now live.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

All men want is a physical relationship and they are dimwitted arrogant over grown children, and that's what men are.The Ugly truth is the war raging on against you all and the way they want you to think.It lacks any true wit, it is a deluded crude spoof on reality. It's more of the sort of junk that the military industrial complex wants out there. Take away your beliefs, morals and intelligence. Dumb you down and take away your ethics.It's a trash film and the fact that my family sits through it without even knowing why they are watching it disturbs me.

Thoroughly predictable but I loved it!,"Abby Richter (Katherine Heigl) is a seriously uptight TV producer. Her show is bombing in the ratings and she scares away any guy she dates. Then she is forced to add sexist, out-spoken Mike Chadway (Gerard Butler) who gives advice on ""The Ugly Truth""--a short segment where he tells the truth about relationships. Abby hates him but the ratings soar. To make peace Mike tells Abby he'll help her get handsome Colin (Eric Winter). If she does she backs off. She agrees and gets Colin and then the predictable complications ensure.OK--I KNEW who this was going to end 15 minutes in but I STILL loved it! It starts off great with Katy Perry's ""Hot N Cold"" roaring out during the opening credits and just keeps getting better! Heigl is gorgeous and an excellent actress. She nailed all the comedy completely. Butler--all hot and handsome--matches her perfectly and the interplay between them really works. I heard they got along great on the set and it shows. Eric Winter is charming and handsome but the guy is (purposely) not given much to work with. The script is sharp, moves quickly and has plenty of funny moments. What I like most is the script has VERY frank adult sexual talk--it doesn't dumb it down to a PG-13. It's rare to get an R rated romcom aimed at adults these days! My only complaint is Heigl's character is treated a bit TOO cruelly at times (especially in a pantie sequence). That's why I'm only giving it an 8 but it's still well worth seeing.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""The Mad Manipulation of Romance""","Good watch, could watch again, and can recommend.It feels like this is after all the uproar with Katherine Heigl (""27 Dresses"") and she was trying to come back with a smile on her face, but she took the role because it gave her the opportunity to act the awful person she was accused of being.Gerard Butler (""Bounty Hunter"") acts up a storm to keep up with her, with both equally playing off each of wonderfully.I can't tell the better actor here because Gerard is clearly acting, but he might be acting a character that is acting eccentrically, but I'm still aware regardless of how good it is, versus Katherine who is so natural and seamless that you don't realize she's acting until she over acts per the character following another character's prompts badly.It doesn't make for the best movie, but it sure is interesting. And I'm sure if you can look past all that, then you can appreciate this veil metaphor of the sexes and a very well written story.Nothing about this is fantastic, but it's a solidly good romantic comedy.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Hmm Good,"I've been on a rampage for the last few minutes, giving all these stupid rom coms 2s and 3s. But Ugly Truth is something different. It's tough, manly. Though it has the sweets to back it up. This is a good rom com for men and women.The story is about a news station that casts a manly man for a new section about being a man. The person in charge, Heigl, is doubtful about its performance and tries to be strict about the content. The man fights back, and eventually tries to assist with her love life, proving that he could make any man/woman fall in love with someone else.Butler plays a cool role. It's fun to watch the manliness. Heigl is attractive but quirky at the same time. I used to think she was so hot, but now she's whatever. She's kind of weird. I don't know. You could watch the movie for the same reasons.Worth a watch6 stars",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Perfect for a relaxed and funny Sunday movie evening,"The already typicall romantic comedy where the to protagonists who start by loathing each other end up falling in love for each other.
As usual Catherine Heigl is beautiful and funny and I have to admit she was the reason for watching the movie. Gerald Butler is kinda in an unusual role but he gets it quite well making one think that maybe he should play in comedy instead of action movies.
In the end is a funny and relaxing movie that will make you laugh, perfect for a Sunday home cinema evening.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great Movie,"I have not laughed so much over a movie as I did watching ""The Ugly Truth"" This was film was hysterical and Gerard Butler and Katherine Heigl were great in the roles. It is a must see movie for both men and women. I thought that the script was well written and true to life and if this movie gets a poor rating, then the reviewers need to lighten up. I would go see this movie again. The scene in the restaurant just about sent me into a fit. I could not stop laughing. The baseball scene was just as funny. Guys would relate to a lot of the scenes in this movie. I cannot understand how the critics rate a movie poorly when the audience was roaring with laughter from beginning to end. How can you not find this movie fun and entertaining? But it is definitely not for children under 18, so moms do not bring the kids.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
terrible,"the 6.4 rating is beyond me. I hated this movie. Hated it. hated it. hated it.First off, Gerard Butler's American accent is pretty horrible. Katherine Heigl's character is a walking cliché. (A workaholic woman who's unlucky in love, even though she looks like Kathryn Heigl)The movie ends with one of the most stupid endings that I've ever seen. WARNING SPOILERSWhy would she fall in love with Mike? I still don't get it. They had some decent chemistry as friends, but were not believable as a couple.END SPOILERSEven worse is the fact that the movie is a big sexist lie. It's offensive to both women and men. In interviews, the cast and director defend it saying that ""it's the truth."" Bull****. It's not the truth. Women don't need to degrade themselves to land a man. Not all men want their women as sex objects.The film is mean spirited, not funny, not charming, boring, dull, and clichéd.And the film really failed to take advantage of it's R rating.

The Ugly Truth is FAR FROM UGLY!,"I got to see this tonight as a sneak preview with a bunch of friends & we absolutely LOVED this movie! It's about time we get a great Rom Com without the characters having to tiptoe around talk about sex. I didn't mind the R rating one bit since it was one of the funniest movies I have seen all year. Gerry Butler & Katherine Heigl were a scream together! She is way funnier than I ever thought she would be. I thought she did an excellent job portraying the mildly anal retentive Abby who had an unrealistic idea of what her perfect man should be. It was great seeing Gerry be comedic finally after all the dramatic & action roles he has done. He needs to do more of these type movies, he really has a great sense of timing & his expressions really say it all. I will be seeing this again a few more times at the theater.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A suggestion-less suggestive movie,"The movie's main theme is really directly depicted in the suggestive nature of the scenes. The comedy is full blown geared up for mature audiences. I like to compare this movie to Hitch (2005). I think that this is quite the opposite of Hitch, especially on the methods and the conflicts the two movies presented. But The Ugly Truth hits it harder and rougher to those who have the symptoms of serious passionate relationship issue syndrome. This movie's appeal comes from all those suggestive scenes, which also sets it way apart from Hitch. The acting is just another okay overall. Gerard Butler provided the right amount of balancing to Katherine Heigl's lead performance, which is for me not very special. I like how the movie builds just enough of the complimentary characters such as Joy and Colin.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
A romcom guys can enjoy,"This review is from the perspective of a guy who generally avoids romantic comedies like the plague. Their sense of humor usually makes me cringe. And early on, I was worried The Ugly Truth would be the same. But as soon as Gerard Butler popped on the screen, I started laughing frequently.The premise of revealing the truth of how guys think is a comedic goldmine. So much of what he said is accurate. And I love the bluntness and uncensored nature of how he says it. This movie is not worried about being politically correct or offending people. In 2025, that's refreshing.Heigl and Butler both play their roles perfectly. Their chemistry works, as does the romance aspect.

"A true awesome chick-flick since ""What Women Want""","I'm a kind of guy that is not into the mushy, romance, chick-flick stuff like ""You've Got Mail"", ""The Lake House"", ""The Notebook"", etc. The only chick-flick that I can sit through was ""What Women Want"" With Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt. I thought that move was pretty good! Then ""The Ugly Truth"" came along and while I was watching the trailer of this film I thought to myself, ""Is this the next funniest chick-flick of 2009?""The film is about a TV news producer, name Abby (Katherine Heigel), that is juggling with her career and her personal sex life but both in jeopardy because of her uptight, strict personality. The only person that can help her, but despises him, is a raunchy TV personality host name Mike Chadway (King Leonidas...Whoops! I mean Gerad Butler). Mike teaches Abby what guys want in a girl inside and out in order to win her ""Mr. Right"" and that the same time, he keeps the ratings up in her TV program. Then, the raunchy comedy continues...Back to asking myself the previous question, ""Is this the next funniest chick-flick of 2009?"" Well my answer is YES! This movie will make you laugh and laugh and laugh! Mostly, all the crude sex jokes that you heard in your life is all crammed into this film and you'll just keep begging for more.

And Heigel's character is so real with all those issues about the relationships and frankly vulnerability.

Starts off crass and never lifts itself out of the lowest levels,"Katherine Heigl is capable of good acting, but it'a wasted on a film that seems to be targeted at 12 year-olds whose humour stays around the masturbation and such themes level. It really, really is not in the same league as ""When Harry met Sally"" as another commenter suggests; that film had some class - this has none.What's particularly sad about this film is that the basic theme of ""what men really want is tits and arse, anything else is a denial of the truth"" theory is portrayed as being THE ABSOLUTE TRUTH. Well, it is for a certain proportion of the population - but the whole world is not trailer-trash - thankfully!

Yes, this is very much an adult film. You don't want your seven year old watching it. There are a lot of ""naughty"" words and frequent sexual situations.

A Romantic Comedy I Was Forced To Watch,"Chauvinistic morning show commentator Mike Chadway (Gerard Butler) makes his perpetually single producer (Katherine Heigl) the subject of a series of romantic tests in order to prove the theories on relationships he espouses on his segment called ""The Ugly Truth."" But will his experiments help her find love, or is she just a hopeless case?The film also has some good supporting cast members with Cheryl Hines, Bree Turner, and the actress who plays Shirley from ""Community"".There is some pesky cinematography, with a cliché use of cameras circling people in conversation. And a really bad hot air balloon scene. Most of the time it is standard with nothing of note -- not surprising, as no romantic comedy has ever been made by a notable director or cinematographer.Gerard Butler's character is harsh, crude and somewhat immature, but as the host of his own show, he is actually fairly accurate. In some ways, he is the more rational version of Tom Cruise from ""Magnolia"". And what a deal, too, since Butler is the discount version of Russell Crowe. Although I was somewhat shocked at times, I liked the male lead.Another reviewer talks about Heigl: ""Despite her big talk about portrayals of women in film, she returns again and again to gender stereotypes that are so formulaic they make me cringe."" This review is becoming standard, with Heigl speaking out about one-dimensional women (whom she calls ""shrews"") while still starring in romantic comedies, which are the epitome of films pushing flat female characters.Roger Ebert says ""the comedy bogs down in relentless predictability and the puzzling overuse of naughty words."" He also finds it amazing that ""this raunchy screenplay was written by three women."" Not sure about the second point, but the predictability is true enough (are you surprised?) and the naughty words did make me question who the audience was. Is this a way to lure men in to see a woman's film? Who knows?Mysteriously, I actually sort of liked this movie, even if I thought it was horrible and would never recommend it.

Gerard Butler gave a surprisingly brilliant comedy performance and a great American accent that if you didn't know, you wouldn't realise at all that he is Scottish in real life and quite the Scottish accent too. Since ""300"" (which I think is one of his greatest acting achievements), Gerard has really shined in the film industry revealing his acting talent in big films like ""RocknRolla"" and ""How to train your Dragon"", performing a variety of characters and now this film.The main actress of the film Katherine Heigl (one of those big actresses who I don't know, but my parents do for some reason) gave an equally talented performance, making it great casting for a comedy duet display.

I'll take that one on trust.And why can't we see Mike's congratulatory cake? I bet that box was empty. Boo.But back to the review...Abby (Heigl) is nothing if not prepared. She's capable. She's unflappable, at least until Butler's character, Mike, shows up. I don't know about you but, background check and casual heightism aside, I rather like the idea of a date who comes to dinner with a prepared list of conversational topics. Who likes awkward silences?Abby's TV morning show is dropping in the ratings, so her boss decides to freshen it up by hiring a spicy TV personality, Mike Chadway, to present the Ugly Truth. He's going to be controversial on love and relationships, the battle of the sexes, telling it how it is, in his mind anyway, not how folks pretend it ought to be. Abby is horrified, but the results are in and the numbers don't lie. Abby's lovelife being a trainwreck, in a short time Mike is doling out advice to her too.Mike's TV routine, first seen on some kind of cable channel (is that right, cable?) is crude to say the least. Very lowbrow. He remorselessly objectifies women, gleefully in fact. And how does he do that so convincingly? I'll tell you. It's because this movie, The Ugly Truth, was screenplayed by three women. Yes. True. Look it up. Roger Ebert was astonished that something so vulgar could come from writers on the distaff side, but I'm not. No-one is better at objectifying women than women themselves. And yup, you guessed it - that's the ugly truth.But what about this movie as another entry in the rom-com genre?Mike's right. ""The truth is never pretty."" Does this movie stick to its truth till the end? It ought to be a bitter end, given the obnoxious date-doctor's philosophy, but, well, things tend to end happy kissy in Romcom Land. And this is a standard issue Hollywood genre picture, with just the kind of locations, lighting, lensing, soft music, bouncy spirit, to make it only barely distinguishable from a host of others. What sets it apart? Heigl and Butler both have good energy, likeability, and Mike's crass, schoolboyish sense of humour, the kind the ladies both disapprove of and giggle/swoon over. Contradiction? In a man's world yes. In a woman's mind, call it multitasking.In under half an hour Mike has had chicks wrestling in pudding on morning television. Abby then has a dream where she's demoted to being a nude weathergirl, dropping tacky innuendoes. Neither set piece is remotely convincing. Nor for that matter is the cat up the tree scene, also inside the first half hour. Once Mike/Butler starts dishing on his fellow men, then, well, you really know this stuff was written by women. It's testament to Butler's charm and Heigl's that they make this crass piffle funny and entertaining. And I disagree with Ebert about the restaurant underwear scene. I think Heigl's impromptu O-performance is more impressive than Meg Ryan's (from I'll Have What She's Having) for being fake real as opposed to fake fake. Curious to admit, but The Ugly Truth rises in status within the genre on account of its unusual, explicit vulgarity. It's not insipid, which makes a nice change. It's borderline gross, but not gross-out. It's rude-funny without being disgustingly filthy. It may be completely unbelievable that someone so icky would get a morning tv timeslot alongside news anchors, and likewise end up advising a beautiful woman on how to date moment-by-moment, but the payoffs outweigh the absurd setups.Recommended, I'm ashamed to say.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

If she's atoning for her early role in 1994's American remake of 'My Father, The Hero', in which her 14-year-old character wears a white, one-piece thong bikini while claiming her dad Gérard Depardieu is actually her lover in order to appear more womanly to boys, then perhaps it is. But right now Heigl's range is proving slightly more limited than John Wayne's, who at least played both a Mongolian *and* an ancient Roman with a Madison County accent.Heigl plays Abby Richter, a Sacramento breakfast TV show producer, and the kind of frightening valkyrie who background-checks her dates. This glamorous professional remains inexplicably single - until the execs pair her up with shouty shock jock Mike Chadway (a dodgy-accented Gerard Butler) to boost the ratings with his lame 'Men are from Bars, Women Need a Penis' shtick. Chadway's 'Ugly Truth' segment claims to spill the beans about the sexes while advising pent-up women to flick the same. ""Men are simple, they cannot be trained! You wanna win a man over, you don't need ten steps, you just need blowjobs!"" While women who want 'relationships' are advised to talk dirty, dress like Streetwalker Barbie and ""get a StairMaster"". Given that Mike has already called Abby a ""dog"" and a ""lesbian"", what happens next is frankly extraordinary: the shriekingly strange control freak falls for her neighbour, the young orthopaedic doctor Colin (Eric Winter), and challenges Mike to be her very own Cyrano-in-an-earpiece. And, well, we all know how 'Roxanne' turned out. (Or not: Mike doesn't actually get off with Colin.)If one were to take a buzzsaw to The Ugly Truth, its arterial spray would drip down the wall to form the coagulated word 'Generic'. Among 37,000 similar rom-coms, it is markedly close to 2001's 'Someone Like You', in which Ashley Judd uses roommate Hugh Jackman's womanising outlook as raw material for her sexist advice column. And then falls in love with him. This lack of any originality whatsoever wouldn't be so insulting if there existed any actual chemistry between the leads; if the supporting cast weren't as slight as snowflakes (wimpy Colin is barely even human); or if, with its trash-mouth, oral-sex gags and casting, it didn't so desperately and transparently want to be a Judd Apatow movie. Just one without the insight. Or soul. Or wit. Or anything. Why is Mike in love with Abby? ""Beats the s*** out of me, but I am."" And that, boys and girls, is how you tidily dispose of character development when your script ain't worth a fart.Its leading lady exec-produced this (rarely a promising sign), and so did her mum, but this film seemingly exists only to utterly humiliate Heigl via three farcical set-pieces; the lowlight of which sees her remote-controlled vibrating sex knickers (a gift from Mike, with the honest-to-goodness words ""this isn't for you, it's for your bean"") being 'accidentally' activated while she's out having dinner with clients. Meg Ryan's got nothing to worry about but Nora Ephron should sue. ""Thanks for coming tonight"" says Mike. ""For dinner. That kind of coming."" Sure, we get it. Who wrote these gags, David Brent? Well actually, a trio of women wrote this film (two of them also being the brains behind 'Legally Blonde', 'She's The Man' and 'The House Bunny'), demonstrably proving that chauvinism isn't the sole preserve of one sex.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Luketic does not propose to find answers to the differences between men and women, but reseat them and take advantage of the conflicts that always existed","The hardest difficulty about doing romantic comedies is to attract the male audience, which usually only watch this movie in theaters to accompany their respective girlfriends and wives. The Ugly Truth has a differential as through its male protagonist, you can have fun with their sexist opinions and are often applicable in the life of any couple. For completeness, we still have one of the protagonists of the most beautiful current cinema, Katherine Heigl, always competent to make you laugh and delight men. With these two differences, the film has everything to consolidate as one of the highlights of the genre in a long time.Abby Richter (Katherine Heigl) is a competent and conservative producer of a television show. With the ratings dropping, your boss has the idea of hiring competition Chadway Mike (Gerard Butler) program ""The Ugly Truth"". Thus, a sudden, the Company and eternal romantic Abby is forced to accept as a collaborator guy macho, rude and ""expert"" to reveal what - really - attracts men in women. With love relationships in low, it uses the ""consultant services"" to conquer the neighbor Colin (Eric Winter) and the result ended up being better than expected.Directed by Robert Luketic (Legally Blonde (2001), Monster in Law (2005), Killers (2010) and 21 (2008)) and scripted by Nicole Eastman, Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith, the film manages to bring something new to the typical plots. Abby is shown as the paranoid, dreamer, creator and for being too picky, just never finding your perfect match. Mike now represents the masculine side, with practicality, honesty, divestment and security of knowing exactly what men like. It is precisely this struggle between the sexes, the idealization and romanticism on one side and candor and a ""more tangible reality"" of another, underlying and driving the entire plot development.Abby is a producer of a TV show very competent, but also very conservative in professional and personal life. Since I program is suffering from a significant drop in audience, being overtaken by emitting far lower expression, the head of Abby decides to hire the competitor Mike Chadway program ""The Ugly Truth"", known for his way of talking about so macho and rough on relationships, outspoken, and going straight to the point, burning self-help books live and screwed romantic dreams of women. Mike arrives and changes the way the program is conducted, and the relations of Abby not revenge, she decides to consult with Mike to hook the heart of her neighbor Colin.When Abby seeks the help of Mike, the film cannot escape the typical old clichés. At first she does not support it to be extremely opposite her way to think and act about relationships, but when she uses it in an attempt to win her new neighbor Colin, we have the traditional visual changes given by a bath in clothes store tamer of Abby, plus tips on how to behave in various situations right up to an electronic listening that would guide the meetings, a traditional scene sensual dance between the protagonists only inserted into the script to bring the couple and make them realize what they feel for each other, and scenes of jealousy in which both realize their real feelings, among other things. Moreover, the film justifies the actions of Mike showing that he is not as unattainable, revealing their vulnerability. He was hurt by women in his past, and has a gentle side and family through his relationship with his nephew and sister, even though the custom of dating several women. The natural progression of scenes ranging approaching Abby and Mike is increasingly well placed throughout the film and makes us believe in the couple.The cinematographer Russell Carpenter values well outside the locations and represents well the routine the scenes of a TV show. The soundtrack to Aaron Zigman - the same Bridge to Terabithia (2007), Sex and the City (2008) and My Sister's Keeper (2009) - is once again one of the highlights. Always fun and leading to laughter and thrilling and rocking the romance when needed. Emphasis on the scene in the hotel room where Abby ""reveals"" to Colin. The soundtrack is also very current and appropriate. We have ""Hot N Cold"" by Katy Perry, ""Pocketful of Sunshine"" by Natasha Bedingfield, ""Under the Covers"" Josh Kelley, to ""Right Round"" by Flo Rida & Kesha.The film manages to excel and do well for two reasons. The first is how the script deals with the relationship between men and women here by applying the formula of opposites attract and stating that there is no way to choose who we fall in love. The script is full of expressions, phrases and more sexually oriented jokes, how to cite food shaped penis, orgasms, masturbation, jokes about looks etc.. The jokes and balconies spicier gifts every scene is precisely what makes the film does not miss a beat at any time and can take several laughs and a few laughs all the time. How not fail to mention the priceless scene vibrating panties in the middle of the business dinner with the presence of Colin, or the scene of tapas which the protagonists were given in some scenes while Mike helped Abby to make Colin an interest in her.But in addition to greater sexualization of the film, the second reason for the good result and it takes the movie forward, are its stars: the undeniable chemistry between Gerard Butler and Katherine Heigl. He - he was best known for playing King Leonidas in 300 (2006) and for having a stake in Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life (2003) alongside Angelina Jolie - had already ventured into drama and comedy romantic in Dear Frankie (2004) and the great PS I Love You (2007) alongside Hilary Swank. But here it may drop more, leaving its most gallant came to light very well and exploring one side more comic. The bastard way of his character blends well with the more rustic look of Butler. Have a beautiful and mesmerizing Katherine Heigl - who appeared when she was still very young on the big screen and in recent years became known for playing Dr. Izzie Stevens on Grey's Anatomy series and starring alongside several romantic comedies such as 27 Dresses (2008), also very good Knocked Up (2007), and Killers (2010), Life as We Know It (2010) - shows extreme resourcefulness and charisma. Heigl, besides being one of the most beautiful faces in Hollywood in recent times, has proven to be a great actress and that masterfully uses his facial expressions every visual joke. So knowledgeable and dedicated in the genre of romantic comedy, having acted with some of the biggest heartthrobs of the cinema, now it lacks is venturing into other genres and take more risks in his career, going over his state of comfort and exploring new challenges his career. Ability and talent she has proved that, and to spare.Luketic does not propose to find answers to the differences between men and women, but reseat them and take advantage of this vast field situations and conflicts that exist since the world began, and achieves its purpose well. Of course, taking the clichés already expected the licenses in the script so that everything fits well, the film entertains and deserves to be given whenever possible.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
The truth is really not that ugly.,"The truth is if you not easily offended this is a more adult rom com & the only ugly thing about this film is it was edited to be too short a storyline.This was a very interesting plot that would have been better with a more fleshed out plot ( basically a directors cut with the ""deleted scenes"" would have made the film a better balanced watch as why were they edited out? )So the normal edited version is just a 7 out of 10 ( as not enough back story about the main two characters to make you understand them & empathise more with their characters & understand better what they both need ).Basically not enough time in the final edit is spent on making you really care about both characters, as this is a movie for adults so give it more run time.Definitely worth a watch & if you own the DVD & can watch the ""deleted scenes under special features you can see it could have been a great ""8"".( the ending we get was good but if they had added the best parts of the ""alternative ending #2"" to the rom com, set a year or two later that would have really sealed the deal as it could have shown the growth of both of the two main characters & that of the other peripheral characters we liked ).",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Man what a bad movie,"Seriously, i don't know what movie studios are thinking now a days, releasing movies like these into the cinemas. I went to watch this movie, not with high hopes (after all the whole opposites attract formula has been used millions of times in romantic comedies, so it wasn't very original) but i thought it could be fun. I mean the trailer had it's moments, and i am a Gerard Butler fan, i thought maybe he could have good chemistry with Katherine Heigl (she did OK in knocked up). None of it was there, no chemistry, no good acting, no script, no laughs. The only reason i am not giving it a 0 to this movie is because i had a few laughs in the vibrator scene (is not a spoiler because it appears in the trailer). I am a big fan of Gerard Butler, but i don't know what he was thinking, is like he accepted the movie without even reading that awfully unfunny script. He did very good in 300 (some people say his acting was stiff, but i think it was very powerful, his approach to Leonidas was chilling) so i guess he should stick to those kind of strong quiet type kind of roles. Another thing is his accent, he cannot pull it of, his American accent is jut plain awful, Gerard if you are reading this for any reason whatsoever, i am a big fan but stick to your native accent or at least get a better American coach. Katherine Heigl does a lousy job playing this highly annoying network executive, her whole character is just annoying, and the way they approached the character was just unreal. As i said earlier the script is painfully unfunny, i mean they jut used clichè after clichè of the macho stereotype for Butler, clearly trying to emphasize how different he was with Heigl's character: Guess what? this time it didn't work. The characters were so cliché'd that they just became caricatures, i never cared for any of them, i didn't care if they ended up together or not. All in all is an awful movie, and i just couldn't repress my feelings towards this mess of a movie. Horrible performances, Horrible movie",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

"All think of ""it""...","The film causes disgust. During its viewing I had time and again a desire to switch off it, but I have not made it, since. I respect creativity of any director. But, nevertheless I will tell that anything special in this film that that clever and interesting I have not found.About what a film? Plainness of a plot which is invented for no reason, absence of interest to which speaks that lust and platitude is present at it through every minute-two. Specially for ""the dark"" people who are not understanding anything in a life and relations between the man and woman Dzherard Butler which has played the leader of the program on TV «the Naked truth», tries to ""throw light"" on sex and everything that with it it is connected. In its opinion, each person thinks only of sex. The interesting statement, but nothing confirmed and nothing meaning. Therefore also there is at me, (and I hope not only at me), a sensation of delirium and groundlessness.As to Ketrin Hajgl, its character in a film first does not trust the leader, and then, on the contrary, completely trusts in its ""councils"" in which anything as I already spoke, clever, instructive it is not observed.What as a result? As a result — the usual comedy melodrama created in what it is impossible to be surprised, in the USA. After the only thing, fortunately, viewing of this ""creation"" I have even more doubted that the director of this film can create something worthy, for reception of pleasure from a film, at least in a genre a comedy/melodrama.

The truth is pretty,"At the start of the movie, one of several terrible songs is played. These songs represent a musical style that is apparently either enjoyed by Katherine Heigl or by her fans.Abby is the uptight yet attractive producer of a morning news program, though in recent years the program has become mostly fluff, something Abby does not approve of.While she is watching TV at home, Abby's cat D'Artagnan accidentally switches the channel and Abby finds herself watching Mike, a man with outrageous (though not unusual for men) opinions about relationships between men and women. It could be worse; one of his competitors says things like ""No really means yes"".Mike takes calls from viewers, so Abby calls and gives him a piece of her mind. Mike also figures out what Abby's ideal man would be.The next morning Abby is shocked to find Mike at her TV station as the newest member of the cast of her TV show. His segment will be called ""The Ugly Truth"".D'Artagnan helps Abby find her ideal man. When the kitty gets trapped up in a tree, Abby must go rescue him. When Abby gets hurt trying to get out of the tree, she is rescued by her new neighbor Colin, a doctor who is everything Abby wants. Abby turns into a giggling teenager. The next day at work, she is her uptight self again, but with prettier hair.Mike helps Abby prepare to date Colin. She needs to do a lot to make herself pretty, including buying new clothes. At this point it becomes clear that although Abby absolutely despises Mike, we surely believe that by the end of the movie she will end up with either Mike or Colin.Meanwhile, Mike does so well it is possible his show will go national and Abby will have to find a replacement.Katherine Heigl does a very good job. At first, she is too hard to like and I find myself not even caring what will happen to her. She's not even good looking. Later, she is gorgeous and even easy to like. The fact that she can go from uptight rhymes-with-witch to a giggling teenager helps a lot.Gerard Butler is a challenge to like (I would have preferred a Tim Allen type) but he's just right for the role. As a guy I would find myself liking his wild ideas on women. But even I found myself sort of hoping he would get the girl rather than Colin.I know Nick Searcy best as the Frank Burns type head of security on the time travel series ""Seven Days"". Here, he is much easier to like and does quite a good job as Abby's boss.When I saw this movie it had a TV-PG rating with a D for dialogue, though some of the sexual humor is quite potent, and I would definitely not call this a family film. I did like one gag involving a product one would buy at a store selling sex toys. Seeing this movie helped me get a joke I heard recently on TV's ""Rules of Engagement"".Of course, the movie follows a formula, but I like the formula. The challenges are silly and we do ride an emotional roller-coaster, but everything will be all right in the end, right?I actually think the truth is quite pretty.",,Anonymous,Romance

The Ugly Truth,"Abby Richter (Katherine Heigl) is a producer for a local TV station's morning news program in Sacramento. The show is struggling, pulling in less viewers than reruns of Geraldo, and her boss Stuart (Nick Searcy) is looking for something to draw viewers to their morning show. When he finds out that a cable access show called The Ugly Truth run by Mike Chadway (Gerard Butler) is pulling in viewers thanks to Mike's brash attitude toward relationships, he brings The Ugly Truth to the morning show as a regular installment on the morning show, much to Abby's chagrin.Best known for his turn in 300 Gerard Butler has amassed a somewhat large female following (I'm sure the uniforms in 300 didn't hurt), making him something of a recent go-to guy for romantic comedies as of late. Katherine Heigl, originally of Grey's Anatomy fame, found her in to movies when Anne Hathaway dropped out of Knocked Up allowing her to jump into the lead female spot. Since then she seems to have taken a spot in the lead in several romantic comedies appearing next in romantic action comedy Killers with Ashton Kutcher. So coming from somewhat different backgrounds how do these two play together in the movies?Fairly well. In a movie like this, you need to believe that the main characters despise each other, and Heigl embodies that in this movie. And while Chadway, if played improperly, could come off as totally unlikeable, Butler makes you like this sexist neo-perv. It's in the characterizations and acting that the movie grabs your attention and pulses with the ability to make you laugh. Another thing that I found more welcome on my end, was the R rating for a romantic comedy, something that you don't typically see in most romantic comedies. The willingness to push things just a little further was kind of refreshing.I can't really say there's much that I didn't enjoy with this movie. As I've said before in my review of The Proposal, this movie doesn't reinvent the romantic comedy, nor does it need to. In the end it's fairly by the numbers, but does more to bring in audience members from both sexes, making it a much better date movie than you can typically come to expect from most romantic comedies. I recommend this movie, especially to guys who need a romantic comedy to watch with their women.3.5/5",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Love Hate Relationships,"I am currently taking a class where we are asked to watch many varieties of movies and recently a friend of mine recommended I watch the movie, ""The Ugly Truth"", a romantic comedy and I must say this movie is by far my favorite from this genre of movies. The films main characters consist of a successful women TV producer named Abby Richter (Katherine Hiegl) who recently got news that her TV station was getting horrible reviews and if they didn't go up soon they would have to cancel the show. It was then that the Abby's boss decided to bring in a fresh new piece to their show which brings us to Mike Chatway (Gerard Butler) who at the time worked for a late night call in show giving advice to women in his opinion of what men want. Here is where Abby first sees Mike and winds up calling in to tell him off because she thinks his vulgar opinions are obscured. It is then the next day that it is announced that the new addition to the show Abby produces is going to him. It is here where the theme begins. The theme of this movie is the battle of man versus women. All throughout the movie these two battle it out with Mike with his charm and vulgarity and Abby with her intellectual smarts and control freak personality. It is then when Abby meets a guy who she believes is perfect and when I mentioned control freak earlier she has a check list of the perfect guy for her. This is when Mike comes into play and shows Abby how to win the guys over or in other words shows her what guys really want. While Abby was hesitant to think that Mike even had the least bit of clue what he was talking about in the end he was right.

"A Predictable, Unbelievable Failure","I watched this turd last night and it totally sucks. Here are the reasons why: 1. I like raunch and I like heartfelt romantic comedies but not both. A movie can pull at our heartstrings as it shows two people falling in love or it can joke about swalling cum but it can't do both. This movie tries to be filthy, funny and touching all at once and it fails.2. I am tired of seeing hot chicks in movies who have no social skills or ability to get men's attention (ala Miss Congeniality). Most of the hot women I know in my life excel socially and none have had a hard time getting men.3. Romantic comedies are usually predictable (probably their greatest downfall) and this one is more predictable than most. It doesn't help that the hot doctor's character is never developed. He is a completely 1-dimensional character. We never really care if she gets him and we care even less when they break up.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Standard Rom-Com or Gross-Out Comedy? A Belabored Movie That Can't Make Up Its Mind,"This 2009 movie proves that women - in this case, screenwriters Nicole Eastman, Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith - can write romantic comedies just as poorly as men can. As directed by Robert Luketic (""Legally Blonde""), the idea behind this misfire is to cross-pollinate the most tired conventions of the female-focused genre with the sensibilities of the recent spate of raunchy, man-boy comedies, this latter genre having found its unequivocal leader in Judd Apatow. However, unlike Apatow, who has figured out how to make films that are insightful as well as funny like ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" and ""Knocked Up"" (ironically featuring this film's star, Katherine Heigl), Luketic shows no such finesse as everything in this film feels labored with the principal actors Heigl and Gerard Butler overplaying their opposites-attracts roles to near-cartoon proportions. Moreover, there are so many absurd gross-out gags inserted in this film that it feels like the creators (including executive producer Heigl) completely miscalculates who its target audience appears to be.The strictly by-the-numbers plot centers on Abby Richter, an uptight, overachieving producer for a ratings-challenged morning talk show in, of all places, Sacramento. Her workplace is full of the stock characters you would expect in this type of formulaic movie - the demanding station manager, the show's vainglorious co-hosts with empty smiles and non-ironic deliveries, the inane segments that make up Abby's struggling show. Predictably, her personal life is burdened by an incessant, programmatic search for Mr. Right, and consequently, her one-time dates become a series of qualification interviews. Prospects don't look much better at work with her show's ratings, and so enters local cable-access celebrity, Mike Chadway, a chauvinist personality who regales in providing sexist advice on what men are really looking for in women. Naturally, it comes down to guys wanting nothing but sex and how women should do everything they can to encourage it.Ratings rise based on the prurient content and Mike's unapologetic behavior, and even Abby recognizes his prowess in tapping into the public's psyche, so much so that on a stay-or-get-fired wager, Mike convinces her that he can be her Cyrano to help her land her neighbor, a handsome doctor who meets all of Abby's superficial qualifications. As tired as the premise sounds (and it is), the movie's pain points are exacerbated by the constant need to humiliate Abby, mainly through simulations of sexual acts in public. Obviously a knock-off of Meg Ryan's fake orgasm scene in ""When Harry Meets Sally"", the most notoriously contrived episode involves a pair of electronic panties that cause her to writhe uncontrollably in front of her corporate sponsors. Heigl seems to be playing the same model of efficiency in all her big-screen roles, and as Abby, she plays her stereotype on hyper-drive, for instance, hanging upside down from a tree in her underwear or doing her happy dance repeatedly.Burying his Scottish brogue under an accent that sounds suspiciously like Mel Gibson's, Butler should be careful about accepting roles like Mike because he could otherwise turn into a Matthew McConaughey-type of actor, a promising career start (""Dear Frankie"") followed by bad commercially-driven choices. The other actors make little impression with even the comic talents of John Michael Higgins and Cheryl Hines wasted as the shallow talk show co-hosts. The ending is predictable and poorly matted on a hot-air balloon, and the denouement brings an unnecessarily cynical exclamation point to the whole venture. The 2009 DVD is unsurprisingly, mostly filler - a gag reel, a set of alternative endings, and a couple of featurettes – the first about the differences in the male and female points of view and the second about the apparent hilarity in making this film. I'm glad the cast and crew had a good time, me not so much.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

I thought it would be a typical Katherine Heigel movie, but Gerard Butler's character was really entertaining.Due to the humor that he adds, I'd even consider asking my boyfriend to watch it.

Erratic,"I have just come from a movie theater where I saw the new romantic comedy ""The Ugly Truth"" starring Katherine Heigl and Gerard Butler. It was directed by Robert Luketic with three screen writers, two of whom worked with the director on an earlier hit, LEGALLY BLONDE.With a title that suggests the great Leo MacCarey comedy THE AWFUL TRUTH, this movie has been taking an awful lot of criticism, mostly directed at Miss Heigl, a beautiful and competent actress who has, it seemed, been called upon to carry a script which is mostly distinguished by the fact that her character, as written, is composed of a number of seemingly immiscible characteristics, none of which are ever sorted out; and which seems to attempt to move between standard screwball, standard romantic comedy, with occasional Farrelly-Brothers-style freak-out jokes tossed in, with no presagement, rhyme nor reason.The whole thing ends in such a predictable manner in a sky filled with balloons that the film might have been written by simply taking discarded parts of other scripts and tossing them in.In short, while Miss Heigl does not distinguish herself in this indistinguishable mess, laying the blame at her feet strikes me as cruel and foolish. While she is given an 'executive producer' credit, there are a total of eleven producers on this film, which is up near the John Woo level. Miss Heigl carries out her acting assignment competently, and she has good chemistry with Mr. Butler. While she has appeared in other romcoms to better effect -- I did enjoy 27 DRESSES -- surely her job as an actor is not to rewrite the script, nor to insist on a character that makes sense, but to perform the role in a manner as plausible as possible, to milk the funny lines for what they are worth and to be generally of interest when she is on screen. She accomplishes the last, but surely the fact that her character makes no sense and that the gags are thrown in at random cannot be laid at her feet.Mr. Butler is given a much more interesting role, that of a chauvinist pig whose TV producer Miss Heigl is forced to become. However, the audience is swiftly assured that this is simply a pose to cover a warm heart and Miss Heigl comes to recognize this gradually -- and telling the audience quickly and Miss Heigl slowly is another problem with the script.There is also the third wheel, played by Eric Winter, who plays an unattached doctor with a body that looks like he spends three or four hours a day working on his abs. Although my early assumption that he would turn out to be gay were not borne out, he serves no real impediment to Mr. Butler's and Miss Heigl's inevitable romance.The result is that this is a poor but fitfully watchable romcom, distinguished mostly by Mr. Butler's macho maundering on What Men Really Want. If you miss it, you won't miss much, but I doubt if the actively painful scenes -- including the aftermath of a discussion of masturbation that the Farrelly Brothers would reject as neither funny nor realistic --will cause you to walk out of the theater.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

Awful!,"Warning: If you're planning to see this movie with your teenage child...don't! It is not appropriate for a teenager as it is filled with dirty language throughout. The humor, if you can call it that, is crude and crass. The terrible script, choppy scenes, vulgar language, all make for a movie that I would characterize as smut. Sadly, good comedy takes a back seat to x-rated dialog. If I had been watching the movie by myself I would have turned it off after the first ten minutes. It was embarrassing to watch. What a total waste of time! If you want to see good clean comedy watch ""The Proposal"" instead.I assumed the script was written by single men who think acting like morons attracts women; interestingly, it was written by three women...perhaps they thought they had something to prove. I've got news for them, they just proved they could write bad comedy!One more point: The writers are clueless or they think their audience is; I'm referring to the part where Abby calls Mike's show and he asks her if she's calling from Europe. Local television stations are not aired in Europe. If the writers happen to read this review, please go get an education!",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

"So-so sitcom/romcom, miscast and underdeveloped","So-so sitcom starring Katherine Heigl and Gerard Butler, set in a completely unbelievable (by me) world of daytime television, in which Katherine Heigl, the hoity-toity politically correct producer of a very low-rating breakfast/midday news & current affairs show is incensed when her superior appoints a politically incorrect hunk (Gerard Butler) to host a special segment called 'The Ugly Truth', in which he tells 'the truth', which she finds ugly, but the audience loves, and which, of course, rates its head off. There are some funny ideas here, which don't quite play out. KH is not believable as Ms Hoity-Toity. In fact this is the sort of romcom that KH usually sends up. Gerard B is okay, he's just not funny. Some people aren't. Successful romcoms, I think, are like souflees; they seem insubstantial, but they're delicious when they're just right – light and fluffy. All that lightness takes a lot of hard work, and skill. This looks like it's been cast in a hurry, and shot in a hurry..and it'll probably be forgotten thus",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

Ugly is right,"This movie was the most offensive, disgusting film I have seen in a long time. I left in the middle, during a particularly offensive scene. It was not only coarse, filthy and very lacking in creativity or true humor, but it was misogynistic.The idea that women need to accept that men are nothing but animals and that they(women) simply need to ""loosen up"" is a male-serving lie. It is discouraging, hurtful and untrue.. Please do not go to see this film. Try to see something of a higher level PLEASE. I do think there is more to male/female relationships than crude jokes, sexual innuendo, etc. The heroine is a beautiful, intelligent woman who would have many men chasing her in real life.

Take note: not all guys think alike and not all ladies think alike. It is just that simple. In not so many words, that's what this movie is saying. There could never be a better title than ""The Ugly Truth."" You cannot go PG or PG-13 with this one.

Definitely Better Than a Poke in the Eye with a Sharp Stick,"""The Ugly Truth"" is a definitely better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick. It stars two lovely, charming actors: Gerard Butler and Katherine Heigl. Other than that, there is nothing good to say about this movie. It really, really stinks. The critics got this right.First, memo to Gerard Butler. You were gorgeous in ""Phantom of the Opera."" You were buff in ""300."" In ""The Ugly Truth,"" you are fat, and fat does not work on you, darling. Some actors can carry it off – where would James Gandolfini be without those extra 200 pounds he carries around. On you, Gerry, the fat just does not work. It settles on your face, and you look puffy and too much like Ernest Borgnine to star in any romance outside of a remake of ""Marty."" The rest of the movie is simply not worth talking about. It is vulgar, trashy, and badly made. I was astounded by the poor quality of the film stock. It's as if you are watching ""The Ugly Truth"" through rancid fish aquarium water. The direction isn't up to high school drama class standards, and the lines fall flatter than Kansas.All of this is a crying shame, because the premise is promising and the actors are game.

Between Raunchy And The Rom-Com Lies...,"...the (moderately) raunchy rom-com! And friends and movie buffs, it works wonderfully well.You already know what it's about.

This one conforms in all the usual respects, but we mustn't stop there.""The Ugly Truth"" provides more sincerely funny moments per unit time than I would have dreamed possible. Gerard Butler and Katherine Heigl prove to have wonderful screen chemistry. Each one's presence is enhanced by the presence of the other. What's unique and refreshing about the movie is how artfully it weaves, in and between and around the laughs, a poignant insight about love: how BLEEP!ing irrational it is.Yes, some men are looking for T'n'A. Yes, some women carry checklists to which a suitor must conform to be seriously considered. But the wildly, totally absurd, delightful truth about it all, as Mike and Abby illustrate for us, is one we should all bear in mind as we navigate our personal minefields of the heart:You can't hunt it down, you can't predict it, and you can't rationalize it.

The two leads really work well together and have great chemistry. There are also some pretty funny physical gags in the film. Yes, it's pretty formulaic and yes it's pretty predictable, but it's still a very enjoyable fun and often times warm hearted movie. Katherine is really just so lovable and great in her role!

Too Raunchy and a Bad Script,"Abby (Heigl) is forced to increase ratings of the TV show she produces by allowing Mike (Butler) to show the women in the TV audience what men really want from women.After 10-minutes, I shut this down. Too embarrassing to watch. Nothing funny, no good lines. The only thing it had going for it was watching Katherine Heigl. Then I tried again the next day hoping it got better, but shut it down again after an additional 10-minutes. Simply really bad and crude dialogue mostly by Mike (Butler) who was a non-stop Raunch Machine. Even the beautiful and talented Heigl fell into the trap and mouthed a few unfunny more-than-risqué lines. Enough was enough.So now the DVD sits waiting to go back to Red Box where no one should ever take it out. Will the movie save itself? Probably, but I will never know after experiencing the first 20-minutes head start of garbage it produced. Yes, I know a lot of people like the dirty talk, especially hormonal 7th and 8th graders. But, they, too, grow up at some point. Let's hope. Sometimes the risqué has it's place and is funny, but not in here.When I found out that three women actually sat down and wrote this, I kind of understood why all the raunch. Apparently, good lines, and comedy take a back seat to x-rated dialogue. Perhaps they felt they had to prove something. Oh, wait a minute, they thought they were writing funny stuff.

A Nutshell Review: The Ugly Truth,"How my friend and I got to watch an advance preview of this film is an interesting story in itself, given the circumstances and what we had experienced and observed, somehow playing a little bit on the theme of the movie, but I suppose that is something for another day. The Ugly Truth didn't fare all too well when it got released in the States, perhaps most people found the content too hard to swallow, in self-denial, or basically too prudish to let the hair down and guffaw at the situations being presented, however unlikely they could be.If you had thought the trailer had some of the best lines in the movie, then may I assure you that you'll be up for a lot more. Maybe it's because I have bad taste, or a potty mind at times that took over, and found that hey, I could be the equivalent of a Mike Chadway (Gerard Butler) too, with filth that comes out of the mouth without thorough processing. Butler's Chadway is a shock jock, who on late night cable television hosts The Ugly Truth, passing on sound but cynical judgement about the state of modern relationships to his viewers. Katherine Heigl's Abby is a television producer whose languishing ratings on her show translates to a threat of cancellation, until Mike gets contracted to present his pointed viewpoints on a segment of her news programme.Needless to say, sparks don't fly between the two because the control freak in Abby is automatic loggerheads with Mike's loose cannon (pardon the pun), and made worse when Mike is deemed as the saviour of her show and career. The two enter a grudging professional relationship when Abby seeks help from Mike in order to snag the man of her dreams (according to a checklist, no less!), and I guess for a romantic comedy you can fill in the blanks all the way to the finale.Sure the story isn't rocket science, full of fluff that could be used to fill a king sized mattress, but who cares about the story when you have insane, chauvinistic situations (and this is written by three women!) plastered left, right and centre full of sexual innuendos and references all targeted squarely at making you laugh, probably sometimes at yourself when you realize that you've utilized the same tips and tricks, or found yourself stuck in the exact same situation where the advice become ""words of wisdom"". It's pretty much the games people play, laid out flatly on the table, and as such, adds to your ability to identify and participate in the film.The film worked wonders because of its star pairing of Butler and Heigl. I always thought Butler could do action and romance with his eyes closed, but who would have realized that he makes an awesome shock jock who's convinced with exactly what he's preaching, and practising those lessons to the T. If anything it adds to his versatility that he can do comedy as well. Heigl needs no introduction, and she amplifies her comic timing a lot more in this one, which I think easily endears her. Playing essentially two proverbial roles like the Librarian and the Stripper in her real, and perceived, fake self thanks to Mike's creative input, it's a little bit of fantasy thrown in, as who can imagine anyone looking like Heigl, having a lack of suitors lining up her doorway. That goofy dance of hers each time she literally jumps for joy, should be immortalized.Hold on, did I actually enjoy this film? Yes, really, so don't laugh (at me). I have to admit again that it relied plenty on clichés, cardboard characters, and unreal situations crafted just for laughs (such as the one just begging to challenge When Harry Met Sally's iconic scene in a restaurant), it's quite inexplicable how I could have come to really laugh at nearly every moment, and had a field day with it. Inexplicable, just like falling in love with someone is.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Better than what I expected,"The problem with romantic movies is that they are plagued by recipes and formulas, relentlessly walking the same path until nothing remains but a dusty, barren, tasteless thing. And then they reinvent themselves, making fun of their former selves, like high school children entering a new phase and then dismissing anyone not sharing their view. But somehow, romcoms always get back to the same idea, like the tail eating snake.This one started as these 2.0 types, with the manly type showing a control freak beauty the ways of true love. And then it went the usual way. The thing is that Katherine Heigl and Gerard Butler really had chemistry (even if I dislike the chick personally) and then the whole thing kind of made some sense. And I enjoyed it.And then the clichés started butting in where they had no business doing so. Somehow, there must be a guy with a cliché checklist for romantic comedies and he insisted that at least half of them should be checked by any movie. Something like a romcom MPAA, maybe?Bottom line: I rated the movie high because it really was better than the crap in the genre.

raunchy alleged romantic comedy,"Katherine Heigl needs to rethink her career. She's too blatantly beautiful for moviegoers to continue buying the notion that the characters she plays are incapable of finding love. Puh-leeze, give that a rest. Further, she's always got a librarian-type look at the start--then blossoms into a babe. Another tired Heigl movie signature. But what really kills this picture (don't waste the $$ for a DVD rental) is that it suffers from an identity complex. It's R-rated for its very vulgar language and innuendo...but nothing is really shown. So men will be disappointed that there's no T & A on screen (though there's plenty of talk of it) and women will find it too crass to be romantic.

Another summer wasteland romcom,"If Apatow and Meg Ryan movies had a child, it might be The Ugly Truth. Its a cookie-cutter romance filled with lots of cuss words and scatology to make it seem ""edgy"". As much as the actors want there to be more involved with the movie, the bones just aren't there, and after a few early giggles, The Ugly Truth is exposed as a poor effort.The Ugly Truth opens with Heigl's character Abby as a depended-on news producer who's love life is in shambles due to her obsessive need for control (she has a checklist of ten things she expects in a man). This is only made all the more clear when she calls into a male romance show led by the a scruffled Mike Chadway (Butler), who chews her out and calls her fat. Of course, Mike is soon hired by her network as a correspondent to increase ratings. Cue shenanigans.When Abby meets her new 8-packed doctor neighbour (I think he may have extra abs), she falls head over heels and is absolutely clueless how to proceed. Mike finds out and teaches Abby to treat the good doctor as a man, and no one knows men like Mike, who becomes Abby's Mr. Miyagi of men in order to get her to stop complaining about his show.There is some basic truth to what Mike says. Yes, men don't like being controlled. Yes, men don't fall for personality at first sight. However, the movie works in broad strokes, and as such ends up as both male AND female chauvinistic. Mike's a pig and Abby's a bitch. Somehow through each other they get a little closer to the middle.Of course, that's because the genre demands it. The movie follows the flow of rom-coms to a ridiculous extent. There really isn't much original at all going on in this plot. The ending is particularly terrible, the character shifts being far too sudden.The movie has some funny bits at the beginning, with Butler playing the over-the-top pig. Unfortunately, once we get over the fact that there's some particularly nasty cuss words in a rom-com, most of the rest seems pretty stale. A half-hour of mildly-funny does not make up for a very unfunny next hour. Admittedly, there were a few unintentional laughs towards the end.The actors do their best. Heigl is cute and annoying, as she should be, and has a future in these kind of movies. Butler shouldn't be wasting his time, but does what the script demands quite well. Eric Winter seems to be fit enough for the dreamy doc role, even if his face is a little creepy. Cheryl Hines and John Michael Higgins are the saving grace of the first third as the husband-and-wife co-anchors, but they quickly fall to the background after their time is up.The Ugly Truth is just another entry in the wasteland of summer rom-coms, even if its one that earns an R-rating. No amount of dick jokes can make up for that.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

Katherine counter acts as Abby, the award-winning producers of a news show, that hires Mike.Abby decides to use Mike as a date guru on the terms, if his advice helps her, they work together side-by-side, and if the advice doesn't work, he quits.I find myself even more so amazed that Gerard is able to play another versatile role and being unrecognizable. He is such like an amoeba changing his appearance with each movie and being something completely different from his last film.The chemistry between the two stars is quite incredible to watch.

Cyrano With Blue Eyes & Blue Jeans,"I'm not a fan of ""Chick Flicks, "" and I've never been much of a fan of Gerard Butler after the scandal.... but I LOVE the sweet, fresh - faced Katherine Heigel since Grey's anatomy & the All - American Eric Winter since Days of Our Lives. So, I've been putting off watching this movie for 10 years, now I'm disabled I'm watching tons of movies on Netflix, and saw this, had I known it was a re- imagining of Cyrano De Bergerac, as Roxanne was a few decades ago, I would have watched this back when it first came out!Katherine plays the producer of a local television morning show, who's so neurotic, that any man she dates, she has her assistant do a background check on him, and ACTUALLY thinks up and prints out a list of questions for them to ask each other on their first date! She hasn't had a meaningful relationship in a long time, she hasn't even had sex in 11 months. Everything in her life is in tight, perfect order, and that's how she likes it... she's a control freak.Gerard plays Mike, the star of a local access show called ""The Ugly Truth, "" which gets picked up by her mourning show for regular episodes. This Show is aimed at men, teaching them how to pick up women and tell them what women want- however, he's got it ALL WRONG, i.e. he tells men instead of taking women on a romantic singer date, we'd prefer you take us to Jello wrestling! So, as you can guess, they butt heads!Enter Eric's Colin. Abby sees her cat outside in a tree, the limb breaks outside his window, he rescues her, gives her his number. When she gets the nerve to call him from work, Mike over hears, and interferes. Now I ABHOR spoilers, so I won't be giving any away, but know that Mike plays Cyrano, and just as with Cyrano, he learns more about himself than anything, and it backfires on him.Being someone who doesn't like ""Chick Flicks"" I LOVED THIS MOVIE!

just what I expected,"I am a sucker for rom coms. I am aware that many like this one are not very good. They all draw from a short list of popular clichés and then they mix them up and cast the movie with the ""it"" girl of romantic comedies at the moment. The clichés featured in this movie are, but not limited to; the chauvinistic man whore who acts the way he does because he was hurt, the liar revealed, the bickering couple who ""secretly"" love each other, and topped off with a cheesy public outburst to declare their love. The result is a generic rom com that will disappoint the film critic. I enjoyed this movie because I knew exactly what it was going to be when I saw it. Sometimes I enjoy predictable movies because I don't want a surprise. I enjoy knowing what is going to happen throughout the movie. It's like eating a frozen pizza or a hot pocket.

Unbelievable and raunchy and sassy romantic comedy.,"""The Ugly Truth"" isn't anything great still it's a comedy that entertains in a crude gross and raunchy kind of way. From watching the scenes of the slow eating of a hot dog and listening to the script clearly you notice that it's a crude and sass comedy. It' not like the classic romance where love was obtained the old fashion way by holding hands and using manners.Katherine Heigl is an uptight and by the book California TV news producer who's programs are starting to fall in ratings. Enter a new sight when one day she sees a public access program that's outspoken as the host(Gerard Butler)tells it like it is about love, life and relationships. So the TV station up and hires this loud and outspoken mouth and what do you know ratings increase! In what was a traditional and uptight controlled news cast is now a sex advice hit! The Butler character starts to give the Heigl character advice on relationships it works at first yet not with some growing pains.Yet thru it all in the end it's a growing experience as each polar opposite will find their true selves and discover unexpected love. Overall this film is nothing great maybe a watch for it's sass and make believe as how many TV stations would really let the Butler character be that foul. And the chemistry between the two leads is nothing great. Really a hit and miss romantic comedy.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
best,"This movie is stunning and smashingly awesome. This movie is a great part when butler teaches how to impress a boy. I think it's best. This movie has its own sharing and beauty. Love is always different from each and another story. We don't know when we fall in love. When we depend on a girl. We always think about this girl and her heart is always telling us to meet her. , he never gave an answer in the end because guess what, there's no answer. It's as simple as that. So, in a way, the film deceives the audience. The negatives aside, the film did have some good elements. I liked the funny parts when the focus on the couple's romance wasn't there. I must admit there were a few scenes where I laughed out loud and those news anchors were good. But that's about it. The romance portion of the film didn't interest me.

Average Romcom,"The protagonists aren't ugly and the film's not truthful. Apart from that it's... well it's not great. It's a romcom that ticks all the convention and cliché boxes, never once straining from the confines of the genre. The truth here, it is claimed, is that men are simple, butt hen the 2nd half of the film goes on rather predictably to show that the protagonist who claims this is precisely capable of being the ideal man he claims doesn't exist. But as this is fairly recognisable from the outset the only remaining question is whether the journey is worth it? Not really - there's one funny scene at a baseball game which involves a gag done much better in many more films, plus a When Harry Met Sally rip-off scene that misses everything that was funny about the original film. We get the expected montage(s) and a dance scene with a total chemistry vacuum. It's not awful - i did laugh once or twice, but the overriding hypocrisy, the total dearth of chemistry between the leads, and the single dimension in which the characters are drawn makes any kind of empathy whatsoever with the protagonists nigh on impossible.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
"the truth about ""the ugly truth""","Every woman in the world wants to know what is going through a guy's mind, right? Well if you're one of those women wondering about the guy's mind, finally here is the movie that gives you insight into that complex mind! I learned so much more from this movie than I ever could have from getting advice from my best friends or from people who have been in relationships before.Abby (Katherine Heigl) is a producer for a morning show who has this list of qualities that she would like in a man. Mike (Gerard Butler) is this rude TV star on his own show called ""The Ugly Truth."" Abby's boss ends up hiring Mike to work on the morning show because they need a way to boost their ratings. Abby is absolutely livid about this because she finds Mike to be obnoxious and that he does not understand the idea of relationships at all.Mike tries to show Abby that he has serious expertise in relationships by helping her land her ""perfect"" guy. Come on though; is any man or woman ever really perfect? Well apparently Mike's advice is helping boost Abby's love life drastically because she lands this ""amazing"" guy.The Ugly Truth is a wonderful portrayal of the actualities of relationships with hilarious memorable lines. Heigl and Butler work so well together that you would actually think it was not a movie and you were watching real life. Their characters really help to balance each other out in their beliefs and their portrayals of the male and female genders. Though I found the movie to be hilarious and even a guy friend of mine said he enjoyed the movie, there were times that it contradicted itself which really bothered me. They showed the truth of relationships but they also showed an exception to what really happens at the end. It was a predictable ending that I did not really enjoy as much as I would have if it was something that was not as classic in a romantic comedy.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
mediocre comedy,"The Ugly Truth tells the story of Mike (Gerard Butler) a host of a TV show of the same name, in which he bluntly tells single women that the crap of prince charming they believe in and the advice they get from self-help books won't help to get them a boyfriend. After moving to a new TV network, Mike meets his producer Abby (Katherine Heighl), who initially hates him, then tolerates him for the sake of the ratings, and ends becoming buddy with him to get her the love of her hot neighbor.The funny thing is that the script uses all topics and tips that self- help books offer to women, even though Mike states in his program that he's against them. In other words, there is an absolute incongruity between what the character of Mike preaches and what the script does. I could not be otherwise since this is a romantic comedy targeted to women. A pity that, by doing so, treats the viewer as if we were all blind idiots.The most daring element of the film is that it is a romantic comedy where sex and sexual vocabulary are explicit and unsweetened. Said, this, there is not one single nude sex scene (actually just one sex scene), and even the orgasm scene is more comic and tasteless than daring. More unexpected than daring I would say. If you want to do something really provocative go all the way, with all the consequences.The leading couple, played by the always charming and hot Butler and the ultra-feminine Heighel, has a great chemistry on camera. However, their individual performances are uneven. Heighel starts the film overacting and she's not believable in her role until midway the film. On the contrary, Butler has a surprising easiness for romantic comedies, and plays his role with charm and cheekiness; in fact, he's perfect for this sort of roles, although he seems to be choosing bad quality movies that don't showcase his talent, but melt it away.The film is entertaining and has some funny scenes, but is full of stereotypes both in the script as in the drawing of the characters, and mediocre acting overall, which really ruins the whole thing.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

Boring...,"""The Ugly Truth"" is a Comedy - Romance movie in which we watch the relationship between a misogynistic man who is a host of a morning show about relationships and a very strict woman who is a television producer.Despite that I didn't have high expectations from this movie I have to admit that I was disappointed by it. After watching it I felt that I wasted one and a half hours of my life, something that I believe is the worst feeling after watching a movie. The direction which was made by Robert Luketic was below average following almost every cliche possible in a comedy - romance movie. The interpretation of Gerard Butler who played as Mike Chadway was good but it wasn't enough for saving this movie.

Fairly generic and obvious but still passable on a sort of genre level,"The Ugly Truth is summed up by the poster which sees the two stars leaning and turning their bodies away from one another in the time-honoured way that suits a film that has no intention of doing anything new or challenging but rather just turning out what the viewer expects. So it is that two people who initially hate each other are forced by a plot device to spend time together – I wonder if it is possible that they will somehow fall for each other at some point? No, surely not, I mean they clearly dislike each other from what I can see.And so it goes. Anyone who cannot see where the film is going within 5 minutes (or even just the poster) has simply never seen a film in this genre before – because it does almost exactly what you expect from start to finish. Along the way we have comic misunderstandings that are as basic as they are elaborately set up and of course a general emerging chemistry developing – none of which will be a surprise to the vast majority of viewers. The plot is secondary to the comedy though and in this way the film does have a certain obvious charm to it thanks mainly to the enthusiasm of Heigl in the lead role. She is likable and she commits to delivering the material and really does sell it in the most part. It is a shame that the supporting cast (including several famous faces) could not have been better used to deliver lots of side laughs to strengthen the film, but they were still reasonably good.Butler overplays his ""gruff real man"" role, slurping his coffee quickly used as a character shorthand – stuff like that. I didn't really like him that much and I don't really see the appeal – nor did I think he worked particularly well with Heigl, although this was perhaps down to the base material more than just his performance. He does what the material asks of him though, so in regard I guess he is OK for the film. As I said, seeing people like Hines, Higgins, Brown and others not really given the material to work with was a shame – normally a cast is populated with people like this so they can provide colour and one-liners in the background to help provide a sort of comedy base for the main plot and cast, this wasn't really the case here.So The Ugly Truth does just what you expect it to do across a film filled with the elaborate and unlikely comedy situations that you can see coming and often hope don't arrive. It is not a particularly good film but it is not a bad one – just about doing enough to provide the easy, undemanding and instantly forgettable genre fill that the majority of viewers will have come to it for.",,Anonymous,Romance

Also the whole ""comedy"" thing is missing from that Drama-Romance. Yet, I 'm not sorry for the 2 hours i spent watching it! The backdrops were quite well. The acting was good. Especially Katerine Heigl, as I mentioned before, but Gerard Butler was good in his own way too, i just think that the plot needed a little bit more work. Still a movie worth watching!",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great romantic comedy for all sexes... Great entertainment,"This one had me laughing to tears. No dull second! The lines are sharp, funny to cracking and although sometimes low, hey, it is a romantic comedy. Don't expect witty literary stuff. The comic angle is everywhere, from the anal retentive archetype Abby(Catherine Heigl) to the uneducated street smart Mike(Gerard Butler) who does not get the reference to public figures. So, they do say some words like sex, erection, and even the part where Abby says the word cock is funny. Heigl does a good job playing a ""When Harry Met Sally"" - Meg Ryan scene both ways, one where she's for real and another where she fakes it. And they're both funny! This is not a chick flick. The laughs were very loud watching this among guys. It might be a bit awkward with a date because this movie stabs at many more romance fallacies than all the other RomComs I've seen. But in my opinion, if you are on a date, it might actually serve to separate the sport from the prune and her reactions will give you some pointers on how to continue. I might even come back to write again and tell you how it is with the wife.... When Harry Met Sally, Bridget Jones's Diary and Two Weeks Notice, are all nice Romantic Comedies and the top rated. This one takes the cake and creams them all.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
You're gonna laugh out loud,"I love this movie which is still a shock to me and my girlfriend won't shut up about it she's like see I told you but I was surprised. When the movie started I thought here we go again typical ""chick flick"" but soon the movie pics up and I swear you will be laughing at the situations that occur...no spoilers I hate that you have to see it for yourself. But this movie is so funny it inspired me to write a review, we see something I like then something she likes the next week which is how I saw mamma mia and I hated it and it seemed like it would never end but we see everything and I have like four reviews on this site, what more proof do you need? Great acting by Katherine Heigl she is awesome now I'm gonna go watch the hangover to get my man card back.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Predictabality destroyed it,"Here we go again. Another one of those movies that have been done a bazillion times already. Granted, it had it's funny bits but overall the whole thing just felt so darn clichéd.So here's the basic storyline. A pretentious woman looking for true, passionate love and a guy who's a complete jerk and believes men only care about looks of a woman, hate each other. But wait, what's this? After a bunch of random bullcrap they end up together! Did you see that coming? I mean, who would've thought? Oh right, just about anyone who's seen romantic comedies before. Yes, just kill any shred of potential this movie had by destroying the plot line and making it generic romcom ending no.992. Most other characters excluding these 2 are basically props and add nothing to the story. The basic argument of the whole movie is 'men are afraid of love' and 'women are control freaks'. Ah, just shut the hell up with your dumb morals and just give us a decent funny movie. Oh, that can't happen because just about everything in Hollywood has to go by the dumb rulebook. Yes, never try to be original, always repeat what has been done and be very predictable.Like I said before, some of the jokes are good but most of them have been already done so they felt pretty bland. Even in the good jokes, none really stood out. This is a very forgettable movie and is definitely not worth watching because of a few decent jokes. Unless you're a big romcom buff, avoid. That's the real ugly truth.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Witty, exploitive, humorous.","Contrary to user fontroy5's review, this movie is most definitely a watch-worthy flick. The movie travels around society's stereotypes towards genders and gives a funny yet witty outlook on the truths behind them. If you aren't the type to read too deeply into things and keep in mind that this is a >comedy< romance, then this movie is definitely for you! While there are some things on the movie that could of gone without (Like the ending, I won't spoil it but it's not the most tasteful ending), The Ugly Truth most certainly is The Ugly Truth, because while most of it can be simply disregarded, there's a lot of real thought behind what's spoken of. 9 out of 10, a must watch!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Formulaic yes and predictable but a fine rom-com still,"70-80% of this is engaging and entertaining enough that for the most part we overlook the unbelievably unrealistic female character (who looks like Katherine Heigl and has such a difficult time getting dates apparently?). Gerard Butler is great in his role, although some of the ""guys like b****es"" trope feels really dated watching this in 2022. (Especially because of that lens, I am being particularly generous with my rating.)That said, I really enjoyed the movie--came here for Heigl and Butler and both delivered--although the last act felt hurried. (The chemistry between the two leads though left a lot to be desired--Heigl genuinely doesn't seem interested about the Gerard Butler character in the beginning that the way she falls for him at the end is a bit of a stretch.)",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
I loved this movie.,"Okay so this movie has a bad rep, but it's not true. I loved it.I love Katherine as an actress and I think all her movies are great. She always gives her best and puts herself into the character. Gerard did a great job as well. He completely fits that character.The movie is funny, interesting and everything a romance movie should be. Some people mention resembling to Hitch and similar movies but I haven't thought of one single movie while watching this. You know how there are some movies that when you finish watching you know you won't watch them again. Well, when I finished watching this one, I went here to look at the quotes and then thought to myself that I definitely will watch this again today.I'd recommend it!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Amazing movie,"I might have found it a bit predictable, yes and I don't know if this is just me but this was really good.

"Not wonderful, but not totally horrible, either.","After listening to and reading many, many negative reviews from (of course) male movie critics, my expectations for this film were extremely low. The same critics who loved Borat and Knocked Up and Superbad are now complaining that THIS movie is ""too crude"". Since no one brought excrement to a dinner table in THIS film, I am thinking that this one isn't nearly as disgusting (or mean!!) as Borat (which I will admit I haven't seen...after hearing about that scene, I didn't want to). But I digress. The other reviewer who mentioned that certain critics just can't handle mixed genre films must be right...my view is that it's okay (to the male critics) for ""guy"" movies, or movies sold as straight comedies (The Wedding Crashers comes to mind) to have crude language, but if a ""chick flick"" has bad language, then it's disgusting. I don't get it. I DID think much of the dialog in this movie was unnecessarily crude. However, I didn't think it was the worst film I've ever seen. I do think I enjoyed it more than ""The Proposal"". I am a fan of Katherine Heigl (I loved 27 Dresses), and Gerard Butler. Another wee criticism I have for this movie is that I just don't understand why they felt the need to HIDE Butler's accent. Why not just let him be Scottish? It was distracting to hear him slip into his natural dialect. I found myself wishing they'd just had him speak in his normal voice. I also enjoyed this film a lot more than I thought I would.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
...And Boy Is It!,"Hmmm. Looking for an older romcom and heard about this. Although good in parts, leaves a lot to be desired. It has some funny moments for sure.. ubt a few that would definitely make your grandmother blush or turn away or both. (Let's face it, you wouldn't even start watching this with your grandmother. This movie was still holding on to what I would call, ""The American Pie Formula"" in 2009 no less. Where gross-out was considered good, or atleast part of the formula. (My how far we've come.) Again some laugh-out-loud funny parts, but meh. Acting is decent, characters are decent.. and that's this movie in a nutshell for me... decent-ish.I give it 4/10 felated hotdogs.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

I really liked this!,"I'm truly surprised that this movie didn't earn a higher score. I really liked it. Although you have your typical chick flick ending, there is some delightfully unpredictable comedy mixed in! Katherine Heigel and Gerard Butler did an excellent job, not to mention the supporting cast who were also great. The script was really wonderful and witty. There were some crude elements in the film, but it is rated r and intended for a mature audience. Altogether I really enjoyed this flick, it's not something I'd watch with my parents but it really is a versatile chick flick. I think men would enjoy it just as much as women!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Fun!,"Fun Film~ full of over the line,very tolerable ruff and tumble talk on relationships. These two play it all perfectly and the film sets aside life's seriousness to get down to what's really going on with people in their personal lives in the midst of life. It's just fun and what's wrong with that... Thought it was going to be a Harry met Sally (which was Great!)drawn out conversational story that goes through so many people's reasoning about finding who's who and what works. But it's quick, It's flirty, it's messy & It finds those sentimental parts~ doesn't dwell to long with them and has funny little messages and leaves you wanting more ~ which is what all great films do! They did a great job. For people who wants to analyze this about what it says about relationships as a whole and what it means for women and what does it say about men.... I think they are missing the entire point of the movie:-) The Doc, he's adorable too!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Hilarious throughout -- many/most critics are clueless!,"I thought the Hollywood Reporter (or maybe it was the Tulsa critic) that got the basics, at least in part; this romantic COMEDY has a male viewpoint, as opposed to what's been offered for more than a couple of years now in romantic comedies. Quite simply, ""the relationship adviser as a crude Alpha Male"" premise is a surprise, especially with some defeats, insecurity, caring and polish is weaved into his interactions. He is not a misogynist, nor even a sexist, given his early recognition of Heigl's producer skill and contribution to the show. Perhaps one can't be certain of that, unless you sit through the laughs in entire film...By and large, other (up tight or elitist?) critics just don't get it! I'm reminded of the 70s, Mr. Mom's role-reversal film premise decades ago -- the critics blew that too. Neither plots were ""predictable"" except that in such films, it almost always ends well for the main players. But make no mistake, the key plot and broadcast scenes were original and hilarious -- parts reminded me of Mad's old, ""TV scenes we'd like to see...""In our showing, the audience was filled almost entirely with mixed-gender groups, who laughed though out this film. Note: there were few kids as it should be. The plot and dialog were both situationally and language surprising, because we're not used to THE UGLY TRUTH being shown an spoken in it's most basic form.Finally, we care about the characters. And in spite of the Relationship Alpha Male vs. Business Alpha Female premise, I expect the gender score ended up pretty close overall. Our matinée discount was completely unnecessary; this film was well worth it even at the over $10 full price + our time.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
lady think like a dude,"This movie started out cute and ended up being like a dude flick!Girl what were you thinking? Why did you go from cute and sweet,to a very nasty potty mouth dude;that hated the ladies.If I wanted to see a movie like that I would watch a ""B"" movie. If that is what you were going for you hit the nail on the head with this one. That is my mom's opinion about this comedy of the sexes. Mine is I liked it at first it was funny, and witty! But then further into the movie, it was one cuss word after another! And this sweet romantic comedy, transformed into a perverted dude flick! If I wanted to watch something that kept referring to oral gratification. Every two seconds , I would watch the revamped 'Two and a half men !""",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Stupid critics, this flick is a throwback & it's hilarious.","I mean sure, it's a big, fat, moist ball of cliches, but despite the opinions of the current social climate hypocritical language & intent nazis, it's fricking hilarious, smart, charming and a subtly and nearly flawless examination and commentary on the interaction between romantic and potential romantic partners. The leads, Heigl & Butler have genuine chemistry and the affection between the two is apparent quickly. They are both a complete surprise to each other, proving again that it's lunacy and incredibly shallow to judge a book by it's cover. Yeah, the dialogue is raw. Once upon a time so was the reality. Social change is needed, and as a son, nephew, cousin, brother and father, any abuse directed at a woman/girl enrages me and compels violence in my heart. The #MeToo movement, in it's intent and heart is long overdue but is being undermined by extremists of a different sort than the standard issue creep. I'm not going to point fingers but I'm certain that everyone knows of what I speak. It's tragic that a significant portion of males are misogynistic toolbags and have no business being anywhere near anyone let alone a creature as complicated and wonderful as your average female walking amongst us. It's dangerous and emotionally and psychologically crippling to see the world in black and white. You automatically lower your potential for growth through basic human interaction immediately by limiting the field, platonically and romantically. We need to make sure that policies and attitudes are in place to insure that the abuses of the past cannot be repeated and although it's challenging it can and hopefully will be done. In lockstep with that change there needs to be social dialogue between everyone who might be reasoned with that it couldn't hurt us all to recover some of our humor and find a balance between keeping the scumbags at bay and yet also not being too rigid and paranoid that you make yourself unable to enjoy a joke, have a sense of humor. This film isn't perfect but it's a simplistic role model for that balance and quite frankly I miss the girls I used to be friends with, amazing ladies that gave as good as they got and actually usually got the best of men in our hilarious verbal light saber duals. Interesting, intelligent, sharp women and girls who wouldn't take crap from anyone and could easily handle your basic everyday creep and use their remarkable wit and words to make him regrets his shallowness and ignorance and hopefully felt inspired to do the work to be able to engage with the opposite sex or any potential partners with respect, empathy and sometimes crass and vulgar silliness providing everyone with mutually beneficial laughs in an ever darkening and stupid world. See the movie!! Lighten up!! Fight for what's right but stop taking yourselves so seriously because you're missing out on a complete and fulfilling experience with another person by employing a linear unforgiving baseline of expectations to and for your relationships. We need to smack the creeps down every time, so hard they never come back but we also very much need each other and need to enjoy each other and hopefully have some genuine if not always clean laughs along the way. The Ugly Truth is funny and if you don't laugh then I kinda think that maybe it's not the movie that's rude and wrong headed, it's you.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Starts out funny, (however predictable), but loosing spark, half way through the movie.","Lots of sex jokes, lots of male sexist remarks, lots of dumb blond jokes. Is it funny? Reasonably funny at moments, because Gerard Butler is casted perfectly in his role as a blunt sexist pig, who has made a career out of his sexist outlook, playing the role of a relationship adviser, what have you. Unfortunately Kathy Heigl isnt really funny in her dumb blond role.Every joke is exaggerated and sometimes exaggeration works, sometimes it doesnt. I would have loved to have seen a bit more serious acting, which would have enhanced the comedy effect considerably for me personally. A better, more original storyline wouldnt have hurt either, to put it politely...Ah well, we have seen these blunt romantic comedies before, this one is best suited for teenagers, who love blunt sex jokes and male/female stereotypes.The good: blunt sex jokes, however blunt can be fun ocassionalyThe bad: blunt sex jokes is all there is to it.

Red pill romcom,"OK, it might not be totally red pill but at least it's purple. Gerard Butler demonstrates his acting range by playing a dating coach in this 2009 romcom two years after his breakthrough role as King Leonidas in 300. Nowadays he just plays the same tough guy role over and over, a bit like Liam Neeson. So he's playing a dating coach who tells the ugly truth of the title regarding the sexual dynamics between men and women. Katherine Heigl plays a post wall Karen TV producer of a failing breakfast show which hires him to spice up her show. Obviously she's completely against this but also obviously she eventually warms to Butler's masculine charms. It's all predictable stuff but it has it's moments, like the scene in the restaurant. If you absolutely have no option but to watch a romcom this one would be better than most.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

Disgusting and Degrading,"My face for the entirety of the movie honestly looked like I was going to be sick. This movie altogether is extremely uncomfortable. Nobody talks like that. I know in a lot of romcoms the girls falls for the guy who doesn't necessarily deserve a second chance but this guy shouldn't have even got a first chance, he didn't even really. The stuff that both genders say about each other are disgusting and degrading and the scene in the restaurant was just gross, was it supposed to be funny?And what even was the finale? That wasn't a resolution, and why was it in a hot air balloon? If the unfunny and crude humour wasn't enough to turn you off this movie, the fact that the plot is actually pointless should be. They can't agree on anything, I'm all for enemies to lovers but this kind of hatred isn't tension. For something to qualify as a romcom for me there has to be a scene where something falls apart and when something happens that makes me swoon (some of my favourites like 10 things I hate about you is a really good example). Well it did check one of my boxes, the entire movie fell apart before it even started, but it was rude and disgusting and nothing so much as made me smile.I honestly don't know how I made it through this movie. The fact that I got it on DVD as well, what a waste of money, and of my life.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

A Decent Adult Romantic Comedy,"'The Ugly Truth' follows the similar storypath as other romantic comedies but this one has a doze of 'adultness' to it. The adult jokes work very well and the treatment to the story is interesting. The battle of the sexes is well depicted even though at times it gets a little overshadowed by the Abby and Mike love story. Heigl acts and co-produces. Her acting is very good. She totally nails the part. Butler, however, comes across as a little uncomfortable in his role. Sadly, the rest of the cast doesn't get much scope. The refreshing Sacramento setting was something different from the usual New York setting that has been overused in romantic comedies. Music is well utilized and the camera-work is pretty decent. The most enjoyable sequences were the ones with Butler and Heigl where their characters challenge one another with their polar opposite viewpoints, trying to prove the other wrong. Overall, it's a decent adult romantic comedy.",,Anonymous,Romance
enjoyable but plays out exactly the way you'd expect,"Abby Richter is an uptight, controlling NorCal morning TV producer who's struggling with her nonexistent love life and pressure from her boss to improve the ratings on her show.

Though initially put-off by all of his risqué, over-the-top antics, finicky Abby eventually makes a deal with him after he promises to help deliver her the man of her dreams. Heigl and Butler are such an appealing and occasionally laugh-out loud funny duo that it's a real shame that the ""obvious from the word go"" script gives them no chance. A likable, but all-too-predictable battle of the sexes romantic comedy. **½",,Anonymous,Romance
Quite vulgar for a romcom,"Two great actors on board with GREAT chemistry. It could have been such a perfect enemies to lovers movie. Yet it was utterly consumed by the vulgarity of the sexual jokes, references, dialogues, even songs, with ""you spin me right round"" playing as the credits song of the film. This condition in itself deprives the movie from the romantic side of it. Even though they are a great couple and you totally ship them, in the end you're just relieved the vulgarity came to an end. The movie sells itself as a romcom and when you start watching it you also sign up for a romcom so no, we're not supposed neither to expect nor respect this extent of indecency.",,Anonymous,Romance
