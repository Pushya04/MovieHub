The Movie You Remember,"Remember that movie you saw when you were a kid, and loved it? Loved it! Best movie ever! You told all your friends about it, the great music, the cool characters, the gear cars? You talked about it for years, for decades, and then it turned up again, so you dragged your family to see a cool movie that was done right. And as you sat through it for the second time, you wondered ""What happened to the movie I saw when I was a kid? This is nothing at all like it! The lines are stupid, the music is lame and the actors are gargoyles! What happened to it?""This is that movie. It's not the movie you saw, it's the movie you remembered. It's got great music and great cars that dance, and actors who behave like Steve MacQueen, and Kevin Spacey shoots the really bad guys -- not the bank robbers, those are the heroes, but the really bad guys, and says ""I was in love once."" Edgar Wright -- whom I know from the movies he directed Simon Pegg in -- has directed a gangster-car-chase-teen-love movie that does what Justin Lin, Guy Ritchie and those other hot directors tried to do, but could not. Yeah. This is the movie you remembered.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
This is why I love movies,"I was able to watch Baby Driver during an advanced screening last week and and yes it's as amazing as the critics say it is. The way it uses the music is just so great. It's so different from all the other movies, but it isn't artsy in a way that only the critics will like it: this is a movie for everyone. I went with a friend who is really hard to please when it comes to movies, but I just knew he would love this. And I was right, I never saw him as excited about a movie as he was about this one. It's just so much fun to watch, but it's also serious when it needs to be and it has very intriguing characters. But I'll be honest, the core of the movie is its music. I think this is the second time I say it, but the music works so well. If I wasn't in the theaters I would sing with the songs. Even though it's completely different, it reminds me a bit of Fury Road in the way that it makes you want to punch your fist and the air and cheer during the movie. In reality I think it's more a mixture of La La Land and Grand Theft Auto (it's definitely not a musical by the way). Go see this movie. I don't want to overhype anyone, but I'll make a bold statement and say this is my favorite Edgar Wright movie. I'll be shocked if this doesn't appear on many 'Best of the Year' lists in December, at least I already know it'll be on mine.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Believe the hype,"Everything about the film is pretty much pitch perfect if you ask me. Lets start with the cars. I have not been a fan of Fast and Furious films, but the chase scenes in this film run circles around that series if a certain reality of the moves matters to you. This is more in line with Bullit,French Connection, and the Italian Job films as far as great chases.The music, fun, simply fun. Songs from every decade of my lifetime.Action best pure adrenaline action in years. You will be truly on the edge of your seat during much of the film.Humor, what can I say, love Edgar Wright's humor and this is his best.And oh what a cast! Loved every one of the leads performances. I think Ansel was a standout, but come on Jamie Foxx, Spacey, Hamm and the beautiful Lily James. And the other leading lady, Eiza Gonzalez, was unknown to me, but she was great with one terrific diner speech in particular. I was lucky enough to see this at an early screening in Denver. I will be seeing this in the theaters once again when it opens, and I very rarely watch movies more than once.Sometimes when I see a review fawning over a film like this, I think troll. Best way to check that out is see how many films the reviewer has reviewed and rated. I have over 4,000 rated films here. Not a lot of tens either.Best film so far this year.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Action flick with endless panache and swagger,"There is never a dull moment in this action crime film about a getaway driver who has his own unlimited getaway soundtrack but who also wants to break free from the crime boss who owns his life.There is enough style and visceral strut in this film that it neutralizes the one or two credibility gaps in the plot. Ansel Elgort is great as the title character, but Jamie Foxx steals the film with a lively performance as the loose cannon in the crew. Performances all around are solid and the dialogue is so rife with dueling wits, it's like watching a recurring display of verbal fireworks. These firecracker scenes of competitive criminals showing off their bravado are just as exciting as the chase scenes through downtown Atlanta.The film also banks heavily on a heady, omnipresent soundtrack that keeps the tempo perpetually hyperactive. A word of caution: The action can be tough going at times; the film revels in its permanent state of anarchy before ultimately developing a mean streak. But for all the blistering gunfire and screeching tires, this is not a one-note film. It has its moments of quietly boiling tension and eerie backstory flashbacks. It's a film that wears its attitude on its sleeve and doesn't shrivel into conventionality. Not an absolute bull's eye, but recommended to everyone who wants a good rush.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Technical brilliance overshadowed by poor story and characters!,"Edgar Wright deals with the technical aspects very well, be it camera work, cinematography, editing or soundtrack. But in pursuit of the style, he forgot to write good characters. There is absolutely no conviction. You don't feel for any character. Their actions are confusing (like Kevin Spacey in the end). It tells you a lot when I say that the most interesting character was an 8-year old boy with barely 3-4 minutes of screentime. The dialogues didn't help either. No one is interested in the comparison between weapons and different body parts of a pig.In short, the writing is abysmal and keeps you from enjoying what could have been a very fun watch. Perhaps they could have fed some more lines from Monsters Inc.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Perfect blend of action, comedy, and a great soundtrack!","The film stars Ansel Elgort as the titular character in deep with some undesirables from the criminal underworld. To pay them back, he must use his driving skills to help with a number of heists. During all this, he becomes smitten with a waitress (Lily James) who makes him feel like he's more than just a criminal. He then decides to try and escape his life of crime, but he soon realizes that it's much easier said than done.I must say, Edgar Wright did a fantastic job with this film. All the music fit so well in their respective scenes, combined with the great acting all around to make one of the most entertaining films I've seen in a long time.Jon Hamm, Jamie Foxx, Kevin Spacey, and Eiza Gonz√°lez did their parts well and portrayed convincing mentally unstable killers. This is the first time Wright has worked with this much star power, specifically American star power. The actors played well off of each other, especially in scenes involving comedy where they nailed the punchlines.The music was good, not all of it recognizable by the average viewer, but effective nonetheless. Supposedly Edgar Wright based the whole movie idea around the Baby Driver song by Simon & Garfunkel, which is an accomplishment all on it's own.Baby Driver was paced well, was never boring, and made me want sit back down in my seat and watch it over again.I wanted to keep this review kind of short, but I did want to give you enough information to hopefully convince you to go out and see this film if you get the chance.My suggestion: Do yourself a favor, go enjoy a night out at the movies and go see Baby Driver!Seen at a advance screening in Roseville, Minnesota.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"There's no doubt some impressive work here, some cleverly designed sequences and some tasty long takes with some lively dynamism.","However Edgar Wright is a director that seems to get more immature as opposed to maturing with his audience as his films go on.Baby Driver, a film idea that was, no doubt, pulled from a drawer of high concept, high-school ideas from Mr. Wright, has that sort of aged 90's Tarantino vibe, from the musical OTT dialogue, attention to soundtrack, and the Natural Born Killers style star-crossed main characters.
Unfortunately that makes the idea very dated and the promise of a musical car-chase movie a bit of misdirection. It's more of a 90's gangster film with a painful hipster hand guiding it, interspersed with music videos made of car chases.There's some humour, neat little ideas, satisfying and creative moments, but they're unpleasantly jammed in to a a few moulds that don't do some of the core concepts justice. Lily James is a delight but her character is shortchanged, the idea of replacing core characters for each job is nonsensical probably to get rid of actors to other commitments. And the less said about the two dimensional Darling and Kevin Spacey the better.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
The Coolest & Most Unique Film This Year,"Edgar Wright remains one of my all-time favourite directors. Why? Because each and every film he crafts reeks of originality, he takes a few similar traits, throws them together, delves down a completely unexpected route and forms something unique, something masterful. From 'Shaun of the Dead' to 'Hot Fuzz' and so on and so forth, each film feels like something you think you've witnessed before, but on a whole new level, something fresh, something alluring, packed with adrenaline... and of course, 'Baby Driver' followed suit.'Baby Driver' is an utterly engrossing caper-comedy that is (in my personal opinion) the finest film to face 2017 so far, I couldn't help but smile throughout, from the stunningly executed action scenes and stunts, through to the soundtrack (with an abundance of classic rock and soul tracks) and finally the heavily relatable characters. The lack of disappointment in Edgar Wright's work continues with this masterful film, which is ultimately also one of the coolest films of the past decade or so.Many of the heist films of recent years have been rather disappointing when it comes to both story and technical achievement, however when something like 'Baby Driver' makes an appearance, it's refreshing to know that indie films are still taking this planet by storm and shunting the blockbusters out of the limelight. To know that certain production companies still trust the creativity of a director over the monetary expectations, and by doing so, unleashing a flurry of fantastic independently ""driven"" films.I'm gonna finish with this (partially odd) statement / testimonial... when I went to sleep last night, I had odd dreams of car chases and stunt driving to rock classics, and that is thanks to this film, the fact that it stuck with me even when I wasn't fully conscious. That's how much of a damn cool film 'Baby Driver' is... just go watch it, just throw away your tickets to 'Transformers' and 'The Mummy' etc, and go see this instead.",,Anonymous,Crime
Exhilarating! Wildly entertaining!,"Exhilarating! Edgar Wright's¬†Baby Driver is an accelerated non-stop action-thriller that will have you in high-gear the entire drive time. Wildly entertaining! It offers up the best car chases, excellent characters, and displays solid writing in this subgenre of action films. During the golden age of Hollywood cinema, grand getaways, robberies, and car chase movies were a staple. Sony/Tristar, et al, demonstrate that one of the foundational plot types that provided audiences with thrills back then can be effectively resurrected today to embody the engine that drove those motion pictures and install it into a new, sleek body design to mesmerize and impress audiences of today. Certainly, Baby drives to the beat of his own mixtape in this movie, but the film itself goes further and integrates the rhythm of action into the sound design of the motion picture. Not to be left behind on the 80s throwback movies and TV shows bandwagon featuring hipsters and mixtapes, Wright crafts a summer film that rises above the all too clich√© CGI robots taking to the sky and pirates swashbuckling across the seas to remind us that little can compare to the squeal of the wheel, love, and the witty turning of phrase. In short,¬†Baby Driver is a self-aware pop-culture film but has the soul of a James Dean motion picture.Meet Baby (Elgort). Yes, that's B-A-B-Y Baby. He's the unparalleled talented getaway driver for Doc's (Spacey) Atlanta crime ring. With earbuds in place, playing classic rock or his own mixtapes, Baby drives, speeds, and maneuvers to the beat of his tunes. No police force is a match for his ability to evade his would-be captors in order to return Doc's henchman (and woman) to the secret lair. As chance would have it, Baby meets Debora (James), the girl of his dreams, at his usual diner. All that stands in his way is one more job for Doc, or so he thinks. With payment in full of his debt to Doc on the horizon, Baby seen this as his opportunity to make a clean break and to ditch his shady lifestyle of crime. But when Doc approaches Baby with yet another job, Baby must decide to whom his allegiances lie and protect those he loves.Any veteran filmmaker will tell you that it's vitally important to hook the audience within the first three to five minutes of a film. Fail to hook producers at the beginning of the screenplay, and it's file-thirteen for those 120 pages. As a director, it's encumbered upon him or her to grab hold of the audience's attention, creating the urge to want more, to know more. The first scene of¬†Baby Driver is an incredible display of excellence in writing, directing, and the technical elements of motion picture creation. The magic of this scene lies in the ability for Wright to wow the audience without leaving anyone ""out there in the dark"" (Sunset Blvd) overly stimulated or left with the feeling of utter exhaustion. The scene is perfectly stimulating. It sets the bar high for the film, and continues to keep it up there for the entire runtime. Just like the pace of Baby's driving, the pacing of the film is exquisitely handled and couldn't be better! The biggest difference between this robbery/getaway film and similar films such as¬†The Fast and the Furious is substance. In addition to the incredible cinematography and sound design paired with out of the world car chases, the film provides heart, soul, and qualitative substance that forms the foundation upon which the more superficial elements are laid.The cast couldn't have been more brilliantly selected. One of the hallmarks of an Edgar Wright film is the charismatic leads that display solid chemistry on screen. Just who are our heroes in this film? You'll just have to watch it and decide for yourself. I love it when films take the more conventional concept of heroes and villains and turns it on its head. For whomever you decide are the heroes, you'll certainly find yourself actively rooting for their survival and rooting for the villains to meet their demise in shockingly creative ways.¬†When Kevin Spacey isn't busy being the President of the United States, or more recently, an ex-President, he is the king pin of an Atlanta- based crime syndicate that stages fantastically wild robberies. And Baby is indebted to him and must reluctantly aid and abet as the best getaway driver ever to hit the screens in recent years-- think a modern-day James Dean. Jaime Foxx plays the veteran head henchman extremely well and adds his own repulsive, yet comedic charm to his role. It would have been far too easy to play off Spacey and Foxx's conventional talents to steel focus away from the central plot, but Wright strikes a perfect balance between his leads and the story. Elgort and Spacey's on-screen chemistry was crafted with strategic precision in order to quickly solidify the frien-emy relationship between the two characters. With Elgot increasing in popularity, Wright could have deflated to playing up the attractive bad boy tropes but instead allows Elgot's Baby to develop organically throughout the film.If you are seeking a summer film that clearly demonstrates a movie in which all the creative elements work seamlessly together in the manner in which they were respectively intended, then don't miss¬†Baby Driver while it's in theatres. The energy you will feel in this film is nearly unparalleled by any in recent times, and that's because both the major and minor components work together like a well-oiled machine. You will be at full throttle as you are instantly transported from your auditorium seat to the passenger seat in Baby's car.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Good performances,"A very well choreographed film. Right from the driving sequences, the dance & music moves, the complete score of the film to even the sign language conversations between Baby and Joseph.Absolutely loved the editing - sleek and clean. I can imagine the efforts needed to shoot the complete the film by calculating the amount of individual shots taken in the film.3/4th of the film is quite interesting, felt quite a drag towards the end.

Fun Car-Chase Thriller Action Drama,"A brisk action thriller that includes fast cars, guns, and a good selection of music.Though I enjoyed the scenes, the movie is forgettable and presents nothing new to the table. It's a fun movie, yes, but feels like a pulp fiction of the genre. The storyline is shallower than a kiddie swimming pool.3/5. Average and forgettable. The movie does keep a good pace, but that's not enough to save it.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Little more than a mix tape with dull characters and clich√©s attached to it,"I read an early tweet that described Baby Driver as 'a mix-tape with a film attached to it' and that proved to be an accurate comment. The tweeter may have thought this was a good thing, but I certainly don't.Yes, there are some good tracks and the action sequences are elaborate and frenetic (a little too frenetic, actually), but the characters are dull, unlikeable and bear very little relation to the real world. I simply did not believe in them, especially Darling, the sassy, kick ass stock character that only a fool would consider to be a strong female character.Then there's Baby, whose laconic, boyish demeanour makes him a rather uninspiring protagonist. His romance with Debbie, a cute little waitress, is yawn-inducingly clich√©d, too.If you want a stylish heist film that isn't so bloody try-hard, then watch Drive. It's an exercise of style over substance much like this film, but it has suspense, atmosphere and characters that could actually exist rather than blaring music, mind-numbing action and flat, hateful comic book characters.",,Anonymous,Crime
One Killer Track,"Edgar Wright's newest film captures everything you can possibly love about going to the movies. It's filled with wonderful characters, great car chases, enough style for a dozen cool flicks, and yes, a soundtrack that is better than sex. While using a familiar story template (the Driver & Drive), Wright completely makes it his own, infusing it with his love for music and his film geekiness. Wright has a perfect filmography at this point and definitely deserves to be ranked as one of the finest directors of the past 20 years. This may be his best movie yet.The cast is note perfect, the only downside is that Jon Bernthal's role is almost more of a cameo (considering the top billing). Ansel Elgort is wonderful as Baby, bringing an instant likability and purity to the character. The supporting cast is equally great with Jon Hamm, Jamie Foxx, and Eiza Gonzalez as the standouts. The scenes between all three of them contain the most electricity and tension.The car chases are brilliantly shot, eschewing the dull over-the-top silliness of the Fast & Furious franchise for something much more grounded and much more exciting. The lack of special effects keeps up the tension with actual stunt driving, continuing the good trend of recent actions films going back to doing things for real, showing an understanding of the genre.Usually, I try to not let myself get too hyped about a new film coming out, but this is the exception. I can't remember the last time I had this much pure fun at the movies and all of you need to see it. I was lucky enough to get into an advanced screening and I almost regret it: waiting two months before I can see it again is unbearable torture.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"freaking brilliant, doesn't slow down or miss a beat","Thanks to student edge i was given the chance to see the film early, having seen amazing reviews from its screening at SXSW, i went in with incredibly high expectations. Coming out, those expectations still managed to be exceeded.Edgar Wright directed the sh1t out of this movie. Everything is filmed beautifully, especially the incredible action scenes and one- takes. The acting is superb, the film balanced out the drama and comedic elements extremely well, and the plot was immensely well developed and entertaining, the characters are rich and engrossing, with the chemistry between Ansel Elgort and Lily James being the stand out part of this film for me, lastly i was very skeptical at the beginning of the film regarding the dominating presence of the soundtrack throughout the movie, but the killer soundtrack was fun, lively and bloody joyful, and blended into the plot seamlessly , it became its own character in the film and definitely brought a smile to my face.Go into this movie knowing as little as you can, this is an experience like no other.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Great music that some how grooves well with Action sequence,"I somehow felt love and hate sort of feeling for Baby Driver. The movie started off on nice note but then somehow slows down and eventually picks up too much pace in second half. It's pretty hard to keep the interest alive all the time. I really loved the song selection and even noticed me nodding to few beats as well. The car action sequence were well shot too. But then the second half of the movie was so fast that it feels like they just wanted to end this but still wanted to keep it alive. Don't think if there was any need of few gruesome sequences.The story had so much potential and having some good cast along, it could have gone to great heights. But it disappoints in this area and turns out to be just another mindless action drama for light viewing.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
The coolest movie in cool movies history.,"This is actually my first review on here. I had the chance to see this movie as an advanced screening at my university. I now feel obligated to let fellow movie afficionados know that this movie is simply freaking awesome. I love good music and cars (especially Subarus like the one from the trailer) and that alone was a good enough reason for me to go watch this movie. I was not disappointed.I find Edgar Wright's movies entertaining. However, this movie was a step above that. Take La La Land, combine it with heist & Fast & Furious elements to it and you have Baby Driver. The casting was great. Jamie Foxx and Kevin Spacey have similar roles to the ones in Horrible Bosses, but that does not make it any less fun. The cinematography is exceptional and the plot is intriguing and unpredictable. The camera work in one of the opening scenes reminded me of Birdman, which is a Best Picture Academy Award winner, so this movie is definitely executed in a stylish manner, and has a great attention to detail. The soundtrack is picked to perfection and the dialogue is the wittiest, funniest one I have seen in a movie in a long time.I only see two cons for the movie. One: some of the action sequences did seem a little unbelievable, so if you want a completely realistic movie, you might want to trade some of that for the entertaining factor. Two: it was an advanced screening and the movie only comes out in 2 months... and I already want to watch it again. I rarely rate movies 10/10 but it was the most fun I've had in a theater and that certainly deserves my rating.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Noisy action, impressive car chases, violence and romance in a good film by Edgar Wright.","As Baby (Ansel Elgort) was a child, a car accident killed his parents and left him with tinnitus (continuous humming sounds in the ears), which he blocks out by listening to music on iPod. Baby lived a troubled life and it is revealed that he once tried to steal a car which was, unknown to him, owned by criminal mastermind ""Doc"" (Kevin Spacey). With a particular job in mind, Doc assembles his team made up of nasty criminals (Jamie Foxx, Jon Hamm, Eiza Gonz√°lez ,Micah Howard) .

Every road out takes him right back in !. This year, volume up, pedal down !. This summer, the only way to get out is to getaway !.A film by Edgar Wright, an English director who has become a favorite of many action comedy enthusiasts for his work with Simon Pegg in the Cornetto trilogy. After paying homage to zombie movies, 80s police movies, and paranoid science fiction, respectively, this time, without Simon Pegg, he updates the cinematographic language of the old robbery and chase movies, such as: Bullitt by Peter Yates, Driver by Walter Hill, Thief by Michael Mann, but adding drops of humor, sympathy, and an attractive love story. The film won the audience award at the South By Southwest Festival and its premiere in the USA was a surprising success in the country. Considering that this is not a superhero film or a blockbuster, the film was also nominated for the 2018 Oscar for best editing, sound mixing and sound editing.The cast is led by Ansel Egort, who rose to fame for his leading role in the adaptation of John Green's best-selling young adult novel The Fault in Our Stars, and later starred in none other than Speielberg's recent remake of West Side Story. He is joined by the sweet and farcically beautiful Lily James (Cinderella), John Hamm (Mad Man series), Jamie Foxx (Django Unchained), Kevin Spacey (House of Cards series), Jon Bernthal (Walking Dead series), Eiza Gonz√°lez, Flea Micah Howard among others.There's a moving and catching musical score by Steven Price, including wonderful songs. As well as brilliant and colorful cinematography by Bill Pope. This is an acclaimed and notorious film from director Edgar Wright who delivers the goods with skillness and aplomb enough . Edgar often uses ordinary trademarks: Deadpan humor in fast-paced moments; a recurring gag where a fence jump goes wrong; pivotal scenes that take place in a bar or pubs, his characters often share his love of action movies; musicand video games; action synchronized to music that is playing; frequent and effective use of foreshadowing; fast paced and heavily stylized action scenes and has included multiple references on his work to James Bond. Edgar is an English filmmaker , screenwriter, producer, and actor . He is best known for his comedic Three Flavours Cornetto film trilogy consisting of Shaun of the Dead (2004), Hot Fuzz (2007), and The World's End (2013), made with recurrent collaborators Simon Pegg, Nira Park and Nick Frost. He also collaborated with them as the director of the television series Spaced and his last hit was : Last Night in Soho (2023). Rating: 7/10 . Better than average . Worthwhile watching.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Was expecting more,"I went in this movie not knowing anything about it other than the fact that it was probably going to be a bank robbery type of movie. Now it had that, but it was simplified. The action scenes had a comedic aspect to them that just didn't feel right to me along with a lot of action happening behind closed doors. It does make sense since he is a driver and can't see what's going on, but there was one scene where the camera purposefully gets out of the way so we can't see. It really takes out the suspense in everything, which would've added a whole lot more to the movie.This movie could've been so much more had they not gone the comedic route. Unfortunately though, nothing was believable because of that. You have cops coming out of nowhere and action scenes that are unrealistic. I guess a big mistake of mine is comparing it to the movie Heat, because that's what I was expecting from what little I knew. It was still a decent movie with an interesting story, but it falls short because it resorted to comedy for the action sequences. If you go in not expecting Heat or A Dog Day Afternoon, you may enjoy it slightly more than me.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
A summer film so cool that air-con is optional.,"There's something inherently appealing about the concept of a getaway driver.¬† A skillful 'bad-boy', but not normally bad enough to actually DO the nasty crime stuff¬Ö. merely be an active accomplice to it.¬† As a result, it's a subject that the movies have returned to time after time.¬† I'm old and crusty enough to remember being wowed at seeing Ryan O'Neal in Walter Hill's ""Driver"" on the big screen in 1978. And well before that, as a kid, my poor departed mother used to be driven crazy by me begging her to take me to see ""The Italian Job"" (the original 1969 version) YET again¬Ö probably the greatest getaway chase in movie history: I must have seen that film at least 20 times in the cinema. Of course more recently we've also had Ryan Gosling and Carey Mulligan in ""Drive"" on the same theme.But with Edgar Wright at the helm, a big name cast and an enticing trailer, I had high expectations for ""Baby Driver"" ‚Äì and boy was I happy! This is such a seriously cool film on so many levels.Opening with a bank heist followed by a kick-ass car chase, we follow 'Baby' (Ansel Elgort, ""Allegiant"", ""The Fault in our Stars"") as a tinnitus-suffering, music-infused getaway driver under the thumb of the criminal overlord Doc (Kevin Spacey, in icy Frank Underwood mode). Doc recruits an ever-changing mix-tape of villains for each job, including the psychopathic and appropriately named 'Bats' (Jamie Foxx, ""Sleepless""), the chillingly dangerous Buddy (Jon Hamm, ""Mad Men"", ""Keeping Up With The Joneses"") and his ""Bonnie-style"" wife 'Darling' (Eiza Gonz√°lez) and the moderately incompetent JD (Lanny Joon) (who changed his neck tattoo of ""HATE"" to ""HAT"" since it improved his job prospects¬Ö. ""everybody loves a hat""!).Baby's life gets more complicated when the hoods become aware of his fledgling relationship with fellow-orphan Debora (Lily James) a waitress in a diner and another lever to keep Baby locked into the job that he is just so, so good at.On the surface this might be perceived as being just another good excuse for a lot of CGI-driven car stunts in the style of ""The Fate of the Furious"". But no. Firstly, as Edgar Wright declared before the special screening I saw, all of the car stunts were actually performed for real on the mean streets of Atlanta (and hats off to the film's stunt coordinator Robert Nagle and his team for these).¬† And secondly, the car scenes are almost secondary to the fabulous story and character development in the film. The script (also by Edgar Wright) is just brilliant. There are genuinely laugh-out loud moments in the movie, with one of the highlights for me being JD tasked with procuring Michael Myers ""Halloween"" masks for a heist. If you don't find this scene hilarious, you are not human ‚Äì official.Elgort is really strong in the lead role, and suggested to me that if the role of the young Han Solo in the upcoming Star Wars spin-off hadn't already gone to Alden Ehrenreich, then here was a very strong contender.¬† All of the supporting roles are strong (as you would expect from such a stellar cast) with Jon Hamm being a standout, appearing truly demonic in the closing scenes. ¬†The one role I was less sure about in the film was that of Lily James, whose performance as the 'sweet as apple pie' waitress seemed a little too ""animated"" for the big screen in the early scenes - I remember an acting class by Michael Caine where he advised that given the size of the movie screen 'stillness was good' sometimes. What works well on the small screen (I am a big fan of her roles in historical TV dramas like ""Downton Abbey"" and the impeccable ""War and Peace"") perhaps sometimes needs modifying for the wide-screen experience. I greatly warmed to her portrayal in the action sequences later on though: she's a great actress and one that this film can hopefully now propel into the higher echelons in Hollywood.Another star of the film is the fabulous soundtrack coordinated by Oscar-winner Steven Price (""Gravity"") featuring (amongst many other classics) Queen's ""Brighton Rock"", Golden Earring's ""Radar Love"", the Simon and Garfunkel classic (obviously) and Bob & Earl's ""Harlem Shuffle"", all used to brilliant effect.¬† This latter track leads me on to some early Oscar predictions:¬† if this film doesn't get nominated this year for Oscars for Best Editing (Jonathan Amos and Paul Machliss, ""Scott Pilgrim vs the World"") and Best Sound Editing (Julian Slater), then there is no God! The ""Harlem Shuffle"" coffee run sequence is a masterclass in editing and direction.¬† Starting off with what I thought might turn into a tribute to ""Saturday Night Fever"", the scene neatly takes on a style all of its own.

Well Executed but Boring,"The execution and quality of the film making was great, but overall I quickly got bored watching this movie as none of the character's motivations seemed realistic or made sense to me. The action sequences were great, but didn't do anything especially unique or carry any suspenseful weight with the plot that I found myself yawning during much of it. Perhaps it needed more shocking gore.The movie seemed to be a bit confused in its tone, mixing stylized violence with comedy and serious heist elements. It was set in a realistic world, but the characters and their motivations were not. It felt like it was trying to rekindle the essence of a Tarantino cool bad guy heist film like Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, but missed the mark. I found myself not believing the heist scenarios enough or having enough of a stake in them. It needed a stronger overall macguffin.The use of Music was unique, but I would've have got more out of it if more obscure music was used, like what the GTA video game series does curating amazing forgotten B-side gems from famous artists.I felt like Jamie Foxx's acting talent was a bit wasted, and the bland Atlanta backdrop seemed like a production budget restraint. I wonder what city was written in the original script? I doubt anyone writes for Atlanta. Rather than transporting us to a cool city that feels lived in and feels like a real location, this just felt like a boring block of downtown brick buildings to shoot car chases and shootouts in.I love most of Edgar Wright's other films, so I'm not sure why this was so boring for me. It just didn't do anything new for me and will probably be forgotten from my film memory years from now.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Way over-hyped! Not a great or even good movie.,"Everyone's gushing about how the music matched a few scenes and I mean like.... Yeah? Welcome to movies, where sound is designed to match the scenes.There wasn't anything amazing.Bad acting from the main character. Bad writing as well, he makes a lot of stupid decisions which I suppose are the reason the story exists. Lazy and unrealistic writing. No chemistry between him and his ""love"" who are in love and run away after a date which entails going for dinner and then ending.This girl must be lonely as hell despite being a good looking waitress. She wants to leave her job and her friends behind for a man she doesn't know at all, except that he's friends with some criminal elements... And she's like hell yeah lets do this!OH and I assume she remains celibate for 5 years for him at a point.Again... They have had one date and barely any conversation, and no nookie.Just a lot of terrible writing in this like that which bothered me. The action and music scenes were okay. You can find much better looking at any top-lists.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
Wow Wow...wow,"(Originally posted from confessionsofasavagemind.blogspot.com)The summer blockbuster season has become somewhat of a bore for me. The major films released this summer have been generic, bland, and unexciting as they can be. To prove my point, the fifth Transformers film was just released to audiences' and critics' dismay everywhere. During the summer, I rarely even find myself at the theater due to the little variety of choice and depth of whatever hundred million dollar tentpole film is currently plaguing every theater around me. I had even stopped watching movies almost entirely due to this fatigue. I am happy to say that Baby Driver is the film that rejuvenated my love for movies.Preemptively, I will tell you that I will give you no plot description of the film. I knew next to nothing about the film besides the fact it was a heist film. I highly recommend going into the theater with a blind eye to reading or looking up anything about the film besides the showtimes. (Yes, that means no trailers too!) I cannot possibly describe this film. Yes, it is a basic crime and heist film. However, it breaks so many genre conventions that it is unacceptable to disrespectful tot he film to refine it to one genre. The best comparison I could give is if Heat, Bonnie and Clyde, An American in Paris, Reservoir Dogs, and Drive had a cinematic orgy and produced this child. The film is so fast-paced that you can hardly breathe. The suspension of disbelief, or how much you actually believe the story that is taking place on the screen, is flawless within the film. I came into the theater with about a million and a half different thoughts running through my head, and every one of them was silenced when the lights were dimmed. In all of the quick action on the screen, the film makes time for a real heart and story in its pseudo-musical style. This is executed by some of the sharpest and effortless editing and cinematography that this film critic has ever seen.The casting in Baby Driver was absolutely divine. I cannot think of one character or actor who was misplaced or a weak link within the film. Writer-Director Edgar Wright delivers the sharpest dialogue and story of his illustrious career. That is saying something incredibly large coming from the director of Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, and The World's End. Wright cements himself as one of the best minds in cinema. I mourn for his version of Ant-Man that Marvel canned after the studio would not allow him the creative control he was used to. Wright has been working on Baby Driver as an entire project since 1995, aka the entirety of my life. To see his uncompromised vision come to the screen as a real joy. It is also a real message to producers to stay the hell out of visionary directors' way (I'm looking at you, Disney) Edgar Wright can not only direct any genre but spawn entirely new ones as he does with this movie.There are very rare occasions where a film can take me from cinematic nihilism to enjoying the true art that goes into these incredible pictures. I haven't felt a true joy from a film till the two or three times I saw La La Land. There are absolutely no faults with this film. It wins not only a perfect score from me but the (tenative) rank of the best film of the year.Score: (10/10)",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Edgar Wright in Master Class form,"When it comes to the art, there are few filmmakers who create and perfect their own signature brand. Tarantino, Scorsese, Kuebrick and many others all share distinct characteristics that make there films recognizable to those serious about cinema. The men listed above are all Master Class in my opinion and dare I say Edgar Wright is on his way to joining them?SummaryBaby Driver follows a young man who goes by the name ""Baby"" (Elgort) who is what the title suggests, a Driver and a damn good one. His talents led him to becoming the prized getaway driver for a group of criminals. With his heart not aligned with the lifestyle and actions of his co workers he seeks a new start, especially after becoming interested in a girl. It is until he finds himself ready to abandon the life he finds out how intertwined he really is.ReviewPros Referencing back to the intro, the first 6 minutes of this film shows why Wright is in a class only a few are in. The scene uses its soundtrack to act as choreography, every snare hit and kick means something and are perfectly timed to the world our characters are in. We the audience soon realize that music is more than just a soundtrack in this film, but provides an arc for our characters, especially Baby. We learn a lot about him based solely off of the music being played, which is unlike anything I have seen at this level. We then proceed to a long tracking shot of Baby navigating to a coffee shop, which in my opinion is one of the most beautiful shots of 2017. I never thought Watching someone get coffee would be this entertaining. Wright does a good job from the start of putting us into this kids world while simultaneously showing us why he doesn't belong in it. The casting choices were all good and added different elements to the story. Baby was the only one tied to music physically through his iPod, but each character was choreographed as if they were listening too. The action was shot really well especially the getaway scenes, both on foot and in the car. The car chase scenes are pure brilliance making The Fast and The Furious movies look 2nd tier. Edgar truly kept me engaged and I never felt cheated in any scene.ConsMuch of the film focused on visuals to the point where I felt some characters were a tad bit flat. Subtracting Baby and Doc (Kevin Spacy), I felt the others could have had a little more substance. Some of their decisions and actions felt somewhat robotic in my opinion. With that being said Buddy (Hamm) and Batts (Foxx) did shine in a couple of scenes due to them being quality actors. With this being said please understand that even this didn't ruin this movie due to them still being entertaining characters.Lastly the only other minor issue I had was the romance. Although there was nothing wrong with the acting or chemistry between the characters, it was just a little difficult to believe or get invested in.Conclusion/GradeWhat makes Baby Driver great is that it is a unique experience and is visually stunning. Edgar Wright does a great job of blending action, suspense, romance and comedy making it one of the most enjoyable films of 2017.8.1/10",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Am I missing something?,"I don't consider myself a movie expert or anything but I'd like to think I know a good movie when I see one, even if it's not exactly my cup of tea. Baby Driver was actually supposed to be. It had the potential to be a decent action movie but I was suspicious from the moment I saw it had 8.3 on here. I mean, what could have they done with this movie to deserve such a high rating? So, just in case, I lowered my expectations and, somehow, I still managed to be disappointed. Is it possible I am not seeing the originality and perfection of this movie that everyone keeps talking about?Let's go over the good parts first. The soundtrack, of course. I was very pleased with the song choices and that alone has salvaged this movie from a tempting lower rating than 6/10. Then, the action. One could argue that is seemed forced in some cases, which is true, but overall, I can appreciate the bad-ass driving scenes and the well executed violent confrontations.Now it's time for the cons. To begin with, I feel like this had the potential to be a great story and somehow it got boring before it even began. The relationship between Elgort's (Baby) and Spacey's (Doc) characters could have given some wind to the wings of this movie. Baby's past could have done the same. I swear, there are so many things which could have been used to make some sense out of the story and out of the characters, but they just didn't elaborate on anything well enough to interest the viewers. It's like they wanted this movie to be so many different things that they ended up with a little bit of everything which amounted to nothing much when put together. Onto the girl. I just don't find her character believable nor do I see any relevance of having her in the movie other that to slow down the pace of it. I could go on about all the things which were ridiculous about this love story, but then again, maybe I'm just too cynical to understand it. Next stop, Spacey and Foxx. Come. On. Guys. I adore both of them and I was hoping for either of them to be the highlight of this movie. They were not. It felt like Specey couldn't be bothered to deliver a good performance. I was half expecting him to keyser soze his way out of it and turn the whole thing around and there was even a perfect moment to do so. And then nothing. Foxx didn't do a bad job but this character of his was already used in Horrible bosses so I can't give him much credit for it.The list really could go on for much longer. I don't expect movies like this to have relatable characters nor a reality based storyline, but I do expect a level of consistency, which is something this movie is lacking big time. I enjoy when a movie has more than one thing to offer but this whole ""love story from a musical on one side and a serious, violent heist on the other"", is just not working in a way I find interesting.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"A brilliant display of music, editing, and action","Director Edgar Wright did not fail to meet expectations. In fact, he exceeded them to deliver a wonderfully soundtracked, very enjoyable film, well rounded with action and comedy.The film Baby Driver follows the story of Baby (Elgort), a robbery getaway driver who listens to music to drown out the ringing in his ears. He meets and falls in love with a diner waitress (James). Despite the couple's wish to leave the world of unenjoyable jobs behind them as they drive off to nowhere in particular, Baby's life of crime doesn't let him to do so as his boss (Spacey) and the muscle (Hamm, Foxx) continue to put him in difficult situations. The film is full of stunning car chase scenes, foot- tapping and head-bobbing soundtracks, and spectacular editing work.The acting is praise-worthy, especially with an all-star cast. Ansel Elgort plays Baby wonderfully, fully embodying the character and drawing the audience's attention. Kevin Spacey plays Doc and gives a good supporting performance as the callous mastermind behind each big heist. Hamm and Foxx play the callous and ruthless robbers and undoubtedly succeed in giving Baby a hard time. Lily James also gives a great breakout performance in the film.ON TO THE EDITING. Edgar Wright's past works (Hot Fuzz, Shaun of the Dead, etc) all show his action/comedic genius with on-point sound editing and scene cuts. Personally, I believe Baby Driver may be Wright's best work because the intense, fast paced driving action allows for quick cuts that align with the rhythm and beat of whatever great song is playing on Baby's iPod. Even the characters interact with the music -- whether it is a character mimicking the loud blast of a grenade, cocking a shotgun, playing a make-shift piano, or shifting the car into reverse -- each interaction is a perfect note that makes the audience enjoy the film and song that much more. Overall, I believe Wright managed to succeed in what he sought out to achieve -- a comedic action film that is unique in film and sound editing.In my opinion, Baby Driver is a highly recommended movie that will be sure to attract and appeal to a large audience. Wright makes the viewer appreciate editing, so take note and enjoy the brilliance and the fun.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
The Best of Edgar Wright,"Immediately after seeing this movie the first thing I said was ""this is my second favorite Wright movie"". However after letting it sink in for a day, I now realize how much craft, technique and talent this movie took to pull off.As for craft, the editing in this film is clean, seamless and more than impressive. Unlike many quick cut action sequences, these feel continuous and you can actually map out the locations in your head, the audience is able to see the entirety of the stunts (which are all done practically). The gimmick of ""the movie is set to music"" does not feel forced at all, nor does it feel like a gimmick. This film uses music both as emotional weight, a soundtrack and as a story telling device, the soundtrack is beyond phenomenal. In terms of talent, the culmination of talent between director, actor, editor, stuntman, and musician is unparalleled. Ansel Elgort stands out in this role, after being confined to teen dramas, this is a breakout role for him. He brings a silent intensity to the role which perfectly contrasts the vibrant and absurdness of the world around him. Wright of course delivers in every way, his direction solidifies every aspect of this film.Bottom line: this is a movie for everyone, everyone will find something to enjoy in this movie. The audience in the theater was the most responsive, alive and invested audience I have ever been a part of. They winced at painful moments, cried at the romance and of course the comedic aspects of the film had everyone in stitches. This is the best film Wright has made, the Cornetto trilogy and Scott Pilgrim seem to be steps leading to this action packed, fun filled masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Messy Genre with Moralist Conclusion,"""Baby Driver"" is a sort of ""Drive"" wannabe with the story of an intriguing runaway driver However the messy genre of action, romance, crime, music, drama and comedy associated to an awfully moralist conclusion spoil what could have been a cult-movie. The music score is sensational; Ansel Elgort and Lily James show great chemistry and perform charismatic characters. But the unfortunately story is not good and the characters are confused and not well developed, especially Doc. In the hands of Quentin Quarentino, this storyline could have been great with better screenplay and direction.

"A film so in love with itself, it needs its own cinema seat","""Baby Driver"" is showy, clich√©-ridden and irritatingly self-aware. It's like that yappy drama society kid at college who is so consciously trying to act cool by breaking into song, dancing around chairs, drumming on desks and spitting jokey one-liners with a hand pistol flourish....the kind of person a cynical SOB like me just wants to punch in the throat.The central premise is about a young, good-at-heart kid forced into a life of crime in order to pay off a debt. The annoyingly slick, Abercrombie-faced ""Baby"" is not only the fastest getaway driver in Atlanta, we later find out he's also a self-taught music producer, dancer and talented free-runner...are you rolling your eyes yet?The main mechanic, so lauded by critics, is that everything in the film revolves around music, from the editing to the dialogue. Since Baby is constantly plugged into his i-pod (so, we are told, to drown out tinnitus from a car accident which killed his parents), the film essentially plays like one giant music video, with nearly every gunshot, tire screech and sassy put down edited meticulously with the beats or riffs of whatever track is playing during the sequence.Unfortunately the songs didn't make the hackneyed screenplay that much more interesting. While there are some splendid car chase sequences (too few in my book), one must endure cringey moments of Baby miming and dancing to James Brown, dull characters waxing poetic about song lyrics and saying clich√© bull$hit like ""Sometimes all I want to do is head west on the 20 in a car I can't afford with a plan I don't have"". Everyone in the film is pretty, none of the gangsters really look like gangsters, least of all the Latina 'Darling', who can't even hold a gun convincingly and is just there to show cleavage and lick her lips at camera.Imagine the most indulgent ideas from Guy Ritchie and Tarantino's trash bin channeled through a Justin Bieber video. Less style and even less substance.There are no doubt people who will love it for being a showy piece of nonsense, and there is some entertaining, high impact action, but it's far from the genius some critics are praising it as. I saw it with a group of youngish people who all agreed it wasn't as good as they'd hoped and that some bits were just plain daft.Leave your brain at home and perhaps you'll be rewarded...",5.0,Anonymous,Crime

Baby Driver is one of the best of 2017. It's musically-synced story to car chases are perfection,"Let's talk about Edgar Wright. He is clearly a fan of the movies, given how much he references them in his own work. Heck, his Cornetto trilogy films (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, and The World's End) are love letters to various genres while telling good stories about friendships. But his work has come of the best editing that I've seen. Not only is he good at creating speed and pace, but his use of sound (and not just music, but little sound effects) makes his work rewatchable just so that you can catch every little joke he threw in.Baby Driver continues his plight to pay tribute to his favorite American movies. In the case of driving movies like Smokey and the Bandit and thief movies like Heat and Reservoir Dogs, their legacy is felt, along with more hits as a comedy. This also happens to be Edgar Wright's first American movie, so you could tell he wanted to make something that would please his fans and a mainstream audience, likely hoping that this will lead to bigger things. I for one have been excited to see Baby Driver and how entertaining it could be as a car movie.Getaway driver ""Baby"" (played by Ansel Elgort) works for criminal mastermind Doc (played by Kevin Spacy) as the best driver for bank robbers in Atlanta. Baby seems to get himself in the mindset by constantly playing music, depending on his mood and situation. This extends to his home life where he cares for his foster father, but also mixes his recorded conversations into songs. His recent mission with robbers ""Buddy"" (played by Jon Hamm), ""Griff"" (played by Jon Bernthal) and ""Darling"" (played by Eliza Gonz√°lez), gets him closer to settling whatever debt he has with Doc.Baby seems to be finding some new happiness with waitress Debora (played by Lilly James) who has a similar interest in music. To top it off, after performing a mission with ""Bats"" (played by Jamie Foxx), Baby thinks that his life of crime is finally over. Doc quickly visits him to tell him that is far from the truth. Baby agrees to be the getaway driver for a mission involving the US Postal service before secretly escaping with Debora. Like any good movie, several things go wrong and it's now a chase for Baby to escape his fellow robbers and the police.Baby Driver is exactly what I think about when I define ""cinematic fun"". Like a lot of Edgar Wright's previous movies, it's all orchestrated in musical perfection. While this is not a musical, the constant songs are almost like a character in the movie, giving us a reminder how music can make or break a film. The first five minutes perfectly set up the comedic, but badass tone with the use of ""Bellbottoms"" by the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion. The movie keeps up it's fast pace throughout the hour and fifty minute runtime. Think of this as a modern day American Graffiti if it had bank robbers.The casting is a rare complete perfection. I cannot think of one person that was not right for the part. Ansel Elgort is very likable and charming as the young driver. He manages to carry the weight of this character's ear problem that makes him listen to his music (which I didn't mention before, but didn't want to spoil too much of). Performances from Kevin Spacy, Jamie Fox and Lilly James are good, though my favorite was of Jon Hamm for reasons that I can't give away without spoiling. Let's just say that the role of the main villain is not who you think.You may be surprised to learn that while there are a lot of car chases, a majority of the action does not happen till the second half. The first takes a great deal of time getting to know our characters, and the relationship that happens between Baby and Debora. If I had to make any criticism of some sort, I wish that Lilly James would have been given a little more to do, even though they make her a good ""damsel in distress"" type for the purpose of the story. Aside from that, I can guarantee that Baby Driver is already on my future list of favorite movies of 2017.I'll give this ten classic IPods out of ten. I have a hard time imagining that anyone will hate Baby Driver. It's very entertaining that's timed to perfection, like our story's bank robbers. I can only say to get in the car and see this¬Öin the theater. We need more original content like this.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Different, but entertaining","The movie was very entertaining and kept you engaged. Although the ideas behind the characters were interesting, most of them turned out flat with little or no development. The dialogue at times was cheesy and a bit forced and the plot was barely interesting enough, but I can forgive all of its flaws because the whole point of the movie is the driving and music. The action and driving scenes are amazing and well thought out. They keep you on the edge of your seat. The soundtrack is perfectly timed with the action and the music itself is awesome as well. Although the characters left you wanting more, the action was intense and made up for the lack of depth in other areas of the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"""Baby Driver"" delivers, even if it doesn't quite make a clean getaway.","I am someone who has enjoyed Edgar Wright's work immensely. In fact, Hot Fuzz is one of my all-time favorite comedies. So obviously, I went to this movie with high expectations, knowing how much he can deliver a good time at the movies. After seeing it, I can say he most certainly did, although some things did drag it down from it standing toe-to-toe with his best.First, the positives: the music direction is phenomenal. Nearly all the soundtrack utilizes a vast selection of music from the past 50 years, and it's clever in how it doesn't use super-overplayed songs (with a few intentional exceptions) and instead uses music most people have never heard before. This does a wonderful job of emphasizing Baby's encyclopedic love for music. How the film cuts with the music is truly a work of art. Each chase scene felt like a exciting, but focused rush I usually don't see in summer blockbusters.The main character, Baby, has a backstory and arc that feels completely natural. His decisions throughout the film make sense relative to his situation, and Ansel Elgort does a great job portraying both social awkwardness and focused training. Most of the other characters are funny as well. Although I do feel like they could have fleshed out some of them more, most of them do get the job done. It is a bit disappointing, however, considering that even some superhero films this year did a better job with building their characters. Jamie Foxx does a stand-out performance which bought out most of the laughs for me.Now for some drawbacks: the love interest fell completely flat for me. While Lily James' performance is solid, the material feels, well, a bit lacking. I felt they needed to better justify her and Baby's strong emotional bond. Since that spark isn't quite there, I ended up questioning why she played along with the events of the movie. That reason isn't quite given and it is distracting. Also, while the music is great, there are brief moments where they use a more traditional film score. If they wanted to show this bond Baby had with music, they should have completely immersed us in his ears, which they do, but in a couple scenes I felt as though they forgot or phoned it in. Silence can sometimes be as powerful as score, especially when it contrasts.Despite some gripes, I do think Wright has made another solid addition to his short, but impressive, library of work. I do recommend you see this one in the theater if you get the chance, because we all know the last thing we need is another Edgar Wright film to bomb at the box office.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Baby needs changing,"So wanted to like this. I'm a massive fan of Wright's previous work and he can make good films that don't star Pegg and Frost (see Scott Pilgrim) but Baby Driver just didn't work for me. I think it has to do with expectations. Baby Driver just doesn't have the winning goofiness of Wright's other work and just came over as loud and obnoxious. The characters, bar Baby and Debora are totally unlikable and the 'music' concept is stretched way too thin. Wright seems to abandon it too as the film devolves into a shouty, sweary, shooty denouement that we've seen a million times before. I can't understand the critical praise heaped on this film. I think it has maybe presented something of a palette cleanser for critics who've been CGI'd to death this summer, but personally I was really disappointed.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Wright Delivers Another Winner,"Wow. Baby Driver might just be the best film director Edgar Wright has ever crafted. An exhilarating ride, Baby Driver serves as a showcase for Wright to combine everything he's learned in the director's chair up to this point, from quick-witted humor to high-octane action sequences and everything in between. Over twenty years in the making, from the first frame to the last, Wright's film fires on all cylinders in a glorious exercise of style.The film follows Baby (Ansel Elgort), a young getaway driver with tinnitus who constantly plays music to drown out the sound. To be fair, I wasn't quite sold on the film when I first heard about it. While I was intrigued by the premise, I didn't know quite how Wright would pull it off. But after the fantastic Three Flavors Cornetto trilogy and the criminally underrated Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, Wright has knocked it out of the park for a fifth straight time, something I should have never doubted was possible. While I've heard other compare the film to 2011's Drive (but funnier) or 2016's La La Land (but with car chases), I actually think they're doing the film a disservice. Only Wright, a unique talent who continues to solidify himself as one of today's best directors, could have conceived of the spectacle featured in the film.Gone are the quirky British settings of Wright's previous films, with the whole of Baby Driver set in Atlanta. While I was a bit skeptical about this change, seeing as how a major part of my love for the films of the Three Flavors Cornetto trilogy had been their setting in England, Wright immediately sets the tone from the get-go, opening with a thrilling bank robbery sequence that includes a well-executed long take. The pressure just builds from there, as Wright crafts chases and shootouts with technical flair and superb skill. Bill Pope, who previously collaborated with Wright on The World's End and Scott Pilgrim, captures the proceedings beautifully, his superb camera-work showing through every scene. Visually stunning, Baby Driver is a wonder to behold on the big screen.Perhaps the most impressive of the film's many technical aspects is the editing, handled expertly by the duo of Jonathan Amoss and Paul Machliss. Wright's carefully curated soundtrack works perfectly in conjunction with whatever's on screen, allowing for the film to develop a unique, energetic rhythm unlike anything I've seen. And as for the soundtrack itself, it's one of the film's many assets, with Wright mixing songs both new and old to great sonic effect. Additionally, Wright makes sure that every song serves a purpose, allowing each one of them to shine.Baby Driver, however, isn't a conventional action film by any means. Remember, this an Edgar Wright film after all. The way the story unfolds allows for more than a few twists and turns that managed to keep me enthralled. Additionally, I was surprised that a supporting character's presence was entirely left out of the trailers. Considering marketing's propensity to leave no stone unturned when it comes to a film's trailers, it was refreshing to see that was not the case here. While I won't spoil who that character is, I will say that they help ground the story by providing an emotional tether for both Elgort and the audience that becomes indispensable the more I think about it.While the film undoubtedly belongs to Elgort in the lead role, who does a tremendous job acting opposite so many established stars, I was thoroughly surprised by how much I enjoyed Jon Hamm's role. Hamm simply owns it as Buddy. While Jamie Foxx might be more of a scene- stealer as the unpredictable Bats, it's Buddy that truly kept me on the edge of my seat. However, Foxx shines as well, delivering a performance entirely unhinged and yet, wholly believable. As for the rest of the cast, Lily James shines as well, bringing a lightness to the proceedings that provides a nice balance to the hardened criminals that make up the rest of the cast. Kevin Spacey atones for the sins of Nine Lives here, as the leader of the criminal outfit that Baby drives for. Spacey makes for a great criminal leader, delivering another electric performance in a career full of them. And Eiza Gonz√°lez, who plays Buddy's wife Darling, turns in a solid turn as well, fierce and sensual in equal measure. While a slight part of me wishes that certain cast members had received more screen time, I do commend Wright for presenting a straightforward story that does not stumble over its own excess.As for the story itself, some might be surprised to find that Wright's focus here isn't so much on the humor, with the film having perhaps the darkest tone of all of his films. Whereas in his previous films, the death of a character was usually treated with humor and levity, the stakes here are definitely higher. However, make no mistake, the clever writing that has shaped each of Wright's previous films remains intact. While Wright's emphasis does shift a bit more towards delivering genuine thrills than I was expecting, he succeeds graciously. But both the thrills and humor are all in service of one thing: Wright's script. And with his script, Wright accomplishes his goal of delivering an entertaining, rollicking crime romp complete with a fantastic soundtrack and well-rounded characters.Wright is simply at the top of his directorial game here. His directorial trademarks, from the way he handles transitions to the sublime usage of visual storytelling, are all here and put to splendid use. But above all, Baby Driver is kinetic entertainment, a bright spot in an otherwise mediocre summer movie season. I walked out of the theater feeling electrified, eager for another opportunity to see the film again. Simply put, Baby Driver is the most fun I've had at the theater in a long, long time.Rating: 10/10 (Masterpiece)",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Fast paced fun ride.,"Fast-paced, stylish ride that perfectly blends action and music. The car scenes are the undeniable highlight, packed with heart-pounding chases and expertly choreographed stunts that keep you on the edge of your seat. The clean, straightforward story avoids unnecessary complications, making it easy to follow while still delivering plenty of thrills.The characters are another strong point, each bringing a unique energy to the film. From Baby's quiet yet charming persona to the unpredictable supporting cast, they all feel integral to the story's rhythm.While it's not without its minor flaws, the film's combination of sleek visuals, a killer soundtrack, and tight storytelling makes it an exhilarating watch. Definitely a must-see for fans of high-octane action and well-crafted characters.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Baby Driver is your new favorite movie,Edgar Wright is one of my favorite movie director in the world.With Scott Pilgrim at number 1 in my favorite movie of 2010 when i hear he gonna direct a new movie after a long time i immediately check it out as soon as it hit my country and i gotta say:Yeah this movie definitely is one of Edgar best work yet.To fully enjoy this movie i suggest viewer go to the theater completely blind and know nothing about the plot cause that what i did and it paid off very well.With Edgar unique visual directing style the movie nearly about 2h but it very fast paced and packed with so much awesome things so it very re watchable.Although the plot being done a million time before so you kinda know how it gonna end and how the characters being played but with Edgar dialogue style the movie always know when it need to be serious and when it need to be funny.All the characters interact with each other very smooth.Ansel Elgort for the first time i saw him on the big screen is brilliant as Baby the main character that relate very much to me.With a cast full of A-list actors seeing them each have their own backstory and mystery also please me a lot and add so much weight to the movie.With all the thing i list up there i highly recommend it for everyone,10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Promising idea, failed execution.","Who wouldn't like a movie about driving fast cars while blasting cool music at the same time?I mean, think about Drive, or the Italian Job (original and remake), Vanishing Point, even those Jason Statham Transporter movies and so many more.The script is there, almost written.You only need to implement it. And that is not an easy job.Baby Driver starts wonderfully and promising but just fails to deliver. Plot is almost non existent and characters are cartoonish.I could oversee all that. I really could.Just give me cars and music.Nope, not even that.Apart for a red Subaru Impreza, called. WRX in the states at the start of the film and a few ""I think I have heard that"" songs here and there, nothing that will make you remember this movie once the end credits roll.I really seems to me that there was no budget to but the song right so they just did what they had to do.Kevin Spacey, once again, more than delivers in a role that was cut for him, almost up to the end. It's a shame.Got two hours to waste? Waste them on this movie.Got two hours to enjoy a film? Choose one you are going to actually enjoy.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Overrated AF,"Why this movie rated so high!? This is just another style-over-substance film. The music was too loud (i guess maybe it was supposed to?), the characters make dumb decisions & this was far from reality (our guy met this one girl at a restaurant one day & the next day they became love birds & decides to run away--- i mean wtf!?).The things i like is the direction & it's pacing. The things i didn't like is the absurd & illogical plot, repeated dialogues, dumb characters & decisions.This movie is at best 5 out of10 !",3.0,Anonymous,Crime
Favourite movie of the year so far,"Now I have to admit that i haven't seen a lot of Edgar Wright movies, I've heard a lot of people praise him for Hot Fuzz, Scott Pilgrim, Shaun of the Dead, The World's End. I've only seen Hot Fuzz and wasn't a big fan, but the trailers for Baby Driver were really good and I just went in with an open mind.This movie is only as good as the lead character called Baby. I haven't seen Ansel Elgort in any movies but he gave a great performance as Baby and the character was great and relatable.He's a getaway driver for heists and always listens to music because of an accident that happened when he was young. The reason for him to listen to music is explained and a great reason and I love that he listens to a classic IPod. I had an IPod like that so that made it relatable and just Baby is a great character, so that really made the movie for me.Other than Baby, the rest of the movie is also great, I absolutely loved it, there really are no issues I have with it.So besides the main character, what else makes the movie great? Well, the side characters are really good as well. Jamie Foxx, Kevin Spacey, Jon Hamm, Lily James and so on, they're all really great. I totally believed the love story between Baby and the girl Debora. I honestly was afraid of that but they made it work perfectly.Another thing I loved was the soundtrack, throughout almost the entirety of the movie the score and the soundtrack is used and it works perfectly. They made it another character in the movie.Of course this is also an action movie, so the question is how the action is shot. Well, if you saw the trailers you could see some really cool shots there, the movie is no different. The style is great and luckily most of the action is shot with long takes and all in frame. I was so into the action because it was so well shot and it was practical. I have to admit that I don't know if they used CGI but that's the great thing, if there was CGI, I didn't see that it was CGI, so that's great.They also make the action line up with the music, and not in a way that it's stupid and doesn't work but in a very clever way that it only makes the movie better.So essentially everything this movie needed to do for me, it delivered, great action, great characters, great soundtrack. It's an extremely fun movie, I had a blast with it, it's my favourite movie of the year so far and I hope that there are movies to top it because that means this year will be awesome. Baby Driver is a 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
All you need is one killer director and lots of great songs!!!,"There are no standards for a guy like Edgar Wright, he keeps making unique and original movies and sets his own standards. This is his most realistic movie to date and a little darker in tone than his earlier works. Nevertheless, I absolutely enjoyed the technical aspects of the movie especially the whole rhythm of the movie. How many movies have gun shots synced with the BGM or cars' gears shifting to the tempo of a song? This movie has so much rhythm in every aspect, be it the quiet moments or the insane chase sequences, the editing as usual in an Edgar Wright movie is captivating. It was as if Edgar Wright was conducting a choir... It was super stylish. I'm sure it will take another viewing to grasp some of the minor things that I may have missed in this fast paced piece of brilliance. Everybody knows by now that the movie's greatest feature is its killer soundtrack and I absolutely loved the way songs are used in this movie, they don't play passively in the background but are an extension of Baby himself. Everything in this film feels deliberate and carefully planned. I think Baby Driver will go down as one of the most original action/romance movies made in recent years. This is the third movie this year after Logan and John Wick 2 that I thought is a contender for future classic status. Baby Driver is a meticulously crafted masterpiece from a director who just can't make bad movies. Highly Recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Don't waste your time,This is the first time I am writing a review on IMDb.

This is a hopeless movie I have ever seen. People were leaving the cinema even before the ending. Please don't waste your time.,,Anonymous,Crime
Enjoyed the first half,"Watched the movie on a flight and it seemed a decent way to kill some time. It all started off well. The opening scene is very promising. It makes you want to learn more about Baby, who is portrayed as an intriguing genius.
The further up you get into the movie, the more it changes from a 'classic' into a movie with action scenes that are no better than those in Fast & Furious. The focus on characters and their personalities disappeared half way and so did my interest in the movie.
On a more positive note, I appreciated the roles of Baby's step dad and Debra. All other characters were bland in my opinion.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Nowhere near as good as the hype,"I was hugely excited for this, as a fan of Wright ever since Spaced. But I left feeling really underwhelmed. If you want a Kingsman style lightly amusing comedy with a good soundtrack then its great. But if you're looking for the warm, cosy, nuanced and observed humour and subtle wit of the Cornetto trilogy with a bunch of heart and charm then you might feel underwhelmed too.Whats wrong with it? (spoiler free)It over-relies on the central idea of music and syncing. If that had been one element on the side of a much more interesting and character driven heist film (e.g. just a gimmick of the driver), it could have worked brilliantly. But because its been SO built around that idea, you start thinking ""really, is the idea even that interesting?"" The syncing becomes more distracting with its fantasy elements (e.g. Hamm shooting a gun in time to the music that Baby's listening to). Its fine for a short film or music video, but it gets stretched a little thin across a whole feature (especially when there's precious little between these moments to be interested in).There are precious few actual car chases. I was expecting a climactic crazy chase on a scale with the one in Blues Brothers, something over the top and cinematic as with Hot Fuzz, but it never happens. The action shifts instead to some pedestrian action in a car park interior. The chases themselves are fairly short and really not very inventive - beside the music syncing there's just nothing interesting about them. The opening of Drive feels far more engaging and interesting in comparison.The central romance falls flat. The girl just comes across as fake and irritating, with zero chemistry between them. Because of this, Baby's purpose to be with her has no credibility.The other characters are all weak. I craved some of the brilliantly nuanced characters of Wrights other work, even ones that pop up for brief moments (e.g. Peggs housemate or Reese Shearsmith's character in Shaun). Spacey does a hugely watered down version of his Glengary character. Jon Bernthal's more interesting character only pops up for a brief pointless cameo to make 'retard' jokes, never to be seen again.The cinematography feels dull like a TV pilot, its just not inventive in the way that it feels like it should be. Visually, its the weakest Wright film by far.The plot is clich√©d. For a heist film, there is nothing inventive or memorable about the writing or story whatsoever.The music is obviously great, and there are some nice amusing moments. But it didn't live up to the film I imagined from the hype, or Edgar's other movies, at all. I feel like people are just being suggestible to the idea of ""cool music"" and marketing.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Fast cars and soul- This is a solid winner.,"I had put this movie on my watch list as the trailer intrigued me but I had no real expectations going into it. All I thought was this would be a heist/car chase movie, that it would be popcorn entertainment with a promising cast lineup. I'm not sure if it was my lowered expectations or my being surprised, but this movie blew me away.From the very first scene, this is such an enticing movie. It has an oddness to it that is so charming and fun, with a main character that makes you love this quirks. On top of that, it is well shot, directed and acted. With a general plot that is not all too original but it's the characters and the style of the movie that take it far away from something ordinary.I would suggest seeing this movie if you are a music lover or love action movies with something more than the mundane. A car movie with soul.Excited to see it again.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Starts off plenty strong; peters out in the third act.,"I liked about 76% of this movie - until right after the awesome cameo by the incomparable Swan himself. The film gets to that point at breakneck speed. Then it just sputters through moments like Wright didn't know how to finish things through at the same pace.Oh, and Jamie Foxx is intolerable beyond imagination. I know he was meant to be villainous. But it went from being apt characterization to cinematic teeth-grinding smugness without a trace of even devilish nuance. There is absolutely nothing redeeming about the portrayal; it is straight-up grating, one-dimensional and detrimental in every applicable scene.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Not only that, but i think it has a good and touching love story. And the music is perfect for the action! Really a great music movie.",,Anonymous,Crime
Not what I was expecting.,I'll keep it simple and spoiler free. I was expecting Hot Fuzz with non-stop music. It's not. I was expecting Shaun of the Dead's Westchester/Don't Stop Me Now scene for 2 hours non-stop. It's not. I was expecting Scott Pilgrim vs. The World's clever sound editing and dialogue. It's not.

"Fast Cars, with less fast cars and more plot","It's Fast Cars, with less fast cars and more plot; the movie cares more about the soundtrack than it does the cars on screen and more about the plot than it does stringing together driving sequences. The film is an absolute trip from start to finish, with all the action and sometimes over-the-top violence you might expect, toned down considerably by the character-driven plot. Elgort is a truly delightful male lead who ‚Äîwith a touch of charm, innocence‚Äî brought the humor needed to temper the less-than-savory company he keeps.The supporting cast is also no disappointment. Jon Hamm (Buddy) found the perfect follow up film to Mad Men playing an angry criminal, head-over- heels in love with his wife, Darling (Eiza Gonz√°lez). Jamie Foxx embodies bat-sh** crazy as Bats and Spacey plays a very familiar type of criminal mastermind (he's basically a chubbier version of Frank Underwood). Jon Bernthal (Griff) is more of a cameo than an actual cast supporting cast member, which is surprising and a bit disappointing.Silly name aside, if you like any of the cast members, heist movies, good music, fast cars, quick plot turns or Edgar Wright's brand of action this is certainly a film worth seeing.Featuring: Brogan Hall as Samm, reminding us all that it is, in fact, the #YearOfTheChildActor and notable allusions to some of the greatest films of all time: Monsters Inc. and Little Rascals.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
One gear.,"Boo! Booooo! Bring it on. I can take it. Despite a plethora of gushing reviews, ""Baby Driver"" is not a great movie. Passable, but not great.How can this be? Car chases, tricky heists, great cast, and director genius Edgar Wright at the helm. Surely this must be one helluva grand cinema going adventure? Well, it is, but only in very short spurts.Cartoonish characters, good and bad, in any action flick worth it's salt lick, gotta have some, um, character. Something sorely lacking over here. Normally juicy actors Kevin Spacey, Jon Hamm and Jamie Foxx, are wasted in one dimensional, dry roles. Totally forgettable. Worst of all is newcomer Ansel Elgort, who fits the title profile - he can drive and has peach fuzz - but brings nothing to the table.The opening scene is great: primo, clever four wheel and six barrel action with super cool tunes a blaring (Jon Spencer). Wright films style like no one else, but here, he forgets to pepper the thing with substance. ""Baby Driver"" is a coupla hours of drivin' and shootin'; nothing more than an average video game offers.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Good but definitely not amazing,"I found this movie to be very entertaining although lacking in brains. I wouldn't pay to watch it again or buy the DVD but for a one time watch it was more than alright.. just don't take it seriously and don't expect much in terms of depth, the Pianist, Ocean's Eleven or even Fightclub it is not! The movie builds up Baby's character to make you feel a huge and massive twist in coming to prove Baby is actually smarter than he looks. Bummer. Doesn't happen. The last third of the movie falls flat with the typical predictable stuff you already knew was going to happen. The love story was a bit too naive for me with no substance and a bit boring. The relationship between Doc (Kevin Spacey) and Baby is the most stupid Hollywood clich√© shifting for no reason at all from a logical extreme to an illogical different extreme. Now that I think about it, not a single relationship in this movie seemed real apart from the disabled foster dad with Baby. Those were the scenes that gave the movie depth and beauty. Other than that, take the car chases away and you got a road traffic of a movie to watch. The dialogue and writing in general was below bar especially for Jamie Fox's character. As to why Kevin Spacey chose that mediocre role, I'll never find out. I think the writers of this movie set out writing the coolest getaway scenes with the coolest getaway driver in town then towards the end ran out of ideas.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Overrated,The only thing I can say for sure about Baby Driver is that this movie is highly overrated. It certainly doesn't deserve such a high rating as it does now on here. It's an easy to watch action movie but not the best one in this genre. The plot isn't difficult to understand and it isn't that bad either but the characters are what brings this movie down. Too much have-you-see-me characters just don't do any good to the movie. I really doubt criminals and bank robbers would act like they do before a heist. It would be for sure a disaster every time. Kevin Spacey is the big name in Baby Driver but don't watch this movie to see him in action. He did much better movies than this one. The rest of the cast can clearly act but it's just their ridiculous characters that makes this just an average action movie.,5.0,Anonymous,Crime
Awesometacular,"I caught a premiere of this movie in May, thanks to Sony pictures, and UC San Diego. I never thought a free movie could be THIS good.First of all, this is an Edgar Wright movie. That itself should make you go to the theatre. The story is quite simple - A good guy is unfortunately stuck in a world of crime as a getaway driver. He needs to pull one last job before he elopes with his girlfriend. But the story is never the most important thing in an Edgar Wright movie. The razor sharp humour, the amazing soundtrack, and the gorgeous visuals bear his signature. This Edgar Wright-ness is the film's USP. And, the stunts, OMG !! The stunt/chase sequences in this movie put all the 8 Fast and Furious movies to shame (I wasn't a fan to begin with).I can't give you a single reason to NOT watch this movie. IT IS phenomenal.

Stupidest film I've ever seen - and I've seen Prometheus,"I must be stupid.I feel like I just handed over the family cow for a handful of magic beans. I saw the trailer for Baby Driver and thought it looked dreadful. But I was still stupidly suckered into seeing the whole movie by the post-truth IMDb score and enthusiastic reviews from trusted sources.They're dead to me now.I've enjoyed Edgar Wright's work in the past but Baby Driver is the puerile fantasy of a twelve-year-old boy. It's a fantasy where bopping along the street in tune to your 'beatz' makes you look super-cool instead of like an attention-seeking tosser, where simply not talking has the power to turn a pudgy-faced teenager into Robert Mitchum, where the hot waitress falls inexplicably in love with you before you've even ordered a Coke, and where driving at full speed into the back of a lorry in a crash that kills both your parents, leaves you with only two cool little scars and a slight ringing in the ears, instead of hideously squashed and sucking soup through a straw for the rest of your life.It's also cool - when you're a getaway driver - to drive very very fast and with a lot of squealing tyres and crashes - even when your shitty driving is the only reason the police are chasing you in the first place. God forbid you should just mirror, signal, manoeuvre - and disappear quietly into traffic. God forbid you should just... GET AWAY!There are so many ridiculous inconsistencies, unlikely coincidences, dumb actions and unintentionally hilarious lines in this film that I kept expecting Leslie Nielsen to pop up and make a beaver joke.Baby Driver has tinnitus which comes and goes as the plot requires (or not - either is fine). He has an endless supply of iPods and sunglasses - as one pair is slapped off his face, he pulls another from his sleeve like Paul Daniels on a sunbed. Baby Driver is an orphan but he cares deeply (aka shallowly) for his foster dad who is black AND disabled AND deaf, which is like the Cliff Notes way to Create Sympathy. But it still doesn't work. Baby's not sympathetic. Or heroic. Or sexy. Or even a good getaway driver.Likwise, Kevin Spacey's Doc is supposed to be 'the best' at putting together tip-top teams for heists, and yet he employs a series of infantile squabblers who all resent the hell out of the toddler-of-mystery that is Baby Driver.Throughout the film, Doc has Baby Driver in a brutal iron grip - threatening to break his legs and slaughter everybody he loves. But then he wilts like spinach at the sight of Baby Driver with his instant girlfriend and within seconds showers them with money, tells them to get away and 'never look back' and - in the grand emotional fulcrum of the whole movie - reveals: 'I was in love once'. Another one for Cliff Notes, I think.In short, Baby Driver is a stupid film where stupid people do stupid things while saying stupid lines to each other.Avoid at all costs unless you're a twelve-year-old boy.A stupid one.",,Anonymous,Crime

"Bad title, great film","Baby Driver - While it sounds like a follow up to The Boss Baby or Baby's Day Out, it's far from it. This is a fast-paced, engaging gangster flick with music and moves to spare.The title character, played by Ansel Elgort, is the protagonist, but also the resident DJ for your movie going experience. Songs are synced up with the action perfectly, making it all the more immersive. Having the songs be something the character was experiencing as well was a unique way to provide the soundtrack.Paired with the music are the crazy car chase/get away scenes. While there are quite a few of these, they never get stale. Each has it's own song and unique flare, so it's a new experience each time.There are no weak links with the actors either. It's hard to pick favorites out of such a strong crew, but Jamie Foxx and John Hamm really pull it out here. Each of their characters have more than a few screws loose, perhaps allowing them to bring something more to the table than the other members of the cast.Edgar Wright wrote and directed all of the characters exceptionally well. I cared about what each of them were saying with every line. Too often in other films there are scenes of sloppy exposition or flat dialogue to progress the story. Here, there is no filler to be found.The movie of course doesn't do itself any favors with a name like Baby Driver. The target audience likely will skim past it on the marquee, while a family that missed the most recent showing of Cars 3 might be in for a rude awakening four minutes in. While it definitely has the worst title of 2017 so far, it also has the distinction of being one of the funnest experiences of the year as well. If you get the chance, it's a ride worth taking. 8.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Balls out, creative and utterly original!","I've felt starved of originality so far this year and this film promised to be a little different. Different it most certainly is.I caught a late night showing of the film some 7 days before it's official release and I drove home quicker than I ever should have, (especially with the dodgy tyre that's hanging off the back of my car), I was in such a rush to throw these words together because the film is just simply THAT BLOODY GOOD! Edgar Wright hasn't just created a film, he's created a piece of art. This is picture and sound working absolutely perfectly with each other, a master class of editing. Gun shots and window wipers sync perfectly with the beats of the music, the volume of the soundtrack dictated by how the main character 'Baby' is experiencing it at the time. In fact, there's only a couple of times throughout the whole feature where the music actually stops, (when the headphones are ripped from his ears) timed so brilliantly with the serious moments of the film. It's a unique and creative effect, the likes I've never seen done before.Ansel Elgort plays the young get away driver 'Baby' and does a fine job of portraying a cool, if somewhat purposely awkward character. Jamie Foxx, Kevin Spacey, Jon Hamm & Lily James all perform brilliantly and there's a number of scenes that feature them on screen all together which are genuinely electric. I'm a big fan of Jon Bernthal, especially since his Punisher role in Marvel's DAREDEVIL however I was disappointed to find his role is more of a cameo than anything else. The romance between Baby and Debora (played by Lily James) works well and the chemistry between them shines.The lack of CGI was a breath of fresh air in a world where every film seems to be rammed with it no matter how effective. Prior to the screening, Edgar Wright had recorded a short message for us and he made it very clear that he shot this film using almost entirely practical effects and it shows. Not one bit of poor CGI to ruin the magic, just balls out, car chasing porn.As touched on earlier, the soundtrack is immense. A perfect blend of some well known tracks and some less recognizable, all very effective and match the on screen action beautifully.A couple of small gripes that pop up and ruin an almost perfect get away can be found in the closing chapters. A particular scene in a car park features a few too many cuts for my liking and for a time I struggled to see what was actually happening on screen. The pacing also drops off rather quickly in the final scenes. A more sudden climax would have perhaps worked better to what had been a racey/fast paced film up to that point. It dampened my enthusiasm for the film a touch, which is a shame because the motor was running beautifully until then.Baby Driver doesn't waste any time in pulling you into its world and the camera work in one of the opening scenes is outstanding: A long shot timed perfectly with the music and crammed with brilliantly timed on screen moments, it was superb. The cinematography is exceptional and the plot is intriguing and unpredictable. The amount of attention to detail found in here is something to behold and it's clear Edgar Wright put his absolute all into creating this masterpiece. Finally, the dialogue is some of the wittiest I have heard in a film in a long time, it had the whole cinema laughing out loud numerous times and features some great real world references that are bound to make you smirk.The best way to describe Baby Driver is that it's La La Land being overrun by speeding cars and bank robbers. Throw in some Kingsman style humour and, at times, pretty graphic violence and you've got yourself one hell of a good heist movie! Go see this Baby!

A Solid 7 For a E. Wright Comedy Film -  Although There Was Something Off about J. Foxx Role.,"Has anyone else found Jamie Foxx's role in general not funny and dull? Got the impression that it wasn't well developed, is not a new type of character for him, the ""badass-getto-mental-outlaw"" as we have seen him in Horrible Bosses, but here it just didn't come through as well as the others. Over all not bad for a ""cop and robbers"" franchise type of American audience pleaser film to go with a large Coke and Pop Corn.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
High Octane Ballet,"From the opening sequence of Baby Driver you realize you are about to see something different. Edgar Wright has tricked you into watching a musical and loving every second of it. One where the dance numbers are performed by fast cars and the beat of the music is pounded out by the gunfire. You thought John Wick's choreography was amazing? Every step, movement, shot, cup of coffee, and chalkboard drawing is perfectly timed to the music of the scene, every line of dialogue was a song. It is a ballet, a Broadway dance, and a brutal massacre without a single missed beat.This is a huge undertaking as a director, making sure all the pieces are moving in time from the camera and talent to the background performers and traffic, and Edgar Wright nails it every time. It may not be the type of film that the Academy usually notices but Edgar deserves a Best Director nod for the opening title sequence alone. It stands next to Goodfellas and Touch of Evil as one of the best long takes of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
B-a-b-y,"Let me start this off by saying that Hollywood needs more films like Baby Driver. Not just because the originality is off the charts, but because I wish more films boasted this much irreverent fun. It's Edgar Wright, so you know it's going to be stylish, but there really hasn't been another film this year that has matched the amount of chaotic entertainment in Baby Driver. I guess you could say it's this year's Deadpool.With all that out of the way, I should now say that I didn't find there to be anything significantly impressive about any one character in the film. Ansel Elgort and Lily James have great chemistry, as you'd expect. Kevin Spacey is an intimidating but somehow charming antagonist, as you'd expect. Jaime Foxx plays a foul-mouthed henchman, as you'd expect. Jon Hamm, Eliza Gonzalez, and Jon Bernthal aren't given much depth either. I guess my point is, Baby Driver gathered a bunch of extremely talented actors for a film, and failed to put together an impressive story with interesting characters. Elgort's 'Baby' is given a semi-interesting but prototypical backstory, but the rest are given absolutely nothing.However, you'd be hard-pressed to find anyone who doesn't enjoy the soundtrack and overall flow of the film. The action sequences are nicely spaced out and the music is perfectly timed up. It's not uncustomary to have a great soundtrack in an Edgar Wright film, but it's unprecedented for a film to have this much success using music to drive the story and action. Wasn't it difficult to not join Elgort while he's dancing to the beat through the streets of Atlanta?The soundtrack is addicting, the action is thrilling, and the performances are more than serviceable. If only Wright gave a little more attention to developing each character so that their motivations weren't so shallow, we may have one of the best films of the year on our hands. Without much to grapple onto, Baby Driver is just a little bit above a decent action-crime-thriller.+Soundtrack is killer+Action is well-shot and paced-Characters lack depth-Motivations should be fleshed out7.0/10",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Baby Driver - Movie Review,"I enjoyed this movie, but certain action scenes did go on a bit too long. I also felt that certain characters were underdeveloped. The movie felt a little too cartoonish when I wanted it to be more on the serious side. However, I still enjoyed all the fun and mayhem that this movie had to offer. The music, colors, and mayhem are what kept Baby Driver entertaining.For a more in-depth review, check out my video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWCnFeMnd_k",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Enjoyable with so much more potential,"Before seeing 'Baby driver' I was very excited due to the fact that the director, Edgar Wright is known to make unique movies which really work. For me this movie was bitter sweet. This is because it contained some of the best action scenes, and car chases I've ever scene. The editing, cinematography and integration with music was extraordinary. Kevin Spacey and John Hamm, were perfect in their roles, and for the most part I felt that Ansel Elgort was best suited for his role also. Although this film has major problems. I feel as though other movie reviewers are addressing the main issue with the film, and are really overlooking the importance of it, as they are distracted by the elaborate and breathtaking action sequences. This film does not delve deep into its characters enough to make you really care about them, and their relationships. Ansel Elgort's character ""Baby"", is rushed into a two dimensional relationship with Lily James' character ""Debora"". The genuine love between these characters is not apparent due to the lack of substance as a couple. There are situations where this relationship is threatened to create suspense and I couldn't help but think about how much more intense and gripping it would be if the audience really felt for these two characters. I have seen it been done in other films, where the viewer is emotionally attached to characters and their relationships. When it is done right, it truly takes you other places in terms of tension and genuine worry. I was deeply disappointed by this, as all the stunning action scenes would have enhanced even further if the audience had felt a real care for these characters. It reached a point where the limits of their relationships were unrealistic. Debora would make life threatening decisions, which could either kill her or make her a criminal, for a boy she had only gone on a single date with. The occurrence of this really took me out of the scenes, as her motivations were insanely unrealistic for an average human.Furthermore, my other main issue with 'Baby Driver' was Jamie Fox. Countless movie critics are praising his performance, and to a certain extent he was great. His personality as a character was done well. It was his unclear line delivery which really interrupted intense scenes that were intended to really build in tension. On countless occasions I felt that the ruthless and terrifying persona of his character was lost due to my inability to understand him. Also the acting by Eiza Gonz√°lez as ""Darling"" was quite terrible, especially in a certain scene where she was attempting to be threatening, which only left me cringing. Overall, 'Baby Driver' is a really enjoyable movie, which was lots of fun to watch. The reason as to why I am grading it a 7/10, is due to all the potential I see in it. It was so close to being a masterpiece, and I can't wait to see the film which can tackle this style perfectly. I know that when that happens, that film will be a modern day classic.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Overhyped,"I only saw this movie recently . It was according to my cousin a very good movie . Though after seeing this , I was very much disappointed . It tries to hard of being stylish in a way that it reminds of Tarantino , though that director seems to pull it of a lot better. The gimmick with the music is over-used , the acting is only so-so , and the story line is one in a dozen . Ok, the camerawork is pretty decent , but that is almost the only thing that stands out .

"A simplistic Plot With Killer Soundtrack Makes ""Baby Driver"" A Delight","""Baby Driver"" the new film from Edgar Wright is about a getaway driver named Baby who is forced to work for a criminal mastermind who hires different teams to rob banks. When Baby meets the girl of his dreams, he wants out, but not before being double crossed and forced to work on an other job.Edgar Wright's films are brilliant. I will say that first. They are all funny, original, and relatable. ""Baby Driver"" is no different. This may actually be the best Edgar Wright film I have seen (excluding The World's End, which I have NOT seen). This is up there for as one of the best and could be in the running for my favorite movie of the year when all is said and done at the end of the year.First off, the cast is phenomenal and perfectly cast. I have not seen Ansel Elgort in anything else, but he was really good in the movie. Everyone in this movie really gave it their all. Jon Hamm in this movie, HOLY SMOKES. Even Eiza Gonzalez, thought not great, did a very good job and gave it their all.This movie is very original, something there isn't much of these days. It is so well written and you are able to get sucked into this world very easily. The script is very witty, funny, original, and relatable. The characters are not overly developed, but not underdeveloped either. It's just the right amount of characterization.This movie goes in many ways I did not expect. This movie sets up a character to be the main villain and he doesn't end up being the main villain, which I would usually have a problem with but I felt it worked very well for this movie. It wasn't predictable, and usually movies like this are. This one wasn't. it kept me guessing and on the edge of my seat for the entirety of it.Th action is really cool too, and yes there is some shaky cam, but I feel as if it is shaky cam done right. You can still make out what is going on in each scene even when the camera is shaking. the action is just so inventive and cool, as unrealistic as it may be, and it made these scenes really entertaining and fun to watch.This movie also has a killer soundtrack. The soundtrack for this movie is the perfect driving music. It was fun to listen to, and added a little extra to the action scenes. This was by far one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard for a movie.Please do yourselves a favor and see this film next weekend when it comes out. this is what Hollywood needs right now, original films that aren't afraid to push the envelope. This movie was a whole lotta fun. I had a blast with it at my screening, and is definitely up there for best of the year so far.I'm giving ""Baby Driver"" the almighty perfect score of an A+Check out my review of ""Baby Driver"" on YouTube in the link provided, and please, go and support this movie.

A slice of fried cinematic gold,"Edgar Wright may not have made too many films however, he's one of the few directors working today that can generate such a buzz for his projects, thanks to their originality and sheer entertainment value. His sixth film, Baby Driver, has been no stranger to positive word of mouth and it is well and truly deserved. Believe the hype because Baby Driver is a pure slice of fried cinematic gold.After being coerced into working for a crime boss, young getaway driver Baby (Ansel Elgort) finds himself taking part in a heist doomed to fail, finding love along the way.Wasting no time in dropping the audience right into the frenetic action, Edgar Wright's Baby Driver is relentlessly paced throughout, building in kinetic energy as each chase sequence rises in intensity and magnitude, leaving you well and truly on the edge of your seat. Featuring incredible stunt work and some swift cinematography from Bill Pope, Baby Driver possesses some of the best chase sequences I've ever seen on film.Another aspect of the film that elevates it to another level is the soundtrack Wright expertly utilises for not only the major chase sequences, but the smaller scale scenes too. Every song works so well, whether it be Tequila accompanying a shootout or Hocus Pocus playing over the film's major chase sequence. Seriously though, the chase sequence that sees Baby trying to escape via both car and foot is just insanely well put together, Hocus Pocus being the real cherry on top.Coming to the performances, Baby Driver features a small yet impressive cast, ranging from relative newcomer Ansel Elgort through to the seasoned pro that is Kevin Spacey. Elgort may not be as charismatic as you'd think however, he really does suit the role of Baby incredibly well because it isn't a role that requires the most charismatic of actors. There are other roles in the film for that, one of them being Jamie Foxx as Bats, a member of the heist team who has a penchant for violence and running his mouth. This is the best I've seen Foxx for a while and, along with the rest of the cast, he looks like he's having a ball.Edgar Wright's Baby Driver has an old school crime caper feel to it but with Wright's sharp writing and knack for humour plus the amazing chase sequences at hand, it really does become something else entirely. This is sure to be one of the most original and thrilling films you could see all year.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Driven to Greatness,"Before even looking at what makes this film special, Baby Driver already succeeds on its own as a hodgepodge of action, crime, heist, comedy, romance and drama that balances all elements pretty evenly and deftly. The pacing is nearly perfect and it's very simple and straightforward, but at the same time cleverly and engagingly plotted.What takes this film to a special place is a literally unprecedented level of sound design detail. In several places, you can see elements of the lyrics in the song interacting with background elements and extras in the scene backgrounds. Not only is pretty much every gun shot and door slam and overall action element rhythm-synced to the ever-present soundtrack, but even less noticeable audio tricks fully immerse the audience in the shoes of our main character. For instance, in one dialogue-driven scene, the main character is listening to some other characters speak while keeping in one ear bud (headphone). I was sitting on the left hand side of the theater and the music seemed extremely faint, almost to where one can barely hear it. At first, I thought some inconsiderate asshole in the audience had a phone game with an instrumental loop running, and then I realized: they have the music turned down low and panned hard right as if we are hearing it exactly how the main character would. If this movie doesn't take the Oscar for sound design, something is clearly wrong.The humor style and relentless pacing won't click with 100% of people, but I think the type of person that this film was intended for will love the film and that it also has some crossover appeal to those that aren't big action fans, as well. It also helps that it effortlessly covers so many bases in terms of defying genre conventions. Even the inclusion of certain genre clich√©s in this film feel more like a wink at the audience than a lack of creativity. Strongly recommended for all fans of action, comedy and music!",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
A really good movie that fizzles badly in the end (some spoilers),"After seeing Baby Driver, one thought kept going through my mind over and over again: Boy, oh boy, what if Quentin Tarantino had directed it? This kind of movie was made for him. In some ways it feels like a modern-day Reservoir Dogs. Put a bunch of criminals together and at some point there will be betrayal, and bloodshed. Director Edgar Wright did a commendable job, but had Tarantino gotten a hold of this project, I know the character development, writing and directing would have been much crisper. The characters are interesting: Kevin Spacey as the level-headed leader of a gang of thieves, with Jamie Foxx, Jon Bernthal and a grizzled-looking Jon Hamm among the thieves. Hamm is about as far-removed from Don Draper as can be and proves he shouldn't be typecast. But the focus is on the baby-faced Ansel Elgort as Baby, who is a helluva getaway driver. He is still tormented by a childhood tragedy and listens to music through his headphones all day, even when he's driving. The other important star of the movie is the soundtrack. It drives the entire narrative, an idea that seems borrowed from Guardians of the Galaxy. But the music is great. From the Commodores, to Queen, to Barry White, songs are used effectively. The plot revolves around Baby's quest to do ""one final job"" and then get out of the crime business. We've seen this before many times. It never ends well. Along the way, Baby meets Debora, a bubbly waitress played by Lily James, who looks like a young Jessica Lange. She also is obsessed with music, just like Baby, and they fall hard for each other in what seems like five minutes. However, their ultimate plan to ride off into the sunset together and listen to music will be easier said than done. The first hour of Baby Driver is strong. But the final half-hour devolves into a clich√©-ridden mess, with supposedly dead characters suddenly reappearing and bad guys failing to kill good guys despite having them in their cross-hairs several times. It's almost as if the producers ran out of money and decided to call it a day. Baby Driver is the second movie in a row, following All Eyez on Me, that disappointed me. Not because they were bad, but because they could have been so much better in the hands of a different director. So to sum up, Baby Driver is interesting for a while, but eventually wraps up like just about every other caper. Well, at least there's great music along the way.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
The gorgeous flower among the desert of 'musclar' cars racing action films,"It isn't embarrassing to say that Baby Driver is the most amazing movie about cars, music, love, crime,... that separated from the others movies of this kind. It is not only funny, crazy but also significant, meaningful and touching. 113 minutes I watched the film, I laughed, I cried, I be afraid, I felt the beat of those songs, and after that I clapped for such a wonderful action film. There are several reasons which makes it becomes the best movie of excitement, love, music, action... First, this is the movie directed by Edgar Wright. Absolutely, the talented director has lead the movie with the way that nobody can. There are always his passion, love and a little crazy which makes it be his own film. The 22-year- project is successful, which doesn't surprise me! Second, the casts are incredible, beautiful without any super stars. Ansel Elgort, who is my favorite since ""the faults in our stars"", returned to act the distinct play. Two Oscar winners are Kevin Spacey and Jamie Foxx. Lily James is impressive with classical beauty. Finally, the music is wonderful, the scenes are maleficent and some action scenes make my heart stop beating. Those features are Baby Driver, a perfect movie. I watched it and definitely I want to watch it again...",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Fun action-crime flick that is unrealistic and a tad bit overrated,"Is it a fun movie? Besides the boring parts of it (and there are plenty of boring portions), yes. But is it an Oscar-worthy 10/10 or 94% score on RT the reviews and ratings would have you believe? No.Baby Driver is a fun, if yet awfully unrealistic action-heist-crime flick. While parts of it excel, parts also falter; it's not a perfect movie. The main character's driving strategy is a good metaphor for its quality: speed forward, hit brakes, then go backwards in reverse; it's all over the place.However, overall I did like it and it is good. I just don't quite understand how a movie this unrealistic scored so high with critics. Usually movies with this much deus ex machina don't fare as well overall. But if you are in the mood for action packed mindless entertainment, it does a good job in that department keeping you entertained. And it has some laughs mixed in.6.5/10",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Writer-Director Edgar Wright's Baby Driver is an instant classic and a must-watch for movie fans of any kind,"Packed with unprecedented style, flawless editing, relentless charm, and a beyond-killer soundtrack, Edgar Wright does what he does best with Baby Driver and proves that action movies can be smartly written as well as beautifully directed without sacrificing any of the sweet eye-candy we come to love in action cinema.

Don't believe the Hype,"I may have been more generous with the rating I chose, however due to the overwhelming number of highly positive reviews, I feel that some brutal honesty is required here.The main themes in most of the reviews I've stumbled across are that this movie has a refreshingly original story and that the car chase scenes were exceptional. Neither circumstance holds true. The story was as cut and dry as any in this genre and the car chase scenes were bland, boring, and made no sense to me. Compared to a movie like Drive, where the protagonist's backstory actually lends to his driving skills (stunt car driver, motorsports participant), in Baby Driver, we're supposed to believe that some kid somehow acquired exceptional getaway driver abilities because of...tinnitus? There is no connection here, not to me anyway. And as for the chase scenes, utterly boring and unoriginal. The cars were completely lame too. Taking Drive as a point of contention again, the cars in Drive even have some degree of backstory to make the seemingly unbelievable chase scenes more believable...upgraded chassis, suspension, and souped up engines. In Baby Driver, we're given nothing more than showroom stock grocery getters...not even the top end models of the cars were chosen to take on the challenges. It was just all around stupid to me and I was left disappointed.OK so the soundtrack was good. But this is not Forrest Gump where a compelling, original story is amplified by a perfectly curated soundtrack. Instead, it's a collection of good music used in campy fashion. If what you're after is the soundtrack, get a Spotify account. Dollar for dollar you'll get a lot more out of it, I promise.",2.0,Anonymous,Crime
A More Sophisticated Action Movie That Aims At The Heart,"Going into ""Baby Driver"", I had lowish expectations. I could not have been more wrong. Probably the best action film of 2017 thus far, Edgar Wright (known for ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz"") delivers a well blended film that incorporates very well spaced action and romance, with just a hit of comedy. Baby (Ansel Elgort) is a lovable and approachable character, who's obsession with music has you tapping your foot along with the stellar tune he plays along the ride. Action seems to be pretty much grounded to the laws of physics in this film, and even though there's a hearty dose of it, audience members will leave the theater wishing there was more in the film.8/10, would recommend.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Awesome,"This new Edgar Wright film delivers seller acting, exceptional music, and significant fun. Going into this film knowing nothing outside of the trailer did not leave me disappointed as seeing how the events unfold in the film is so wacky and interesting that knowing nothing raised my enjoyment overall. The characters were also pretty great as well, each with their own distinguished personalty and arcs. However, what makes this film truly stand out is the sound design and music. Everything within the movie's universe lines up with the music being played, this includes conversations, gunshots, and even footsteps. Now although nothing really shocked me about where the movie went with its story what did surprise me was just how different this film is from Edgar Wrights other films. This proves his versatility as a director and I am looking forward to seeing other movies like this from him. Overall Baby Driver is an incredibly fun ride. The best way to describe it is La La Land + Drive + Mad Max = Baby Driver. Go see this one as soon as you can as it will not disappoint. And with that I give Baby Driver a 9/10!",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Technically high-quality movie, but not very memorable. Verdict: Over-hyped","When I saw the trailer for this movie, I thought ""Meh, looks kinda dull."" But then I saw that Edgar directed this movie - I LOVE HOT FUZZ - and I became very excited about it, and this excitement was amplified by the early ratings in the 8.5-8.6 range. But when I saw it, I was unfortunately disappointed. There aren't too many memorable things about this movie, and it's predictable. It's moderately funny, and the chase scenes aren't as astonishingly mind-blowing as I was led to believe. The characters are decent and the story is OK, which puts it at a 5/10, but the editing is a tier above average so I'll give it a 6/10. I think the 10/10s are coming from car buffs who never watch actual 10/10 movies, or from people who like purely ""realistic,"" typical action movies. I would really have liked to see something new and unpredictable, or to have some absurd humor or something, but it just wasn't there. This movie is a 7/10 MAX, although I still recommend you see it in theaters if you have nothing else to do. Personally I would not watch this again, and I am still debating whether the $10.50 was worth it.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Best Car Chase Scenes Ever,"This film brought me back to memories of some of the great car chase scenes from films like Bullitt, the French Connection and the Seven- Ups. Really awesome car scenes here and there are many of them, not just the one great scene we got in those films. And the score had some great songs in it to (really loved hearing Carla Thomas's B-A-B-Y). The performances were top notch with Jamie Foxx, Jon Hamm and Kevin Spacey having a lot of fun as bad guys (Jamie was particularly menacing) as did Jon Bernthal and Paul Williams in briefer roles. Ansel Elgort in the lead and Lily James as his romantic interest delivered solid performances. Eliza Gonzalez steals every scene she is in and we'll hopefully be seeing a lot more of her.

I did say some bad things about this movie but i really suggest it ( Edgar wright movies don't do that good in the box-office,"Baby driver is the latest film by Edgar wrightThe positives -great music selections ( not just picking a much of 80""s music to get to people""s nostalgia) - music fit very well with the story - great editing - super fun action scenes - the acting is fine - very funny - some funny characters-negatives -the boyfriend and girlfriend romance is uninteresting - this one seems like a weird complaint ,but they play the first couple of second of jump around ( by house of pain) they do the same thing with the next episode (by Dr.Dre and Snoop dog) -some characters boring or not in the movie for that long (i know they were trying to make it more realistic by changing crew members for every mission but come on)",,Anonymous,Crime
Overhyped,"There are some interesting plot features such as his blind room-mate, but they ultimately don't contribute to the storyline (which is predictable and not very complex). Its as if they've been put in to hide the fact that this is an unoriginal mix of a fast and furious movie and a typical 'boy meets girl' love story. 
The main problem is the reliance on music. Music can make any moment in a film magical, but this relies heavily on a certain taste of music to boost any given seen above a mildly entertaining level. If you dont like this music, you dont like the film. I asked a few people why they liked it so much and they just said 'the music!!!!'. Its well choreographed, and I'd watch it for free on netflix but otherwise.... nothing to see here.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

fine action made cool,"Baby (Ansel Elgort) is the skilled getaway driver for robberies organized by Doc (Kevin Spacey). Baby has hearing problems after the crash that killed his parents. He is constantly listening to music to alleviate the symptoms. He owes money to Doc and is working it off. Doc recruits a rotating cast of characters in the robbery crew. Baby falls for waitress Debora (Lily James).Edgar Wright is the real star of the movie. The idea is pretty simple. The story is straight forward. The execution is superb. The car chases are fun with an exciting music soundtrack. There is his trademark close-ups but he doesn't do his usual long sequences. The acting is solid but Baby can be a distancing character. He says little and that is a wall from him at times. The rotating cast of characters also prevent great relationships from building up. Some of them have great scenes with him but they don't all have the needed time. Jon Bernthal has a great time poking at Baby but he's cut short. These are stylistic choices that probably pull back some of the bigger payoffs. While this is a fun execution, Baby is not a character who is bigger than the story. He's not quite at the same level as Ryan Gosling in Drive. It's partly Elgort. He's more a puppy version of the big dog. There are some fun moments. The comedy is sporadic but good. Overall, this is a fun ride.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
I Recommend That You Watch This At The Cinema To Fully Appreciate This Visual & Sound Spectacle As Intended!!,"Woooow what an experience!!If you only watch one film at the cinema this year,so far,then this is definitely worth going for for that buzz you won't get from a home viewing i guarantee! The marrying of sound, songs and visuals is of an outstanding beauty and originality!If like me you enjoy the unrelenting excitement of the recent batch of Fast And Furious films then you will love this film too. And this sprinkles a bit more viciousness on top from its characters as well. This film is just cool as F@$%!The music chosen works brilliantly throughout.The car action is jaw dropping. The performances from all the cast are great, the only change i would have made was having Griff(Jon Bernthal) play the Bats character instead of Jamie Foxx. I found Jon Bernthal to be way more menacing and threatening like the Bats role demanded, but thats not taking anything away from J.Foxx, he made it work too.I highly recommend this film for people in search of adrenaline pumping car action sequences, some pumping gun battles, some badass criminal characters in that pulp style and for people who don't mind a hint of romance in the vein of films like True Romance, The Getaway, etc, as it works brilliantly in this too.Highly original, never been done before and unless they do a sequel will never be done again i reckon, so do yourself a favour and go watch it.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Movie or music video?,"When I first checked Baby Driver on IMDb it had a rating of over 8/10 - this (and movies like John Wick, horrible, ridiculously overrated movie) have me wondering if someone has learned how to ""game"" the IMDb rating system.

"Fast, Exciting, Fun.","This is a movie about car chases, and Edgar Wright's script and direction expertly keeps this movie's pedal to the metal. It is relentless and never lets up, due in large part to the clever idea of playing a soundtrack of fun and exciting songs continuously throughout the movie with only the briefest of interruptions.The story is simple and unoriginal as can be: a young guy owes one last debt to a criminal boss, only to be sucked back into the world of crime while seeking a way out. But while lesser movies would bore us with a dozen redundant clich√© backstories, melodramatic romances and enough self-serious dialogue to make the Fast and the Furious series seem like Shakespeare, Wright avoids it all and focuses the attention on the thrills. Think ""Whiplash"" meets ""True Romance"" meets ""21"" and you've got a general idea of the movie.Wright's direction is as originally compelling as ever, and he's probably one of the only directors who can make pressing an elevator button seem cool. There is one particular scene in which the main character (""Baby"") is asked to survey the location of the next heist that has such a small yet smart twist that serves as a perfect microcosm for the elevation Wright brings to this genre.The acting is superb, with Jon Hamm's charismatically dangerous performance being the biggest standout, and Kevin Spacey's acting somehow manages not to chew up his scenes like one would expect. The film is not without its flaws ‚Äì there isn't a strong antagonist, the plot isn't smooth and some characters are in need of better payoffs ‚Äì but there's enough here for repeat viewings, or at the very least, a fun time at the movies.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Edgar Wright cranks up the tunes, turns on the ignition in Baby Driver, unique action driver film Baby Driver.","Baby, B.A.B.Y (Ansel Elgort) is a get a way driver hired by crime boss Doc (Kevin Spacey), who with his personal blend of music in ears drowning out his tinnitus becomes the best and most skilled driver ever to hit the road. However, in a underworld where doesn't belong, Baby tries to escape this life, especially as he meets waitress Deborah (Lilly James) Director: Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead, Scott Pilgrim) conjured this idea of a structure combination of music and action 2 decades ago with focus on the right soundtrack to match the driving action. He most certainly has demonstrated this in his quirky action-packed thriller.Delivering a new twist of action, correlated to the fantastic choices of music, Baby Driver becomes its own film setting the quirky, fun atmosphere through the immense soundtrack. Each song telling their own story and expressing the emotion and tone of each scene, but most importantly putting us in the driver seat of Baby, and the life he leads. With one most exhilarating opening credits scene.Driven with action packed sequences Baby Driver is full of fun and thrills, including the most impressive driving scene witness in a film for a long time. Well constructed sequences wonderfully put together consisting sensational shot tracking shots, and a non-stop thrill ride event occurring in the third act.What also Baby Driver is made of is, its foundation of classic drivers movies, including, Walter Hill's The Driver, Nicolas Winding Refn's Drive, and aspects of Arthur Penn's Bonnie and Clyde, but very much standing on its own legs, as Empire Magazine called it ""One of the most utterly original films in years."" Although I don't completely agree with the majority of that statement, but Wrights creative use of the soundtrack spark the unique magic that sparks Baby Driver.Although I can most certainly appreciate Wright's work, I undoubtedly do scratch my head as I necessarily don't quite understand what exactly about the film that earned it massive critical and public applause on this level. I perfectly enjoy it but seem to be missing this wow factor that has caught many others viewers.One of the stand out features of the film is the great ensemble performances, such as Elgort's closed off Baby a perfectly executed character. Opposite Spacey's Doc who chews up scenes with his Underwood like authoritative speeches and heist plans, then Lilly James' sweet waitress Deborah, although with little background acts the perfect love interest for Baby. The stand out for me was Jamie Fox's Bats, intense when he needs to be and a scene stealing rough mouth.Baby Driver is a wonderful mixture of action and music and car chases unique to the action genre. Although arguable I didn't quite meet the reaction that most others have reached, this is most certainly a film to enjoy, if you appreciate Wright's other works, enjoy a fun thrill ride adventure, or love jamming to your tunes while cruising in your vehicle. 8.2/10",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

"An action packed, spunky, thrill ride for everyone!","Baby Driver is the latest action/crime flick from Edgar Wright starring a hefty and talented cast that boasts a huge breath of refreshing air in a summer filled with mostly underwhelming blockbusters. This is definitely a fun film anyone of any demographic can have a good time with seeing as how to juggles all these different genres in a balanced way.Where the film succeeds the most is style and tone. The ""feel"" of this movie is consistent throughout its runtime and never tries to be anything than it's not. Musical elements are utilized to its fullest capacity by creating an almost music video vibe that strangely never becomes annoying but rather helps tell the story and engage the audience. Every scene with every piece of music feels completely intentional and never feels misplaced which gives the script and the talented cast room to shine their brightest.Fans of well developed characters and solid plot writing will find little to complain about this as well. Despite this being a straightforward crime/action flick, characters are well flushed out and the story itself is gripping to the point where you can't take your eyes off the screen. With the exception of one character decision that didn't get enough set up or pay off, every character is believable and portrayed wonderfully.The only restraints one might have with this movie is its unoriginality in its main character arc. If the viewer has seen enough crime films they'll know (or at least can predict) how it'll go and turn out for our hero. It also lacked some character pay off as mentioned before which can take a few people out of the movie. That being said, its execution feels so fresh that it's easy to forget you're watching a film you've seen before. Even after viewing, it still feels fresh and deserving of another viewing because of how much fun and care went into making this picture.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Although not as good as his other works, this new movie is still great","I watched this movie with a group of friends, and all of us when coming out of the theatre had the same opinion of the movie. It was great! Although I do think it isn't as great as Edgar Wright's I still think this movie is great.First of all the comedy in the movie while not all of it had everyone falling out their seat laughing it was still very funny, the gag with Baby's glasses was a highlight I wasn't expecting to think would be that funny but it worked.The action was phenomenal. I feel like the editing made me much more interested in what was going on as well. Also the way the music linked into the action just was excellent. It made the action scenes into like a dance routine, this made the action interesting and also added a slight comedic element to the action, which i thought was a good thing.I also very much enjoyed the chemistry between Baby and Debora was great but I can't go into detail as I really don't understand how to say it.Another small thing that I loved was when there wasn't any music playing there was a slight ringing in the background which gave us a slight idea of what Baby has to deal with in his life. If this was on purpose or it was just a problem with my screening I do not know.So yes this movie is definitely worth watching.

The way the music is used is impressive and fits naturally with events on screen, regardless of many of those events not being engaging enough to keep me from daydreaming about my personal life while the film plays on before me. The music hitting at the right time was really the only thing ripping me out of my own thoughts and back into the narrative.Those who are excited by car chases, sunglasses, trendy styles & simple dialogue need apply.

Absolutely Brilliant!,"Let me cut to the chase: this movie is awesome! Pure and simple. Edgar Wright is a f*cking genius. What he is able to do in crafting this movie is just mindblowing. It is so slick and razor sharp, that I had a hard time thinking about just how much work actually went into the production design, the editing, the cinematography, the sound editing, and the direction in order to have everything run as smoothly as it did. I'd say there is music playing for about 75% of this movie, and it isn't just some random pop songs playing in the background. The movie is entirely constructed around its soundtrack. Every frame, every shot, and every action happens to perfectly coincide with the music. And it's edited to a T! It is stylized in the best way, and it just comes across as a beautiful orchestra of visual awesomeness. If you look in the background, you can see graffiti on the buildings that has some of the song lyrics, and its timed that you hear it in the song as Baby walks past this graffiti. That's the level of care and attention that went into every shot of this movie, and I was blown away by it. There were elegant long shots that you could tell were endless rehearsed and prepped in order to flow seamlessly with the music. There are few movies where I genuinely don't know how they did or pulled something off, and this is one of those movies.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Edgar Wright's Best Movie Yet,"Edgar Wright can really do no wrong. Hot Fuzz was a hit. The World's End was a hit. Shaun Of The Dead was a hit. But Baby Driver is a grand slam home run. Really, this movie is amazing and there's so much good about it that there's not much to say about anything bad in this movie.First, Edgar Wright has managed to create an awesome original movie that is not a sequel, remake, or reboot. And he has also managed to create a movie that is 100x cooler than anything Quentin Tarantino has made in the last 10 years. Really, this movie is cool on multiple levels. Baby is an intriguing character in his own right. As is his love interest, Debora the waitress. But when you add such veteran actors as Kevin Spacey, Jamie Foxx and Jon Hamm to the mix along with an eccentric cast of newcomers and veterans to the mix (like Red Hot Chili Peppers' bassist Flea), the film becomes something much more than a simple action flick.Second, the soundtrack. This is a movie set in modern times so it needs a modern soundtrack. Edgar Wright could have gone the 70's nostalgia route like so many before him. But this one is way different. It's like visiting your vintage record store. There's 30 songs on the soundtrack, all from various decades of music from the 1950s to the present modern era of music. Each track was meticulously chosen, and is more than just mere background noise. The songs often take on a life of their own and during the scenes, you can actually see the songs become a part of the scene. While most movies put the soundtrack in the background and try to burn as much music as they can, Baby Driver actually weaves the music into each scene and it becomes almost organic. Like the soundtrack is a secondary character in the movie.The songs in the movie are as brilliant as the movie itself. This isn't just some collection of nostalgia tunes slapped together for background effect, this is the real deal. You have such diverse and eccentric music as Queen, Beck, The Damned, Sam & Dave, Blur, Simon & Garfunkel, Barry White, Dave Brubeck, Focus, and more. After watching the movie, go buy the soundtrack. Preferably on vinyl, really, any other format kind of defeats the purpose. Although Baby himself prefers an iPod. So you can buy it on iTunes.Third, the action sequences. While it's best to go into the movie spoiler-free, the action sequences aren't just mere action sequences. They really make you want to go rent a Mustang or a Camaro and burn some serious rubber. This movie has some of the best action and driving sequences that have not been seen in a movie for a very long time. This is more in tune with some of the all time classic action films like Goldfinger or Bullit. Amazing action sequences combined with serious character development makes Baby Driver a really intriguing film.So in short go see this movie. Then crank up the tunes and burn some rubber. Then go watch all of Edgar Wright's other movies. Support originality in Hollywood.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Doc (Kevin Spacey)If you like your romantic heists with bite, such as above and as in Quentin Tarantino's films, Edgar Wright (Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy) has raised the style bar because Baby Driver is a major hoot as well as a solidly violent thriller. It's as if Tarantino took Tony Scott's True Romance and David Lynch's Wild at Heart and married them to his own Reservoir Dogs.It's all silly but so amusing as to be almost real. For those of us who love wise cracking and wise guys, Baby Driver is fully satisfactory: ""Don't feed me any more lines from 'Monsters Inc.'! It pisses me off!""

Meeting a lovely waitress, childlike almost like himself, Debora (Lily James), Baby wants out of the driving business, but that's not easy. Doc has plans for his good luck charm, Baby.While things do get violent, with not much actual blood, it's the minimal-CGI driving of which Steve McQueen would fully approve and Drive's Ryan Gosling could only envy. Dick Pope's cinematography and the stunt driving magicians let you feel a part of the entertaining spins, flips, and reverses in an adrenaline rush usually reserved just for the drivers. Baby is a first-rate, formula-like driver with a stoic mien that drives even the seasoned hoods crazy.The film can rightly be called a car chase musical or a heist film cum romance. From Bellbottoms by Jon Spencer Blues Explosion to Tequila by the Button Down Brass and Brighton Rock by Queen to Nowhere to Hide by Martha and the Vandellas, the soundtrack is rockin' with dozens of oldies and goodies just right for plot and for keeping things, violent as they are, light.Baby moves to the beats of the music only he hears‚Äîwith a good tune coming out of his ear plugs, he's the best driver of any heist you have ever seen.

"Tightly edited and stylishly presented, but not my cup of tea...","I found elements of music video sequences, Grand Theft Auto shootouts/robberies, and slick and exciting car chase/escape scenes that appear to be actual stunt work and little CGI in Edgar Wright's opus. It contains impressive performances by Jamie Foxx, Jon Hamm, and Lily James. And Kevin Spacey brought a gravitas that was a little more than OK, but nothing like his Verbal from Usual Suspects; more like Hopper from A Bugs Life (and that isn't a poke). Nonetheless, Elgort's take on the young getaway driver indebted to Spacey's crime boss ""Doc"" didn't go deep enough for me to really feel for the character's plight.Wright does many things right in setting up the story and conflict. No scene is wasted; there are no Chekov's guns; there isn't one line of dialogue that comes across as completely unnecessary. Yet, I couldn't get attached to the characters enough to either enjoy the ride or care for the outcomes.While leaving the theater with my 19yo son, I was reminded of how much I liked Mad Max Fury Road and for what? It was a hell of an action flick with colorful and bold characters but without a compelling story arc. At least Edgar Wright fleshed out a story that carries the film more. But, though my 19yo son really dug this one (he was ""eh"" on Fury Road though understood my love of it), I just didn't enjoy this cup of tea...or rather cup of coffee.Still B+ for good editing, action and acting.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"This Year's Smartest Thrill Ride has Arrived, and Baby's Driving","The opening bank heist sequence -- set to the backdrop of ""Bellbottoms"" by The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion -- is indication enough that¬†Baby Driver¬†is, quite literally, driven by its music, and I'm so glad I went along for the ride. Edgar Wright's latest film is a stroke of pure genius.Baby (Ansel Elgort) is a getaway driver for some pretty nasty people. Of course, he doesn't ever partake in the actual heisting -- expressing distaste in blood and gore at nearly every turn -- as he just waits outside for his crew (different every time), jamming out over sweet tunes to drown out his tinnitus. Or, as gang leader Doc (Kevin Spacey) puts it: his ""hum in the drum.""During one of Baby's regular coffee runs he meets Debora (Lily James), a diner waitress who's cheerful energy evokes within him a desire to escape from the business that started out as debt fulfillment -- ""to head west on the 20, in a car we can't afford, with a plan we don't have."" The problem, and the main source of conflict, is how difficult it actually is to get away from the getaway profession. And with such note-perfect direction from Wright, we are swiftly guided through this musically driven experience that uses its melodies -- from the likes of Queen, Martha Reeves & The Vandellas, The Shake, The Five Stairsteps and many others -- to enhance the narrative. Much like¬†La La Land¬†did last year. It's like a musical in disguise!It's also really innovative in the way that it comes across as an elongated dance routine; never before have we seen a film that matches the rhythm of its music -- all chosen before writing the script -- with the beats of sound, movement and dialogue scattered throughout, in the way¬†Baby Driver¬†does. Fasten your seat belts, people. This is one ride you won't want to miss out on.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Great rhythm, every sense of the word","With Baby Driver I got exactly what I expected, and that's in no way a bad thing: Brilliantly directed action and many highly stylised scenes that have become a welcomed staple for this director.Something that everyone who's seen this film is talking about is the choreographed action that lines up perfectly with the movie's charismatic soundtrack, and sometimes it even becomes it's own soundtrack entirely. It's a fresh addition that makes the movie feel it's own, but I fear for some it may come off as a bit of a gimmick. I loved it regardless.Some of the problems with the movie are the villains, which there are multiple of. Jamie Fox came off as a bit too superficial, and really didn't sell me on anything he did. He seemed more like an actor playing a role than the crazed maniac that he was trying to be. Everyone is praising John Ham who I thought was great at first but in the latter half of the movie he seemed way too ott for my liking. I know that that's kinda Wright's style but he came off a little too cheesy for me. Kevin Spacey I thought was interesting as the mysterious boss figure but later on fell a bit flat considering his ending.If you've seen other Edgar Wright you can gauge with some accuracy what this will have in store for you, and I definitely recommend this if you were a big fan of Wright's Scott Pilgrim film.

"So what happens when you mix a music video with a mediocre action movie?  You get a strangely fresh, audacious and sassy crime musical from the director of Shaun of the Dead","As I watched Edgar Wright's Baby Driver, another movie came to my mind in comparison: Nicholas Winding Refn's Drive. These movies are in many ways different but are both about getaway drivers with strange names. Despite its visual style and all the talent involved, Drive disappointed me personally due to all the over-hyped acclaim from critics and its excruciatingly slow pace all the way through. Baby Driver makes Drive look like Battlefield Earth. This is a movie with enough fun and originality to tick the boxes off to becoming one of the better summer blockbusters of 2017. After his clashing involvement with Ant-Man, Edgar Wright is back on track again, even though this isn't his best work.Here we have Baby, a getaway driver working for a mob boss with a gang of rivals, but he has a special trick up his sleeve he has compared to the others: he can listen to music for 24 hours straight and while he drives, playing different songs that demonstrate the mood that he feels at every moment. He comes across a waitress named Debora (played nicely by Lily James) who he starts to date, but then a final job pops up in the pipeline that causes everything going for him to be sacrificed. Some plot points feel familiar here, but it is the superpower-like idea of music that gives them a shakeup. Had it not been present, the movie would feel unoriginal obviously, but the cast may have saved it from becoming a disaster. Who knows and who cares? What we have here is good enough.This is writer/director Wright's first film to be shot in the United States, which feels like a risky detour for his filmmaking roots, but the end result is, after his four-year directorial absence since The World's End, he luckily hasn't skipped a beat. This is his most unlikely film since Scott Pilgrim vs. the World but is thankfully and once again a very good, if not quite great, feature. You see and feel his love for music and cars, but his trademark style is often hard to find. There are no comedic scene transitions (probably as this isn't billed as a comedy) in the editing and his frantic camera movements have dialled down slightly, which makes his latest feature all the more interesting and experimental.The other thing that makes this a different Wright movie is the use of an all American cast: Jamie Foxx, Kevin Spacey, Ansel Elgort, Jon Hamm, Lily James, you name it, a bit of a Tarantino-like collaboration going on. Elgort is flat-out amazing as Baby, conducting an often expressionless character but with a confident brain. He has the heart of an old school heartthrob in the music scenes and is engagingly subtle in the more intense scenes. Spacey is as good playing an average mob boss as he can ever be, while Foxx is on fine form and Hamm is what you can expect from a cut-throat mob rival as he pulls off rough facial expressions.To call this a Mamma Mia! for people who didn't like the 2008 hit would be an understatement. Car chases and shootouts are present, but songs in the background give the crime genre a layer of soul, creative juice that has been thrown off so often by bleak atmosphere and bloody violence. There are a few long takes of singing that try to compete with the musical numbers from La La Land but with already published lyrics. Whenever the songs are absent, the film descends into action thriller territory and leaves you yearning for the next cue. When they're rolling, the film is a music video stretched to feature length.While starting well and ending with hope, it drags slightly midway through as it bogs down telling the story in a serious manner, and the final showdown feels a tad formulaic, forgetting to be original like the rest of the movie. But they are saved by a jazzy atmosphere and nicely chosen songs (look out for Queen). It isn't as wacky as Scott Pilgrim nor as funny and iconic as the Cornetto trilogy, and the cinematography and costume design are nothing special, but what you can safely say about Baby Driver is that it is not a noisy and soulless migraine like the rest of modern action flicks. It has a brain, confidence at influencing pop culture and, finally, a bit of pride for writing and directing in the action genre. Now that's really saying something.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"VERY Original, VERY fun","Walking into the movie BABY DRIVER, I had heard some strong superlatives - ""very original"", ""haven't ever seen anything like it"", ""a thrilling combination of action and music"". ¬†So, when I went into the Cineplex to see what the fuss was all about, I sat in my seat with my arms crossed and said ""prove it"".And ""prove it"" they did.BABY DRIVER is a ""very original"" film that combines music and action in such a way that I have not seen before. ¬†Writer/Director Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, Scott Pilgrim vs. The World) has a unique vision with the look, feel and storytelling style of this film and delivers - strongly - on all accounts.Starring Ansel Elgort (The Fault in Our Stars, Divergent) as Baby who is a getaway driver for a ""crime boss"". ¬†Due to an accident as a youth, Baby has Tinnitus - a constant ringing in his ears - and copes with it by drowning the ringing out with constant music playing through his earbuds. ¬†Consequently, we see the world through Baby's eyes - or more accurately - we experience the world through Baby's ears and so almost the entirety of the action that unfolds in front of us is played to a musical soundtrack that plays out of Baby's i-Pod.Elgort's performance as Baby is strong - keeping the emotion going on his face, even though he has a tendency to not say much. ¬†Director Wright was smart to realize that the color of this film would have to come from the criminals that are in Baby's world - and he casts extremely strong actors to portray these crooks. ¬†Starting with Kevin Spacey as the crime boss who brings crooks together for a job. ¬†Spacey shows that he still ""has it"" and brings a strong screen presence to every scene he is in.Ably assisting in this ""rogues gallery"" ¬†are Jon Hamm (in his best role since MadMen), Jon Bernthal ¬†(his usual menacing self), relative unknown (at least to me) Eiza Gonzalez (who is more than ""just a pretty face"" here) and Flea (yes, Flea!). ¬†All of these performances are strong, but they pale in comparison to the ""jump off the screen"" performance of Jamie Foxx as ""Bats"" a criminal who got that nickname because he is ""Bat-Sh**"" crazy - and he is.Also joining in is Lily James (Cinderella) as Baby's love interest. ¬†I've stated earlier about good and bad chemistry between actors. ¬†James and Elgort HAVE strong chemistry with each other and I believe that they have fallen in love - even though they meet at the beginning of the film.The best part of this film is that these strong performances play a supporting role to the dance that is the combination of music and action. ¬†As I stated earlier, Director Wright brings a singular vision to the screen and this vision¬†plays out marvelously over the 1 hour 53 minutes playing time - never wearing out it's welcome and knowing when to get off the screen.This film isn't for everyone - it is ACTION and MUSIC with strong characters. ¬†But, if you like this sort of thing (and I do) it is a very ORIGINAL entry into this genre.Letter Grade: ¬†A9 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(OfMarquis)",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Elevator pitch: Vroom Vroom Land,"Vroom Vroom Land.Well put-together tone-consistent music-driven car-action mayhem flick with character moves and flourishes reminiscent of La La Land. And it brought with it the alienation from reality that this did to the story in La La Land too. I'm feeling the whole time like this is a fun amusement park ride but far far from reality. Mayhem gets tawdry and obscene when it's far from reality, like blood and gun murders are acceptable and fun; no, they're scary and wrong.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Easily my favorite Edgar Wright Film,"Plot: After being coerced into working for a crime boss, a young getaway driver finds himself taking part in a heist doomed to fail.I was so happy walking out of this film, I was worried that this would be a case like Mad Max Fury Road where everyone praised it and it turned out to be not that good, but this is not the case. This film combined music and action in a very original and interesting way, which was nice to see in a crime film. The story managed to be engaging, exciting and even tense towards the last half.The cast all did a really good with their characters, the standouts being Ansel Elgort, Jon Hamm, Jamie Foxx, and Kevin Spacey who all put effort into their characters and made them interesting. I was especially happy with Lily James being given a proper character unlike in Pride Prejudice and Zombies, she was very likable, and had really good chemistry with Ansel throughout the film. The action is also really good, especially the car chases which are some of the best that I've seen in a while.This is the kind of summer film that Hollywood should be doing now, not all the reboots, remakes, or even sequels that come out now. I've liked most of Edgar Wright's films throughout, but this one stood out to me more than those. This film is a definite to see in the theater, you won't regret it.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Fun Ride,"Baby Driver is a lot of fun, the first half is probably one the most enjoyable movie I have seen this year. The action and car chases are crisp, well shot, and exciting, with great comedy and visual flair in between. It manages to go from intense car chases that feel like the Italian Job to fun strolls across town that come straight out of La La Land in consecutive scenes, and it feel natural. Ansel Elgort brings charm to the driver, Baby, and Kevin Spacey, Jon Hamm, Jamie Foxx, Jon Bernthal, and Eiza Gonzalez bring a lot of personality to their criminal underworld. Unfortunately, Edgar Wright can't quite maintain the fast paced joy ride for the whole film and rather than building up to the final heist and its hectic aftermath, it feels like Edgar Wright ran out of steam and the wit and visual style that elevated the first half are replaced with action movie clich√©s.Despite that, Baby Driver is still a good movie, packed with fun and it looks like it will have tons of rewatchability. But, it began as a movie that could be an all time classic, and was not quite able to keep up that level of excellence.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Pure cinema!,"Calling BABY DRIVER a feature length car chase music video seems like it's not doing it justice. Here is a film that painstakingly syncs each scene with each appropriate needledrop song to make it look like the most audacious musical ever, but it offers so much more than that. Offering the same, shameless glee of earnest romance, over-the-top car chases, and effective gun-to-gun thrillers of decades past, BABY DRIVER is simply everything. It's top down genre mix taping, courtesy of an inspired and precise auteur of Edgar Wright who did the same idea with video games back with SCOTT PILGRIM.Taken as a music video compilation though, it's pretty much next level. Each minute action and lip-synching is precisely matched to each 70-80s song that actually complements the circumstances of the plot. It's at times funny, foreshadowing, and at times grim, rewarding a lot of repeated viewings without being obscure.Taken as a homage to old, sleazy action movies, it's as much inspired. Rather than being full-on parody like the Kornetto trilogy, it embraces its genre inconography, reminding us why we like it in the first place. That's why each car chase, running, and gunfight sequence looks almost as great as early Walter Hill flicks or this years JOHN WICK. Heck, there's a shootout warehouses scene that's so awesome it puts the entirety of FREE FIRE to shame!Admits all of that though the movie is never oblivious to any genuine character moments and ace performances. Wright manages to accomplish specific character twists that both retorts their standard traits while also adding depth to them. For example, both John Hamm and Kevin Spacey might just be the breakout performances of this movie based solely on how they subvert our impressions of them. Ansel Egort does wonders in a role that seems too much like a clich√©d wonder boy role, but comes aces as his own complex character. Baby's relationship with Debra feels like it's ripped wholesale from a Nick Sparks movie, but the execution feels honest and vacant of any BS contrivances.BABY DRIVER is not only a testament to Edgar Wrights craftsmanship, but also a testament to how any genre film far from Hollywood dreck can still be as successful as this. The action is amazing, the music rocks, the performances are great, the cinematography and editing are pitch-perfect, and it all offers a bravura of thrills without sacrificing a true artists vision. It is pure cinema and one of the best films of the year.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
One of 2017's Brightest Films (So Far...),"Baby Driver, stars Ansel Elgort, Jon Hamm, Jamie Foxx and Kevin Spacey and is the latest film written and directed by Edgar Wright. Baby Driver, tells the story of, Baby, a getaway driver who finds himself taking part in a heist that is doomed to fail. Now I have been a huge Edgar Wright fan for years now, he brings such a unique flavour to Hollywood with his creative storytelling, and distinctive editing. All of his films feel fresh and it's easy to tell a lot of heart gets poured into them and Baby Driver is no exception.I had not seen anything for the film prior to seeing to it, apart from a few T.V. spots here and there, so I was walking into theatre with a fresh pair of eyes and I left with such a giddy feeling. Baby Driver is a real good film, it has tight editing, a good story and rich characters, I could really see this movie standing the test of time and becoming a ""classic"" in the years to follow. The film meticulously crafted, with many scenes in time with the rhythm of the music to go along with the theme of the film and the protagonist's love for music.All the leads give good performances, especially Ansel Elgort who I really bought into as someone who is a hermit and doesn't speak much, and Jamie Foxx who was super menacing. There came a point halfway through the film where Foxx's character really got under my skin, and that wasn't solely due to the great writing but also the intensity he brought to his role. Now the only minor complaint I have is from Jon Hamm, although the role was legitimately written for him, there was something about his performance that just felt off. I'm not sure whether he just felt old for the role, or if it had something to due with how he portrayed his character or if it was my preconceived notion of Jon Hamm always being a good charismatic guy, he was still good nonetheless, I think I had just expected more.Now although I really enjoyed this film from start-to-finish, I did find the first half of the movie to be pretty by-the-numbers, I understand it was meant to set up for a crazy third act, I just felt a little underwhelmed by the first forty-five minutes. Also I found the very end of the climax to be a little hokey, it seemed to have went a little too over-the-top, but the rest of the movie makes up for these small complaints.Overall Baby Driver, was a really solid film. I've been impressed with the amount of big budget original films we've gotten so far this year and I am happy to say that this film ranks up there with some of the best released in 2017. I do highly recommend going out to see this film, especially in theatres, as it is a unique film that isn't solely made for the purpose of the studio cashing in. I cannot wait to watch this movie again and really tear into the easter eggs scattered throughout. Baby Driver was a solid outing from Edgar Wright and I am eagerly looking forward to seeing what else he has up his sleeve and for that reason, Baby Driver gets a 8.5/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Brilliant, but ho-hum.","Okay, so I watched Series One of Spaced last week. I watched Hot Fuzz last night. I pretty much have Shaun of the Dead memorized, word for word, camera angle to camera angle. I got myself fully into the Edgar Wright Zone. Tonight, I saw this film on the big screen, my first Edgar Wright big screen experience since seeing World's End for the second time. And it was fun. Lots of chases, lots of gunplay., lots and lots of Kevin Spacey, Jamie Foxx, and Jon Hamm chewing up the scenery (although, it must be said, not enough of Flea with his prosthetic nose). The soundtrack was brilliant, and warranted by the plot. So why do I feel let down?The problem, I think, is that on some level I expected Edgar Wright to do something more with the form. All of the actors do very well performing their roles, but all of them are playing basic stock characters: the Innocent Kid who has been coerced into a life of crime, his crippled Foster-father trying to keep him on the straight-and-narrow, his naive, wholesome Love Interest, the sinister Mastermind, the psychopathic street wise Gangsta, the sociopathic Whiteboy thrill seeker with his sultry Moll, etc, etc. All well and good, but all something we've seen before.With Baby Driver, Edgar Wright proves that he can make a heist/car chase/shoot 'em up movie as well or better than any other director. No one doubted that he could. I just wanted him to do something subversive with the form.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Stylish, charming and fun but not naturally so","I've always liked Edgar Wright's films without loving them. They're always stylish and fun but also lacking something for my liking. 'Baby Driver' is no different. No one could argue just how stylish this film is. It oozes charisma and charm just from this alone. Then there's the tremendous cast and the spectacular performances Wright gets out of them. Kevin Spacey, in what may turn out to have been one of his final roles, was his usual superb self. Ansel Elgort has even been nominated for a Golden Globe for his performance. Jamie Foxx is also one of my favourite actors working today. The charm that man possesses is almost second to none.What held me back from loving this film though (and most of Wright's films I suspect) is that they sometimes feel like they're trying too hard. I often compare them to Quentin Tarantino's films. Both make quite different films but have a similar method at the same time. In Tarantino's films the style and charm he manages to achieve seem so natural and like there was no other way that scene could have gone down. With Wright's films it feels the opposite. It feels like they achieve it, but far from naturally. I also had trouble buying the love story in this film. I think a little more effort could have been put into making sure the audience understood why he loved this woman so much. Definitely a fun watch, make no mistake about that. Even bordering on a must-see film, but it's still far from perfect.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
One of Wright's best films (and the year's)!,"'BABY DRIVER': Five Stars (Out of Five)The new action-comedy from writer/director Edgar Wright. It stars Ansel Elgort as a young and extremely talented getaway driver, that's blackmailed into working for a team of professional bank robbers. The movie also stars Lily James, Kevin Spacey, Jon Hamm, Jamie Foxx, Eiza Gonzalez, Jon Bernthal and Flea. It's received nearly unanimous positive reviews from critics so far (it's currently 98% positive on Rottentomatoes), and it's also received nearly unanimous positive reviews from viewers as well. I agree with everyone else, it's one of the year's very best films!Baby (Elgort) was in a horrible car accident as a child, which killed both his parents and gave him tinnitus for the rest of his life. He blocks the illness out by constantly listening to music now, which also makes him extremely skilled at things like driving. When a bank robber kingpin, named Doc (Spacey), caught Baby stealing from him (when he was younger), he blackmailed him into being his most skilled getaway driver (on every heist). After Baby pays Doc back though, everything he owed him, he wants out of his life of crime now. He's also met a young woman (James) he really likes, who also likes him a lot as well. Doc won't let his best, and most reliable, driver leave him that easily though.The movie is extremely well written; it's full of great character development and witty dialogue. It's actually reminiscent of a Tarantino movie in that way, but with Wright's uniquely talented touch too obviously. The characters are all well cast as well, and the action scenes are breathless. There's multiple fully exhilarating car chases in it, and there's also an awesome foot chase scene too (that's inspired by one of Wright's favorite films, 'POINT BREAK'). The soundtrack is also equally cool, and it's always fittingly placed (in a stunningly beautiful way). The movie is a classic waiting to happen, in every way, and it's also one of Wright's best films (and the year's)!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/mxz-nUpMk6Y",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Radar Love and Hocus Pocus,"Those are two great songs from the 1970s, used here in the movie. American film, which, as usual in recent years, abounds in retro American music hits. This time, I appreciated the musical taste of the one who chose the songs, because they are European, both Dutch productions, Radar Love by Golden Earring, and Hocus Pocus by Focus, two of the greatest rock groups ever. About the film: it's a good entertaining action movie, containing also a special kind of love story. Ansel Elgort is OK. Jon Hamm is very efficient. Eiza Gonz√°lez is efficient too and beautiful. Kevin Spacey, charming as usual but much fatter than usual. Jamie Foxx is better and better, great personality, in my humble opinion, greater than Denzel Washington and Sidney Poitier and other black actors. Last but not least, I think I'm in love!

Empty attempt at being 'stylish',"I think this film only made it to cinemas cause it has managed to involve household names such as Kevin Spacey and Jamie Foxx (why these great actors ever said yes to this project heaven knows). It is a thoroughly empty and soul-less attempt to be a stylish new thing, but falls to the ground with a thud. Nikolas Winding Refn's film Drive has already done everything that Baby Driver tries to do. Where Drive succeeded in telling a mysterious, deep story involving romance and action at the same time as having a unique auteur style, Baby Driver falls short in every respect. There is nothing wrong with the cast as such, Im sure the actors do their very best with a thin plot and an even thinner dialogue. Why this film has received such high ratings on IMDb is the real mystery!",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
You make wrong things right,"Greetings again from the darkness. If his movies are any indication, writer/director Edgar Wright would be fun to hang out with. He thrives on action and humor, and seems committed to making movies that are entertaining, rather than philosophical life statements. Many know his work from Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, The World's End), while others are fans of Scott Pilgrim vs. the World. High concept, high energy and a creative use of music are identifiable traits within Mr. Wright's films, all of which are crucial to the success of his latest.Ansel Elgort (excellent in The Fault in Our Stars) stars as Baby, a freakishly talented getaway driver paying off a debt to a no-nonsense crime boss Doc played by Kevin Spacey. Baby has an unusual movie affliction ‚Äì a childhood accident killed his parents and left him with tinnitus. He compensates for the constant ringing in his ear by listening to music through ear buds attached to one of his many iPods (depending on his mood). In fact, his insistence on finding just the right song for the moment adds a colorful element to each escape route.The film opens with what may be its best car chase scene and the hyper-kinetic approach sets the stage for something a bit different than what we usually see. There are no car drops from airplanes or train-jumping (I'm looking at you Fast and Furious franchise). Instead these are old school chases in the mode of Bullitt, or more precisely, Walter Hill's 1978 The Driver (Mr. Hill appears briefly here as a courtroom reporter). A heist-romance-chase film with a diverse and truly remarkable selection of songs, high energy, more than a few comedic moments (the Mike Myers mask sequence is brilliant) and a recurring Monsters, Inc quote requires a strong lead, and young Mr. Elgort aces the test. Baby is the DJ to his own life, and possesses a moral compass that others on his jobs can't comprehend. It's a heart of gold in a bad spot.Spacey plays Doc with his chilling dead-eyed stare, and even has his own moment of action sporting an automatic weapon during a violent shootout. Spacey's various crime teams (he varies the pairings) include psycho-lovebirds Buddy (Jon Hamm in his continuing effort to distance from Don Draper) and Darling (Eiza Gonzalez), Jon Bernthal, Flea, and an aptly named Bats (Jamie Foxx), who is not the clearest thinker of the bunch. Other supporting work comes courtesy of the rarely seen songwriter/actor Paul Williams, musician Sky Ferreira (as Baby's beloved mother), young Brogan Hall as Doc's talented nephew, and CJ Jones as Baby's foster father. Mr. Jones is one of the few deaf movie actors and he adds much to Baby's life outside of crime.The crucial role of Baby's love interest goes to the very talented and likable Lily James (Pride and Prejudice and Zombies) as singing waitress Debora, who introduces him to Carla Thomas' ""B-A-B-Y"" song, while he plays ""Debora"" from T.Rex for her. She and Baby share the not overly ambitious life plan: ""to head west in a car I can't afford and a plan I don't have"". They are good together and that helps make up for the always cringe-inducing red flag of ""one last job"" prior to the lovers running away together.Buried in the Miscellaneous Crew is Choreographer Ryan Heffington, who deserves at least some of the credit for the most unique and creative aspect of the presentation. This appears to be a movie fit to the music, rather than music fit to the movie. There are some astounding sequences where the drum/bass beats are right on cue with the action ‚Äì gunfire, driving, and character movements. ""Harlem Shuffle"" plays as Baby playfully dances past graffiti and sidewalk obstacles that perfectly match the beat and lyrics. We see what is likely the best ever movie use of ""Bellbottoms"", and without question, the most creatively brilliant use of ""Hocus Pocus"" by Focus. At times exhilarating to the senses, the infusion of comedy shots and new love help offset the tension of crime jobs and the thrill of the chase.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

A gimmick... but what a gimmick!,"Version I saw: UK cinema release
Actors: 6/10
Plot/script: 5/10
Photography/visual style: 8/10
Music/score: 8/10
Overall: 7/10Baby Driver is essentially a gimmick: heart-thumping action scenes set to music, and literally choreographed to fit the rhythm and tune of the music. Every other aspect of the film is either arrayed to support this, or deprioritized. The plot and characters are a jigsaw of cliches, even given tropey names like 'Baby' (Ansel Elgort), 'Buddy' (John Hamm) and 'Doc' (Kevin Spacey). It's a cookie-cutter heist-gone-wrong story that you have seen many times over.
That is all that's required though, because the chases and fights are fantastic. The energy, already high due to writer/director Edgar Wright's expert hand, is enhanced by the music, making it more immersive, and definitely more exciting.
I emerged from the cinema practically dancing to the sounds coming out of my MP3 player, just like Baby.

The Movie Feels Like It was Directed by 3 Directors,"The first 45 minutes of the movie is really intriguing and it absorbs the audience with joy and fun. You don't understand how time passes in this part.

I would describe the 30-35 minutes part of this movie mediocre. In comparison, the 35 minutes part had more character development but had less enjoyable parts about driving and music, which I think were the best parts of the movie. The ending though I didn't like a bit. The movie went bonkers in a really childish way with unbelievable action scenes and I felt like they came from a cheap action movie. The only thing I loved about this part was how different it feel when there is no music, it kind of gave a rather interesting message. Like I said, the movie feels like it was directed by 3 directors. The 1st one is trying to direct a fun movie about driving and music, the 2nd one is trying to do a mediocre action movie, and 3rd one is just there to mess this movie up because of some revenge or whatnot I have no idea.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"A Movie Actually Deserving of the Title ""Perfect Summer Movie""","I think mostly everyone can find something in this movie that they would enjoy. The chase scenes feel realistic and intense unlike many of the current car focused movies like the Fast and Furious franchise (apparently many of those scenes where shot with a stunt driver and very little CGI if any at all was actually used, which always is nice to see). The music in this movie blends well and never felt out of place. Is it Guardians of the Galaxy level amazing... debatable but Baby Driver will definitely have one of the better soundtracks this year.The comedy throughout was well timed and most of the characters showed off their own sense of humor. There was really no comic relief character although many of the movies funnier scenes would be attributed to Jamie Foxx. The high level of comedy in this movie should be no surprise as director Edgar Wright known for the Cornetto Trilogy always knows how to insert the right joke.All of the characters were great for the screen time they were given. My personal favorite was Buddy. When it comes to playing an intimidating character Hamm can do no wrong. He had the right level of charm with don't mess with me that made Baby feel safe and uneasy at the same time. Speaking of Baby, I wasn't too fond of the character right away. He seemed kind of dorky and trying to be cute with the street walking scene. Eventually though he became a rather interesting character, especially when he meets up with the waitress. You start feeling for him and you want those two to make it. James and Elgort had good chemistry and they will probably stand out as one of the better movie couples in 2017.Everything in this movie was just so well done. The only real hit this movie takes that I can think of after just watching it was that the story kind of dips in the interesting department in the middle. It starts strong and ends with an even bigger bang. I believe the climax and ending are worth the price of the theater ticket alone. This is a can't miss movie. I find myself debating if this is a movie that I have to see in the theaters twice which I rarely even consider. There however is no doubt in my mind that this will be a store purchase as I can see myself watching this movie over and over again.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
So much fun,"""Baby Driver"" is a generic heist action flick synched to the main character's iPod playlist. There could be more substance, but the sharp visuals and flawless direction are enough to deliver some solid entertainment.The script is Edgar Wright's first effort as a solo writer, and unfortunately, it felt a bit too simplistic and lackluster compared to his other productions. Characters are as memorable as they are cartoony, their backstories. Their motivations and personal relationships get hardly explored, and there are a bit too many contrived plot points towards the end. Due to the film's hybrid nature, it's not clear if we are supposed to think of it as a regular action film or just a parody of the genre.Nevertheless, it's an excellent film for a casual, relaxed evening, with some surprisingly thrilling car chases and action sequences for a comedy director.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Edgar Wright at full speed.,"When Edgar Wright left Ant-man, I was really bummed that we would never to get to see his vision of the film. Luckily he makes up for with Baby Driver.Baby Driver's story is a fairly simple and familiar premise. Young getaway driver who works for a mob boss wishes to escape his life of crime and falls in love but is pulled into one last job. The angle that makes this story different from other action films is the tinnitus aspect giving Baby the need to listen to the rhythm of music to stay focused. And from there the film analyzes how music is a reflection on Baby's emotion and past. The tension builds as we get into Baby's head and he is forced to work even closer then usual with the criminal cohorts he is familiar. There he learns just how truly messed up and dangerous they really are. The layers and twist continue build up the depth of the story.This is sharpest I have seen Edgar Wright with his directing, and editing. Scenes that could feel tiring or repetitive in less capable hands are constantly injected with fresh and unique ways to marvel at. They're a lot of visual cues that any Edgar Wright fan will recall from his previous films. Things like long tracking shots, the editing being in sync with sound effects and music, background visuals reflecting the character's mood and story all exist in this film but they feel like Wright has taken them to a new level with his artistic style.This is probably one of the few movies where both characters and actors are a perfect match. Ansel Elgort is the true standout. At 23-years old, he is known mostly for teen dramas but now proves that he is more then capable to play a character as cool and complex as Baby. Elgort does not rely on too much dialogue to show the emotion that Baby feels through the movement of his body when listening to music. Jamie Foxx as Bats nearly steals the show, as a guy who is crazily unpredictable but yet knows how to under people's skin. John Hamm as Buddy really shows an amazing character transformation starting out as an ally to Baby but is then turned into terrifying antagonist. Kevin Spacey's quick line delivery is a perfect match to Wright's sharp screenplay, and has probably the best comic timing in the film. Lilly James's charm as Deborah helps to sell of what could be seen as a typical romantic plot device and really make you feel invested in her and Baby's relationship.Baby Driver is great but now a 100% perfect all the way through. There are certain plot holes that seem to come out of the blue and a certain character's motivation in the 3rd act felt like it wasn't properly set up. The ending was pretty uplifting but I felt could have shaven 5 to 10 minutes off because I felt like it became unnecessary.While it may be only second to my favourite Edgar Wright film Hot Fuzz, Baby Driver is the film where Edgar Wright as an artist is having the most creative fun that any director would dream of having. And Edgar Wright having the creative freedom that he needs is definitely something always worth taking the time to see.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Baby Driver,"I like Edgar Wright movies a lot. This is not his best work. If you told me this was directed by fast and furious director Justin Lin, i would probably believe you. Nothing about this screams Edgar Wright and i find that pretty disappointing.I think Eiza Gonzalaz is a really poor actress, i have never seen her in anything, but i thought she ruined a lot of scenes that could have otherwise been great.Also Lily James (who i quite fancy in other films) really didn't land in this movie. Her accent was weird and character stale and kind of unlikable in my opinion.Granted, these are little things... but they spoiled a good thing.It's terribly entertaining and really quite a good script & concept, just think some points of execution were done poorly. I have higher standards for Edgar Wright.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Hell yes, Wright you've done it again buddy!","'BABY DRIVER' was directed by our lord and saviour Edgar Wright, and stars Ansel Elgort, Lily James and Kevin Spacey. Thanks to a mistake he made when he was younger, Baby(Ansel Elgort) must repay his debt to a heist organiser, Doc(Kevin Spacey). All is going well but when his skills become invaluable to Doc, he must protect his loved ones and try to escape while he still can.Wow. Where do I start with this movie. I'm not rating it a 10/10 just for the sake of it, it is one of the best movies I've seen all year around. The acting is phenomenal, the stuntwork is up there with the best, the action is great, the plot is great; I have no major flaws with this movie. It's awesome!!!!The story for this movie is fast paced, bright, interesting and most importantly, unpredictable. You may be able to predict certain plot point but I guarantee you won't be able to tell me exactly what will happen. The ending is great. The love story between Baby and Deborah is believable. Edgar Wright you beautiful, beautiful man, you have wrote an fantastic screenplay. Thank you, sir!Ansel Elgort was spectacular in this movie and really impressed me as Baby. He was funny, he was smart, he was cool, he was likable; he's a spectacular character that I guarantee will be copied in future films to come. Lily James was great as Deborah and I really bought their relationship. This was a major complain for many critics but I don't see why. It was engaging, it was believable, and, while Deborah made some incredibly dumb decisions, it was fantastical. Jamie Foxx was brilliant as the sly and distrustful Bats. Kevin Spacey command the scenes he's in as Doc and is the best non-actor working today. Jon Hamm was excellent as Buddy. Nothing acting or character wise was flawed in this movie but I guess that is to be expected from Wright's pristine track record.Wright directed the hell out of this movie. Every shot is masterfully crafted. Every edit is specifically chosen and targeted. The colour pallet is bright and bold and artistically captivating.This movie is hilarious. All the characters have funny lines and Wright is a genius at comedy. The chase sequences in this movie are probably some of the best ever put to film. And no, I am not overselling them. The thought that what I saw was practical(which it was) makes my brain hurt. The action was awesome. The score is supercalifragilisticexpialidocious. I adore this movie, and I will bet that you will to. I' rating this movie a nigh flawless 10 Home InvASIANs out of 10. Please watch this movie! I want it to do really well.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

It was a very pleasant way of being introduced to Ansel Elgort.
Kevin Spacey was awesome as always and I absolutely liked the use and control of Jamie Foxx' and and John Hamm's voices.The only reason that this movie hasn't scored higher than 7, for me personally, was its predictability.

These are the perfect actors I would want for a movie like this...Spacey, Foxx, Hamm, Bernthal with Elgort and James rounding out the cast. CJ Jones a standout amongst the all-star cast!I don't think I cared for the ending. Its a little much. In all honesty it would be hard to come up with a good one with the direction they decided to go, so it is what it is. Overall though its a fine movie, one made for theatres, aimed at the non stop action loving crowd in the vein of Be Cool, and Now You See Me. Unoriginal and been done to death but Edgar Wright is a great director and he makes movies worth watching. His style and yet another movie with heavy oldies vinyl catalogs make him someone I want to follow.I watched Last Night In Soho before this movie and felt it was the better effort.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
8.6/10,"Incredible story paired with incredible direction, ""Baby Driver"" is an exhilarating masterpiece. The synchronisation of music with both the protagonist's actions and the audience's emotions is nothing short of genius, creating a rhythm that drives the narrative forward with clever and satisfying repetitions of songs and the short exerts of them. The visuals, often underappreciated, shine with a vibrant and dynamic energy reminiscent of a neon-lit, retro-futuristic aesthetic, adding a distinct flair to the film's atmosphere. The choreography of the dance-like action sequences, combined with seamless camera movements and perfectly timed dialogue, elevate the film to just make it flow, in a sense the audience is drawn in simply due to how satisfying the movie is to watch. Baby driver is unforgettable, the plot is a blend of action, romance, suspense, and a significant character backstory all seamlessly woven together into a straight forward movie, which I find simply brilliant, 8.6/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
okay but done before,"Baby (Ansel Elgort) is a boyish, young man caught up in Atlanta's crime scene. As he is indebted to a crime-lord (Kevin Spacey), his expert driving skills are exploited as a getaway driver for various robberies. Baby would eventually like to go ""straight"" but the crime-lord won't allow this.""Baby Driver"" is a competent film: the story is consistent and sometimes exciting; the acting is good; the main character is interesting; the car chases and criminal showdowns are well done; and it has a superb soundtrack (Baby has to constantly listen to music due to a traumatic incident in his childhood).With all the praise in the above paragraph, a rating of at least three stars should be in order. But it goes down a half notch for a couple of reasons. As a film that is dependent on car chases and shoot-'em-ups, ""Baby Driver"" would inevitably be compared to the hundreds of others that have already been done in this genre. More unique films that advance this well-worn genre would deserve a three-star rating or higher. While not quite formulaic, ""Baby Driver""'s depth goes only so far. Had it been more substantial, I might have given the film a higher rating.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

The chase scenes are a total thrill and the action shoot out scenes being timed with the music is so fun to watch.

A Fun But Slightly Shallow Romp,"Having only seen the trailers for Edgar Wright's ""Baby Driver"" when it came to theaters in 2017, I had a rough but undefined idea of what the film was about. I knew Ansel Egort's ""Baby"" was a, well, driver, and I knew that Kevin Spacey (Doc) was his mentor. Perhaps unfairly, I assumed the film was a lot of action and not a lot of heart.And, funnily enough, the opening scene did very little to change that base assumption. The scene was incredible, mind you - with Baby and a group of robbers (John Bernthal, Jon Hamm, Eliza Gonzalez) escaping the police in one of the most unique, thrilling, and pulse-pounding scenes I've seen in a LONG time - and I thought my previous prediction of how the rest of the film was going to play out was spot on.Not the case.Instead, ""Baby Driver"" flips the script on the viewer following the opening scene, diving much more into the protagonist, Baby, and his blossoming relationship with a lovely waitress (Lily James's Debora) then pedal to the metal action. The driving scenes are still there (and engaging, I might add), but this shockingly turns into an unexpected love story, especially during the second act.There is nothing inherently wrong with this, as Egort and James have fine chemistry and are unique characters, but issues start to arise when Wright tries to seamlessly blend this world with Baby's more hardened, violent world of crime. It is understood by us, the viewer, that this juxtaposition of worlds is the crux of the drama in the film, and that's fine, but the characters simply aren't refined enough - and the dialogue not strong enough - to really make us care about our Bonnie and Clyde-esque heroes.The final result, a heart-pounding first half followed by an emotionally dull latter half, is amplified by fantastic performances from the aforementioned Egort, Jamie Foxx as the sparkplug ""Bats,"" and the terrific Jon Hamm as the engaging ""Buddy"". I would be remiss not to mention Eliza Gonzalez consistently stealing scenes as the sensual sharpshooter, ""Darling,"" as well.The film shines in its unique sound-mixing and stellar soundtrack, both lauded by critics upon the film's release. These two elements are great, there is no question, but not enough to make up for a few of the gaffes previously mentioned.It boils down to this: ""Baby Driver"" is fun, engaging, and unique; all important elements in making a fantastic picture. Unfortunately, Edgar Wright seemingly says all he has to say in the first twenty-five minutes of the film. After that, it is less heart and more tired formula. A good film that had the potential to be great.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

We didn't watch it with subtitles so unsure if the scenes with his foster dad were supposed to be subbed. I needed them more for Jamie Foxx! Could barely understand a word he was saying at time.Weirdly, and yes the GF pulled me up on this, Baby could have just driven away calmly and normally from any of the heists and attracted zero attention from the police.

The Most Surprising Film of SXSW 2017.,"Edgar Wright is known to deliver, if nothing at all, very entertaining films. Baby Driver is no exception. With an all star cast including Ansol Elgort, Jamie Foxx, Lilly James, Jon Hamm and Kevin Spacey, Baby Driver not only is an extremely well cast and choreographed film, it just might be the best film of Edgar Wright's career. Telling the story of a young man named Baby, who is a professional getaway driver who needs music in order to complete his jobs, as he navigates through the criminal underworld. When he takes a risky job for a mysterious gangster (played by Kevin Spacey), he finds himself on the run after things go horribly wrong. With his girl by his side and his music in his hands, Baby must use his specific skillset to get out of the underworld.Before anyone says it, yes, this film plays like a less serious Drive. The storyline is not what is supposed to stand out here, the incredible direction under Edgar Wright and the great central performance from Ansol Elgort are definitely the stand outs here. Granted, I doubt that Elgort would have been able to deliver such a great performance without the amazing supporting cast that Wright wrangles up, but he ends up giving a great performance here as Baby. The rest of the cast is more or less there for name recognition only as none of them go above and beyond in their performance.Despite this, the cast are mere pawns in Edgar Wright's brilliant film. The real stars of Baby Driver are the stunt teams. These car chases are finally something new. With the incredible automobile warfare that the Fast and Furious franchise has given us for decades, it was nice to see a film embrace a smaller scale of car chase. It is real, exhilarating and downright perfect for this film. Truthfully, the car chase sequences here are some of the best that I've seen since Refn's Drive but that's just me. Speaking of Drive, how could I forget Wright's amazing choice of soundtrack. The soundtrack is about just as great as the stunt team's work on this film. This is very much in the vein of Scott Pilgrim as far as soundtrack is concerned and is bound to be a hit come time for the film to premiere in its wide release.Overall, Edgar Wright delivers an action movie with a flawed perfection to it. The story is paper thin, the acting is passable (except for Ansol Elgort, who is terrific), but the action sequences and soundtrack are amazing. These two components are more than enough reasons to go see this film.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime
A masterpiece of screenplay,"Don't even bother to read any reviews below 5. They haven't got a clue what is going on and have definitely only seen the film once. Watch the film through, then watch it again and try to pick up every cultural reference, geographical and temporal joke and of course the brilliance in the score. Superficially a stylish violent heist film (think Heat), Then a redemption story as good as Unforgiven. A love story where Elgort & James are cartoon lovebirds. But really it is a piece of pure screen fiction like Tarantino but with sonehow British humour that makes the story more believable, darker and abstract. Has become on of my top 5 films of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"A stylish, technical marvel that is remarkably entertaining.","Baby Driver is a stylish, technical marvel that is remarkably entertaining. From the opening sequence, director Edgar Wright stamps his work with his signature uniqueness. Wright puts the spotlight on getaway driver Baby, portrayed by The Fault in Our Star's Ansel Elgort, as he rocks out in his car, while Elgort's co-stars conduct a well-rehearsed bank heist off screen. Immediately, from this one direction choice, you know this won't be a run-of-the-mill heist film.What follows is anything but your run-of-the-mill heist film. Music is beautifully integrated into nearly every scene, adding to the unconventionality of Wright's approach to action. The sound editing perfectly blends the actions scenes with the accompanying music. There have been plenty of getaway car chases in film, most notably in the Fast and Furious franchise, but the flair that Wright adds with his own personal touch make Baby Driver's car sequences some of the best put to film.The colors in this film are consistently bright and vibrant, matching the similarly colorful performances by the cast. Jamie Foxx is a standout here, playing the borderline cartoonish gangster, Bats. Jon Hamm and and Eiza Gonzalez portray a similarly over-the-top Bonnie and Clyde duo. Kevin Spacey is (naturally) excellent as the boss that pulls this mishmash of stereotypes together with his cold efficiency. Though most of these characters are written to be caricatures of familiar character archetypes, each and every member of this star- studded cast is able to pull it off. ¬†The charisma that each of these actors bring to the film are one of Baby Driver's greatest assets.It's easy to heap praise upon this film's supporting cast, but Elgort is truly commendable in his first proper leading role. He is given a lot to do in his film, as his character Baby's personality differs greatly depending on who is present in the scene. Elgort's performance ranges from stoic in the presence of his heist crew, slickly charismatic around his love interest, and energetic to an almost child-like level when he is by himself.When it comes to the script, there is a perfect synergy with every other the aspect of the film. The dialogue is often over the top, the characters are exaggerated, the plot is almost fantasy-like. The 80s action movie esque direction taken by writer/director Edgar Wright excuses some of the film's flaws. This isn't a hyper realistic, super serious action film. This is borderline fantasy at points.The flaws of this film are largely based on personal preference. The second act of the film slows down a bit to focus on Baby's relationship with his love interest, Debbie. If you were expecting non-stop action throughout the film, this may bother you. These scenes are well done however, and just as unique and stylized as the action scenes. Also, if you don't take well to the over-the-top, fantasy-like characters and plot, you might see it as a flaw, instead of an asset of the film.While a movie that I love, 2011's Drive, starring Ryan Gosling, was criticized for being largely style over substance. There are definitely similarities between Drive and Baby Driver;¬†especially with both film's emphasis on style. While I don't think Baby Driver will be quite as polarizing, if Drive is a movie that you did not enjoy, you will find similar flaws here.Baby Driver is loud, over-the-top, and unrealistic. But these aren't necessarily flaws, as all of these aspects add to the charm of this film. This is my favorite work from Edgar Wright so far, and one of my favorite films of the year.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Fast and Furious combined with Bank Robbers,"Baby Driver starts out with a lot of promise but takes way too long to get there. Baby is a young kid with unbelievable driving skills who, as we learn, gets drawn from a normal life into the life of bad guys and guns. He listens and lives out his life thru music, which is brought out in excellently choreographed coffee shop and chase scenes.The story develops and you learn about how the poor kid experienced childhood trauma. And you learn how he got pushed to the wrong side of the road. But when he meets his dream girl, he gains hope of escape. Can he, is the question, and the driving line underneath the entire movie.Along the way we meet some really bad people played by Jon Hamm and Jamie Foxx. The mastermind, who I found a bit miscast, was Kevin Spacey. The banter between bad guys got pedantic after a while, with violence executed for the sake of it, without adding any value to the story. Baby's girlfriend smoothly moves from normal to abnormal life, which was probably trying to have us think of them as Bonnie and Clyde.Great driving scenes. Some witty lines. Some good music. But too long. This should have been over in 85 minutes, not 110. The director spent way too much time with useless dialog between bad guys and many useless scenes. The kids end up being stupid, and I found the ending predictable and contrived.But overall, it was an OK movie if you're ok with gratuitous violence, lots of blood, great car scenes, and stories of young love, both lost and found.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
It's About the Girl,"""Baby Driver"" is awesome. Ansel Elgort is the star. Elgort is a young Clint Eastwood. He has a quiet gentleness and undeniable power. Ansel was amazing in ""The Fault in Our Stars"". Here he shines brighter than Kevin Spacey, Jamie Foxx, and Jon Hamm, who are much older and all great.In the opening scene Baby, played by Elgort, races away in robbery getaway heist in his red Mitsubishi with beguiling mastery. He is a prot√©g√© of sorts. Writer and Director Edgar Wright goes full throttle from the start, while subtly painting the portrait of his hero Baby. Baby is a kid in his twenties, who is plugged into his headphones from his iPod, to drown out the noise. He has Tinnitus, a ringing in his ears, the result of a tragic car accident when he was a child, revealed in flashback. Wright's car chase sequence is astounding. Baby drives fearlessly, ice water in his veins. However, he drives like a chess master. Wright is brilliant in his layered character reveal. And Elgort's unassuming charisma fuels this.For me the signature scene unfolds when Baby grasps the hand of Jamie Foxx's Bats as he tries to draw his Beretta on the love of his life Debora. Elgort's Baby gazes into the eyes of Bats, ""No."" Elgort has the calm power and resolve embodying Wright's story of love and courage.The most compelling occurs not when ""Baby Driver"" is roaring 140 mph, rather in the blossoming romance of Baby and waitress Debora, played by radiant and beautiful Lily James. Baby records Debora singing in his favorite diner. Then the two talk about their favorite music and song. Debora and Baby are sweet and kind to each other. Spectacular car chases and automatic weapons battles aside, ""Baby Driver"" is really 'about the girl'. As with most great stories, this is usually true.Kevin Spacey is Doc, the robbery maestro who orchestrates the mayhem. His star driver is Baby. Doc's crew includes the couple Buddy and Darling, played by solid Jon Hamm and Eliza Gonzalez. Baby teams with Bats, played by calculated cold Jamie Foxx, for one more job to get straight in the bond beholding him to his boss and mentor Doc. Thinking he is free, and be with Debora, Baby soon discovers that ""straight"" doesn't mean done for Doc.Baby lives with his deaf and wheelchair bound guardian Joseph, played by kind C.J. Jones. They touchingly converse in sign language. In the amazing dance sequence Baby makes a sandwich for Joseph, while plugged into his tunes. The music not only tones ""Baby Driver"", it defines it. Director Wright seamlessly atmospheres the songs ranging from Barry White, Lionel Richie to Queen as the provocative narrative. At times the movie is an elegant musical with song and dance set amidst mesmerizing action. This is distinctly ""Baby Driver""'s art and profound charm.Betrayal, conspiracy, and gunfire abound in Wright's visual portrait. The sharp furious dialogue of Doc, Bats, Buddy, and Darling are captivating, though ultimately for show. Really, this is ""full of sound and fury, signifying nothing."" This only accentuates the quiet and measured eloquence of Baby. Baby knows he is cursed as a thief, lives by a code, and lives for love.Kevin Spacey is surprising and powerful as Doc. He reveals not as we expect, displaying nobility in the end. Like both Spacey and Elgort, ""Baby Driver"" is a surprise. Yes, it is the visual adrenaline thrill ride. What touches most: ""Baby Driver"" is about the girl.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Typical studio pitch,"This movie knew where it was starting. Like Get Shorty but with a guy who likes music not films. Unfortunately, the soundtrack in nothing special.

Specifically the second half. When some kind of magic 8 ball of plot events was shake repeatedly to create miles of footage containing both words and pictures that teach you nothing, go nowhere, and are irrelevant.Nobody stands for anything and anyone may do any unpredictable event at any moment. Not like characters that represent different people but more like a handful of quarters that create a statistically unpredictable hodgepodge of result with overt throw.It's a mess and a powerful soundtrack could have saved it like where is Going Back to Cali?It's a sad 6 that could have been a 9 with some writers and vision and a plan and a direction.

Music To My Ears,"I really like Edgar Wright as a directors, he's not quite one of my favourite directors working today for the simple fact that despite Scott Pilgrim Vs The World (a film I've yet to see) I haven't seen him really get out of his comfort zone. As much as I love his Cornetto trilogy they're all, even if purposefully so, very similar so I wanted to fully see what he was capable of doing, a Baby Driver proved to me that he is a forced to be reckoned with, I do think this is his best film to date and one of the best of the year so far.It's completely clear from the very beginning that this is Edgar Wrights movie, he has a very unique style that I've always loved, it's very sleek with a lot of quick edits which works perfectly with the pace of the action sequences. I loved his decision to match up his action sequences, as well as simple dialogue or movement scenes to music, though I've never listened to any of the songs in this film it made it more engaging as well as unique.This film has a fantastic cast, Ansel Elgort has never impressed me so I wasn't sure how I would feel about him in this movie but I think he nailed it, playing on Baby's more tragic side as well as his complete commitment physically makes this easily his best performance. I loved Jon Hamm in this movie, I liked how he played his characters gradual downward spiral, Jamie Foxx was really intense in this movie as well as having a great back and forth with Elgort, I loved Kevin Spacey he was really ominous and you could tell that he had some kind of motive and other plan behind everything he did. Lily James was great in this movie she was very likable and had a really good romantic chemistry with Ansel Elgorts character.I really liked the arcs of every character in this film, while not every character gets detailed backstory you get the impression that it was what Wright was trying to go for, to try and better show the ominous nature of this whole organisation and the people involved in it. I loved Baby's arc if learning from his mistakes and excepting consequences for his actions it made his character more likable as well as better rounded. There were definitely some clich√© aspects of Kevin Spaceys character of a crime boss trying to get back a debt from the protagonist but I liked that they gave the character some heart as well as some good head butting scenes with the people who worked for him. I also loved the ever growing tension between Foxx and Elgorts characters that really came to ahead in a nice way.I didn't know how I'd feel about the romantic sub plot in this movie but I have to say it really worked for me. I absolutely believed that these two characters had a connection. Not only do the actors play off each other very well but the characters are just written so well that you want the whole situation to end in their favour. It also felt very believable, it didn't feel like it was some cheesy romantic drama but a real relationship that I really could get behind.My only real issue with this movie is some aspects of the way it concludes, now I did love how they wrapped up Baby's character and his romance with Collins but in some ways the conclusion to the arcs outside of that did feel a bit rushed, it seemed as if some many arcs had been built up throughout the film that needed to be concluded but it did feel a bit rushed in some ways they went about doing it.Baby Driver completely succeeded at what it was trying to be, an entertaining crime thriller with a good heart, solid characters and an investing love story. I loved the way Edgar Wright directed this movie, all the actors performances as well as the arcs of the characters they played, though the conclusion to a lot of the films arcs did feel a bit rushed the overall quality of the film only makes me more excited for what Edgar Wright is going to do next.9.3/10: A (Phenomenal)",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Baby Driver Film Review,"The new action thriller film Baby Driver starring Ansel Elgort, Kevin Spacey, Lily James, Eiza Gonz√°lez, Jon Hamm, Jamie Foxx.In Baby Driver a talented, young getaway driver called Baby (American actor Ansel Elgort - Divergent films, The Fault In Our Stars) relies on the beat of his personal soundtrack from his own iPod to be the best in the game.

But after being coerced into working for a crime boss Doc (American actor Kevin Spacey - The Usual Suspects, Seven), he must face the music when a doomed heist threatens his life, love and freedom.Amongst the other actors / actresses in Baby Driver includes American actor Jon Bernthal (Sicario, The Wolf Of Wall Street) as Griff, American actor Jon Hamm (US TV Series Mad Men, Keeping Up With The Joneses) as Buddy, Mexican actress Eiza Gonz√°lez (US TV Series From Dusk Till Dawn) as Darling Buddy's girlfriend, American actor Micah Howard as Barista, CJ Jones as Joseph a deaf man who Baby lives with and looks after, American actress Sky Ferreira (Elvis & Nixon, The Green Inferno) as Baby's Mom, American actor Lance Palmer as Baby's Dad, Hudson Meek (90 Minutes In Heaven) as Young Baby, American actor Hal Whiteside (Misfortune) as Cook, Australian actor and Red Hot Chili Peppers Bassist Flea (Back To The Future films, My Own Private Idaho) as Eddie, Lanny Joon (Black Gold, Black November) as JD, American actor Jamie Foxx (Ray, Django Unchained) as Bats, Brogan Hall (Cold In July) as Samm Doc's little nephew, R.

Already a classic,"This is not a fantastic perfect movie, but damn it is entertaining and its fast and its fun. I have not had this much fun at the theater since I saw Deadpool. Baby Driver is a great movie from an entertainment perspective. Although the movie basically contains a lot of scenes and a plot we've all seen 10 times before, it still feels fresh, fun and original.I am uncertain about the last 10min and the end of the movie, and there are a few misses, and sometimes things goes too fast or have too many cuts, which coupled with the unoriginal originality drops the score somewhat. I believe this to be a strong 8.This is one of those movies you know, while watching it, that it will be a classic movie. 30- 40 years from now essays will be written about this movie, it will be quoted and referenced by critics. I am also 100% certain it will get a sequel, but please don't do it! This felt fresh and fun, I do not think a sequel will top or even come close to what this movie did.Most entertaining movie of the summer so far and yes, you should see this, and buckle up: the music score itself is worth the ticket price.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
A mostly good movie that frustrates because it could have been amazing,"I saw Baby Driver for the first time close to three years ago now, back when it came out in cinemas. I remembered enjoying a good deal about it, but I've never found myself loving it; certainly not in the same way I've loved and still love Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, The World's End, and even Scott Pilgrim VS The World. Maybe my expectations were too high, I thought to myself. Because those last four Edgar Wright movies were so good, maybe I had hyped myself up too much for Baby Driver.Having rewatched it now, only about a week ago, without a level of hype and with an open mind, I have to say, it still disappoints in many regards. HOWEVER: it's not a bad movie. Not by a long shot. There are things it does really well and I'll get to them of course, but I think it's the fact that it does so much right while also being slightly off in some regards that makes it feel disappointing. With just a few tweaks, I have no doubt this could be on the same level as the four aforementioned Edgar Wright movies, because ultimately, it's not too far behind (like I said: STILL A GOOD MOVIE).So what's good? Well, most of the stuff the movie has always been praised for. It's got an inventive soundtrack, done in the Tarantino-style where many of the songs are relatively obscure (sure there are artists like The Beach Boys and Queen in there, but nothing as well-known as God Only Knows or Bohemian Rhapsody, respectively). I don't think it's done quite as well as Tarantino has pulled off in some of his best movies, but the soundtrack's there and it's pretty good overall. Some sequences are edited to the music (but not all, which was somewhat disappointing), and these were really impressive on a first watch, but sometimes a little gimmicky on a second watch. I guess the film has a bold, colourful, visually pleasing look, at least as good as all of Wright's other films. When compared to his other work, Baby Driver probably has the best action sequences too, with two very good car chases near the start (wish we'd gotten at least one more though), and an exciting shoot-out and on-foot chase later in the movie. It satisfies visually, and for the most part satisfies as an action movie, and these combined with the snappy editing and music largely serves to keep the movie from being truly boring.Although something that doesn't help in this regard is the screenplay. It's easily Wright's weakest, and I do realise he was trying to branch out, and write something a little less comedic, but to me the tone is a mess. It's not funny enough to feel like a comedy, but it's too wacky and reliant on clich√©s (maybe in a self-aware way? I don't always know to be honest) to be taken seriously in the same way you might be able to take a movie a sort of similar film like Drive seriously. Take the opening scene: the title character jams out and lip syncs to music in his car while he waits for the criminals he drives to finish their heist. Is this supposed to be funny? Is he supposed to be cool here? Are we supposed to be laughing at him, or with him? Are we even supposed to be laughing?The comedy in Wright's previous films was always done incredibly well. It's a shame there's little comedy here, because of how funny those movies were, and it's a shame there isn't genuine drama or even much tension in this film in place of the comedy. Somehow, Wright balanced comedy and drama in those previous movies so well that they were both funnier and more emotionally potent than Baby Driver. Shaun of the Dead and The World's End in particular both have some surprisingly heart-wrenching moments that somehow mesh perfectly well with the comedy. In Hot Fuzz's case, it has a legitimately fantastic twist that is far more engaging than any curveball thrown by Baby Driver, and Scott Pilgrim has more style (arguably too much) and in a way, more to say (about modern day relationships) than Baby Driver has to say about pretty much anything.The confusing tone doesn't help the performances here either. I don't want to blame any performers specifically here because I'm not confident Wright had the best handle on his material in the first place. Jamie Foxx overacts, Ansel Elgort is a bit boring as a protagonist, and Lily James is disappointing, probably because she's given the weakest and most poorly written character in the film by far. Because of the latter case, I'm not sure how at fault Foxx and Elgort are. Jon Hamm is good though, and as much as I hate saying it post-#MeToo, Spacey does do a decent job for what he's given.But yeah, when it comes to all the stuff with Lily James' character: it's honestly close to awful. I remember not loving the romance stuff the first time I watched the film, but the second time, it was sometimes wince inducing. Again, because of the lack of self-awareness (at least from what I can tell), I think we're supposed to take the instant relationship between her and Baby seriously, but I couldn't buy it for a second. Their first conversation is so bad, and the kind of thing that feels like it was written by a teenager who is still yet to form a relationship with somebody. Her willingness to go along with Baby's insane lifestyle while barely questioning it might have been believable with a goofier, more light-hearted tone, but because so much of the movie seems to want to be taken seriously, it makes the romance subplot really unconvincing and even uncomfortable.So if the movie had been either funnier, or more serious, or done without a romance subplot, or had just contained another car chase or two, I think it could have been better. There is so much wrong here that could have been fixed with some more work on the screenplay; things that could've been tweaked to make the film flow more, and be either funnier or more emotionally satisfying. The fact this is both Wright's least funny and least emotionally engaging film is so disappointing. He usually does both so well in all his other movies, and so his failure to do so here is baffling. I'm curious rather than excited about his next film, because it's apparently a non-comedic horror movie. He's still a great director, so at the very least, I'm sure it will move well and look good in a similar way to Baby Driver. But if he doesn't nail the tone again, and fails once more to make something that isn't going for laughs, then I'll be disappointed.And I know I'm overall in the minority, because Baby Driver was well received and regarded by most as just as good as his other films. I had some grievances I had to write down and get out of my system though, and for all my problems, I'll once again reiterate that Baby Driver does a good deal of things very well. I just hope I love Wright's future work the same way I loved the four films he made prior to Baby Driver, because it wasn't one I can say I love the same way I can for his others. I may be being pedantic, and I can't speak for everyone, but there are my thoughts on Baby Driver, close to three years in the making I guess...",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Brilliant!,"Director Edgar Wright's newest and most outwardly conventional film Baby Driver is nothing short of a new definition in cool. Aided by an eclectic soundtrack, a stylish and engrossing caper story and Wright's meticulously crafted look and feel, the film soars like rarely a movie of this stripe has soared before. At its height Baby Driver feels like the mordant composure of a Jean-Pierre Melville's crime thriller is being spun around on a Looney Tune Acme thingamajig. It sounds like it shouldn't work but after seeing what is most definitely the best crime comedy in years, having this particular mix of awesome is the equivalent of accidentally getting chocolate in your peanut butter.The film sets itself at the center of a criminal underworld dominated by greed and ego. Yet the world of Baby (Elgort) feels unnaturally bright by comparison. And why shouldn't it be; He's only a job or two away from retiring as an infinitely skilled getaway driver. A driver whose handler (Spacey) trusts him enough to shuttle his various criminal enterprises in and around the Atlanta downtown loop. ""I never work with the same crew twice, except for you,"" says Spacey in a rare moment of rare avuncular appreciation. Baby in-turn answers with Monsters, Inc. (2001) quotes. He's one foot out the door and clearly happy to be.As with all movies of this kind, things don't go exactly according to plan. A plot point that looms larger as Baby starts dating a peppy waitress named Debora (James) who shares his love of music. It's a love of necessity as the music is used to drown out his tinnitus, as well as having the duel purpose of being getaway driving focus fuel and a framing device for the audience.And what remarkably obsessive frames we end up going through. To point out that Baby Driver has a handful of incredible car chases verges on the obvious. Yet what the trailer might not tell you about are the various visual and audio cues that create an echo chamber of gags, setups, callbacks, pacing devices and tension builders. They're meant to please the ears and tickle the brain and boy do they ever. In one moment of frazzled suspense, the sound mixing erupts in a cacophony of gunfire, sneaker squeaks, screaming on-lookers and the non-diegetic guitar riffs of ""Hocus Pocus"" blaring on Baby's iPod. In other scenes the body language of supporting cast members sync up perfectly with whatever Baby is listening to, hinting to a heightened reality that only Baby experiences in the recesses of his headphones. Baby Driver is not strictly speaking a musical, but it might as well be.In the hands of any other director, Baby Driver still would have been good, perhaps edging out The Italian Job (2003) in its ability to balance fast fun and elevating stakes. Yet in the hands of Edgar Wright (who also wrote the screenplay), Baby Driver feels alive, tight, tactile and dare I say even original. It's an exercise in style that zips by with such eye-popping aplomb and works on so many levels that I'm honestly surprised the reigns of this beast didn't slip out of Wright's hands. This movie could have easily been another Transformers (2007) i.e. visually resplendent but far too slapdash for its strengths to be appreciated.No - this movie wants to be appreciated. It wants to be oogled at and admired and further distills its energy with a supporting cast that either meets or exceed it. Kevin Spacey, Jon Hamm, Eiza Gonzalez, Jamie Foxx, Jon Bernthal, Lanny Joon and Flea all do wonders playing the various psychotics that encircle Baby like a murder of crows. Their characterizations are buoyant as a whole with Hamm and Gonzalez standing out as a criminal couple whose psychosis is just this side of Bonnie and Clyde (1967).Then of course there's Ansel Elgort who often feels like a millennial remix of the cool, detached, petty criminal trope made famous by Alain Delon's trademark smolder. Here his detachment hides a vulnerability - a hidden need to find life outside of crime, a deep desire to not see anyone get hurt and of course his creative outlet. An outlet that refreshingly switches off his defenses and gets him to instantly dance like no one is watching.If there is one sour note in this car chase opera, it's the romance. While the rest of the film owns its stylistic excesses, the budding romance between Baby and Debora is played straight and more than a little syrupy. What's worse is because the character of Debora largely lacks depth or agency, huge swaths of the second act feel like we're setting up the marbles and levers of a rube-goldberg machine with Debora being one of said marbles.Yet when everything is in motion, Baby Driver can't help but be an incredible romp. Nearly everything to this movie fires on all cylinders. And in the drivers seat is arguably one of the most fertile and creative movie minds of the 21st century. Shaun of the Dead (2004), Hot Fuzz (2007), Scott Pilgrim (2010), World's End (2013) and now this? Seriously what can't Edgar Wright do?",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Stands Right Alongside Mr. Wright's Other Works,"No SpoilersIt really speaks to the state of the film industry that Edgar Wright is not a household name. Wright has perhaps the largest cult following of any individual in Hollywood, his films are consistently met with critical acclaim, and yet it continues to be difficult for him to generate box office revenue. One has to believe that it is because he refuses to indulge the ""mainstream"" movie industry. He refuses to accept writing/directing roles for superhero movies, remakes, sequels, and so on. He did sign up to make Ant-Man, but clearly his originality was too much for Marvel and he was booted early on in production. Baby Driver may be his biggest financial success, and it will never be number 1 at the box office. It is unfortunate that the general public is so unreceptive to original screenplays. That being said, fortunately for Mr. Wright's cult following, Baby Driver is easily able to stand alongside his other films.Baby Driver follows a young, talented get-away car driver known simply as ""Baby."" Baby has found himself in the unfortunate situation of being in debt to heist mastermind Doc (Kevin Spacey) and serves as the driver for all of his jobs. Along the way, Baby has to deal with Doc's unstable employees (Jamie Foxx and John Hamm among others), and court local waitress Deborah (Lily James). The plot in the second act , overall, is pretty weak. It never feels like it has a definitive sense of direction. Character personalities and motivations are a bit confusing and there isn't any satisfying payoff.While the plot may not be extraordinary, it seems that Wright never intended the plot to be the focus of the movie. The real backbone of the film is the soundtrack. Having been in a car accident as a child, Baby suffers from tinnitus. To drown out the ringing in his ears, Baby constantly listens to his iPod. This music controls the driving, running, and even gunshots throughout the film. It may sound cheesy, but it is an absolute joy and you will be toe-tapping and head- bobbing throughout the entire film.Further contributing to the enjoyable nature of this film is its humor. As with most of Mr. Wright's films, Baby Driver is packed with subtle, self-aware humor. It comes frequently and often unexpectedly. Additionally, the stunt driving and chase scenes are the best since the original Bourne trilogy. It is clear how much effort went into these sequences and it certainly pays off.Overview:Baby Driver is a rip-roaring, fun time at the movies that overcomes a so-so plot with some fantastic action scenes and a kick butt soundtrack.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

"You've Come a Long Way, Baby","It's a bad summer for movies. But one film is about to rise from the ashes and show us all how it's done. Edgar Wright never disappoints, and he's done it again with Baby Driver. This is no clich√©d action flick. What Wright does here is innovative and badass. It's set to a groovy soundtrack of vinyl crackling hits, mostly from the early sixties. The bullets fly and the cars skid in sync with the songs. The opening sequence of the film is nearly a masterpiece. Right from the first five minutes, you are in love with Baby.. yeah, that's his name. The silent hero who communicates through his first-gen iPod shuffle. There are scenes and characters who needed some more fleshing out, like Baby's love interest. But overall, we've found the diamond in the rough of 2017.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Baby Driver,"Baby Driver is one of the best movies of the decade. This is the movie that the world needs and it delivered in every way the music was spot on the acting was superb the whole movie was just terrific. This was one of those films where from the opening scene to the end credits it has non stop entertainment. You will love Baby Driver it is a treat that you just can not miss.Parents Baby Driver is rated R and it is pretty well received by all of the profanity and violence so if you want your little ones to be introduced to it then take them, but if you don't then just wait till they get a little older because they will love it. Jamie Foxx was fantastic as Bats. This was his best role since the Amazing Spiderman 2 in my opinion. I hope this review was helpful and I hope you enjoy Baby Driver.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

"""This one, they say that listens to the music all the time?""","Baby Driver falls perfectly in line with Wright's previous films in style, but offers a bit more in dramatic tone and a little less in comedy. The film still has plenty of funny moments, but it depicts a slight change in direction for him and one that hopefully opens more doors for original films.Baby, that's B-A-B-Y, is the getaway driver for a wealthy criminal, Doc, who plots out the heists and never uses the same crew twice. Baby insists he is done after one last job, but Doc is willing to threaten the lives of the people Baby loves, including his new waitress girlfriend Debora, if he doesn't pull one more stunt.Going into a Wright film, you have a sense of what to expect. Hot Fuzz was a parody of action films to the point where a simple moment of putting on your jacket was made to look like a chaotic action sequence. With Baby Driver, Wright continues this style, but squarely plants the film itself into that world that Hot Fuzz was parodying. This is done with self awareness though, and never becomes a problem. Instead, it highlights the originality of the film and the world Wright has created. It's a heightened reality and music plays an important role in it. To the point where it feels more like a love letter to music than heist films. This is even more apparent when you realize that we never really get to see the heists. We stay with Baby in the car and subvert those expectations. We are with Baby and his music the whole way.As I said earlier, music is important to this film and ever aspect of it revolves around that. Camera work, action sequences, character movements, dialogue, plot devices, the list goes on. For something that important, the music should be good. Wright manages to explore enough genres to please most people and I found myself really digging the playlists. Music is Baby's world and we live in it for 2 hours almost non-stop. To the point where when there is no music playing, it feels out of place. I fully expect people to go out and buy the soundtrack and at no point did I feel as if any of it was forced, like Suicide Squad.I guess you want to know about the car chase sequences, those are thrilling for people looking for excitement. Wright gives us enough unique moments to make those memorable and it's needed because car chases are a staple in Hollywood movies. You want to see something new and Baby Driver delivers enough of a spin to make it seems fresh. The film balances itself out with plenty of small quiet sequences that focus on character. Baby's dedication to take care of his aging foster father is touching. They communicate through sign language, which adds another layer to the complicated character that is Baby. Then we have some tender moments with Baby and Debora. A love at first sight relationship that blooms due to charm, appreciation of music and the aspirations to just be on the open road.Baby Driver is stylish and charges to you at full speed. With the camera almost constantly moving, it never feels slow, even in those quiet moments. The cast nail their roles with just a hint of self awareness. Spacey can be intimidating in his sleep and Foxx has no problem playing someone with a few screw lose moments. At the very least, when you walk away from this movie you can say that you had a fun time, this movie has plenty of those moments to make it great.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Other than the chase scenes?,"After one watches the movie for the chase scenes, it will be forgotten by most. A young kid, Baby, sole a car from a criminal, and there were valuables in it. Well, that resulted in him owing the criminal big time, so he has to be the driver for robberies to work off his debt. As a young kid, he was in an accident, so has tinnitus, and to help drown out the ringing in his ears, listens to music, which helps him set the mood and the pace. And he is a very skilled driver. But when he thought it was over, he finds out it will never be over. There are a couple of robberies that end in terrific chase scenes, but then comes the big job. And that is where the movie cranks it up into overdrive, so to speak. The only thing is, once the movie is over, how many will remember it only for the chase scenes, and then quickly forget it? The characters are not particularly memorable, and about the best performance was by Bats (Jamie Foxx) but it really needed more.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Kinetic, thrilling and funny. Edgar Wright's best movie since Hot Fuzz.","Edgar Wright does it again with one of the best movies of the year thus far, Baby Driver, which concerns a getaway driver named Baby(Ansel Elgort) who is trying to get out of his life of crime working for a crime boss named Doc(Kevin Spacey) so he can move on with a girl that he meets at a diner named Debora(Lily James). The problem is there always seems to be 'one last job' and when the last one goes horribly wrong Baby has to rely on his skills to get out unscathed with Debora.The cast in this movie is stellar with the likes of Kevin Spacey as Doc, Jamie Foxx as Batts, Jon Hamm as Buddy, Eiza Gonzalez as Darling, Lily James as Debora and of course Ansel Elgort as Baby who all give fine performances. The script and direction are signature Edgar Wright with witty dialogue and fast paced, exhilarating action sequences.The car chase scenes really put you in the front seat and are set to a 'killer' soundtrack which features many great classic songs. The way Wright uses music in this film is unprecedented in that nearly every scene is set to the beat or flow of the soundtrack and it fits perfectly. There's only a small handful of scenes where there isn't any music and those are when Baby himself is not listening to music as we essentially hear exactly what he hears throughout the whole movie. As Wright himself put it, he wanted the audience to be both 'Baby's eyes and ears' and he succeeded wildly in doing that.To wrap up, Baby Driver is one of if not the best movie of the year so far and will likely feature in a lot of people's top 10 of the year lists. It's also Edgar Wright's best movie since Hot Fuzz.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Entertaining and even brilliant until the last 10 minutes or so,"Still, not to be missed. The director's hand is so assured and compelling that at times the movie seems head and shoulders above its many competitors. Some of the simplest scenes, where Baby and Debora are just flirting with each other are so well done, they seem miraculous. You will wonder, What kind of strange luck or ability would allow someone to get those scenes on screen? I can't think of anyone able to catch such fresh and candid banter before. And that's not even the main course.The main course is the hostility that Baby exposes himself to in the underworld he is forced to be part of. Jamie Foxx comes across as pure street as does Jon Hamm, both actors I don't associate with seasoned physical menace, but who deliver in spades. And then there's the driving which is fast and furious and made as entertaining as any other I've seen.Baby is a kind of Man With No Name figure but much younger and not prone to violence. Instead of being a dead shot he's an unflappable driver and there's nothing he'd rather do than get out of the life. My only complaint is that the storyline paints our hero into a corner and sort of fumbles a bit in its resolution, but that's after having kept us at full attention, very stylishly, for more than 90 minutes straight. No mean feat.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Really good movie especially if you like your music to go with it.,"I really liked this movie. It has a special aura and I think the director captures that feeling very well when a song with a rhythm appropriate to the situation or the feeling comes up, all of a sudden you start to act like you are in your own musical or sometimes move or dance with it not necessarily thinking about others around you or include them in the experience. That exhilarating feeling of sharing a song with someone who appreciates it is also well portrayed. And not just among lovers or friends, but with strangers too.
I think the people who thought that the movie is just a video clip or all style and little substance were not getting these things. Fast and furious it is not. It is something that offers much more in my opinion.
I very much appreciated all the effort put into selecting the music and creating the accompanying scenes .
The main plot should not be taken too seriously but it is as entertaining as it could be. And I found the backstories of the characters more or less interesting. No fault there. The main irritating factor was the Doc and the way Spacey played it. But I will not dwell on it.
The other actors were enjoyable to watch. Lead actor was a discovery for me. Although a bit stiff I can see that he is multi talented. I really adored the little Samm played by Hall. He is going to be a big star I hope. Jon Hamm and Jamie Foxx were absolutely stunning I wanted to watch them endlessly. Unfortunately Lily James was just a pretty face. I think she should have given more depth. I would've liked to see more scenes with Jon Bernthal as well. On the other hand Flea was a nice surprise.
To sum up, I think the movie is successful and refreshing, although not a masterpiece, a unique and cool directorial achievement which should be seen and enjoyed without prejudice. I can watch it again tonight! (And definitely discover all of the soundtrack )",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Boring ......,I don't see what all the hoopla is about. I could not relate to Baby ie the actor who played the driver.

Baby Driver (2017),"I'm not the biggest Edgar Wright fan but man, I saw the trailer for this and I knew I had to see this as soon as I could. Everything about it seemed like a good time. I like the Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy, each film is funny and solid. I absolutely loathed Scott Pilgrim vs The World though and thought it was terrible. I was hoping for the best Wright ever made with Baby Driver and its pretty nice to say I think we are there with this film. I had pretty high hopes and have to say while the film isn't perfect and struggles a bit at the end its still a satisfying ride.The film follows a quiet but expert heist driver named Baby, and his toils in life which include finding love and the high risk/high reward lifestyle he lives as a getaway driver. Baby is constantly listening to music on different iPods to drown out the sound of tinnitus he developed during a traumatic childhood car accident which killed his parents. I really loved the interactions between Baby (Elgort) and Debora (James). I loved Lily James in Cinderella but I love her even more as the innocent waitress in love here. Side note, but holy cow she really looks like prime Shelly Johnson from Twin Peaks in this.I have to say Edgar Wright puts a wonderful spin on a heist film. Unlike his previous films, the film is really light on comedy and is solely action and style. Its great though. The car weaving scenes are very fun to watch, action scenes edited quite well. As with previous bank heist films the action brings it either with the guns or the frenetic car chases. I have yet to really like Ansel Elgort in something, but this has to be the film that's going to make him a star. I love the characters in this film. Spacey works so well as the leading mastermind behind the heists. Jon Hamm in a villainous role works just as well as Jamie Foxx as Bats. Eiza Gonz√°lez is new to me but wow is she such a gorgeous actress, I may actually take up the From Dusk Till Dawn series now.The best touch in the creation of this film is the ever present soundtrack. Almost every part of the film is accompanied by Baby's iPod song. Its fantastically eclectic and does well to keep pace with the film and accompany different moods and themes as the film progresses. Things get a little messy near the end but I think Edgar Wright is somehow still able to keep it coherent and crazy till the end. This is the type of film that needs a second watch. Its possible that it will go down in in rating on a re-watch. However, its also equally possible for this to enter a personal cult status with another viewing. I'd say Edgar Wright did very well with this one.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
That's my Baby.,"A red Subaru rolls into frame. Vivacious guitar riffs and drumbeats dictate camera cuts, alternating between the four characters within the vehicle. The three that exit are bank robbers, about to perform their rightful duty. The driver stays with the car. With sunglasses and earbuds intact, he begins to lip-sync coolly to the track that blares with immense energy. Soon, that sweet engine revs and we do not stop drifting, baby.During a movie, it is easy to disconnect and greet the monologue inside your own head. Baby Driver does not give you time to do this. It is so well paced that its two- hour run time breezes by. Upon my second viewing, I could not believe how fast one scene fell into the other.A cool rhythm propels the film (not just the rhythm from the expertly selected soundtrack). The quirky undertone and blending genre elements feel fresh and inventive. For example, when you're nicely tucked into the tender romance- BAM- uncomfortable anxiety-consuming situation ensues. Conversely, feeling overwhelmed by too much suspense? SHAZAM: very funny joke pulled from thin air. Edgar does not want you to be bored, not for a moment; he cares about us- it is very nice.Let us talk technicality. The camera is always moving; fluidity moves a scene along. Whether intensifying a car chase, or adding sincere style to the creation of a sandwich, Edgar Wright knows a camera. Pay close attention to the scene after the title screen- feels like a continuous shot. (His idiosyncratic close-up quick zooms are also present, albeit restrained compared to his other films.)It is not often an action movie- let alone any movie- has this much to offer. A car chase heist thriller wrapped in a comedy with romance on top. All clich√©s are steered clear of. It is fun, engaging, unpredictable and purely thrilling. Not one to miss.When to go to the bathroom: The driver enters a room and bubbles are being blown. You have around a minute and a half until important information is revealed.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Has more merits than faults, but certainly not Top250 material","I know...I know. Booo me as much as you desire, but I just can't love this movie, although I wanted to believe the hype badly. Here's what I think: The movie has many merits both acting wise, writing wise and from a technical approach. The editing, the soundtrack and how it works, the sound editing, cinematography all top-class. There are not many actors in the movie but as you can see, the line-up is pretty strong and everyone of them does a great job - Spacey and Foxx are especially good. It was a delight to see Jon Bernthal, too bad he only has a minor role in the movie.So we have a nice idea, a great and cool setting, some interesting or menacing but certainly fun-to-watch characters so almost everything is ready to make up one of the greatest heist-movies in recent memory. What can go wrong? Well, only a few things, and I must state that these things won't bother most people (sadly or thankfully, you decide).As I mentioned, the writers did a great job with the setting and characters - or should I say they had some great ideas, but generally did a lazy work with it? Because I believe this is the case here. Baby Driver is yet again another movie where the premise is extremely promising but execution is decent at best. I had the feeling that the movie is made up of a series of individual takes or clips rather than a well-written flow of events. When you have ideas like ""that would be cool"" but don't know how to make a story around it. The ending is absolute chaos or mess with some totally random character ""development"" which was so upsetting to see.This movie unfortunately can't make up it's mind and I could feel this all way long: it wants to be a romantic movie, a heist movie, but there are so many things that build on characters and dialogue, and unfortunately none of these are top-class or even good job, and as I mentioned it just won't work, the movie makers couldn't mix them into a working piece.Too bad, because they've had a great recipe and some outstanding ingredients.If you read this I'd still suggest to go to the cinema and watch it. Chances are that you'll like it much more than I did, but even I didn't regret buying the ticket because the movie was entertaining. I laughed, I was excited, nervous and of course upset. I'll remember this movie for a very long time - just not as a great one, but one that couldn't realize its immense potential.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Worse than Scott Pilgrim.,"I heard in an interview that Edgar Wright compiled the music for Baby Driver before writing the script. The music (not my cup of tea, but others seem to like it) has clearly been given a lot of consideration; the script, not so much.A hackneyed tale of a young heist driver (Ansel Elgort) indebted to a crime boss (Kevin Spacey), Baby Driver is pure vacuous tripe, a severe case of style over substance, Wright once again proving that, if his film ain't got Pegg and Frost in it, it ain't worth watching.As the viewer, we are intended to empathise with kind-hearted Baby, who would rather provide for his deaf foster father and drive into the sunset with pretty waitress Debora (Lily James) than spend his life outrunning cops, but after a few minutes in his company, I wanted the irritating git out of the picture, his dancing, miming lyrics and playing air instruments quickly getting my goat. I could fully appreciate why the other criminals found him so annoying.Wright handles the car chase scenes well enough, but when the tyres aren't screeching, the film is absolutely horrible, the characters talking like rejects from a bad Tarantino movie, the rapid romance between Baby and Debora utterly unbelievable, and the endless calculated cool scenes merely grating on the nerves.My advice to Edgar Wright: give Pegg and Frost a call and break out the Cornettos.",2.0,Anonymous,Crime
high-octane fun!,"Baby Driver's music is the high-octane fuel that drives this film. Every motion, every spoken word is finely choreographed to its beat. And we, the audience, hold a privileged entry into Baby's world ‚Äì we listen along with him to the playlist blasting through his earbuds. It is not surprising that when a climactic moment arrives, a dropped iPod leads to a scene filled with a terrifying silence. ""Pick it up!"" our inner voice screams - we want that music back as much as Buddy himself, because without it, the real world intervenes in the form of police sirens and gun shots and murderous mayhem. Buddy's relentless earworms appear in the form of Kevin Spacey doing his Bad Boss shtick but this time with heart; a marvelous turn from Jon Hamm, a worm who cannot be stopped,and Jamie Foxx provides cross-melodies of super psycho crazy. Eliza Gonzales shines as the twisted moll, and Lily James dazzles with her child/woman innocence.

One memorable adrenaline-pumping mayhem indeed,"Baby (Ansel Elgort) is a young talented getaway driver for criminal mastermind (Kevin Spacey) who values his role in meticulously planned robberies. Also starring, a bunch of cool cats including Jon Hamm (¬ÑMad Men""), Jon Bernthal (¬ÑThe Walking Dead"", also Frank Castle in ¬ÑDaredevil"" and ¬ÑThe Punisher"" series), Jamie Foxx, Eiza Gonz√°lez, Lily James, CJ Jones, Sky Ferreira, Flea et al. I have always felt that people shouldn't be OK with mediocre or shitty screenplays in action movies just because we're talking about ¬Ñjust action movies"" or ¬Ñjust entertainment"". I can't enjoy bad writing or lots of tired clich√©s in any genre, and luckily once in a while I do come across a good action movie which has, among other good things, a quality storytelling. ¬ÑBaby Driver"" is one of those ‚Äì easily one of the best action movie of the summer, of the year and recent times. I love almost everything about it, although I think it would benefit from a more compact final act which turns out to be a overlong series of chases, some by car, some by foot. The main man behind all that goodness is Edgar Wright, director and a sole screenwriter. Yeah, I had to look his name up from IMDb, too. Wright has already given birth to some modern classics already, namely cult action comedies ¬ÑShaun of the Dead"" and ¬ÑHot Fuzz"" (paving way to the stardom of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost) and ¬ÑScott Pilgrim vs. the World"" (one of the most constantly entertaining comic-based movies ever). And ¬ÑBaby Driver"" may well be his best, most fully realized work yet. One would think that a story based on driving cars fast can't give us anything fresh, but ¬ÑBaby Driver"" actually manages to breath a lot of new life into this. According to the makers, tricks and chases do not rely on computer effects, and the result is one memorable adrenaline-pumping mayhem indeed. But there's much more to it than fast cars. The movie is above average in every aspect I can think of ‚Äì character-building, storytelling, creating suspense, making the actors look cool (an important thing for any action movie!). The visual side is a constant source of pleasure as well, it's carefully and masterfully orchestrated, down to details and including the inventive use of pop music which turns out to be quite an important part of the whole result. All that seems to have inspired actors too whose work is memorable all-around. Wright seems to have almost Tarantino-like talent to make actors cool, or formerly quite cool actors interesting again. Case in point: Jamie Foxx and Jon Hamm in ¬ÑBaby Driver"". The central weight of the story still lies on one character, Baby. And this turns out to be one of the rare instances in action movies where giving a lot of backstory to central hero pays off totally and doesn't bore at all. Any of the ten million generic superhero movies made in past, present and future should learn from that. (BTW, Wright has co- written ""Ant-Man"" and Spielberg's ""Tintin"".) Ansel Elgort has previously starred as Caleb in ¬ÑDivergent"" series, which is some YA crap or other. He was also in ¬ÑThe Fault in Our Stars"" (also YA, but not crappy) and Jason Reitman's forgettable ¬ÑMen, Women & Children"". But ¬ÑBaby Driver"" could be his true ticket to wider fame, and this young man is likable enough to deserve it. The only thing a bit unattractive about ¬ÑBaby Driver"" is its title, although you will understand and like it more once you have started watching. It's the best 112 minutes I've spent watching action movie in a long time. Give it a chance. It kicks ass.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
An erratic illogical dream,"The only good part of the movie was the music. I am not sure how a movie like this gets an 8.1, while something entertaining like Valerian gets a 6 something. From the get go the movie has the feel of a dream rather than a sound logical thought out story. The violence is senseless and the planning of the heists even more. And the ending... even a clich√©d hackneyed 'good' ending would have been better than an ending that doesn't leave you with much of anything.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Fast, frenetic, and swarming with wit --  Edgar Wright's Bady Driver is a total joyride","You can always count on Edgar Wright to load his films with plenty of good humor and wit. When tackling the action genre, Wright proves more than capable of splashing the screen with immense laughter and intelligence without tossing its thrills aside -- a common problem among many entries of the genre. Baby Driver is a movie that gets the blood pumping the minute it open, while staying almost consistently entertaining following the near two-hour proceeding. When it gets down to the action, it is pulse-pounding. When it gets down to the talking, it is funny. And like his previous projects, Wright happens to run with a style-over-substance vibe. Whereas some films it serves as a detriment to the final product, here it is almost profoundly satisfying . Mixing a hodgepodge of adrenaline- fueled action and humor with a killer soundtrack, Wright knows how to give the audiences a blast without sacrificing intellect. This film follows Baby (played by Ansel Egdorf), a twenty-something year old man working as a getaway driver for his team consisting of Griff (played by Jon Bernthal), Buddy (played by Jon Hamm), and Darling (played by Eiza Gonzalez) to rob banks for his mob boss Doc (played by Kevin Spacey). Baby proves to be a highly skilled driver with his ability to escape the cops and pull off outrageous stunts while slaving his ears to music on his iPod. At night, he is at home taking care of his deaf foster father Joseph (played by C.J. Jones). After finishing what is intended to be his last job, Baby falls for a beautiful waitress named Deborah (played by Lily James). When he gets call back for one last job with his new consisting of Griff, Darling, and a tough-as-nails gangster named Bats (played by Jamie Foxx), things get dangerous very quick.Edgar Wright operates this film in a way that boasts plenty of style and smarts from its opening minute. From the frenetic action sequences, to the snappy dialogue, to the smoking hot soundtrack -- this film is brimming with cleverness. In the opening scene showcasing the characters' escape from the cops following a bank robbery, Wright proves to be highly skilled at shooting action scenes and editing them with precision. Rather than chopping the scene up with split-second cuts, Wright captures the full frenetic energy of the scene as the lead character races through the streets while scurrying through semi- heavy traffic. This is when he starts a song from the 70s or 80s on his iPod. To add to the mix, Wright effectively choreographs these scenes in a fashion that matches up with the beat of the music, one scene involving a gunfight in which he performs this flawlessly. The final results are car chases injected with more substance than what we are often accustomed to in the 'Fast and Furious' movies. And like Wright's previous flicks, there is some unexpected moments of gore. When Baby is not dodging the cops or unleashing the bullets, the film takes it time to treat viewers with some funny dialogue, particularly when Jamie Foxx comes on screen. Exhibiting a darkly funny streak, Foxx breaths some comedic gold in his role, delivering one snappy one-liner after another. He is often the power source for laughs. Ansel Egdorf, stepping into his first high-octane role, is suitably appealing as the lead character with an upsetting past that this otherwise light- hearted picture sporadically explores. His romance is with Lily James is charming, but perhaps nothing sizzling. Nonetheless, it is become rarer and rarer for action comedies nowadays to uproot characters we truly care about, particularly one trying to battle his inner demons when caught in a dangerous situation. Then there is Kevin Spacey just being himself like in nearly other role he's endeavored.Baby Driver is a high-octane action comedy that knows how to deliver both the fun and intellectual touch. In the summer with superhero flicks and other highly anticipated pictures arriving on the scene, this is a film that may not see too much sunshine at the box office. Regardless, this movie is a total blast that deserves the attention of many, especially those converted to the Edgar Wright fandom.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
A genre classic,"I have to admit I've never been a massive fan of Edgar Wright, (with the exception of the highly imaginative ""Scott Pilgrim Versus the Wold""). His genre comedies never seemed as ground-breaking as he, and lots of others, seemed to think; entertaining to be sure, but hardly classics and now ""Baby Driver"" arrives, swathed in hype and glowing reviews and would you believe it, for the first thirty minutes or so I thought, here we go again, nowhere at very high speed. Then something happened; I'm not sure what or at what point. Was it a line, (and there are a lot of good lines), or just a bit of action that didn't feel too derivative? Anyway, suddenly I started to get drawn in and finally I was hooked.What hooked me? Well, not Baby for sure. Ansel Elgort is a good-looking kid, like the guys you see a lot nowadays in advertisements; the kind of guys who are meant to sell you the products but who are actually the kind of guys I, for one, would like to slap...hard. And he never really changes. He meets a girl who is also cute and she has a very wide smile and very white teeth. She's played by ""Downton Abbey's"" Lily James and I wanted to slap her too though by the end I had kind of warmed to her a little. She's put into danger and I'm a sucker for a damsel in distress. No, it wasn't Ansel and it wasn't Lily that hooked me or even drew me in, so who? That's easy. ""Baby Driver"" has three of the best bad guys I've seen in a movie in years, not to mention some of the best stunt driving as well as a cracking script from Wright. Easy to get hooked, then. The bad guys are Kevin Spacey, Jamie Foxx and Jon Hamm and there's a pretty tough cookie of a bad girl played by Eliza Gonzalez. Spacey is Mr Big. He's a villain but his Achilles Heel is a a soft spot for Baby and Spacey carries off the tough/tender side of his character brilliantly but it's his henchmen, Foxx and Hamm, who are the real villains, (Foxx, in particular, is the kind of guy who would blow away a baby sooner than look at him), and they would lift a movie half as good and send it off into the stratosphere and they do. They make being this bad feel like fun; as does Wright. He was, of course, up against it, through ""The Driver"" to ""Drive"", ""Baby Driver"" had a lot to live up to and it does. There's a moment near the end when it evokes ""Thelma and Louise"" and any mention of ""Bonnie and Clyde"" is bound to be dangerous. We're not in that class, I admit, but Elgot and James notwithstanding, ""Baby Driver"" is still a genre classic.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
It was OK. But I'm a little disappointed (prob bcs of hype),"Once again, expectations ruins the party. It's impossible not to expect great things when a movie gets such praise as this one got. And I gotta say, I'm a little disappointed.It's not bad, it doesn't suck. It has qualities, no doubt. It's an alright movie, but that's it for me. Alright.The first half hour or so, was kind of boring to me. Some cool details sprinkled here and there, but nothing more. Then something clicks and the movie steps it up a little. But still it's like.. overall it's just OK. The characters are OK, sadly not half as cool as they (try hard) are supposed to be. Some of them are slightly annoying, but nothing that ruins the movie or anything.The action is pretty good and well edited, I maybe thought the shootouts were a little too hectic though. But the driving is solid, but not out of this world.The music I found to be tiring. Yes, it's there for a reason, but it's just too much. And the love story? Gtfo. Love story? Like really? That did suck.To sum up. If I hadn't known anything, I would probably have liked it better, but I did know something, so here we are. Score. I'll probably rate it a 7, even though I am tempted to give it a 6, but I think that's too low. Somewhere between 6 and 7, then. If I see it again, maybe I'll bump it up, who knows. Weak 7 for now.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Baby Driver Delivers a Nice Genre Mashup and it Provides a Much Needed Break From a Summer Dominated by Franchises and Tentpoles,"*Minor Spoilers Ahead* We join our titular hero Baby (Ansel Elgort) sitting outside in a red Subaru. The rest of the crew is in robbing a bank while he's rocking out to the song Bellbottoms by the band John Spencer Blues Explosion. Baby was in an accident as a child and he's been plagued by tinnitus (a constant ringing in his ears) so he listens to music constantly to drown it out. The alarms sound and the rest of the crew: Buddy (Jon Hamm), Darling (Eiza Gonzalez) and Griff (Jon Bernthal) bolt out of the exit. Baby is their getaway driver and through some impressive work behind the wheel, he's able to get the crew out of harm's way and to their safe house. Doc (Kevin Spacey) divides up the take and they go their separate ways. Doc and Baby hang back, Doc plans the heists but he and Baby have an off-the-books arrangement. Baby doesn't get a share as recompense for a debt he's working off to Doc. Baby stands out from the rest of the crew because he's young and relatively innocent. He doesn't enjoy what he does and he seeks an escape, which he finds in Debora (Lily James). She's a waitress at a local diner and they bond over music. The only thing in the way of their relationship is Baby's job because all it takes is a ring of the phone and he has to set out for another dangerous mission.Baby Driver isn't as big or as flashy as some of the other movies coming out this summer. It was done on a relatively small budget and compared to movies like the Fate of the Furious, it's also relatively low key. This isn't a bad thing though, the action scenes are thrilling and I appreciated the fact that they were a little closer to reality. The movie also stays very grounded in this gangster/heist story. It doesn't have a lot of grand ambition but that didn't bother me at all. They handle it well and they provide enough surprises to keep things entertaining. The other thing is that this movie has style to burn. They really commit to utilizing the soundtrack. I loved how the action turns with the music, some of gunfire syncs up with the bass for example and it made things just that much more fun.With such a big name director, an accomplished cast was an almost certainty and there's plenty of talent to go around in Baby Driver. I'm not really familiar with Ansel and he threw me off a little at the beginning because he's so animated when he's jamming to his music. Once the character settles down a little, Baby is easy to like and the same goes for Elgort's performance. Lily James doesn't have a ton to work with as Debora but she has good chemistry with Elgort and she adds to the movie. Jon Hamm slips into his role as Buddy seamlessly and he looks like he's having funny playing a different type of role. Kevin Spacey is one of the best actors working and I enjoyed his performance in every scene. He borders on chewing the scenery but he hit the right notes. Eiza Gonzalez is beautiful and she works really well with Jon Hamm. If I walked away surprised with anyone it was Jamie Foxx. He was really menacing here, and although he's playing a terrible person, he was impressive. Don't go in expecting a lot of Jon Bernthal screen time though.Baby Driver delivers a lean story but Edgar Wright doesn't pull any punches with the ending. The movie shifts into a breakneck pace and it sprints from plot point to plot point and set piece to set piece. You get some unexpected twists and turns and although they throw so much at you in a short period, I thought they largely nailed it. I always prefer an exciting wrap up if the movie can execute it and I think that Baby Driver accomplished that.I'm more than willing to keep shouting this movie's praises but I have to include some very minor complaints. Involving a romance as a subplot in a movie is difficult because unless they shape some really interesting characters, you just want to get back to the action. Baby Driver does this better than most but I didn't buy the romance completely. I saw this with a friend and she thought that it drifted around being really corny. I wouldn't describe it that way but Baby and Debora fall for each other real hard, real quick and it can be hard to buy that she'd be so willing to give up her entire life after only knowing Baby for so long. How certain characters act stretches believability, they don't go too far but these characters acted crazy enough to strain plausibility.With the surprise success of Baby Driver at the box office, there's already talk of a possible sequel which isn't usually Edgar Wright's style. If we get that sequel, I'd be happy as this was a fresh and well-crafted summer movie. But I'd honestly be okay if Baby Driver was a standalone. They wrap up the movie so well and Baby doesn't need another adventure to expand upon his story. This movie doesn't leave you wanting more, it makes you want to go see this again. I can't give Baby Driver a perfect grade but I was so excited leaving the theatre. You don't get a movie that comes so close to ticking all the boxes of things you want very often. Baby Driver blows by the competition and leaves you with some great action, an interesting and tight story and some funky tunes to boot.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Watchable,"Do you prefer an old-school American soundtracks? The film concentrates the audience around the music.Main characters of the film are the best side of the movie.The lead role in this film is taken by Ansel Elgort (Baby). Despite of his ages he worked very good. Kevin Spacey as Doc, the mysterious kingpin after the gang. Lily James as Debora, a young waitress who befriends Baby.SoB-A-B-Y. He is a driver, though he is not a mediocre one. He listens to music 24/7 and drives as fast as bullet. The plot is trivial, but it's more about cool cars, hot girls, good music and whatever rather than plot.I would put 8 from 10, because the plot isn't good, but soundtrack, actors play and jokes are really good. Also I liked that the apogee of this film is in the last quarter. I think Ansel Elgort played really good, maybe, 8 from 10, he merges coolness and calmness in one guy. Of course soundtrack is 10/10.

Go for A Drive with Baby Driver,"Baby Driver! When I saw this trailer months ago I had no idea what to think about it just from the title alone. Yet seeing a star studded cast that included Jon Hamm, Lily James, Kevin Spacey and Jamie Foxx, I had hopes for a good movie. So, with it rushing into a midweek premiere I managed to finally check it out this weekend. What's the verdict on the action/crime movie to hit the screen. Robbie K here always appreciating your views on his blog. Let's get started!LIKES:The Acting: I don't say this too much, but this cast was aces across the board. Let's start with the lead Ansel Elgort who plays Baby. At first I was only impressed with his ability to be the awkward silent type, but as the movie progresses Elgort is able to bring a little more to the screen to round out Baby. His range broadens as more characters are introduced into the film and he has to balance between the two worlds that he lives in. As kind of his looming shadow, the master villain Kevin Spacey continues to play that cool, calculating, manipulative role that he made famous in House of Cards. Not too much to be annoying, but not too little to be cheated Spacey really brings depth to a clich√© role and keeps things heated up. As for Foxx, well his acting continues to improve me in spectrum he can cover. Taking more of the jaded thug approach, Foxx adds the comedic heat to the film with the darker theme taking hold. I could spend the whole review on the chemistry of everyone, but Baby Driver's cast is stellar.The Action: For a crime thriller toting about the stunts and guns, the movie certainly delivers. Baby Driver shifts the gear into R for reality and manages to deliver sequences that are exciting chases through obstacle laden courses with all the bells and whistles. Unlike the Fast and The Furious, this movie keeps things on a believable level, requiring actual stunt driving instead of high tech gadgets. Even the gunplay is exciting, finally adopting the crime motif we had in the mafia movie days instead of the explosion loaded productions famous of modern cinema. The action is well directed, and used as a supporting tool to keep the film exciting and fast paced without being the only aspect of the movie.The Story: Most crime stories bore me these days because they get too caught up in either sex or malicious violence. While Baby Driver is certainly darker in its own accord, it has a story that doesn't dance in one area. A combination of love, action, and crime drama, the storyboard writers get props from me for crafting a decently balanced story. Baby's character is complicated (though the trailers might mislead you), and they managed to gradually peel this character apart and help him transform into someone completely new. To do this all while bringing forth a story that doesn't put me to sleep but keep me on edge is certainly worthy of two thumbs up.The Music: The theme of Baby Driver is music (he is always wearing headphones if you haven't seen the trailers), and that means you need a strong soundtrack. Mission successful on this part too. While I'm not quite familiar with some of these classics (yes boo me), they music directors selected a fantastic spread to entertain us with. Across many genres and decades, your ears will be swallowed by a deluge of classics, each fitting with the tone of the movie and providing great sound support to the impressive visuals. And if you don't know these tunes, well the internet is still a wonderful thing when used appropriately. DISLIKES:No unifying crime plot: In many crime movies, there is a big score, a key target, or some unifying goal. Baby Driver though doesn't have that big, impending doom I often like to see, choosing instead to focus more on Baby himself. While certainly a small dislike, I felt the unifying theme or grand plan could have provided a little more oomph to the story and a way to integrate Spacey's character even more.Romance Aspect: I'm not saying this is bad, and again I'm grasping at most straws, but Baby Driver's romance component needs a little work. Lily James and Elgort have some decent chemistry and work well together in the scenes where they are paired. However, I feel that this component was a little glazed over up until the climax where the crap starts to hit the fan. Expanding this role again would have tied some things together and integrated the cast a little better to complete the story.Part of the Ending: This dislike is again complicated, but I'll do my best to explain. Baby Driver's ending is certainly unique and took many directions I liked in the form of being non- clich√©, artistic, and exciting on many levels. Yet about fifteen minutes of the ending was dragged out entirely too long and started hitting that ridiculous level Hollywood often hits. The vicious parts were a little overdramatic and the predictable twists just led to more run time that wasn't really needed. Still it wrapped up nicely and had a self-gratifying finish, it just didn't need to be that complicated.The Verdict:I agree with many that Baby Driver is one awesome film. Despite the weird title (which yes is a song title), it works on many levels primarily in regards to a suspenseful action tale with strong story elements. Baby Driver is an example of what movies can be if done right and I for one recommend hitting this movie in theaters. Of note, use caution when taking younger audience members due to the violence please.My scores:Action/Crime/Music: 9.0 Movie Overall: 8.0",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Minority review,"'Baby Driver' is one of the most praised movies on IMDb that I have ever seen, and after comparing different feature films that are currently screened the choice was quite clear. While overall I did like 'Baby Driver', I definitely do not share the enthusiasm of the vast majority of the reviewers here. I'll briefly go over my point of view on the movie and then share my likes and dislikes.'Baby Driver' is a heist movie; however, the accent here is on the getaway. The plannings and the robberies are in the background. Besides that there are the usual themes: the last job, misfits who find each other and psycho robbers/killers who pull off the heist.For me, the best parts of the movie were the car chases. Not perfect, but still great and quite original. They felt quite authentic as well. Reminiscent of the chases in the Bourne series but slightly better.The other things I liked were: the acting and the camera work. I think that every actors did well, but I'd mention Jamie Foxx as being the most convincing in his role.For the faults (from my perspective) I would pick the third heist as the major one. It is where all started to disintegrate and became quite stupid. It's first evident in the choice of the crew members, the relationship between Baby and Doc, The chain of events and the overlong, quite boring standoff between the main protagonist and the main antagonist.I'll sum it up by saying that It just didn't meet my expectation. Yes, after reading the description and reviews I thought that perhaps it would be something like 'The Town' or even 'Heat' with those ratings. However, unlike the noted movies, this one was full of idiots as robbers and stupidity ruled.

Amazing long take in opening,"The opening scene is very attracted with intense robbery and escaped racing. Very impressed with Baby's musical coffee purchase long take. Music is everywhere in this movie, although as a non-native English speaker, I don't understand many the meaning and the history behind those songs, yet the music rhyme was right there with me. The movie rhythm sensation is awesome, the director really mixing the music and the racing very well, unlike the Fabulous XX totally bummed me out.Illogical movie parts: 1)Baby almost wearing the same suit all over the time, and police have his photo capture, and no one ever tried to report him. 2)The inconsistency from the character, the bad big boss died by suddenly changed mind and tried to cover for Baby.Anyway, I like the movie because the ending is not drama at all, very glad to see a movie that criminal leading character ends under justice judge, a good logical end.A criminal is criminal, even he is innocent. Besides, Baby stole cars in young age already. This end is in line with my logic, unlike some Hollywood Criminals Happy Escape movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Best fun film of 2017,"Edgar Wright is a modern alchemist. He is able to use all of his great technique to confect these cinematic sensations from hybridising horror and working class comedy in ""Shaun of the Dead"" to mashing a rom com with a video action film in ""Scott Pilgrim"" and finally with his latest chimaera, a musical, yes you read that right, with a top notch heist thriller. That unholy mixture is breathtakingly arrogant and he just about pulls it off. The plot is the stuff of a million genre flicks. Good guy criminal is forced to do jobs and work with people he doesn't like but he will soon be out. Sure, the focus is on the getaway driver but even that we have seen from Ryan O'Neal in ""The Driver"" all the way to a few years ago and Ryan Gosling in ""Drive"". The twist it is not about the plot. Wright's genius is the prism through which he tells that story and it will come as a shock that much of this film is closer to ""Singing in the Rain"" then ""Heat"". So we must talk about his cast because if anyone can put an ensemble together it is Edgar Wright. If you look at all his earlier films there are breakout performances scattered everywhere. It is easy to forget that he selected Brie Larson to play Envy Adams who five years later would be receiving an Oscar for Best Actress. In this film he has plucked out Ansel Elgort as the eponymous driver and what a find. I recognised Elgort from the Divergent films but in this he is a charisma explosion and moves so silkily that I would be surprised if he hadn't trained as a dancer. Elgort is paired with Lily James who I thought was underwhelming in the BBC production of ""War and Peace"" but here she is great concoction of innocence and hometown sex appeal. And what a voice! The rest of the cast is a who's who of fantastic actors: Kevin Spacey, Jamie Foxx, and Jon Bernthal. Jon Hamm and newcomer Eiza Gonzales do a twist on Bonny and Clyde and steal all their screen time. This is easily Hamm's best film role of his career and shows he has some post Mad Men life in him. In the end, it all comes back to Wright. The film is, especially at the beginning, too postured and not as organic as ""Scott Pilgrim"" but I think like ""LaLa Land"", Wright had to establish what type of world we are entering. It might explain that a lot of people are saying they are enjoying the second viewing more than the first. In my experience, it took almost the first act for the film to find its feet and then it exploded as a mixture of music, great editing and clever amalgams on known film tropes. This is one of those films that cannot be analysed: see it and experience the wall of sound and action that is Edgar Wright and ""Baby Driver"".",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Baby Driver.,"Baby Driver is ""OK"" but in my opinion a bit overrated. It's fun and can amuse you if you're bored and don't know what to watch but above that it's a just a regular and forgettable movie, so don't expect anything special.
The cinematography and action are good as there are exciting car-chasing sense in the film. Acting is not great but acceptable thanks to Kevin Spacey.
On the other hand, the charecters are basic and unlikable and as I mentioned, they won't stay in your mind after the movie. For me the story was also very unclear and aimless. I mean, was it about love, dedication, revenge or a robbery gang? The only thing I saw was a nice kid who can drive",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
And Baby you..... are the reason I can flyyyyyy,"Instant classic. Nothing much to say really especially if you love cars and music like me. Speaking of cars, this really reminded me of the earlier iterations of The Fast and Furious franchise and how exciting those car chases were.

Edgar Wright melds old and new in this brilliant new take on an old formula.,"I could say that Baby Driver is a complete rehash of the Fast and Furious genre. I could say that it has no original flair or plot, and that the characters were all one-dimensional cardboard cutouts. But this would be patently false. Baby Driver is the perfect meld between old and new. The plot is atypical Hollywood, but every other element reeks of style, flair, and perfection that seems only achievable in modern cinema by Edgar Wright and Wes Anderson. If I could describe this film in one word, it would be love. Edgar Wright loves this film, it is completely his, and it certainly shows. This film is a visual and audial tour de force, unmatched by the bloated spectacles of the majority of modern Hollywood. Somehow, Edgar Wright has packed a relatively small budget film (for this day and age) with so much love and care that it will keep internet film buffs talking about it for years to come. Welcome to Edgar Wright's heist movie fantasy.
 First off, I'd like to talk about sound. The music and sound design take a front seat in the hard-shifting, tire squealing world of Baby Driver. From the very first moment in the film, even before it has faded up from black, the main character Baby (Ansel Elgort), is introduced by a slight ringing in the background. We learn later in the film that this is because Baby has tinnitus, an incessant ringing in the ears caused by a plot relevant incident. This small moment sets the stage perfectly for the detail present in the rest of the film. Whenever there is no music playing, the ringing creeps in unbidden, like an intrusive afterthought. Baby uses the music to drown out the ringing. When the music stops, Baby loses his rhythm and concentration. The entire film becomes more jarring whenever the music stops, reflecting the unease the ringing brings to Baby. Whenever the music is playing, the film maintains its beat perfectly. Every single gunshot in the film is synced with the music. Every action performed, every cut, practically every step is in time with the music. It is relentless in it's pursuit of musical perfection. From the opening scene, straight into the second scene, the film demonstrates its dedication to music. Baby drives, walks, and even talks to the beat of whatever he's listening to. The keen eared viewer can learn more about the characters in this film by listening closely, than just about any other film. In this way, Baby Driver is basically one of the best pieces of musical theater in the last decade. Who knew ""Bellbottoms"" and ""Harlem Shuffle"" could fit so perfectly as heist music.
 Secondly, I'd like to discuss the visual aspect of the film. Edgar Wright has a reputation for showing subtly striking visuals that stick around in your brain long after they have faded from the screen. This is most often not achieved through flashy VFX, but through clever lighting, costuming, and camera angles. For example, a simple ¬º rotated high angle shot of Baby's instantly recognizable sunglasses, earbuds, and jacket behind the wheel of a car becomes a staple for the film after only the opening scene. That opening shot holds so much information, it's mind boggling. The sunglasses convey that he's emotionally distant, the ipod gives him a slightly carefree attitude and introduces the entire films love for music, the black and white color scheme of his jacket and shirt show he's divided between the light and the dark in his life. These are only the things I picked up on. I'm sure there was so much more that I missed. This is only a taste of what is to come in the rest of the film. That sort of attention to detail and loving care is kept up throughout the entire film. There are so many examples of small details that really make this film. The first time Baby sees his love interest Deborah (Lily James), a piece of heart graffiti in the background changes from black to red. That sort of detail doesn't happen from just any film. Things like that are what make this one special.
 The things I've mentioned in this review so far are mostly technical. It is most definitely worth mentioning that every performance in this film is stellar. The star-studded cast list truly does not disappoint. Ansel Elgort, Jamie Foxx, John Hamm, Eiza Gonzalez, an Lily James are all exceptional. All in all, I believe this movie is truly something exceptional. It is a masterwork of craft and style. Come for the car chases, stay for everything else.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

"I normally love Edgar Wright, but this disappointed me in the end. His weakest film.","I have enjoyed all of Edgar Wright's movies since Shaun of the Dead, and he has made one of my all time favourites (Scott Pilgrim), so I was pretty excited about this one. I went into it clean, without seeing any trailers, and was convinced purely by word of mouth and the director's track record. All I knew is that it as about some kind of heist and a great driver. I bought into the hype and was looking for another winner from Wright.It started off great, with engaging action and an intriguing story. It had some good potential, but it fell apart for me in the third act. The characters did things you wouldn't expect them to, and I was left wondering ""what was the point of all this?"". It had some of the feeling of Pulp Fiction to me (great visuals and style, and you're rooting for a guy trying to get out of a bad situation he's found himself in with criminals), but it fizzled out in the end.It wasn't a bad movie per se, but I expected more from Wright. In the end it was his weakest film to me, and I don't think it's one I'd recommend.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Completely silly waste of time -- for teens and under ONLY, if that","With all the hype over this movie, I had to come in here and try and be one little island of reason amidst the ocean of insanity. For the life of me, I cannot understand how it's getting any praise at all, let alone heaps of it. The premise/plot is colossally stupid, so it's check-your-brain-at-the-door stuff from the get-go. But even within those cartoonish parameters, there is not one interesting story element nor compelling character to be found. The movie is clich√© after clich√©. It has this one parlor trick, which surely you've heard about, where it often syncopates the (ridiculous) action with the music track. To which I reply, okay, fine. In no way do I see how this somehow elevates the terrible script and two-dimensional characters. At no point did I care about what happened to anyone. I hate to overuse simple descriptors like ""dumb"" or ""pointless,"" but honestly, I can't use them enough about this movie.

Obnoxiously bad.,"It's been a while since seeing ""Baby Driver"", but reading some of the reviews here reminded me of how much I despised this film. This is a film for youngsters who seem to think upbeat music, pretty actors, and flashy car chases make a good movie. The rest of us - those of us with hair on our balls, know better. Anyone with even decent intelligence will be repulsed by the relentless onslaught of cliche upon cliche, the awful dialogue, the thinly-drawn characters that we're somehow supposed to be emotionally invested in, or the pointless chase scenes that are supposed to suffice for ""drama"". The cinematic device of syncing action and car chase scenes to upbeat music may work for music video's (of which Edgar Wright has a few under his belt), but there's a line where it becomes a gimmick (see most of Quentin Tarantino's films to see how it's done WELL). Being bombarded with a bad movie gets annoying after a while, and ""Baby Driver"" was no exception. Even the cliche of ""Baby"" having a black guardian is trotted out (so many modern hero's are paired up with black characters just to show how cool \ post-racial they are (see Clint Eastwood)). Also frustrating - packing the cast with otherwise talented actors, but giving them nothing of substance to say or do. (Guess even GOOD actors gotta eat...) Not to mention the ridiculously thin love story that we're supposed to believe. .The up-side of a disaster like ""Baby Driver"", and it's incredibly undeserved high ratings, is that Hollywood will keep people employed, as it sees there's a market for this kind of drivel. And that's also the down-side.",,Anonymous,Crime
The most stylish movie of the year so far,"I knew I will like this movie as soon as I was finished watching the first trailer, but I didn't know I will be so pleased. Baby driver is not just a film, it can easily be one of the best musical we have seen so far this year. Every scene, every action has a rhythm to it. Every dialogue, every expression attached to a musical note. This movie is a good example of how greatness can be achieved by efficiently scoring the movie.Baby driver is about a getaway driver who got mixed with the wrong crowd when he was young and is now forced to pull heiss with them. Everything goes 'Bananas' when he falls in love and starts finding a way out.I've always been a big fan of Edgar Wright. But I always thought it is because Simon Pegg is his lucky charm. I know 'Scott Pilgrim vs the World' was good but it was nothing compared to 'Shaun of the Dead' or 'Hot Fuzz'. I even like 'At World's End' more. But at last, he has proved me wrong. Before going to watch Baby Driver, I also thought it could be that the movie may depend too much on the performances by the big names like Kevin Spacey and Jamie Foxx, but that was not the case. It was the amazing music and insane action sequences which are the actual star of the film.Some of the amazing scores of the movie are, 'Hocus Pocus' by Focus, 'Tequila' by The Champs and 'Brighton Rock' by Queen. Other worthwhile mentions are Egyptian Reggae, Bellbottoms, Smokey Joe's La La and B-A-B- Y Baby. I remember I was shaking my head in the theater on every one of these songs. It felt like every song just fits with the frame perfectly.There was this one scene which reminded me of another one from Shaun of the Dead, where Simon Pegg wakes up and goes to a shop to buy something. There is a similar one-shot scene here as well which resembles. I found out that such long one shots can be seen in other Edgar Wright movies as well.Ansel Elgort has done amazing in a movie which could be his big break into critically acclaimed mainstream cinema. Although he shared the screen with Kevin Spacey and others, he made sure that audience will remember who the movie is really about. His character is cool, stylish, mysterious but funny at the same time. Spacey and Hamm both looked badass. But Jamie Foxx was the one who I liked the most, after Elgort off course. His character was the usual type of villain you love to hate and Foxx played it exactly like that. Also, Eiza Gonzalez played this hot love interest of Jon Hamm's character. Lily James looked cute.So, in the end, I would like to say that Baby Driver is an awesome start for this season. After this, we have Spiderman ‚Äì Homecoming, War of the Planet of the Apes (I am really excited about this one) and Dunkirk coming right after on another. So go watch it instead of going for Transformers and The Mummy.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
I respect this one and it is worth seeing...though I didn't exactly enjoy it.,"""Baby Driver"" is an ultra-violent and nihilistic film...one where there really is no one to root for and which is NOT a film for the average viewer. I am warning you....think twice about this one before you decide to see it.The story is about a very strange young man--one unlike any other in the history of film. Based on his behaviors, he seems to be somewhere on the autism spectrum. While he appears pretty normal in some ways, he is ultra-bizarre. When he's out driving getaway cars, he is VERY odd in that he MUST have head phones on and music blaring and unless he has a rhythm, he cannot drive...or so he's come to believe. How he got involved in this sort of life, the film never really explains...though it's odd seeing a boy who looks like an ad for milk hanging with a group of psychotics who commit the most brazen and horrific robberies.And this brings me to the violence....as these folks are psychotics who don't mind killing folks. One in particular seems to LOVE killing people and with absolutely no regard for the consequences. And, the last 1/4 of the movie is pretty much nothing but fast-paced action and horrific violence.Despite the violence (which really turned me off), the film is pretty incredible in many ways. The way the music and action and dialog all work together was amazing....and how the writer/director Edgar Wright did all this is incredible and difficult. Also, the driving stunts are among the greatest you can find on the screen. Finally, I loved that they actually used an honest to goodness deaf person to play a deaf person...and had his friend/caretaker learn very proficient sign language that is much better than you normally see in a movie (I know because my daughter is deaf and we sign in our home). It was obvious Wright really wanted to get all the details right...perhaps obsessively so. Perhaps the obsessions of Baby were inspired by Wright's own obsessiveness?I think this is a film I'd say folks should see it once. You might not like it or you might be horrified by it....but try it unless you know that the violence will be too much...in which case, skip this one.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Baby Driver Can't Completely Get Away from the Action Movie Clich√©s.,"I am typically a tough reviewer when it comes to the action genre. Not because I don't enjoy films of this genre, I really am entertained; but, when I regularly speak to myself in my head while watching the movie saying: ""Hey, I was right!"", then the level of predictability has definitely taken a toll on my viewing.Don't expect Baby Driver to appear on the ""Oscar Nominees"" list of this upcoming award season, but don't restrict yourself from watching it due to that fact. It's a blast. You're constantly cheering Baby (Ansel Elgort) on as he drifts around the ""bad guys"" (who are actually the good guys) despite the fact that you know he's going to win, because, well why would they have him arrested within the first twenty minutes? That's the kind of predictability I am witnessing when watching Baby Driver. It isn't necessarily a BAD film, quite the contrary actually. But the level of ""fresh"" I receive from this movie is no more mind boggling than that of the new Wonder Woman. It is a fresh character feat within a typical car chase movie. Don't I sound harsh? It's odd hearing this even from myself because if a friend came to me and said: ""Hey you see that new movie that's getting' all the rage from Rotten Tomatoes, Baby Driver?"" I will still answer "" Yes I did, and it was a fun a** movie, go see it"". I enjoyed Baby Driver, I just wished it drifted (ha) away from the action clich√©s. The director, Edgar Wright, may have just produced his greatest movie to this date, (sorry Shaun of the Dead fans) but it still needs a bit more to be a ""two thumbs up"" movie. I respect the effort of the director, trying to revive a genre so suffocated by clich√©s. Oh and the cast was pretty fantastic. Ansel Elgort played the shy hero well enough to earn my recognition for his future roles, Jamie Foxx always entertains, even the deaf room mate Joseph tugged the heartstrings of the audiences with his selfless generosity. You deserve better Joseph. And of course, Kevin Spacey delivers a solid performance again. That's pretty self explanatory. I just wish his character, was written with the same effort as Ansel's character was. Baby Driver: It was great in all the right places, but just ""good"" in too many places.***/****",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
An Enjoyable Thrill Ride,"Jam packed with a wonderful soundtrack, great acting and cinematography, and a fresh, original idea, Baby Driver is an enjoyable thrill ride. The movie is fresh and organic, from the first 10 minutes to the last. Edgar Wright, along with the team of filmmakers and acting talent, really bring this movie together with the diverse array of character personalities which help bring distinction and fun to each scene. Lily James and Ansel Elgort have great on screen chemistry that bring about an innocence and infatuation in their relationship. Scenes are quick and witty, with an incredible usage of camera work that blends with the in scene music to great a one-two punch of dynamic flow, like chocolate and vanilla ice cream swirling out the frozen treat nozzle and landing in the waffle cone (our eyes and ears). The movie resembles a well made music video, only elevated to a level where the narrative is coherent and natural, all while maintaining a steady pace while constantly driving the story forward. No need to run to the restroom, every scene is filled with goodness. The meat has been trimmed of its fat, and the seasoned protein packed hog remains, presented to the audience for full, happy, consumption.

Nobody put Baby in a Corolla,"Baby Driver is an action heist film from too talented by half director Edgar Wright who made Shaun of the Dead and Scott Pilgrim among others. Our main character Baby is a talented get away driver who is a little off, a little young, and who listens to music on an old ipod all the time to cover for his tinnitus that he got in a tragic childhood incident.The plot itself is a simple affair that would not be out of place in a Grand Theft Auto movie adaptation. Baby needs to do ""one more job"" for creepy boss Kevin Spacey (who lets face ot is even creepier in the role now)while his heist mates are heavily tattooed, unstable violent sociopaths that are often not all that bright.Baby has fallen for a diner waitress who shares his love of music and road trips and a they plan to drive off into the sunset after his task is completed. I am sure this will go smoothly.The Good: Some movies are extremely well directed and you are never the wiser except perhaps in retrospect (Logan Lucky). Other movies are extremely well directed and are not afraid to shout this out during the film (Dunkirk). Baby Driver is definitely in the latter category. From the opening one shot where the scenery and character and extras are all perfectly timed to the music to the driving sequences done in real time without CGI the every minute detail direction is all over the place. The is a finely crafted film.Baby Driver is also an entertaining film. If a film adaptation of say Grand Theft Auto V sounds entertaining to you it is because it is. By making our protagonist a little off and hos cohorts so very violent it creates tension in scenes where lesser films would have none. It also has a decent sense of humor with a ""Halloween"" mask gag being particularly funny. Needless to say a decent soundtrack as well.The Bad: Emma Stone was originally supposed to play the diner waitress in the film (she did La La land instead) and the movie suffers for it. Lily James does her best but simply cannot overcome an underwritten role.In Conclusion: Kevin Spacey probably cost this film a best director Oscar nomination and a host of other end of the year accolades. His scenes can be be awkward or unintentionally funny in hindsight. I liked this movie more upon reflection than right after the original viewing (Yes the ending grated on me as well) and some of the hokier heartstring tugging scenes left me a bit cold.Some people will have a visceral dislike of this movie and I get that. It is a truly artificial construct with a lead character that seems to morph as the script dictates. I liked the little touches, the music, the fun cameos and the overall ride. It really is the Grand Theft Auto V film adaptation I didn't know I wanted by a director who never fails to entertain.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.,"Edgar Wright returns to the director's chair after the conclusion of his famous Cornetto Trilogy, with a film that pays not only to the 70's action films but bringing a style that packs a solid ride from start to finish with detail and a soundtrack to love. Baby Driver is one of this year's best and unexpectedly entertaining films to have surfaced.Baby Driver tells the story of 'Baby', Baby is a young and partially hearing impaired getaway driver who can make any wild move while in motion with the right track playing. It's a critical talent he needs to survive his indentured servitude to the crime boss, Doc, who values his role in his meticulously planned robberies. However, just when Baby thinks he is finally free and clear to have his own life with his new girl friend, Deborah; Doc coerces him back for another job. Baby finds himself and everything he cares for in terrible danger. It will take all of Baby's skill, wits and daring, but even on the best track, can he make it when life is forcing him to face the music.What makes the film so engaging throughout is it's incredibly paced concept, style and production value than puts most modern blockbuster films to shame (not to say all are bad) but with a unique vision, eye on concept and making it cool. The cast here handle their roles so well and look to have a blast with their perspective roles; The soundtrack throughout was on point, listening to classic rock, soul and various 60's and 70's tunes through car chase sequences, shootouts and even character engagement makes it so much fun. The action sequences were all taken to levels of high quality, with editing and sound mixing and choreography reaching out to the possibility of Oscar considerations in the next awards season.Baby Driver is a wild ride that will indeed win over audiences, with tight on the spot editing, in sync action set sequences, wickedly good characters and cast performances and a solid eye on detail from story to what's on screen. Take my word, this movie kicks serious arse and with style! 5/5 - NickIn 2004 we witnessed the birth of the the most talented and most clever director and writer in the world. We are talking about a man by the name of Edgar Wright. A man who gave us the funniest Zombie movie of all time...Shaun Of The Dead. And in 2007 he gave us the best action/comedy that had ever been done..Hot Fuzz. Sadly in 2013 Wright's film At Worlds End flopped a bit. Good news is his new film Baby Driver is not a disappointment. Wright is back with all of his comedic, action, clever talents.The acting is top notch, especially from Ansel Elgort (from Divergent and The Fault In Our Stars.) Lily James (UK actress who plays American waitress Debora) is beautiful, and is downright badass and awesome. The supporting actors like Jamie Foxx, Kevin Spacey and Jon Hamm are all great with their role. It's not until the second act that we get to see just how intimidating and scary Jon Hamm is. There is also a scene in the Cafeteria involving the criminals being in the same place as Debora that is very scary and tense. It's not a scene you will forget very quickly.Should also point out that the music and song choices and even remixes are brilliant. The editing is Oscar Worthy. The gun shots even go along with the beat brilliantly! Edgar Wright keeps on proving that more and more he is the most talented writer and director, and he never gives us a bad film. From 2004's Shaun Of The Dead all the way to 2017's Baby Driver...it's fair to say we have a new classic in our hands. How much better can Edgar Wright get at doing this? 5/5 - Jay",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Picks Up Steam,"Thought I had stumbled into another kids flick. I get turned off by loud, infantile music tracks but then the picture settled down and became a pretty fair heist movie with some grown-up tension and suspense. You know what also helped? The addition of Kevin Spacey as the brains of the gang. He rarely gives a bad performance and didn't mail this one in, either. Never heard of anyone else in the film except Jon Hamm.As stated, it gradually becomes absorbing and the plot which seemed outlandish 'grows up'. Lots of reviewers have rehashed the plot, but the actor playing ""Baby"" doesn't add much. The film is saved in the acting department by Spacey and Hamm, who play unbalanced criminals (especially Hamm). Giving away my age, I thought the car chase scenes which were quite extensive and protracted, were overdone and not believable.

He loves the fast and furious high octane lifestyle. Give him a car and he can move from zero to 120 like no one else can. Which makes him the perfect getaway driver and gives him a passport into the profitable world of crime.Injured in a car accident as a child that left him parent-less and with a permanent case of tinnitus (a constant ringing in his ears), Baby drowns out the real world with classic rock music as his live soundtrack. This also helps him concentrate better on his unique driving skills. Of course, he eventually meets Debora (Lily James), a cute waitress who steals Baby's heart while he steals other items.Now they say, crime doesn't pay, although Baby is making a killing...that is until Baby wants out of the crime game. Doc, crime czar and all-around bad guy, played with over-the-top menace by Kevin Spacey, won't hear it. Hence, the basic conflict.Edgar Wright wrote and directed this action heist thriller and he takes his simple (very simple) story, fills each frame with exciting stunt work, and creates memorable offbeat characters. Baby's bank robbing cohorts are a colorful motley crew. They include Jamie Foxx (Jamie Foxx), Griff (Jon Bernthal), Eddie No-Nose (Flea), JD (Lanny Joon), and Buddy (Jon Hamm), and his darling, Darling (Eiza Gonzalez). All of the cast know that the story is preposterous but they play their roles with high energy, rapturous glee, and a knowing satirical wink to the audience. (Especially fine are Mr. Hamm and Ms. Gonzalez as a crazed modern day Bonnie and Clyde.) Yes, the plot is silly and devoid of any real depth or logic, especially as it accelerates to its tidy little upbeat ending, but it is lots of fun.Baby Driver is all action too, more like a demolition derby with multiple chase scenes than a serious movie about crime and punishment. It's Reservoir Dogs with the sardonic humor and without the excessive bloodbath or wit. Call it Grand Theft with Auto, set to music. Skillful as it may be, the film still seems like an endless series of music videos looped together to form a movie. All the action moves with a strong syncopated beat, highly choreographed for our enjoyment. It's full throttle escapism. The first movie musical about cars.Baby Driver presents a major case of style over substance and style mostly wins out. Kudos to the excellent taut editing by Paul Machliss and Jonathan Amos and Bill Pope's electric hued photography that gives the film its unique look. Mr. Wright stages and choreographs his action sequences with an edgy disregard for realism. He also keeps his characters from being lost in all the maelstrom of revved engines and motor mayhem by developing individuals with distinct personalities and lasting traits. (Loved the his and hers neck tattoos.)All remains suspenseful and riveting, that is, until the film takes a sharp detour in its third act, veering hopelessly into typical chase and crash mode. Some of its characters start to act out of character, acting more like mere plot devices set in motion to tidy up all the loose ends. In fact, the movie never explains how characters know the whereabouts of others in order to seek revenge and one character's ""change of heart"" makes little sense and actually weakens the story-line. Too many leaps of logic.Still, fasten your safety belts and move over, Quentin! Edgar Wright's well made film is for adrenaline junkies everywhere; serious film-goers may enjoy it too, as long as they slip their minds into neutral. With a plot that defies logic and having enough potholes to do major damage to one's faculties, Baby Driver is a joyride.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"""Baby Driver""-  One of the year's coolest flicks!  Sharp, exciting and endlessly charming!","Edgar Wright is fast becoming one of the most dynamic and electrifying minds in the world of modern filmmaking. After a more humble beginning in the world of shorts, low-budget features and television work, he shot to super-stardom with the delightful 2004 horror-comedy ""Shaun of the Dead"", and his ascent has not slowed since. With his famous ""Cornetto"" trilogy and the outstanding ""Scott Pilgrim vs. The World"" under his belt, we were all wondering what would be next for this mastermind of cinema.And he certainly does not disappoint with the phenomenal ""Baby Driver""- a sort-of throwback film that pays tribute to the numerous tropes and clich√©s of the crime genre and the many famous heist movies of the past... all while being punctuated with Wright's trademark kinetic direction and dynamic comedy. The film is very much a labor of love from a fan (and fanatic) of film and media, and comes across as a wonderful and heartfelt tribute to the movies he loves. The result is one of the most wildly entertaining films of the Summer, and indisputably one of the flat- out coolest movies of the year. Filled to burst with non-stop thrilling action set-pieces, laugh-out-loud gags, endless charm and razor- sharp wit.We follow ""Baby"" (Ansel Elgort), a young man in his early 20's who works as a getaway driver for criminal mastermind ""Doc"" (Kevin Spacey) in order to repay an old debt. Despite his young age and even younger appearance, Baby is the best there is at what he does. However, he's become increasingly disillusioned by his life of crime and seeks to escape it once his debt is repaid, especially after meeting a gorgeous and kind-hearted young woman named Debora (Lily James) who seems to bring out the best in him. However, things take an interesting turn when his latest job places him in a car with an unhinged and violent criminal called ""Bats"" (Jamie Fox) and a troubled Bonnie-and-Clyde-esque couple. (Jon Hamm and Eiza Gonz√°lez) And the volatile and dangerous combination of conflicting personalities may very well threaten their ability to complete the task at hand...To start, the cast is just magnificent. Ansel Elgort makes for a fantastic protagonist and plays the role to perfection. He's cool, calm and collected when the story calls for it, but also vulnerable and extremely open and likable when necessary. An amazing role for such a young performer. I also had a lot of fun with Spacey in his role as ""Doc""- a slimy kingpin of crime that suits Spacey well... though also with a touch of humanity these characters sometimes lack. Despite being a bit ruthless, you get the feeling he actually does care about Baby and the others... not necessarily as ""friends"" but just on a human level, which was refreshing. You'll hate him at times... and yet you'll also genuinely love him at other moments. Lily James is absolutely adorable and a wonderful addition, and though she might lack some development, she's a key character and James does a great job. Hamm, Fox and Gonz√°lez are all just superb and seem to be having the time of their lives playing such treacherous, evil criminal characters. Particularly Hamm, who gets some really fun moments to sink his teeth into. And I also gotta give a shoutout to CJ Jones, who portrays Baby's deaf foster-father Joseph. It's a small role, but a memorable one and it lent a lot to the movie by giving Baby a great emotional core when we see him at home.But of course the real star here is writer/director Wright, who injects so much ""cool"" into the film, I wouldn't be surprised if the Blu-Ray release came with a mini leather jacket and pair of Oakley sunglasses to wrap around the disc! The most noticeable part of the film- and indeed one of its biggest treats- is the keen use of its soundtrack. In the film, the character of Baby suffers from the condition tinnitus, which he combats by constantly listening to music of all types, and this music is then incorporated into the film as the background music score many scenes. And it's extremely well done, with several key sequences choreographed and edited to match the beats. It may sound like a gimmick, but trust me... when you see a gun-battle set to the song ""Tequila"", your blood will be pumping. Wright's delightful visual flourishes are also on full display throughout the rest of the film, with many sequences being almost psychotically breath-taking. The car-chases here are among the best ever realized, and even the quieter moments (such as an amusing opening credits dance-sequence as Baby strides down the street) are meticulously well-planned.""Baby Driver"" seemingly came out of nowhere for me, and yet I'd now say it's without doubt my favorite film of the Summer. While I am going to dock a single point from my score due to the film needlessly dragging a bit too much at times in the second act, I can't help but completely recommend it to anyone and everyone. The cast is outstanding. The music addicting. The action awe- inspiring. And it's just the most fun I've had at the theaters in a long, long time. Edgar Wright delivers another winner in his near-flawless filmography, and I can't wait to see what he has up his sleeve for his next project. Maybe we'll finally get that long-rumored ""Hot Fuzz 2""? Either way, ""Baby Driver"" gets a near-perfect 9 out of 10 from me. See it... see it now!",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Hidden Gem,"I've called this movie a hidden gem as it came very much under the radar for me with very little hype.The movie tells the story of a getaway driver with extraordinary driving skills. Baby is played by Ansel Elgort who owes a debt to crime lord Doc played by Kevin Spacey. Unlike so many movies you feel empathy and understanding with most of the lead characters. The action takes centre stage, but the plot and script are not just an afterthought. The actors look like they are enjoying their roles and it is a really entertaining ride. Definitely worth checking out.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Oh yeah! this was cool!,"Ansel Elgort's attempt to break out of his young adult stereotype. I've seen him in a few of them like The Fault in Our Stars where he plays Shailene Woodley's love interest and The Divergent Series in which he plays Shailene Woodley's‚Äîbrother, but then, Elgort had a cameo in the young adult movie, Papertowns, and it was one of those things you would not get unless you watched a lot of Young Adult movies, and right there, I knew he was like the Jason Statham of these things or something.Now he's trying to be Statham for real. Statham himself was known prior, but he did not become a leading action hero until he did the Transporter, where he played a man who would drive you anywhere no matter what for the right price. In Baby Driver, Elgort plays a gateway diver more specifically. He works (without a choice) for a man named doc, played by Kevin Spacey, as the important part of his four man armed robbery crews. To make the character of baby (or to make Elgort himself) more interesting, the car accident that killed his parents when he was young also left a ringing in his ear that he needs to drown out using the ancient iPod 3 (I think), to play music that allows him to focus and be a masterful driver.Honestly, the whole fact that Baby has this strangeness in personality seems clich√© to these types of films, but director Edgar Wright allows it to‚Äîdrive the whole style of the movie, and I do mean style. One of the more stylish movies I seen in a while, I love how the music is steering the format of the film. They do this cool thing in which they match up the sound effects with the rhythm of the musical score. It's brilliant, not too music video like but just enough to see the influence.Plus, baby's strangeness becomes interesting bather for the all-star ensemble cast, which includes Jon Bernthal and Jamie Fox, who both play very dangerous men who do not trust Baby because of his quirky behavior, and the fact that he seems too much like a good egg to be in this game (Most likely it's also the face that would get him a lot of unwanted attention in prison). Jon Hamm is also in the film as a criminal whose contempt with Baby just getting the job done.Adding to the style and musical connection is Flea of the Red Hot Chili Peppers who has a small role in the film. I totally love it when he just pops up in on a film.Baby driver is a pretty complete action movie with some great car driving and some cool chases. Very sleek and kinetic thanks to its energetic all-star cast. Definitely an Edger Wright film worth taking a look at (And I thought that would only be the case if Simon Pegg and Nick Frost where in it)http://cinemagardens.com",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"The worst movie of the year so far, exaggerated hyped and boring","I watched this movie at the theater with my friends, and I was amazed how boring this movie was. The best part of the movie was the driving scene at the beginning but once it's over the movie is like gum without any flavor.The music - the songs were good but were an awful choice for this kind of movies, the 60's-70's had better songs better hits, with smart choice of songs this movie could have been a lot nicer to watch.Story - plot holes some parts made no sense what so ever.The cast - the cast was good and perform well.Overall this movie was awful, we expected more action but at the end we got bad love story.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
worth a watch if you like music and fast and furious sort of driving,"Baby driver is the sort of movie with its typical plot and driving scenes as any other conventional movie. Though they put in the health problem to make it seem interesting.It was a good watch and you would sit through the movie enjoying it. But you expect it to be more, which it fails to give.The movie ends on a strange note which sort of makes you feel as if something was left out. It is more of a sort of musical extravaganza with lots of nice music, so if you are watching at home a nice sound system will make you have fun with it.Other than that it seems more like Fast and furious with a touch of music and comedy.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
My Favorite Movie and a total suprise!,"I watced this movie during isolation just to kill some time, not expecting much. Good God was I wrong about thinking it will be just OK!The entire movie from begining to end had my atention and gave me this feeling i really have not felt from any type of movie before! The casting choices were amazing, driving sequences breathtaking and the soundtrack that the movie followed step by step changed my perspective of music in film ( LOVED IT )!I heard that some people did not liked the growing relationship between Baby and Debra, that it felt flat and was added to the movie with no purpose, but in my point of view I understood the problems these two were facing and loved how they connected trough music! They were in my opinion the heart and soul of this movie.Short, this is an extremly fun, fast-paced, beautifly crafted film and with my allready existing love for cars I felt this movie had everything to make it amazingly rewatchable!Highly recommend you see it!Curently my favorite movie of all time - 10/10 from me!",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Pretty good movie,"I would agree that it is a pretty good movie.But I also think it is probably over-hyped.I don't think this movie is anything ""masterful"" or so unique.I liked a few songs in the movie.But the problem is that I didn't care any of the characters in the movie.When I think of ""super cool"" and ""masterpiece"", I think of movies like ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""The Matrix"".I would not put ""Baby Driver"" in this category of being super cool & masterful.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
When plot becomes irrelevant: style (and music) over matter,"""Baby Driver"" (2017 release; 113 min.) brings the story of Baby, a getaway driver for bank heists. As the movie opens, the First Bank of Atlanta is robbed, and Baby (while listening to the Jon Spencer Blues explosion) is able to escape from the seemingly endless streams of Atlanta Police cars. They all meet up with Doc, the ring leader who distributes the loot. ""One more job and I'm done"" reminds Baby to Doc (we later learn why Baby ""owes"" Doc). The next day, while grabbing a coffee, is served by a young lady for whom he takes an immediate liking. At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest film from British writer-director Edgar Wright, who most recently gave us the brilliant ""The World's End"". Here he goes in a completely different direction, and instead delivers a highly stylish action movie, paired to a non-stop soundtrack of delightful songs from mostly back in the day. The reality is that the plot, as wafer-thin as it is, really is irrelevant and we move from scene to scene and simply enjoy what is plying out on the big screen. Ansel Elgort (from the 'divergent"" trilogy) plays Baby. Kevin Spacey is in good form as the ringleader Doc. Lily James, as the coffee waitress Debora) continues her upward march (I just saw her last weekend in another movie, ""The Exception""). Flea (from the RHCP) seems to have the time of his life playing Eddie ""No Nose"", one of the robbers. But keep an eye out for Sky Ferreira (yes, the indie music singer) in her role as Baby's mom when he was a little boy. The production, including the car chases and stunts, is top-notch all around. If you like an action movie AND love good music, you could do a lot worse than ""Baby Driver"".""Baby Driver"" opened wide this weekend, and I couldn't wait to see it. The early Saturday evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was absolutely PACKED. The buzz around ""Baby Driver"" has been building steadily in recent weeks.""Best movie of the year!"" some are saying. I wouldn't go that far. I enjoyed it for what it was, nothing less, nothing more. If you love action movie and good music, then ""Baby Driver"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Just a Fun Time,"Corn ballish at the start but picks up all along. The show is simply light hearted fun, fast, good acting, funny, spoofy, wild, cute, emotional not a computery gimmicky flick. I'd rather watch this way more than 'Guardians of the Galaxy's last rendition which i thought was horrid computer junk. You can see influences from other films and film makers going on. Even though the show is a long ways away from 'Natural Born Killers' there is something in this flick reminding me of 'Natural Born Killers'. I love the pacing, the innocence and the shifts taking place. And, you have to like Spacey, Fox and Hamm.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Don't waste your time - it's awful,"Enduring this movie was a pain - i mean literal physical pain.   Predictable plot would be an understatement if there were any.  Character motivations are non-existent. It's just a random mess of  pointless violence in the universe where every police officer has an IQ  of a carrot. The main protagonist is mix of typical ""my mommy died"" and  ""save the girl"" motivations.   Please - do everyone a favor. Don't watch this movie. Let Hollywood  starve themselves to death. Maybe then they will move on from cookie  cutter plots and characters.   It's awful. But it will probably sit fine with 14-22 year old  ""Twilight"" fans.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
Baby Driver: Great film. Easy to appreciate if you love comics.,"Edgar Wright has two souls. One is his Simon Pegg, British (he is actually Brit) comedic soul: Hot Fuzz, Shaun of the Dead, End of the World¬Ö enjoyable movies, nothing to say (except maybe that the latter was not so funny).Anyway what i really like is his International (US, Canada) Comic Book soul: Scott Pilgrim vs the World! A fantastic and original movie (based on a comic book) and this last one, Baby Driver, whose reality and characters (Baby, Doc, Bats¬Ö) are taken by all means from a comic book. Except that there is no book and everything was made by his imagination.The film is really good. A stellar cast. Few incredibly good scenes, maniacally cured down to the last word and to the tiniest detail. And music sync, fresh and meaningful as it was in 'Steamboat Willie' Disney, 1928.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Edgar Wright is back at it again with the white vans,"It's a quirky action film that doubles as a romantic-comedy. It's a film bolstered by an amazing soundtrack that goes in step with the action. It comes full circle in its repertoire, and all of the encompassing genres the film touches upon are done great justice.The romance between leads Ansel Elgort and Lily James is executed as well as it could've been. It helped to provide some tension during the film, as their budding relationship struggled due to the the life of crime Elgort's character was unwillingly thrown into.It's not perfect, as there was some predictability to come with the film.

Great but not perfect,"I went into this movie with very high expectations, and was a little let down. I was expecting a bit more out of this, now don't get me wrong I thought it was a very good film but I don't believe it deserves as much praise as it has being getting.The soundtrack was disappointing to say the least it had good songs but not great songs, it felt like it was limited by the budget. These songs didn't hype me up, however the action scenes were tailored for the songs and this worked really well it made the action scenes exciting even if the songs alone weren't very exciting.The story in this movie was pretty weak, it felt very generic and uninteresting. Usually this would be a massive flaw but it didn't affect the movie at all, the movie wasn't story based it was all about the dialogue and the choreography in the action sequences.Saying that the action in this movie was very good and I can't count the number of times in the movie that I was more than impressed by an intelligent camera movement or choice in the action scene.The dialogue was also very intelligent, it wasn't that it was hilarious but it had a very fun attitude to it. None of the comedy in this movie was completely hilarious but it was all intelligent even if it didn't make me laugh out loud often it was still very funny.If you're looking for a really good movie you won't be disappointed by this movie but if you're looking for something equal to hot fuzz or Sean of the dead you will most likely be disappointed.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
HUGELY UNDERRATED,"First m, Ansel Elgort is the vehicle of this whole movie and my mind is blown that this actor is not a superstar in Hollywood. Let's talk about how insanely incredible Ansol is in this movie and I swear I DONT THINK ANYONE could have executed or captured his character better. NO ONE. I can only imagine the feeling the director and screenplay writer had to feel seeing it come to life on the shoulders of Elgort.You know Ansol Elgort. Mostly think ""oh that Divergent kid who acted in another movie as her co-star"" but do not let that fool you. This actor can act his ass off but not just that, this movie required, demanded this type of role played flawlessly or else it could not have been so effective. This movie wins you over in the fist ten minutes. Its rare we get these movies that you just know almost instantly that you're about to escape reality for 2 hours. However, on the same token, I did not know this ten minutes into Once Upon a Time in Hollywood but felt it the last ten minutes.With all that said, this is a movie to watch at night relaxing. Preferably stoned (stoned adds 1 star easily). This movie is a very compelling story but how insanely in sync it is with the whole soundtrack----in sync with Ansols character BABY, is what drives this home. It is balls to walls amazing. Oh yeah forgot to say no pun a sentence earlier.Kevin Spacey is great at being Kevin Spacey. Jamie Fox is miscast. This is Babys movie. His story. The best way to tell a story is to always try your best to instill constant conflicts that these characters face to boost the story and plot forward. Any movie or show that does these things I know its just gonna be a very well made story. It's how we get to love the characters more and see them humanized.This review is way overlong in what I should have just said this is the kind of movie after completing you just feel happy. You know. That feeling after investing 2 hours of life and being suprised by a good story especially with movies now a days. This is it. You will love it. If this movie was released in 2020, I think it would have been an even bigger hit.

"****** SPOILER ALERT ***** Awesome Character, Awesome Action! Pure fun!","************** SPOILER ALERT ***** Awesome Character, Awesome Action! Pure fun!Baby Driver is a romp. The opening car chase scene is worth the price of admission in and of itself. It's one of the coolest chase scenes ever!!The best thing about this movie, other than the chases, is the Baby character. I'm a sucker for an understated hero and this really hits the mark. Baby is an introvert who loses himself in music. But he is also a savant of perception and has a quiet power that really makes him appealing. I could quibble about some points where the character writing was poor, but I'll forgive those points because the broad character is so strong.I had real problems with the casting of Kevin Spacey as the crime boss. The casting is so stereotypical and clich√©. Spacey behaves exactly as you would expect such a clich√© character to do. It would have been a much more interesting choice to have the crime boss be cast as¬Ö A 22 year old rapper, a 15 year old gaming nerd, a foreigner from a developing country, or a heavy suburban female with kids type¬Ö anything but the tired trope of Kevin Spacey the crime boss.This movie would have had a much higher rating for me with a couple EASY changes.SPOILER ALERT**********************1) The Baby's love interest is too much, too fast without them really having enough relationship development screen time together prior to them devoting their lives to each other.2) The movie has a double ending that is confusing and annoying. The movie ends when the couple drives down a country road. The credits should have rolled at that point. I would have given this film a way higher rating. The second ending is annoying.Still, I forgive all the faults, thanks to the awesome Baby character and is bad-assery!!",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Action Packed, Hilarious, Original,","Baby Driver is an outstanding movie with an unbelievably well developed plot and pitch perfect cast. It is an action fueled ride from start to finish, it has a formula that could have been adapted in a very clich√© way, but thanks to writer and director Edgar Wright, it is probably the most groundbreaking, original movie you will see all year. It boasts a stellar soundtrack that fits each scene perfectly, particularly the car chases, and we can see that the cast and crew spent an insane amount of time making sure the music suited the action itself perfectly.The balance of drama and comedy is terrific, you will find moments where you are in stitches with Wright's witty sense of humour, and other parts were you are entirely invested in to the characters and their situation. I went to see this movie a second time before reviewing it, and I genuinely only liked it more on another viewing, there is so much I got to see that I missed last time, the amount of Easter eggs and small details are unbelievable.The cast is absolutely perfect, I have no gripes with the casting of each character. Ansel Elgort shines in the lead role, being a very mute lead character with a minimal amount of lines, a lot of his performance relies on his eyes and facial expressions, and he does so in a way that makes it seem like it is in no way challenging. Lily James is charming and layered as Debora, Kevin Spacey brings so much subtlety, nuisance acting as Doc, whose dialogue with Baby is one of the movie's highlights. Jamie Foxx is likable in the worse possible ways as Bats, Elza Gonz√°lez is sweet and cool as Darling and CJ Jones steals every scene he is in as Joseph, a character we can do nothing but care for. The breakout performance, for me, was Jon Hamm as Buddy, he has so much built in rage and it is clear that there is so much more to this character beyond what we see in the movie. Hamm's characterisation is perfect, and he strides through this characters complicated arch, delivering my favourite performance of any Wright film to date.A thrill ride from start to finish, with flawless character development and a toe tapping soundtrack, I am sure future movies will try to mimic it, but there is really nothing else like it. Funny, well acted and beautifully directed, I am genuinely excited about seeing this movie again, it has reinvigorated my passion for film that can sometimes be taken away from me with all the mediocrity that comes out these days, but Baby Driver reminds me why I love movies so much, when they take you on a journey and when its over, you just sit there in awe of what you have just experienced, and would not change any of it for the world, highly recommend to all moviegoers, not one to be missed.A young driver who lives his life through his headphones finds himself involved with a ruthless gang of criminals due to his skill on the wheel.Best Performance: Jon Hamm",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Didn't quite kill it, but fun ride nonetheless","Baby Driver is an aptly named movie. Its cartoony, strange name sounds as incongruous as the life that the reticent but kind protagonist Baby is leading, or rather, has been forced to lead.A deft blend of humour, action, violence and fabulous music, Baby Driver doesn't burden itself with complicated motives or deep-seated psychological impulses. It merely gives you a wink and nod, invites you to hop on for a fun ride ‚Äì then sucks you into Baby's closed-in, yet music-filled world from the get go.The characters of Buddy, Monica and Bats are quite obviously caricatures ‚Äì little or no explanations are given as to why they opted for a life of crime, or how they met the big boss Doc, who commissions them for various jobs with different teams (with the exception of Baby), depending on the nature of the job and his whims.Quite frankly, as the movie unfolds to the joyful sounds emanating from Baby's iPod, neither would you care even if you had known their back stories. Everything is quite plainly, as it seems. Or is it? A skilled getaway driver who is an absolute maniac at the wheel, Baby, who suffers from tinnitus, is finally given the option of leading another life when he finishes a last deal for Doc, which will pay off his debt to the former.Even better ‚Äì he finds a good reason to pluck the earphones from his ears and engage in some real conversation with a real person aside from a few mumbled phrases to Doc and his motley crew ‚Äì he meets Debora, a music-loving, sparkly and spirited lass who someday dreams of hitting the road ""in a car she can't afford with a plan she doesn't have"".But madness and mayhem ensue with the appearance of the crazed Bats, well played by Jamie Foxx, down to the almost twitching suspicion lurking behind his every move. Suddenly, the game has turned dangerous, even menacing. Doc demands that Baby get back into the game, or risk the safety of Debora.What must Baby do ‚Äì resign himself to a life of crime and violence ‚Äì or risk everything he has to free himself? Credit must be given to Ansel Elgort, who plays Baby with a charming mix of pouty, silent rebellion, cockiness, confusion and pained suffering pooling in his eyes ‚Äì caught in a game he never wanted to be in. As frightening as he is hilarious, Kevin Spacey plays Doc with gleeful abandon. His clearly enunciated threats offer a stark contrast to Baby's silent yet painful submission and affirmatives uttered through gritted teeth. Likewise, the pedestrian life that bright-as-a-button Lily James' Debora leads highlights the money-driven, hedonistic backdrop of Baby's world.When this world and Debora's reality meet head-on, Baby is forced to make his choice.Don't expect intricate plot lines ‚Äì the storyline is straightforward and almost predictable. The moral message at the end is clear ‚Äì all deeds must be accounted for, yet with a hint of hope at the end, it leaves you to come to your own conclusion.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Joyride on cloud nine,"Surprises this pleasing just don't come along often.""Baby Driver"" is a heist movie, and as such, it feels indebted to other luminaries (The Driver, Bullitt, Drive, Heat, etc). The only difference here is that the wheelman is someone more akin to Starlord than the usual loner. And just like those movies, jobs go wrong and loyalties swap quickly. But Baby (Ansel Elgort) doesn't belong in this underworld. He's not Gosling or McQueen, and that's where the movie reinvigorates the subgenre. Once the love interest (Lily James) gets dragged in, this reaches a whole different level.But here's where the movie's real magic comes in. It's not just for lovers of fast cars and stunt driving (i.e. me); it's more about the universal appeal of music and how it soundtracks everything we do. It's why there's such bubbly pleasure to be had from both the chase scenes and something mundane, like going out for coffee. This is one big fanciful mixtape, and I don't think I've ever seen a movie make such novel use of it before. The songs really get into your pores. It's just an added bonus that there are brilliantly choreographed car chases to go with it.I can almost guarantee that one cannot walk out of this movie without wearing a huge smile. It's almost a high.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
That was FUN,"WOW I loved it. It's been so long since I've seen a FUN movie. Sure it's over the top, but the action and the soundtrack blend together so well, it made me feel like I was sitting in the car with Baby. If you liked Guardians of the Galaxy, you will LOVE this!",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
one must congratulate Mr. Wright for finally getting his mojo back,"Officially becoming cinematic scenester Edgar Wright's highest grossing film to date and breaks into the 9-digit club in its North American territory, BABY DRIVER, his sixth feature, ebulliently welds his music-savvy retro-flair into an uber-stylized heist drama, and its riveting opening gambit of an adrenaline-rushing car-chasing sequence trenchantly assuages our dread concerning the wind-up of our baby-faced protagonist, as long as he is behind the wheel, he is invincible, and the situation only becomes parlous when he isn't.Baby (Elgort) is a music-loving getaway driver in Atlanta, Georgia, tinnitus-inflicted by a childhood car accident (which rendered him parent-less), he is reticent and steeped in the music to fend off his ailment, especially in the heat of his dangerous metier, music is essential in adjusting his judgment and performing those incredible car stunts. He never fails and becomes the mascot of the criminal mastermind Doc (a stern but wise-cracking Spacey), who promises that Baby can go straight when their debt is squared up, and for one blithe moment, that actually happens, where Baby finds a less risky pizza-delivery job and strikes up a heartfelt romance with waitress Debora (Lily James, personable as ever), until Doc railroads him into taking another job, teaming up with three other criminals, the seemingly congenial but relentlessly lethal Buddy (Hamm, devilishly handsome and irrationally elicits one's trepidation of his denouement), his bombshell wife Darling (Gonz√°lez) and a trigger-happy motor mouth Bats (a marginally irksome Jamie Foxx), and their plan to rob a post office goes askew even before it starts. The rest of the story slumps into clich√©: conscience mounting, body-count soaring, danger menacing, and also a lesson to those evil bosses who relent in the last minute, don't!Baby must save himself from the resultant m√™l√©e and also secure the safety of Debora and his deaf foster father (CJ Jones), with a single-minded villain on his tail who, albeit his unswerving resolution of vengeance, more often than not, opts for talking over pulling the trigger when he gains the upper hand in the cat-and-mouse game, to further aggravate the time-honored chagrin of most filmic villains.Apart from Wright's bountiful aural potpourri (the film's soundtrack is the bee's knees), crafty action pieces, sleek camera antics and outlandish humor (the mix-tape placement is a gas with the great pull of Baby's emotional state). What makes viewers tick is Ansel Elgort's amiable leading performance, Baby is a wizard in the driving seat, but exceptionally denuded of conceit (a staple streak in Wright's characters, although Spacey, Foxx and Hamm are all competing for that grail), conversely, Elgort is radiant of his youthful nonchalance, visceral tenderness and a personal panache transcending the common teen heartthrob crush, which fits him as a Hollywood's rising star and a future mainstay. So, the jury is in, might not be as lenient as those in the film, but BABY DRIVER is a bonafide asset to dissipate the summer blockbuster lethargy and one must congratulate Mr. Wright for finally getting his mojo back!",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
My new favourite movie of all time,"Baby Driver is an amazing movie. Everything about it is fantastic, the soundtrack, the acting, the costume design, and the cinematography. The cinematography in this movie is just such a masterpiece. You simply cant go wrong with Edgar Wright",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Surprisingly good,"We were the oldest people in the audience by far, and didn't have particularly high hopes for what looks like a version of a Fast and Furious movie from the preview. But the cast includes Kevin Spacey and we figured that he doesn't normally sign up for rubbishy films.We ended up thoroughly enjoying Baby Driver. From the opening scene with Baby walking to get coffees, listening to music and with key words from the lyrics 'hidden' in plain sight on signs and graffiti along the way, the design of the movie is just a little bit stylized. The music throughout the movie is thankfully a mix of all sorts of genres, since the soundtrack is an important part of the film. There was something for everyone.The plot starts fairly predictably, but halfway through it takes a sudden dark turn. The second half is really very well done.One word of warning: if you're a guy, get someone else to drive you home afterwards. The impulse to drive like Baby might be too much for you.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
My thoughts,"Pretty good mate, a concert of music. Totally Edgar Wright flow. Sometimes the music is annoyingly on the background, but nothing to worry about. Simple story, Great concept, Snappy flow, good begin and end. Go watch it, at best watch it in theaters. You will laugh, and love it. These days it seems difficult to make good movie. Edgar Wright does it right. On of the good movies of 2017.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

F*king brilliant,Masterpiece of a movie. Saw the amazing reviews and I can't disagree with any of them. Plot was incredibly creative. One of my favorite thrillers of the year. It's something original that was played really well with top-class acting.The intermingled romance was kind of cute and all in all it was just a great movie. Money well spent.,10.0,Anonymous,Crime
got a recommendation for this...,"So I was completely surprised by the main character who's about as interesting as a wet rag or a 2x4.Baby (the name of the main character) happens to be amazing at driving cars - for no explained reason. He also loves music, which is the best part of this movie. In fact - I would argue the slick presentation and music is what sold many audience members. Producers put a ton of talent behind and around the camera. What do we have here? Another big budget film with directionless writing and shallow characters who follow obvious motivations. Well, obvious until the end of the movie - that just gets erratically stupid.Casting isn't bad nor is the dialog (neither is great), but this film falls flat on its face about 45 minutes in, when the audience is supposed to become interested in Baby's every day life. It is a tough sell - he's not interesting. One could call Baby Driver clich√©, which it is: boy, girl, bad people and leverage against the hero - But the jobs (a huge part of the movie) have this nebulous, crime for the sake of crime pointlessness. Large chunks of this movie have zero reason or character motivations to occur - it's like everyone in this movie does stuff only because the script writers said so... that isn't a good thing! and makes this film feel truly artificial - when I'm guessing that was not the intention.Ultimately though - it's the characters that sink this film. They are boring and undeveloped. This leaves no one to root for. Maybe just follow the action?Sadly, Baby Driver isn't purely kinetic/action oriented enough to succeed on this merit alone (like a John Wick). In this case an uber stylized film fails for lack of commitment to a clear vision. Or... Baby Driver lacks successful execution of a music/action/crime/coming of age/love story/car driver movie.If you want a way better movie along these lines watch Drive (2011). If you want a fully fleshed out, mentally flawed hero watch The Accountant. If you want a pure action movie involving fighting, gunplay and driving watch The Raid II ;). Funny though, both the Raid movies do a better job with their characters, story and action - just not the music or slick Hollywood presentation.OK action movie that suffers from another average (at best) script 6/10",,Anonymous,Crime
Wright at the top of his game,"Edgar Wright has a bleedingly simple goal for his new movie, as Kevin Spacey's head honcho Doc so eloquently puts it: ""people love great bank robbery stories, so let's give them something bold and brazen as f@!& to talk about over their lattes."" Wright has certainly achieved that, and more, with Baby Driver. His ambition to deliver originality is matched by his genius in concocting a hyper-real world where every action beat, every character tic and every sound bite is calibrated with flair and intrigue. It's easy to pick the films that influenced Wright‚ÄîHeat, Reservoir Dogs, Bullitt to name only a few‚Äîbut they aren't simply repurposed for a modern audience, they're used as a base for Wright to subvert expectation and build his own iconic sequences. Most impressive is the means in which music is integrated into the proceedings. The action is not only choreographed and edited in synch with the tunes, but also often dictated by the song chosen by our titular protagonist (the charismatic Ansel Elgort). There's a refreshing focus on practical effects that enhances the excitement too; witnessing high-octane, frenetic car chases knowing they were executed for real is exhilarating, highlighting the fact that CGI is not a necessity in crafting superb action flicks. Having written the script as well, Wright deserves even more praise for creating a collection of quirky, dangerous and exciting characters, then nailing his cast selection with a crop of ridiculously talented actors who make them memorable. Elgort makes quiet cool as Baby, Jamie Foxx brings an electric volatility to criminal Bats, Lily James is charming as girl-next-door Debora, Jon Hamm and Elsa Gonzalez are slick and sexy as Buddy and Darling, and Spacey amps up the sneering menace to record heights. Boasting adrenaline-pumping set pieces, a plethora of unforgettable characters, endlessly quotable dialogue and a soundtrack for the ages, Baby Driver is a fresh, fun and unique cinematic offering by a filmmaker clearly at the top of his game.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"oh its an Edgar wright, so straight away we have to call it a great movie","Sorry, some spoilers in this.Look, I liked this movie, really I did. It probably wins best sound track of the year over Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2. I enjoyed watching it, seeing the little Edgar Wright shots we have all come to expect from him (kind of like Sam Raimi) and I had a fun time watching it.... Then I started to think about it about 20 minutes afterwards and found a lot of plot holes, especially in the second half. A lot of flash, not as much substance.A lot of where the movie goes in the second half is kind of lazy writing to set up for scenes later in the movie and really, just a lot of non common sense going on. Best example is with the diner scene. Bats wants to go there and Baby is afraid of him hurting Deborah. All he needed to say was ""I got there a fair bit, they know me there. They could ID us if something goes wrong"" and simply drive on down to the next diner down the road. Just little things like that. Not to mention, also the reason they had to do that job that next day and the whole picking up the guns really didn't make a great load of sense to me.As I said, I did really like this movie, a lot of fun, well acted and well put together. But its not the be all and end all of movies or anything cutting edge or ground braking. Anyone who says it is, well, they need to take their fan boy/girl Edgar Wright glasses off. He is a good director, with a growing decent track record, but to lather his movies with praise as soon as they come out just because he directed them seems a bit much",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Not what I Expected - but in a good way!,"Not what I expected -- but in a good way. The newcomer who plays Baby holds his own with all the veteran actors and the music is subtle but so prevalent, it's like it's a character all its own. The stunt driving was really great. It put some much needed new life and blood into car racing. All in all the movie had a really nice sweet but sinister vibe to it. The balance was just right!",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
A good entertainer,"The movie is entertaining with comedies, emotions, actions and behaviors of weird team. Not a bad pick, was attracted by the trailer which was actually a initial movie clip. A normal story framed in a better way to watch it on the big screen. Some gun shots are meaningless and i really doubt it if some of the choices in the character of the movie will behave as defined in its story! Watch it with no expectation. The Kid as 'Baby' acted really well be it a dance move or a riding scene or be it a romantic scene, excellent performance from him throughout the movie. Cheers!",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Slightly overrated but overall entertaining action blockbuster,"Baby Driver is an above average action movie but definitely not the perfect blend so many critics seem to see in it.On the positive side, the action sequences of the movie are vivid, spectacular and diversified. They also look rather realistic and don't overuse CGI technology. The last third of the movie has a great balance between an overall gloomy atmosphere and few more hopeful scenes between the characters. CJ Jones and Lily James played really likable and profound characters one could easily identify with. Jamie Foxx and Jon Hamm played two quirky gangsters with their very own styles. It was also great to see Flea from the Red Hot Chili Peppers as a side character in this film.On the other side, the backstory isn't very original. The stereotype of a tough guy with a soft core because of a rough childhood is simply overused in Hollywood. The underlying message that he is still a nice guy and didn't have any choice to become a criminal is also very dangerous. Some of the characters' decisions are plain unrealistic, especially the typical Hollywood ending is filled with laughable stereotypes. Another issue is that every second Hollywood movie uses rock music of the seventies these days. While I like this type of music, it's simply wrong to praise this movie for its original style that isn't that original after all. I also thought that the middle section of the film dragged on for too long. The main character was introduced as a cool character that doesn't speak or think much but the middle section suddenly tried to give the character a more intellectual and profound touch which was completely misplaced.In the end, Baby Driver is without a doubt an overall entertaining, fast-paced and stylish action movie that you should enjoy at your local movie theatres. But it simply isn't anything more than that. It's the kind of movie you will enjoy while you're watching it but you probably won't remember much of it after a few months or years.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Borrows from other movies while still doing its own thing,"I'm a pretty big Edgar Wright movie fan but didn't like The World's End that much. So I went into this movie hoping it would at least be better despite the mediocre trailers. I think it delivers a fantastic action movie.I had not seen Ansel Elgort in anything before but he was excellent as the quiet driver, Baby. Everyone else is pretty good and Kevin Spacey seems almost quaint in this role after seeing him chew so much scenery in House of Cards. Jon Hamm plays someone a little sleazier than usual and Jamie Foxx seems to want to be the villain from start. The weakest performance for me was Lily James, who I have also never seen before. She seemed to be playing up this innocent small town girl persona but it didn't really work for me.Whenever there's action in this movie though, it springs to life. Every car chase, shootout, footrace pulls you right into movie. One of the more inventive car chases I've seen in a movie as well.The music is what really drives this movie though. No song is accidental, it all wonderfully syncs up with what's happening. It really gives the film a wonderful flavour and makes it so unique.My only criticism is that when the movie slows down and has dialogue scenes they feel really dull the way the shots are composed. Perhaps this was deliberate to contrast with the action but they felt a bit mediocre in comparison. But still well worth seeing and I will definitely be re-watching it at some point.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Listed as: Action, Crime, Music. Would have been better as just: Action, Crime","This movie was enjoyable to a certain degree. My problem was the 'Music' classification in addition to the 'Action, Crime' listing.From the start, I got annoyed with Baby and his music and dancing. I wanted to watch a thriller with action and crime, not a musical with Baby being some superhero kid. Ridiculous.Had the script stuck to what the last 3/4 of the film offered, I would have enjoyed it better - minus the overblown 'superhero drama' Baby had to play out.This film came across more as a music video than a movie. I'm curious if most of the budget to make this film was paid out to music royalties instead of tightening up the screenplay.Enjoyable, but I wouldn't brag about it or watch it again.A generous 8/10 from me.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Very much a genre film, even if the soundtrack jazzes it up a lot","A lot of hype around this film, and a lot of big names involved on either side of the camera - Pope and Wright on one side, and many famous faces on the screen itself. I left it a while and approached it without expectation, and I was quite surprised by what I found, considering the praise lavished onto it. Despite being on almost all 'cool' 'best of' lists for 2017, Baby Driver is not much of a movie, although it is a decent genre movie and a great Original Soundtrack.The plot does nothing to surprise or thrill, there are no twists that will knock you sideways, or developments that will feel new or fresh. Indeed it sticks very much to the basics without much added. Where the film works hard is with the production and style. In this way it does look good. It benefits a lot from having plenty of famous names and faces, as well as a comparatively big budget to work with. This budget ensures plenty of style and slickness. This is well combined with the music - which is not only great but frequently very well used; it flows like a musical at times, and I did like this aspect - although by itself it is not really enough to suggest it makes it a great film.Perhaps I was not in the right mood to watch it, but I certainly didn't see the great film that many claim to have - and while I'm sure it will feature on many year-end lists, it was just a solid genre film with plenty of resources.",,Anonymous,Crime
"Superb action, too simple a story","Getting used to Edgar Wright after the Cornetto trilogy, is falling on it's knees for creative control in all the right ways but perhaps still lacking, it's still the snappy and witty camera control and transitions that engages the story fully, perhaps even better then all the work laid out before. But then again i find the whole movie falling flat when it all comes to character development, when you really think it over after watching it, you realize it was only boy loves girl, weird backstory obstacle, escape. I would've liked a bit more of an explanation on the whole Doc, Baby friendship, could've perhaps given more backstory to the central story.Still a great movie all things considered, a 7/10 fits it nicely.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Meticulously technical movie, but just a typical heist plot","I am not one to notice details, but I do care about them when I do. This movie is very carefully crafted, a choreography of sound, action and movie edit. All the acting is beautiful and, if you are into movies, you should definitely watch this.However, if you care about the story, it is as plain as it could be. It is the story of a getaway driver, stuck against his will in a mobster's contract. Everything that happens is pretty much obvious. If you are not one for details, but care about the story, it will probably not excite you at all, even if there is nothing wrong with it per se.Bottom line: watch some actors have fun in a movie where the writer/director had some fun. That's always good. Try to have fun as well, because at times it just feels like a movie for movie makers.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
The funnest getaway movie ever,"Baby Driver was one of the most joyful experiences I have had at a movie theater for quite some time. The main lead in Ansel Elgort brings a lot of energy to the role making him really fun and entertaining. The character is also just very well written. He is a very good and kind hearted person in the movie, but he is not so good that he lacks no edge. I mean the kid is in the getaway driver business so he has seen a lot of bad stuff happen.Lily James plays a amazing role as the love interested for Ansel . I will say that her character through could have been given a little bit more to do than what she got, but I did believe that her performance told a lot about why she was willing to do some of the things she did and why she never ran way.But the star of this film isn't Baby rather it is the music and Edgar Wright's amazing direction as the film's use of music adds a lot to the enjoyment of each scene along with the erratic action scenes that can go from calm and innocent to intense and scary. A very good balance that is pulled off by Edgar.And it only bolstered by how much you care about the characters in the film too.

Rating: A,"In my opinion, a movie's score is one of the five most important details of its success. It doesn't matter if it's a musical, a drama or a horror film, its soundtrack must be epic and memorable so that it triumphs in the big scenes.Baby Driver has THAT score! Without it, this movie wouldn't be as awesome as it is and it wouldn't definitely be part of my favorite films of 2017! The soundtrack is part of the story, it adds more depth to the dialogue scenes, it helps developing characters and it elevates the action sequences making them feel much more fun and entertaining. It's a perfect score to an amazing movie.As expected in an action film with pretty much only car chases, the direction skills used are always my biggest concern: am I going to be able to actually follow the action sequences? Or is it going to be full of cuts and cars with no route whatsoever which will make it all extremely confusing and disorienting? Well,¬†Edgar Wright nails the chasing scenes and adds some more cool shootouts and bank heists!They are riveting, captivating, extremely fun and edited flawlessly. There's very little CGI in the chasing sequences and some long takes help to fluidly follow the cars without it becoming a mess in my head. I always know where they are, where they're going and what they're doing. The phenomenal editing is consistent throughout the movie and the cinematography is just beautiful. Excellent camera work with incredibly long one-takes (one of the opening scenes is a complete masterpiece) prove that¬†Edgar Wright is one of the best directors working today!The cast also plays a huge role.¬†Ansel Elgort, who I didn't know that well, has a great performance even if it is very subtle. It's not a ""full-on"" performance with tons of scenes where he shines, but he definitely brings the attention all to himself due to his well- portrayed¬†character's personality.¬†Kevin Spacey is a legend! He just does what he always does: be himself. He doesn't even act, he just goes through the dialogue so fascinatingly fast, but in a way that keeps us very captivated and mindful. His character has some slight depth that he elevates brilliantly alongside his usual burst of charisma.As for the rest of the cast, everyone is really great, but I have to take my hat off to¬†Lily James (Deborah), who is able to be romantic as well as dramatic without ever feeling over-the-top or even clich√©. Her chemistry with Ansel is amazing and the dialogue scenes become very captivating at the sound of some perfect music.¬†The romance is one of the things that some people might find boring, ""more of the same"" or just unnecessary (this last one is nonsense), but the actors/characters are so interesting and compelling that they are able to raise the quality of a potential flaw, one that I find pretty great.Jon Hamm (Buddy) is a surprise and pulls off a great performance as well as¬†Jamie Foxx (Bats) who portrays a badass in a cool way. The cast's chemistry is palpable and everyone seems to be having fun with the shooting instead of being there just to collect their paycheck.Baby is the main character so his backstory and present situation is very well developed, but I'm happy that the writers didn't forget the supporting characters. Everyone receives something that makes me care for them, at least enough for me to be at the edge of my seat during the action scenes. The writing is extremely well-balanced, it never transforms the film into just a comedy (due to the fantastic humor) or just a drama (due to the dialogue/character development scenes). It's just right on point.My only issue with this movie are some moments during the second act. Despite the film's fast pacing, the main story isn't anything new or unique, it pretty much follows the path that I am expecting from the beginning. Because of that, the second act drags a little bit during some scenes that aren't that interesting and that don't have that much depth or significance to them.All in all,¬†Baby Driver is one of my favorite movies of this year! Exciting action/chasing sequences, a brilliant direction from¬†Edgar Wright (from the beautiful cinematography to the extremely well- handled camera work and flawless editing), some captivating and compelling characters, a cast with terrific chemistry and with¬†Ansel Elgort surprisingly stepping up to the plate. The writing's on point and the soundtrack is the film's main attribute: without it, everything else loses both depth and awesomeness. It's just memorable. Some pacing issues during the second act don't let me give it the maximum rating, but it's still a simply fantastic, fun and super entertaining movie!",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

The main theme of this movie: Attention to detail.,"This review will have no spoilers because all that needs to be said about this movie is in the first two sequences.
In the opening scene we see the two most important themes of this film, Cars and music. Then we get all the backstory we need. Baby is a lighthearted kid that appreciates music and is happier without the crew. He doesn't exactly fit in because he doesn't like the violence. We also learn that he knows what he is doing. One person from the crew points forwards, but Baby drives in reverse because we saw a cop going the other way in the background. Then we get a sequence of well-shot, practical effects car chase scenes. All of this timed perfectly to the music too, every door shut, every break slam, every turn. All of this backstory is given to us without a single word of exposition. All we get is action and detail.
Then after being stunned by the perfection of that sequence we are put directly into another scene that is just as good, if not better.
Baby is walking through the city listening to music. Every piece of graffiti or character movement matches up to the lyrics of the music. When he finally arrives to get coffee, we get the first words of exposition and it is only to inform us that his name is Baby. Then we see that as he turns back to return to the crew, things are no longer happy. He has to avoid a cop, a bike, and a car. This is all in one long tracking shot, where even the sound effects were timed perfectly with the music. 
In these two scenes we see what this movie is really about: attention to detail. Throughout the film every sound effect is timed with the music, every scene is a practical effect, and every detail tells us more about the characters. We even see in the end that these details return and help Baby, though I won't reveal too much. The movie isn't timed to the music just because it is cool. I think the movie does this because it really draws everyone in and tunes them into the movie's subtle details. Everyone watching this movie gets captivated and really falls for the tricks this movie pulls, every joke, every twist, every beat.
The movie doesn't feel like a music video, but more like a subtle musical. The ones where you go and sit in the audience and are drawn in by the music. You watch the entire play as if it were a film and don't realise until the end that music was a major part of the play. In this film the music is a large part of the film that draws you in, but during the movie it really feels like more of a side point or a returning joke. The real main attraction is the perfection of every scene, the amount of attention put into detail. The movie feels smooth and ironed-out. The movie feels as if it were rewritten and refilmed hundreds of times until finally, the movie was perfect to them. It may not be perfect to you, but to Edgar Wright and the other creators of this film it is a masterpiece, and I agree.
Edgar Wright is a master of detail and he has shown this in all of his movies. This movie is no exception. Many people didn't like it because of the story, which wasn't perfect, but I still believe that if you really disliked the movie it is because you weren't paying enough attention.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Was it good?*scratch*,"Baby Driver is a comedy/crime which is really hard to compare to any other film from these genres (except for other Edgar Wright's work). It takes the attention from viewer at the beginning to end while giving the big amount of perfectly fitting music. Action is really compelling, plot is smart, easy to follow and it encourages to care about our protagonist, Baby. It's not hard to predict what will happen in the first 30 minutes of watching but in second part of the film things are getting twisted, the whole crime/thriller mode is being activated with less amount of space for typical humour. The romance isn't the best and someone could say that it's the most flat and simplified part but for me relation between Baby and his ""just-met love from the first sight"" Debora came out quite natural and suitable to the rest of the movie.Casting was perfect. Jamie Foxx as gangsta/psycho is extremely believable, Kevin Spacey is very minimalist but his performance is so charismatic and gentle that he need only one statement to give unforgettable expression/scene. The rest of the cast act also with no big flaws. Too bad Jon Bernthal was there only for a short time.Talking about weak parts of Baby Driver is like talking about consequences of eating pizza - it's not worth its time. In the end we have some much fun with product which doesn't consider viewers as idiots (yes Baywatch, i'm looking at you). Although many things happen like in some fantasy (some elements of car chase, coincidences, romance part), it looks very realistic. We see character's motivations and how every situation escalates. Editing is on the highest level.Also I can't believe how interesting was presented conversation in sign language between Baby and his step-father.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Bad Baby, easy driving.","Baby Driver has a fantastic sense of momentum. From walking down a block to evading the police in a high stakes chase, everything Baby does is well choreographed and high impact. The opening heists serve both as the best action sequences in the film, and as a clever framing technique to introduce a colorful and twisted cast of criminals. Unfortunately most every character in this film ends up revolving too close to the titular Baby, making them seem like mirrors for the protagonist's ego, rather than fulfilling their potential as great characters in their own right. This is my only real problem with the film. Lily James and CJ Jones seem crammed into the script only to smile and repeatedly tell Baby how great he is, while Kevin Spacey also has an overabundance of ass kissing lines, although he delivers most of them with a scowl. What makes this all so infuriating is that while Baby is a fun character, and his Tinnitus is wonderfully incorporated into the editing, he doesn't seem worthy of the fascination the script has with him. It is a fun joyride nonetheless, but I can't help but feeling that if Baby Driver had utilized its excellent cast of criminals better, it could have been more than that.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
I too don't understand how this is so highly rated,"I'm being generous with the stars. But I've seen so many poorly made movies this year. That this at least excels in some aspects.The chase sequences were pretty cool, and I would say a lot more plausible/realistic than many movies. Where you could see if someone was that good in reality they might actually get away. On a technical level it had a lot going for it. So I will give it that.The biggest disbelief in this film is the story. It's a bit silly. The main actor while he could dance, had good looks, and do a parkour move over the car. The whole time. I thought was a pretty terrible actor. Made me wonder who chose this kid for the role? When the love story rolled around, I could not wait for it to get back to the action. I suppose he would make for a good dj too. But not an actor.It was like Baby was trying to do a bad ass hip Napoleon Dynamite? The girl at the diner instantly became the most supportive girlfriend ever with very little history or investment to risk her whole life. But OK.The acting by the supporting cast was very good. But again the story is just silly.If the director would make an action edit, without the whole love story. Limited to just the kid driving the heist, not trying to act.Just the supporting actors, it would be good, maybe even a 7.4 How this kid got the leading role is beyond me. Must have some connections in Hollywood some studio exec wanted to make his son happy?Watch if your bored, or are highschool age or younger.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Bad movie,"Wrote a big write-up, but unfortunately, this stupid site somehow ate my comment, so I'll just summarize and say, Lily James did a great job, I hated Ansel Elgort, I hated the writing, I hated most of the other performances, there were numerous plot holes and that Jon Hamm and Jamie Foxx's roles got incredibly annoying and unbelievable as the film went on. This was also another film where you can tell the writer grew up rich and does not understand how working class people behave. One part in the movie, Baby works off his debt and just walks away to become a pizza delivery driver and Doc never says anything like, ""You excited to make real money now?"" There was just a lot about Baby that reminded me more of a trust fund kid than a real lower-class person struggling to make it.I just can't recommend this movie until it comes out on DVD.

Everything kind of fits. Found myself uncomfortably laughing out loud at some points and really impressed by the cleverness of it all. The music score (which is pivotal to the plot) is just excellent and the acting is everything you would expect of a great cast. Will be looking out for more by this director.

You'll be dancing in your seat,"Through our earbud-obsessed getaway driver protagonist Baby (Ansel Elgort), we are quickly introduced to the illegal schemes of head man Doc (Kevin Spacey) and his misfit master con team Bats (Jamie Foxx) and Buddy (John Hamm).What unfolds is a series of thrilling car chase scenes that leave a lump in your throat and provide edge of your seat anxiety, each perfectly crafted to Baby's personalised soundtrack.¬†With songs ranging from Beck to The Beach Boys, the film hums to an infectious rhythm that you'll have a hard time to stop yourself from smiling about. Each scene becomes even more impressive once you remember they were actually performed with real cars and real stunt drivers.And then everything, of course, quickly goes bad.Tied to the ring of criminals by a past mistake, Baby is very much the sore thumb of the bunch. Equal parts endearing and morally questionable, he takes the film from a classic bank heist to a musical-esque action thriller. We quickly realise Baby is never going to escape the firm grip of Doc and can only look on in horror as his fate grows far more sinister.The film is full of Wright motifs, the classic quick cut montage and witty one liners, similar enough to his previous works to make a mark but different enough to keep it feeling fresh.If anything is disappointing it's the hollow back story of Baby's love interest, Debra.¬†The chemistry between Baby and Debra is electric - at one point they are practically melting over each other at the dinner table with affection. But we never really learn too much about his sweet-as-pie-diner waitress except for the fact that she looked after her sick mum and sometimes does her laundry. We never understand why she's so willing to run away with a serial murdering thief that she just happened to have met. But maybe that kind of plot history is too much to ask.In the end, there's no denying that Baby Driver is worth seeing. Whether simply for the soundtrack or the car chases, everyone will be able to find something to sink their teeth in to. It definitely has its misses, most notably vague character motivations and a shaky introduction, but it finds its own ways to smooth it all over.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
best film of 2017,"Go watch Baby Driver- the best film of the year till date.Baby Driver is a unique movie, creates its own category- that of a heist musical. Yes, you read it right, and let me explain. At its core, Baby driver is as old school as it gets- it is about rollicking car chases and near crazy criminals. Juxtapose that background on the central character, Baby, who is a demon of a getaway car driver, and who views life through music, and there you have a heist musical- an exhilarating experience I must say. No superhero or transforming robot big bashes, just a straight forward stylishly made romantic action comedy running on gallons of nitrous oxide.Was he slow?So what is unique about Baby, played by an excellent Ansel Elgort? He makes remixes out of everyday conversations, and turns his world into music. He is addicted, nay dependent, on music because of his tinnitus condition- he needs to play music to cancel out the continuous ringing in his ears. So director Edgar Wright takes this a step further to make everyday activity a part of Baby's soundtrack. Everything that happens in the movie- a car rushing past, a man typing, a message coming on the phone- will work with the beats, in a fluidic way that is almost impossible to imagine, let alone execute. Hats off to Mr. Wright then.But its not all style, there is tons of substance too. Baby in the past tried to rob Doc (Kevin Spacey), got caught and now is trying to pay off his debt by being the driver for the heists that Doc plans. One last job is what he is due, but once you are in crime, there is no last job so there is that. And then he meets Debora (Lily James), the love of his life, the reason to get out of crime. Do the stars align? Is Baby able to turn a new leaf? Do the lovebirds get to walk away in the sunset? All this to the tune of Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, Bob & Earl, The Beach Boys, Queen, Simon & Garfunkel T. Rex, Beck and many more.The stars do an exceptional job too. Ansel Elgort and Lily James embody an old world chemistry and charisma. Spacey is Spacey- super cool, Jamie Foxx as Bats is scary, Jon Hamm and Eiza Gonzales as lovers in crime are great, while CJ Jones as Baby's foster father brings tons of sensitivity to a 100 mph movie. In fact it is not only about the stars. Every one- the extras, the bits and pieces actors perform like flawless beats in a chart topping soundtrack.Baby Driver is what movies are all about. Awesome music- check. Great plot- check. Excellent direction- check. Superb acting- check. Flaws in the movie- nil. Don't believe? Watch it and find out.",,Anonymous,Crime

Entertaining genre bender with superb sound design,"Edgar Wright makes original, stand-alone films with good pacing. Franchise flicks struggle with pacing because you have to think about what's to come. It's not a complete work of fiction so you have to compromise. Not so with original flicks. Wright doesn't sequel bait in the slightest, and it's refreshing.He reminds you why you're sitting in a cinema watching a film instead of sitting in the cinema watching some CGI team hog the PS4 controller. He does intelligent visual and auditory comedy which cannot be done in video games, in books or on radio. His previous films have had mostly visual comedy, but Baby Driver goes all in on the auditory alternative.Action scenes sync to Baby's music, creating what feels a bit like an action-musical in some scenes. He gets the ratio right - the characters aren't dancing around in the action scenes, they're still fighting. Gunshots match to beats, that sort of thing. If you like a healthy dose of soul, blues dripping rock, Motown, even heavy metal, then you'll love the soundtrack.One moment you're in mindless action, the next you're suddenly in a romance, then the musicals break out. It's a bit all over the place but comes together convincingly enough for me to recommend it to all audiences. An A-list cast doesn't hurt.See it in the cinemas or on a home cinema with good surround sound.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
What a ride!,"Freshly minted, super-duper fun, uber cool, confident, thrilling, propulsive, exhilarating, inspired, geeky glee inducing these are just some adjectives I would bandy around Baby Driver and it is definitely deserving of even more. This is pop-culture filmmaking at its best.I once read that there are seven basic plots for telling any story in movies. Nowadays, hardly anyone tries to do anything remotely original anymore. ""Better tell the same story and mixed it up with CGI"" feels almost like a template. I can count on the fingers of one hand, movies that dare to push the envelope this year (Get Out, Bad Genius, Dunkirk) In that respect, Baby Driver isn't original in its story ‚Äì how many times have you seen a story about a nice guy who thinks he is out, but he is pull back in for one last score and it all goes to shite? It is in its execution and style that it hits the sweet spot.Edgar Wright shot the action to the rhythm of music, not the other way around. Everything about Baby Driver and Baby is about the rhythm and the beat. Bullets exploding from gun barrels to the beat and car drifting to the tempo. The whole thing feels like a magic carpet ride to geek innercity. I love how Baby's character is established gradually ‚Äì we see his uncanny ability in weaving in and out of traffic like a bat out of hell, always a few steps ahead of the police cruisers. We see how he has different iPods with carefully curated playlists for any occasion and mood (Apple, please bring back the Classic üò¨). In Baby's world, music exists in every frame, so much so that his world turns to shite when the music is gone or when he can't find the right tune.Ansel Elgort brought the winsome character to life. From the very first scene, he is the propulsive beat of the whole movie. This is a career-defining and star-making role, and he nailed it. However, the movie doesn't rest on his shoulders alone and the supporting cast is a match made in heaven. We have the ""Man with the Plan"" Doc (Kevin Spacey), Buddy (Jon Hamm), Darling (Eiza Gonz√°lez), Griff (Jon Bernthal) and Bats (Jamie Foxx). Just let their monikers roll off your tongue. Aren't they cool? The characters have disparate personalities and each of them brings their own distinctive spin on their roles. These are not cannon fodder or plot movers, each of them menacingly memorable in their own way.In the heart of it all, is a romantic interest played by Lily James. The meet cute is scored to, you guess right, music. We hear the music first before we see the face. By the time the scene hits, you would be so into Baby you know he has now something to look forward to without the movie telling you in boring expositional passages. Their chemistry is palpable and sincere. You want them to get in a don't-know-what car and head west into don't- know-where.Where Baby Driver sort of gone off track for me is in the final reel where characters take somewhat jarring detours and a coda that feels too convenient, but I am not dissing this one little bit. I saw the whole movie with a wide geeky grin on my face, and the first hour is one amazing tour de force. The gears and mechanics at work are calibrated for maximum impact and the car chases are shot with such verve. IMHO this one left any movie in the Fast and Furious franchise in its wake and it is up there together with Bullitt, The French Connection and Ronin.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

keep driving to soul music,"Edgar Wright takes a turn away from the Cornetto Trilogy with the perceptive ""Baby Driver"", focusing on the getaway driver for a group of criminals.

"As homage to classic heist films, Baby Driver starts exceptionally well but ends with a whimper.","When you have bank robberies, armed gunmen wearing caricature masks and fast getaway cars, you are most certainly watching a heist movie. Add music in every scene, a bit of old fashioned misty-eyed romance, oddball characters thrown into a madcap mix and you are now watching Edger Wright's Baby Driver - a kinetic, off-the-wall action comedy that starts with a bang, but before you know it, is gone in 60 minutes. Everything after is like the recoil of a gun ejecting a spent cartridge.The first hour is so much fun, it contains every reason you would recommend watching this film. Even so, the first two minutes is all the viewer needs to get hooked in. Written and directed by Wright, the film begins with infectious energy soon after we are introduced to baby-faced Ansel Elgort as the titular getaway driver for a group of armed robbers organised by Doc (Kevin Spacey). He is called Baby because he is the youngest member of the crew and basically a kid. Baby also suffers from permanent hearing damage owing to a tragic accident, so must listen to music to drown out a constant hum in his ears. Seen through Baby's perspective, everything that happens in the film is synchronised to his music. Be it gun shots, doors opening and closing, tyres screeching, dialogue, and every other sound effect is seamlessly integrated into the soundtrack and camera-work with stupendous attention to detail. And as soon as we are hooked to the music, Wright moves swiftly into the plot specifics ‚Äì Baby owes Doc one last job, after which he is free to pursue his own life. But as we have seen in previous heist films, there is no such thing as a last job. Once you're in, there is no way out.Despite his obligation to Doc, Baby is a nice guy and sure enough things get complicated when he meets love interest Deborah (Lily James), a waitress at a local diner. They plan a perfect getaway but with the arrival of a new stick-em-up crew, ala Bonny and Clyde couple Buddy and Darling (John Hamm and Eiza Gonz√°lez), and trigger- happy badass Bats (Jamie Fox), all hell breaks loose. What ensues is a roller-coaster, edge-of-your seat thrill ride all the way but is it the best from visionary director Wright as early reviews seem to say? Including Shawn of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, all of Wright's six films to date have been wildly entertaining action comedies with clear love for genre films that came before. Baby Driver is no different in that it is a love letter to some of the greatest heist films from Hollywood (how many references to heist films can you spot in this review?). The car chase scenes for example are non CGI rendered, meaning actual stuntmen were used in white-knuckle maneuvering that resembles chase scenes from the original The Italian Job. But while the film could have remained a simple heist movie (where inevitably the last heist is always botched), Wright's story gets muddled with grand themes of loss and love heals all wounds, and then turns into a farce with a hammy ending where characters refuse to die. No pun intended.Compared to some of the big titles opening this summer, Baby Driver is much smaller in scale and budget, but still manages to stand its ground as an exhilarating action-comedy with nothing but the will to entertain. Add to that a fantastically assembled soundtrack fused with almost every scene and we are essentially watching a musical on wheels. There is also Wright's unique sense of pulp cinema style oozing in every scene, but despite all that has gone into making Baby Driver an interesting and fun film (including a well assembled cast), the biggest downfall is the lack of any relatable or lovable character. That, and the fact that the film opens on an octane high but simmers down to a whimper towards the end undermines what could have been a scorcher of a film this summer.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Huge credit to the people who edited this movie, the sound editing and mastering is good, the action editing is good, and the pacing was perfect. Most action films has a pacing problem when it comes to car chases but this movie did it right. When watching it feels like everything is timed to a beat, almost like we are seeing the world like Baby is, to a beat. The only reason that Baby Driver didn't earn my 10/10 spot was a couple of editing moments where a cut reveal what would happen and it ruins a couple of twists but on the other hand, if those cuts were to be left out it would have taken the audience out of the story and just question what they saw on screen.Ansel Elgort could not have been more perfect for this role, looking forward to what he has left in the tank for us in the upcoming years, he fits in good as a main character behind a wheel. A couple of other big names were in this movie; Jamie Foxx, Kevin Spacey, Jon Hamm & Jon Bernthal. As usual Jon Bernthal and Jamie Foxx prove yet again that they are excellent at playing a-holes. If it weren't for the cast of talents on this movie had probably been overlooked as just another car movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
The moment you catch feelings is the moment you catch a bullet.,"Baby Driver is written and directed by Edgar Wright. It stars Ansel Elgort, Jon Bernthal, Jon Hamm, Jamie Foxx, Kevin Spacey, Flea, Lily James and Eiza Gonz√°lez. Music is by Steven Price and cinematography by Bill Pope.In debt to a crime boss, a young getaway driver with tinnitus finds himself taking part in a heist that could spell doom for all involved.Lets get it out the way, I'm a big fan of Edgar Wright, I find him refreshing for still shooting on film. That he has beautiful camera actions and for the fact his cutting is smooth and not a incomprehensible video game mess like so many other action movie directors these days. So obviously I love Baby Driver for sure.The choreography is high quality, the stunt work equally so, while the varied soundtrack (given to us via Baby's personal player) is one of the best in many a year. Cast are bang on form, where naturally they are given a zinger of script to work from (it pays to watch more than once to catch some lines again). While the thrill of the extended action scenes are joyous.It was a film long in gestation for Wright, and you can see he has given it his undivided attention. He may be divisive as per his output, but the monster success of Baby Driver (both critically and commercially) speaks volumes about the quality of the work on show. One of the best films of 2017. 8.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Spinning the wheel,"I'm not into the whole ""Gone In 60 Seconds"" / ""The Fast And The Furious"" franchises where the cars (or more particularly the driving and destruction of them) are the stars, but I took a chance on Edgar Wright's take on the brake and am glad I did.Focusing on the appropriately baby-faced title character (Ansel Elgort) from first to last and told from his own cockpit view, I actually wondered if he was going to perpetuate his initial Harpo Marx mute routine for the whole movie and was a little disappointed that he didn't. Where I did connect with him however was in his devotion to his iPod where he has a different one for different moods and can find his favourite track by spinning its wheel as quickly as he can the one in his car.Baby however has a lot on his plate, an orphan who unsurprisingly lost both his parents in a car crash, he now looks after his elderly deaf-mute black stepfather in a run-down apartment, appears to be under the control of criminal mastermind Doc (Kevin Spacey in his last major film role before his scandalous fall from grace) and then falls for a pretty waitress named Debora (Lily James) who shares his love for usually classic R 'n' B music.Into the mix are thrown Doc's flaky negative-Mission Impossible assembled crime gang members Jamie Foxx, Jon Hamm and Elza Gonzales who all get to jive talk and play shoot-em-up with any number of rival gangsters and errant cops who cross their paths, but who ultimately come to their own sticky ends.With the action set-pieces neatly syncopated to a diverse soundtrack taking in obscure T Rex, early 70's Dutch Rock from Focus and Golden Earring as well as great soul-sides by Sam and Dave, Bob and Earl and Carla Thomas, ending of course on Simon and Garfunkel's title tune, the film is a breathless ride through a series of staged bank heists and of course car stunts where it's fair to say that many cars were damaged in the making of this movie. There was also a relieving dollop of comedy as you'd expect from director Wright in the crisp music-themed dialogue between Baby and Debora, the gang squabbling over which Mike Myers character mask to use when carrying out a robbery and Baby's gentleman-driver politeness which helps him ultimately to reduce his jail term and so reunite with Debs at the end.All the performances are good, with Hamm in particular surprisingly so as the deranged stockbroker-gunslinger and Elgort and James as the young Bonnie and Clyde-types.I actually watched this movie as an in-flight movie which probably isn't a bad way to see it. As well as helping my return home go quicker I also appreciate it saving me from ever dipping into any of the four-wheel stunt-fests like those mentioned at the start of this review.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Fun,"I like Edgar Wright. His movies are always entertaining, with sharp humor and fast-paced action. I consider Baby Driver to be one of his better offerings. It's a straightforward story about a character trying to exit a life of crime. He works as a getaway driver, which gives Wright an excuse to film some of the most unquie car chase scenes ever. The main character doesn't just go fast; he has complete control of the automobile, slamming between gears effortlessly while making manuevers that don't seem physically possible. So those parts are fun. But we also get reasons to like the character and care about him succeeding. It might not be the most memorable story, but it's a fun, entertaining watch that doesn't ask too much of the viewer.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Lots of Fun, Set to a Great Soundtrack","Baby Driver is a fun, dark comedy with an eclectic and amazing soundtrack. The central character has ear buds on most of his waking hours and when he does, we hear the same music as him. The whole movie at times seems like a series of music videos, especially the car chase scenes, which could easily get monotonous, but they are very well done and extremely fun. Some of the plot points and characters are almost one-dimensional cutouts, but you won't have time to think too much about those because the movie moves quickly from one scene to the next and keeps the plot lines engaging as it does. The back part of the movie is darker than the earlier scenes, with more violence and fewer jokes, but it is still a great time. Bonus sightings if you like Mad Men, The Walking Dead, or the Red Hot Chili Peppers, plus the always-amazing Jamie Foxx and Kevin Spacey showing off their acting skills.For those people who live in Atlanta, this movie is destined to be a drinking game of who can identify the most locations. This was highly entertaining and worth the time and ticket price for some fun escapism.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Not what I expected from Edgar Wright...,"I love Shaun, Nick Angel, Scott Pilgrim. They are really awesome! & so funny by the way. I carry my expectation to ""The World's End"" and yeah, its OK. So, after all the buzz, the hype and good critics, my expectation is way too high too for this movie. Its my fault to expect a perfect movie, ""Baby Driver"" is just a good, cool and stylized action movie. Its OK overall, I like it. I guess this movie will appeal more well to American audience because they know all the old song that have been played in the movie. They might enjoy it better than people from other continent that's not very familiar with the song selection. I love some of the song too but in some scene I think its too much and kind of annoying when its so loud with the help of the cinema audio system. Enough said, just enjoy it, its OK.

A Spinning Record,"A very steady directing hand by Edgar Wright. Music is the sync of life and he plays it to the hilt about a driver for crimes because...he's indebted to a crime boss. Simple enough. Until you introduce nutjobs.Quirky fun and clearly a filmmaker who knows how to put together a movie that isn't trying to be so computer graphics heavy. What a relief it is to watch a movie where you see the director's personality in it rather than stupid superheroes being thrown through drywall. God, I hate Marvel.

2017's Best Action Film!,"Baby Driver is a one-of-a-kind movie; Edgar Wright is still one of the 21st Century's best directors and easily among the most creative as well. Baby Driver is like his previous films but unique as well; it's got some genuinely funny moments mixed in with tense drama and action sequences. It starts off with ease, but by the time you get a third into the movie it cranks up the gears and doesn't slow down! This film is pretty damn fun, a bit shocking, and has got some of the best bit-gags in an action movie in recent memory. Imagine the characterization and wit of Hot Fuzz mixed in with the crime-thriller vibe of Heat, with a dash of Nicolas Refn's Drive car-chases, and you have Baby Driver: one of the year's cutting-edge movies. This is a hybrid genre-film that knows when to even out action with character drama and humor; and the result is a seamlessly entertaining film.This movie is an achievement and is sure to be cited as a modern classic down the track. Who knows? All I know is that I loved this film; and it deserves to be seen at the movies.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Cops must have read the script since they magically appear so quickly.,"Edgar Wright yeah? Edgar Wrong. I love Edgar Wright movies, but I thought this script was truly amateur hour. So I wondered what happened? Then I read this is the first screenplay he wrote by himself. And so I beg, please do NOT do that again. It is one mistake after another. Nothing really makes any sense, which I guess is fine if you're going for the surreal world of Scott Pilgrim or his other films, which was which were true masterpieces, not this junker. I saw some professional critic say (can you trust those guys anymore?) that this was ""his masterpiece."" I hope he got paid well. This movie is amateurish on every level, and it isn't just the script, the story is hackneyed as well. But back to the script, you know what I hate in crime movies more than anything? Magic cops.Magic cops is what I call it when police show up within a time frame that in real life is much too fast. If you commit a crime and within seconds or less than a minute there are multiple cop cars and helicopters on you-- those are magic cops. If every time you turn around, there are cops, those are magic cops. That may give the director a quick way to get into a chase scene, or move the plot where you want to go quickly, but it is cheating the laws of reality. The ability of the cops to always find the criminal very quickly regardless of what they do or where they go or how little info the cops should have, is cheating the viewer of a realistic story. Which is fine for a surreal movie like Wright is known for, but this is played straight. This is a straight up crime romance. It is lazy writing and nothing more to blame.Another thing I hate is when supposed seasoned criminals do very dumb things in order to make it easier for cops to catch them. For instance if you are stealing cars to make a get away and also switching cars to aid in your escape, why would you then park right in front of where you live or where you are doing stuff? And since you changed cars why are the cops there within a minute or two? The writing is lazy, that's why. The criminal all of a sudden conveniently acts like a foolish amateur at the worst possible time and the cops magically appear everywhere--that sums up this movie. This happens over and over and over.The acting is fine for what they are asked to do, but what they are asked to do is either mawkish or hackneyed tough criminal types. I get the feeling that Wright was trying to create a Guy Ritchie movie (failed at that Edgar, completely) because he wanted to be seen as more than the guy who makes funny wacky weird movies. He wants to be seen as street. He fails bigly. The amount of hype this movie gets is sadly so typical these days for bad movies, and I think a lot of it has to do with people who are maybe drinking or other things, maybe out partying before seeing these types of movies that appeal to young guys, because if you are sober and not very young, you should cringe at this type of stuff. Imagine Fast and the Furious without anything but sitting around talking like idiots with a few driving scenes without any of the wild and big production stuff they do. What you get is dumb and tiresome dialogue, mawkishness, hackneyed machismo, and a forced romance that doesn't seem real just to give the movie a romantic motive for the lead.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime

Not as Bad,"So I've been holding out on this movie. I've come across my brother watching it a couple of times and he seems to enjoy it. Anyway I decided to give it a try. The first 30 minutes are pretty solid. It loses it's basis somewhere along the way with a cringe love story and a Bonnie and Clyde thing. It also pushes in a lot of unnecessary and incoherent violence. The storyline becomes baseless somewhere along the way. At some point, the only thing that keeps me going are Jamie Foxx's one liners. So thanks to him, I gave an additional two points in my review. Also, thank Kevin Spacey for another one. His character had so much potential but his ending is dumb.

Of course this is a very important part to the story and the motives of our Driver. But at times it felt like a completely different movie and not in a good way either.

"It's not about the cars, music or characters...it's about popular culture as a whole","I was waiting for this movie with great interest, as many journalists wrote things like ""it's going to be the car movie of the year"" or ""chase scene orgy never seen before"". Truth to be told, 'Baby Driver' is a no-brainer for a die-hard car junkie, it's no better than a random Fast & Furious episode...which is bad. It's bad in terms of showing anything else than the usual stereotypes about driving & action and how they work together, contains little new or unique elements.But at about halfway to the runtime I realized the director probably didn't wanted to show anything like that to the audience. The characters are so ridiculously simple that they practically play no part in the movie - they are merely just tools for showing off mighty pop culture icons like an iPod, a Subaru Impreza, a cassette recorder or the waitress at a 60s style American restaurant. The list could go on for pages. And the music choices - well, they are brave, but I can say they worked out amazingly well - soundtrack is definitely the strongest point of 'Baby Driver'.So all in all this movie is a mirror to the societies of the last ~50 years. If you realize this, and that in fact it's still a pop-corn movie, not the nominee of an art film gala, you may be able to enjoy it - just don't concentrate on the story.

Wright goes next level of hip with Baby Driver,"Baby Driver is a cool film, you'll become aware of this from the first minute of screen time and Baby Driver is certainly aware of it too.Edgar Wright's first American film oozes a cocksure arrogance (need proof, go back and re-watch the first 10 minutes), as it goes about telling the story of Ansel Elgort's tinnitus suffering getaway driver Baby, whose like the octane fuelled love child of Colin McRae, Dominic Toretto and Steve McQueen for good measure.It's rare to see a filmmaker so assured of themselves and Wright's humble beginnings that took shape as we now know them with two best mates stuck in a pub as zombies took over their city, have evolved and taken shape too allow the wunderkind to make Baby Driver not only a heist thriller, but one that confidently mixes in the most unlikely musical cues and comedic undercurrents in a fast paced, snappily edited and self-aware tribute too car lead action classics of yesteryear.It's unlikely that we'll see a more whip smart Hollywood event this year of a film that's more proficiently edited together scene to scene or in a sound editing sense and when Baby Driver is rocketing along at full speed, there's barely a chance to take a breather as Baby's dealings with Kevin Spacey's criminal kingpin Doc and crew members like Jamie Foxx's demented Bats and Jon Hamm's Buddy get more dangerous and Baby's feelings for Lilly James's humble diner worker Debora start taking hold.Wright really does create an often thrilling ride, but all the screeching tyres, smartly tuned edits that fall in place to an even hipper soundtrack and wink wink type dialogue, can't help mask the fact that Baby Driver's earnt smugness and quick-fire pacing culminates in a rather so-so finale and that the films frequently masking a fact that Baby himself isn't exactly the most amazing of protagonists and his almost instantaneous courtship with Debora doesn't click as it perhaps should've.It may seem like nit-picking towards a film that achieves its goals of providing a near endlessly on the go narrative and frequently heart pounding car chases but with Wright so assuredly going about his business, he has set the bar high for judgements and made his films flaws or the more glaring for it.It's brave of Wright to centre a film of this nature around such an against the rule book main character, usually reserved for macho tough guys or arrogant handsome devils, and Elgort's Baby is anything but the usual, but it doesn't make him the most likable of guys.Making more than a few questionable character decisions and sometimes being too quiet for his own good, Baby is often too cold of a presence to make us truly care for his plight too escape a world in which he has fallen into and doesn't belong to, no amount of haphazardly done flashbacks will change that fact and it's hard to see why Collin's likable Debora would take such an instantaneous liking to a such a character.With Baby not always winning us over, Wright does find some fun and Hamm-y (sorry Jon) turns from his supports with Kevin Spacey in particular stealing the show as the curiously likable and sometimes detestable Doc. With Spacey on top form his ably supported by Jamie Foxx who is clearly relishing the chance to go all out as loose cannon Bats and Hamm makes his mark early as smooth criminal Buddy, before a final act stanza turns his performance into an over the top Terminator-light caricature, full of big eyes and a lust for blood that just doesn't feel like scenario that was full developed or earnt.Final Say ‚ÄìAt the end of the day there's little point denying that Baby Driver is a rip-roaring crowd pleaser and your likely new favourite film, filled with dazzling car chases, fun over the top performances and Wright's trademark dialogue smarts, but with the film already being labelled an instant classic by many, one can't getaway from the feeling that Baby Driver's reputation is already racing ahead of itself.4 homeless James Bond's out of 5",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Fantastic and very entertaining,"No doubt this may end up being the studio surprise of the year. It's not difficult to think of Drive when watching this. Just like Drive, its opening car chase scene and the subsequent credits opening are simply fantastic and set the mood for the entire thing. The real star of this film is Edgar Wright, who I haven't seen show this much directing flair and skill in quite a while, if not his entire career. This may truly be his best film yet. The screenplay is quite good and does a nice job with these characters, but it's everything else that seems to really bang. Elgort is so fantastic that you forget how unlikable his real life persona is. This is a fantastic film that should no doubt be recommended.",,Anonymous,Crime
A comedic and stylish version of Drive,"Edgar Wright's Baby Driver(2017) does not follow an original plot. Baby (Ansel Elgort) is a get away driver who wants out of the heist game. While trying to escape the world of crime, he falls in love with the beautiful Debora (Lily James). This sounds much like Drive(2011). Both Baby and Driver, the protagonist of Drive, are getaway drivers who are both trying to walk away from the game. Both movies also explore their love lives. Overall, Baby Driver is a comedic twist on Drive.Baby Driver, however, can be praised for its style. Minus the plot, the style of the film feels like something out of a Quentin Tarantino film. It's safe to say that the cinematography for this film is worthy of an Oscar. One can also appreciate the accompanied soundtrack of this film. Soundtrack is comprised of mostly tunes that are not overused in films. These tunes accompany the film and add to its style.There is also a combination of enough action and enough comedy. The film has enough action packed scenes to keep the viewer interested and enough whimsical humor to keep them entertained.Overall the film can be ranked 7/10. Although the plot of Baby Driver is not original, it still a good plot that has a flow. The artistic style of the film, along with its soundtrack make the movie that much better. Baby Driver is definitely a recommended film.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Edgar Wright's Baby Driver is a pulsating drive through the mind of a virtuoso talent,"It's been four years between drinks for fans of Edgar Wright. While remnants of his involvement remain in 2015's Ant Man, they ultimately underline the overall disappointment of what could have been. Luckily he's back and firing on all cylinders with his action/music hybrid Baby Driver, a stylish update of the old-school heist flick. It's Wright's most commercial film to date and coincidentally his first to film in the US. Using the streets of Atlanta, Georgia as his own personal racecourse, Edgar Wright's Baby Driver is a pulsating drive through the mind of a virtuoso talent, whose impeccable track record speaks for itself.In his first headlining role, Ansel Elgort is Baby Driver, the baby-faced getaway driver who times his chases to the beat of a specifically curated soundtrack. Baby suffers from Tinnitus, the result of a childhood car crash that killed both his parents. The music allows him to block out the ringing in his ears, helping him to focus and heightening his driving ability. His talent catches the interest of criminal mastermind Doc (Kevin Spacey), who organises bank robberies across the Atlanta metropolitan area. In dire financial straits, Baby agrees to work heists for him but after meeting Debora (Lily James), a waitress in a local diner, he becomes eager to get out of a life of crime and start a new life with her. However, deep in debt with Doc, Baby realises that finding a fresh start may be harder than just speeding away.Perhaps the only disappointing thing about the film is that it plays on the familiar heist trope of a ""one last job"" without offering much to subvert expectations. It's a clich√© that Michael Mann has worked many times over in films such Thief and Heat, and fans of those sorts of films will be able to guess the general arc of Baby Driver's story from beginning to end. The biggest deviation is that, while those films typically feature older career-criminals looking for a comfy retirement, Baby Driver features a younger, fresh-faced protagonist whose strings are being pulled from higher up. As a result, it's hard not to root for Baby as he tries to regain control over his life and put it back on track. He's a likable enough character and after losing both of his parents at a very young age, he is just trying his best to make something of his life, even if that means veering off into crime.Besides, while the narrative may play it a little safe, it's the skill and flair in which the familiar story is told that stands out. A kick-ass soundtrack and kinetic action sequences pave Baby's road to redemption, and they work symbiotically to produce a sort of action poetry that will have you hanging on to every word.From the opening scene played to the rocking rhythm of Jon Spencer Blues Explosion's ""Bellbottoms"", the film lets the audience know early on that the music is an integral part of the film's diegesis. In the scene, Baby is sitting in his car waiting for his accomplices as they rob a nearby bank. However, instead of idling around, the camera follows him as he grooves and sings along to the music. With the fast cutting and sweeping camera, Wright manages to elicit more excitement from the inside of the car than from the action occurring just outside.It's impressively put together and Wright stages it similarly to his 2003 music video Mint Royale's ""Blue Song', except with over a decade more of filmmaking experience allowing him to hone his talent. This is most evident in the precision in which the scene plays out as, on cue with the music, his accomplices jump into the car and Baby puts the pedal to the metal, roaring down the highway cops in tow. The shift to full-blown action is facilitated by the beat of the music, and it's this type of pinpoint precision that puts Baby Driver a cut above standard action fare.The film is filled with these types of stylistic flourishes, and they never feel superfluous even when they are indulgent. In one scene Baby goes on a morning coffee run listening to 'Harlem Shuffle' by Bob & Earl and the lyrics become part of the mise-en-sc√®ne, appearing as graffiti on street murals. The scene is so stylishly pulled off that it feels essential despite not adding much to the overall narrative. Then, in the last 20 or so minutes of the film, Baby Driver hits high gear with a slew of exhilarating chase sequences that will make your head spin as the film races towards the checkered flag with lightning speed.There is, however, a (ever so slight) disappointing feeling that the film lacks the belly-busting humour of Wright's previous works, in particular Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz. Given how effectively Wright has married action and comedy before, it would have been good to see a bit more of his trademark humour peppered throughout the film, such as the hilarious Mike Myers/ Michael Myers mask mix up scene. Although the decision to focus largely on the action may have been a purposeful one by Wright whose British comedies haven't exactly brought in box office gold stateside. Despite amassing a loyal fan base over the years, the cult filmmaker has yet to have a bona fide box office hit, but he seems determined to change that with Baby Driver.Overall, Baby Driver is a triumph of style over substance. It turns the chase film into high-art without challenging the viewers' expectations of the genre. While the story lacks surprises, the film's inventive chase sequences and perfectly tuned soundtrack make it irresistibly entertaining. After all it's not the destination but the ride that makes Baby Driver worth jumping on board for. And it's a ride worth taking over and over. Now when can we get a Baby Driver sing along version?",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Gritty and action-packed,"Baby is a young getaway driver, contracted to a master-criminal, Doc. Doc's specialty is armed robberies - he puts together teams for each heist, with Baby being the only constant. Baby completes his last job for Doc and is now free. He sets about leading a normal life, getting a legitimate job and starting a relationship (with Debora). However, Doc views Baby as a sort of good luck charm, and, using threats of violence, pulls him back into the criminal world. With a particular job in mind, Doc assembles his team. However, the other individuals are incompatible with each other, if not psychotic, and soon not only is Baby's life at risk but also Deborah's.A gritty, action-packed and entertaining drama from director Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, Scott Pilgrim vs the World). Good script, with some characters that Tarantino would be proud of. Good action scenes, largely involving cars. The car-action does get possibly too much screen time though, starting to resemble Fast & Furious after a while (that's never a compliment...).Another negative is that it does feel too schmaltzy, especially the ending, which is quite weak in comparison with the remainder of the movie. Ansel Elgort is also a bit irritating as Baby (though not as irritating as he was in The Fault In Our Stars). Comes across as a nerd trying to be cool.Can't fault the supporting performances though. Kevin Spacey, Jon Hamm, Jamie Foxx and Lily James are great. Jamie Foxx is particularly impressive as the intense, paranoid, impulsive, psychotic Bats.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
You remind me of the Babe.,"The final film of the Edgar Wright retrospective, for now, is ""Baby Driver"", one that I don't think works consistently enough at the best of times, and now, though not really it's fault, is weighed down by having a couple of stars who are ""problematic"".Baby (Ansel Elgort) is the getaway driver for a professional criminal mastermind Doc (Kevin Spacey). Whilst working with various combinations of bank robbers, Baby sets his life to music from a series of MP3 devices he keeps in at all times, to drown out the tinnitus that plagues him. With his time working for Doc coming to an end and with the increasing violence of the robberies playing on his mind, Baby looks to leave town with his new girlfriend Debora (Lily James) but Doc isn't willing to let Baby end their partnership.It's not like there aren't things to admire in ""Baby Driver"". There are a couple of scenes when he editing to music works really well - particularly in the early scene when baby goes to get coffee. There are good performances from Jamie Foxx, Jon Hamm and Eliza Gonzalez. If you can remove the performance from the performer, Kevin Spacey is strong too, with a complicated character. Some of the practical driving stunts are really well done to and are a credit to the team that produces them.The main criticism is that I don't think the cutting to music effect works often enough in the movie - maybe it can't - maybe that just wasn't possible to do it, but if all of the film worked like the scenes when it does, I'd feel a lot more positive about it. I'm also never particularly convinced that Ansel Elgort or Lily James are the right people for their respective roles. I don't see much chemistry between them.I don't hate it, but it's not one I can see me revisiting as often as other films in the director's catalogue.

Torn between a 6 and a 7,"Baby Driver is a pretty fun movie to watch and you will definitely not be bored by it. The music choices are great and the fact that everything in the movie lines up with the music makes for a very entertaining watch. It is also very impressive and makes you wonder how much work must have gone into getting the action to match up with the beats.Sadly it seems that the effort that that took eroded Edgar Wright's focus and when it comes to other aspects of the film, mainly the story, the characters and the comedy the movie falls far short of his previous films.(Now, obviously I won't rank it down because it isn't funny, since it's not listed as a comedy, but an action musical, but if you wish to watch it you'll probably want to know beforehand) This is in no way a Transformers or Fast and the Furious level of action schlock, but there are some strange choices and some straight up bullsh*t in it.For example, Baby's living situation. I'm not saying it's impossible that a single deaf black man would want to foster a kid and be seen by the CPS as a good fit, but it's the kind of thing that makes you wonder how in the world it happened and takes you out of the story a bit as you ponder the possibilities.Kevin Spacey's character was the worst part for me personally, both because of Spacey's lifeless line delivery and because of a breach of character which happens late in the film and appears so illogical and unexplainable that it almost seems an ex machina.For a fan of House of Cards it was just hugely disappointing and slightly embarrassing to see him perform so badly. He hardly performed a sigh better than he did in that sh*t show Nine Lives!There is more I could go into, but for fear of spoiling anything for you I'll keep from saying anything further than that there are some other plot turns that just do not make much sense. If you would like more info I'm sure it's not too hard to find.So, to conclude; Baby Driver is far from a bad movie and is highly entertaining, but it's hardly great and it is far from the hilariously beautiful genius that is Scott Pilgrim vs. the World or Hot Fuzz.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Pure cinematic fun and revelry,"As Bob & Earl's classic sixties song ""Harlem Shuffle"" blared in the cinema, and as the film's protagonist Baby (Ansel Elgort) boogied his way down the street in an unbroken Steadicam shot, I felt director Edgar Wright's passion for filmmaking. His filmmaking is as exuberant and vibrant as the film's soundtrack and even the most pessimistic critic would have a hard time not taping their foot to the music or revelling in one of the film's impressive action set pieces.It was the film's riveting opening scene that reminded me of the directorial passion and creativity that I feel has sorely been missed in most modern commercial blockbusters. Franchises do not generally allow for individual creative identity, since the studio is beholden to making an ongoing story that is bigger than one single two hour film. But Wright's strengths lie in his unending creative energy and ability to take a fairly generic, hackneyed premise and breathe new life into it. The fact that some of the irreverent, almost self referential humour from Hot Fuzz and Shaun of The Dead has carried over into the film also helps garner likability. If there is one problem in working with a generic story with a new stylistic edge it's that it becomes harder to fully invest in a character. Baby becomes a likable character, mainly due to Elgort's charismatic energy, but characters like Doc (Kevin Spacey), Bats (Jamie Foxx) and Buddy (Jon Hamm) come across as underdeveloped and bordering on cartoon like. This was an issue I had with Wright's previous film Scott Pilgrim; when you decide to prioritize a stylish aesthetic over character development, the film will end up being solely a surface level pleasure. This is not to say that a film cannot be enjoyed in this way, but I think Wright's far too talented a director to settle for that. It is because of this that it took a while for me to fully invest in the movie. The first half, much like the Baby character, was too concerned with finding the right song, not wanting to start driving until the best tune was picked.When the film gets out of first gear though, it soars with a palpable power and charm. The scenes between Baby and Debra (Lily James) work, once again despite their clich√©d nature, because of the natural chemistry between the actors. Charm exudes out of this movie. I am once again reminded of that opening scene with the long take. I can see, just from that one scene, the joy for cinema that Wright has. It makes it feel exciting again. And if all it is to audiences is a two hour thrill ride then so be it. It will still be the most exciting movie you will see this summer.Oh... and the soundtrack is great too.",,Anonymous,Crime

Baby Driver (@cmp_moviereviews),"Inspiration comes in many forms. Whether it be from a good quote, a page-turning book, or in my case, a classic movie. Edgar Wright has shown what it means to draw inspiration from films of the past to create something that is genuinely nonstop fun. ""Baby Driver"" is a film that demands and deserves multiple viewings, not only because of its technical brilliance, but also due to its commanding desire to make viewers smile at what's unfolding in front of them.

Breezy crime film is pure cinema!,"Snappy crime film from writer/director Edgar Wright (""Shaun of the Dead,"" ""Hot Fuzz,"" ""Scott Pilgrim vs. The World""). Ansel Elgort, an actor who I was previously not familiar with but who is excellent, plays Baby, a young getaway driver paying off a debt to crime boss Kevin Spacey by pulling jobs for him. Baby is near the end of paying off his debt and getting out, but as with most films about criminals trying to leave the life, it pulls them back in. That synopsis does not do this film justice because Wright tells his story in a supremely cinematic of fashion and what I mean by that is that he tells his story in a way that it could not be replicated in a book, a graphic novel, TV show, or other format. ""Baby Driver"" is pure cinema. Baby wears headphones throughout the film to buffer the constant ringing in his ears from a childhood accident that killed his parents, which allows Wright to give this film an amazing playlist of the first order, which includes everything from Dave Brubeck to The Dammed to Queen to Young MC. This is easily my favorite film soundtrack in a very long time! Also, as you would expect from a story about a getaway driver, Wright delivers a series of dizzying and thrilling car chase sequences, each better than the last. Rewatching this film, these chases seem to only get better and I believe will eventually enter the pantheon on greatest cinematic car chases. The film also boasts an incredibly strong supporting cast that besides Spacey includes Jon Hamm & Eiza Gonz√°lez as a husband/wife crime duo, Jamie Foxx as a distrustful nutcase, and Lily James as Baby's new girlfriend Debora. Performance are great all around, but this is really Edgar Wright's show and they're just living in it (or at least fleshing it out). With constant references to other genre films, this movie one that is a must see for cinephiles! FUN FACT!

Also Jamie Foxx's character was just got WAY too much screen time. Other than that, the action sequences are so incredibly good that you feel a bit bored during many of the dialogues. Also, there is a certain scene that kind of contradicts one of Spacey's superstitions that felt a bit contrived, stemming from an entire 10 minute aside that the movie could've just done without in my opinion.

Fun ride homage with a great heart,"I got to say that the mainstream cinema has been for me a letdown of late, and the better films have been really those under the bridge where I've found a few gems (e.g. Raw).Baby Driver is an antidote to the poor and identikit set of films released by the majors, and I hope it influences others to think outside the box.As with other Edgar Wright movies, this film is a homage to many favourites of years go by (I'd say major influences are Res Dogs + Gdns of Glxy + Point Blank = Baby Driver), but this is still a fine movie.We have a mostly light hearted and tender movie, as our lead with his obsession with his iPod music collection to help drown out tinnitus, is caught up in a world that is way too far for him. He's an incredible getaway driver, but the heist world is too much for him. He falls in love and it's a race to find a way out, not easy.It's funny, it's cruel, it's got a great soundtrack and great empathetic characters that are well fleshed out. Jamie Foxx is a cruel heist colleague and really ramps up the tension.The only problems are the derivative aspects to it, but that's part of the joy as it brings out memories of all favourites. It pays homage without ripping off. The first 30mins I got the impression that it would be too light hearted, but it does ram up heavily after that and the story picks up pace. Very good stuff.For a film to watch in the cinema, I can't think of too much better in the mainstream.

A super-stylish and massively entertaining visual and audial feast,"This might just be the coolest film I've ever seen. Powering along at a lightning speed to the tune of a stunning soundtrack, and popping with energetic performances across the board, as well as some exceptionally stylish directing, Baby Driver is an exciting, rapid- fire and triumphant piece of entertainment, and a film you won't be able to take your eyes and ears off for one second.Let's start with what really makes this film so stunning: the directing. From the legendary Cornetto Trilogy and Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, we know how well Edgar Wright can direct a movie, with his iconic fast editing and rapid-fire comedy.What's interesting about Baby Driver, however, is the fact that it's quite a lot different from Wright's previous films. For one, it's not a comedy. While it does have a brilliant sense of humour, and is a hell of a lot of fun to watch, it's not a film that's designed to make you laugh out loud again and again like Hot Fuzz and Shaun Of The Dead. Instead, the best entertainment comes from the visual and audial roller-coaster ride that Edgar Wright takes you on throughout the movie.First off, Wright's visual style is a little different from his previous movies. The film's opening act, for example, is full of long, sweeping takes that differ hugely from his traditional quick cutting. However, when used in the context of an insane car chase through the city of Atlanta, it has a very similar effect, and kicks the film off with some hugely exciting sequences.In the final act, however, Edgar Wright really does come into his own when he brings back his legendary editing techniques, and in tandem with those new spectacular long takes, the entire action finale is exceptionally exciting to watch, with the pulsating beat from those quick cuts working brilliantly with the more grandiose and elegant effect from those sweeping shots.What's more about Baby Driver is that it's absolutely popping with so many vibrant colours. As brutal and even violent as some of the crime story is, you can't help but smile from ear to ear at every moment simply because the film is so bright and enjoyable, with the bright reds of some of Baby's cars, the bright lights of the nearby diners, and the dazzling police sirens that add another level of visual exhilaration to the mix.But it's not just a visually thrilling film, because what really sets Baby Driver apart from so many brilliant action movies is how much of an audial experience it is as well. Centring around a character who listens to music when he drives, the film is set to an amazing soundtrack, barely stopping at all throughout the movie, playing whenever Baby has his earphones in, and giving the film such an amazing pace and rhythm that lasts from the very first to the very last scene.On the whole, it's pretty clear that Edgar Wright's directing here is beyond brilliant, but it's not just his directing that makes the film so good, because his screenplay is equally thrilling. With a genuinely engaging crime story focusing on an interesting central character, the film does brilliantly to prove itself as more than just an action extravaganza, and manages to get you on the edge of your seat with its fantastically exciting, unpredictable and non-stop plot.But it's not just Edgar Wright that runs the show here, because the performances are also fantastic. Despite a brief hiccup in the opening act, all of the actors do brilliantly with some hugely energetic and entertaining performances. From Ansel Elgort's effortlessly cool turn as Baby, to Jamie Foxx's brilliant show as a hothead criminal that threatens to derail all the plans, and from Kevin Spacey's smooth but sly crime boss to Lily James' effortlessly delightful love interest, all of the performances here are fantastic, and bring so much to the table when it comes to adding even more energy and life into an already exhilarating film.Overall, I absolutely loved Baby Driver. It's a film that snowballs brilliantly throughout, starting fast but never stopping as it turns into a relentless and effortlessly exhilarating action thriller by the end. With unbelievably stylish and energetic direction from Edgar Wright that defines the film's brilliance, as well as a brilliant screenplay and fantastic performances across the board, Baby Driver is the very definition of entertainment.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Good movie, Great Music","We follow the strange yet quite charming getaway driver ""Baby"" and him trying his best to get out of the crime world, which he does not fit in. We all watched similar stories many times. What this film does best is, it is really fun the watch. Car scenes were a blast to watch and the musics... musics were the best part of the whole experience. Really fun to roll it in and watch it with a bunch of buddies over some snacks and some light board games.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Enjoyable,"This film tells the story of a young man who is an amazing driver. He is forced to be the getaway driver for a criminal mastermind, until he meets a beautiful waitress who likes music like he does. A heist then goes wrong, and his life is at risk.I thought ""Baby Driver"" is a comedy, but it is also a crime thriller. The initial sequence featuring Baby and his love for music is very entertaining. It is quickly followed by a showcase of his exceptional driving skills. Then, the scene of him buying coffee is a long continuous shot, which deserves a mention. Many cool things happen is the film, and it is very enjoyable. The change in baby is quite a surprise to me.",,Anonymous,Crime

Good hyperkinetic caper yarn,"Ansel Elgort is 'Baby"", a young, music-obsessed driver in thrall to criminal kingpin 'Doc' (Kevin Spacy) who uses him as a getaway driver for number of increasingly bloody robberies. Baby, who is always plugged into music and records much of what he hears, is viewed with suspicion by the various hard-cases hired by Doc, ultimate leading to a climactic showdown with psychotic 'Buddy' (John Hamm). The film is darkly comic but not a broadly funny as director Edgar Wright's earlier films (i.a. Shaun of the Dead (2004), Hot Fuzz (2007)). The driving scenes, which are primarily practical effects (i.e. Not CGI), are excellent, the story entertaining (despite being a bit over-the-top and implausible (especially Hamm's seemingly unkillable bad guy)), and the cast and script uniformly good.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Not memorable, but definitely enjoyable","I had little expectations about this movie, besides the decent ratings on Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb (a rating which has gone down the drain for multiples 1...clearly a harsh judgment by any means)Will this movie be remembered? I doubt. Its mainly thrills (if not purely), with no specific statements, important plot holes indeed, characters are indeed full of clich√©s (although the character of Jon Hamm is more contrasted than most of them) or without things that will make this movie unforgettable.Despite all these flaws, the movies has its positives and, for a Saturday / Sunday night movie, clearly pass the test: Picture is of good quality, acting was decent (the fact that the characters are clich√©s does not necessarily mean that the acting is bad - maybe easier to do, but not bad by any means...the roster of actors is quite a plus), the action scenes are not realistic but well produced and enjoyable...and obviously the soundtrack is strong, very strong, with very few ""easy cheesy"" tracks used. Without forgetting that the ending of the movie, if not astonishing, clearly hits the mark.A decent movie, for a decent chill at home watching an entertaining movie on a quiet weekend night",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Forget the plot for a second ...,"I want to focus on production. Lots had been said about plot and that's fair. But this movie is a production masterpiece.It's focal dedication to music is refreshingly original. It's never done in a non-musical and is instantly engaging. The movie feels built around the songs instead of them being added later. It's odd and wouldn't fit with many films. But it works here. It's captivating and gripping. There's something exciting about the characters syncing and interacting with the song.The screenplay is a masterpiece. It's ballsy. The director for and actors do a great job given the task.

Destined to be a classic,"""Drive"" meets ""La La Land"" in this smash success of summer 2017 both written and directed with great panache by the British Edgar Wright. Is this a car-chase heist movie disguised as a romantic musical or the other way round? No, it's a genuinely fresh and original mash-up of genres with a plethora of tropes from other cinematic work.Like ""La La Land', the opening sequence grabs the attention and sets the tone. The eponymous young man at the wheel, played with a mixture of innocence and brutality by Ansel Elgort, is revealed to be someone with brilliant driving skills that enable bank robbers to escape any number of Atlanta's police vehicles but somebody who needs to overcome his tinnitus by playing loud rock music into his ear pods. Following the opening titles, a stroll to a coffee shop has all the cleverness of other parts of ""La la Land"". However, the story-line - a laconic loner who discovers a woman who might be his escape from a life of crime - is straight out of ""Drive"" which, as a thriller, is actually the better movie.There is lots of action in this film, with cars and guns in scene after scene, but what really makes the movie is the acting. This is a work where so many of the support roles are filled by actors who can and have top-lined movies: Kevin Spacey as Doc, the mastermind behind the heists; Jamie Foxx as Bats who is the wrong side of crazy; and Jon Hamm as Buddy who exhibits an almost ""Terminator""-like ability to keep coming back. The female roles - notably Baby's love interest Debora (Lily James) and Buddy's partner Darling (Eliza Gonzalez) are not so well-drawn. And the ending might be viewed as a little too sweet. But, heh, this is quality movie-making that is going to be a classic.",,Anonymous,Crime

Style Over Substance,"Style over substance. It's a term thrown around when defending a film that has artistic merit in visuals but lack a strong story. The films of Michael Bay and Zack Snyder frequently get this defense. The reason why that defense fails is because those movies are actually style with no substance. Baby Driver is an example of a style over substance movie.I can literally break down the entire plot for you in this review without fear of spoiling the movie. A young man (Ansel Elgort) finds himself indebted to a criminal (Kevin Spacey) and has to commit crimes to pay off the debt. Eventually he's clear but he quickly finds that getting out from under the criminal's control isn't that easy. Of course, the young man meets and falls for a girl (Lily James) who reciprocates and becomes involved in the chaos. Not only did I not spoil anything, it's the same plot as about fifty other movies.That's where the style comes into play. Director Edgar Wright fills this world with characters that are more than just one-dimensional plot contrivances. The young man, called Baby, listens to music almost none-stop to drown out a hum in his hearing he got as a child. That music is the film's soundtrack and frequently leads to scenes playing out like music videos but it always feels natural. Flowing from story to music video seamlessly. That's style.Added to this, is the fact that Wright also throws a lot of curveballs into the standard plot of the movie including some skillful bait and switch with the person who ends up as Baby's main antagonist. The cast all embody their characters. Elgort holds his own, but the supporting cast still shine. And when that support includes Spacey, Jon Hamm, Jon Bernthal, and Jamie Foxx it's easy to see why.Despite this impressive star power bringing their sizable skills to play, the real talent that shines here is Edgar Wright's sharp script and clever direction. I wonder how much of this was brought over from his work on Ant-Man. I do find it interesting his first film after leaving a superhero heist film is a heist film.And even though the film's origin may be an interesting tale, it ends up being a moot point. All the matters is the final product, and the final product is something really special that stands with some of Wright's best work (Scott Pilgrim vs. The World and Hot Fuzz). That is exceptionally fine company with which to stand.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

The movie is a fine action packed movie, but at times over the top and comical. Okay movie 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Is it good though ?,"Baby driver is now on Netflix. That means that people who weren't convinced enough by the premise to see the film in theaters, will now - maybe - give it a shot. I did. And I don't regret it. Nor do I regret having missed it while it was in cinemas. It's a decent movie, far better than the Netflix usual, but it's not great.The plot is bad. It feels like something written by an adolescent for adolescents. Ok, that's not a bad thing as such: I mean it worked for Wright's Scott Pilgrim. But Baby Driver lacks the self-referential humor. It's less fun. It takes itself too seriously, at least to my liking. The plot is not good, but it shouldn't matter that much since this is more of an 'atmosphere movie' - the main characters are the visuals, the soundtrack, the rhythm, the kind of overall 'vibe'...Let's talk about that. The music is good and used in a clever, entertaining way. The visuals are good, sometimes a bit overdone (the scene in the laundromat did not achieve what it aimed to), but the overall cinematography is more than solid, sometimes even downright amazing (e.g. he car chases) thanks to Wright's signature playfulness and creativity. The rhythm is fine, even if it loses momentum towards the end.But a movie cannot survive on atmosphere alone (maybe Fury Road pulled that off, depends on whom you ask). Baby driver has serious flaws. Take the characters... The protagonist is far too polished to be relatable: young, good looking, witty, genius driver, brave, intelligent, mature, confident, charitable, lucky as can be, well-versed in tasteful music, musician himself, ... But he's an orphan, so he's human after all - I guess. The other characters are all painfully one-dimensional. As mentioned above, the plot is weak. The dialogue is plain.In a nutshell : Baby Driver is good, but it has too many flaws to be memorable. It felt a bit generic, easy, using too many tropes to be genuinely seducing. I had no regrets watching it, but I won't be coming back.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Honest review,"I was intoxicated on edibles when I watched this movie and I think it made it so much better! I am a fan of Edgar Wright, so I would've probably liked it anyway, but I was trippin' so much that this strange, all music movie just seemed like the the most, exciting, perfect thing for me to be doing at that moment.Ansel/Baby, every scene with that kid I loved, especially the Dave Brubeck explanation scene.As stoned as I was, I was able to see through the horribly unbelievable and sometimes painful dialogue - so, all of the talking parts of this movie was a no-no for me... luckily there wasn't much.The part where Baby loses is timing - oh my god, that's why I love Edgar Wright!!
Loved the Michael Myers scene.
Loved the Joe Loya scene.
Loved - strictly in a clever, way how they blocked all the action of the robberies - I would love for Edgar Wright to do a slick robbery movie.. I think I wish that that's what this movie was - just a good ol' heist movie with this crazy getaway driving - But I did like it, because there's just something that Edgar Wright does with music that I agree with all of the time!Everyone except baby annoyed me.
I feel like Kevin Space was playing this too much like Frank Underwood.
Jamie Foxx was just an annoying robber, and Hamm and the girl were too meh, cliche - Still though, Baby, the music, the driving, made me rate this high... because all in all, I was entertained.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
