Splendid,"This is art. Real art. So few films try for this much.My sadness is that its appeal will be limited to polyglots, musicians, and lovers of costume drama. It's worth so much more than that. Beautifully shot, sensitively scripted and acted, and cleverly executed, this deserves more awards and greater coverage than it's going to get.9 out of 10. I dock one point because Girard occasionally lets the pace drop to deadly, and because Jason Flemyng and Greta Scacchi irritated me beyond words - but that's not Girard's fault.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
An ambitious story that delivers,"What can you say about a film that covers three centuries, people from all stations of society, and several European countries and Canada. Ambitious is a good start.  This film was very well crafted and at about one hundred forty minutes was too short for me.  The story follows a red violin, an inanimate object, although at times it seemed alive to me, thru three centuries and the influences good and ill that it has on its possessors.  It does ever seem to be owned.  Each of its possessors lives a life of passion and turmoil.  The violin's birth is during turmoil and during its life it buried, shot, and almost burned.  The writing which includes this parallel between the violin and its possessor , five somewhat independent segments that mell and converge in the final scenes, and a story told by tarot cards make for an extremely unique experience.  Add to that the musical score, scenery, the varied languages and cultures and you have a great offering. The performances were all strong, but I thought Jason Flemyng as Lord Frederick Pope stood out.  To say his character was eccentric and maybe a little over the top is justifiable but I'm sure that was intended.  English nobility has always been known for its idiosyncrasies.  The ending has incongruous feel with     the remainder of the film but is satisfactory and I can not suggest a better one.  Great entertainment!  Three and a half stars!!!",9.0,Anonymous,Music
priced acquisition,"Just saw this film at the local film festival and it lived up to the hype and more.  The music was incredible and considering I gave up learning the violin after Grade 1, I've found new respect and love for the music they produce.  Just felt swept away by the music from the child prodigy, the gypsies and the English virtuoso.The story was reminiscent of The Yellow Rolls Royce with the main protagonist now being a violin.  I thought it was obvious why and how the violin is red but the revealing scene still drew gasps from the audience. So is the violin cursed consequently or just an innocent instrument of fate.Wonderful way of introducing each chapter via the Tarot Cards and ending each through a prospective bidder at the auction.  Initially, I was discontented with Samuel Jackson's character and his eventual prized acquisition but I realised that this is not the end but in fact, another beginning.  If the instrument had landed up with somebody of relevant ties, it would mean the story has come full circle and it's time to wrap up.  This ending actually serves to continue the story - well done!",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Absolutely wonderful,"I thought this might be one of those films that would be ""good for me"" to see. I was mildly intrigued by descriptions of the story I had read and with the trailer, so I thought to take a chance. I took someone very close to me, an actual violin prodigy. Coincidently, her and I have recently been searching for a decent violin for her that is affordable by actual humans, so we could relate to parts of the plot first-hand. We arrived to a very thin theater in one of those mega-complex theaters, and while everyone was queuing up next-door to see the latest blockbuster from Hollywood I settled into an amazingly comfortable seat with an excellent view and prepared for whatever might come.I was shocked. This film turned out to be clearly one of the best movie going experiences I have had in ages. We see this as the story unfolds and is creatively told through the reading of the violin makers wife's fortune with a deck of Tarot cards. It is the story of a part of the life of a violin; of the humans who would dare to possess her beauty. A masterpiece of a craftsman's art, it is desired by many for it's acoustic perfection. But, as Tolstoy said, ""how complete is the delusion that beauty is goodness."" Or more interestingly, from Saint Augustine: ""Beauty is indeed a good gift of God; but that the good may not think it a great good, God dispenses it even to the wicked."" There seems to be a curse on this instrument as it brings ill to those who manage to possess it. This makes the ending especially eerie.An original, imaginative and thought provoking story that engaged one's mind as American films almost never do. I will not describe more of the plot, it's far too good to ruin. The memory of this film will be one long treasured.Oh, as for my guest, the honest-to-God prodigy: she said the music was magnificent (it was) even though a real musician could tell the actors weren't playing, it was well done.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Wow.,"I saw this film the same day it came highly recommended to me by a coffee shop friend who couldn't stop gushing about it.  While this guy is also a member of the Academy and has steered me to some pretty good picks in the past, I walked into the theater fearing the usual letdown that invariably follows going into a film with overly high expectations (i.e. The English Patient, The Truman Show, etc.) This film not only managed to exceed my expectations, it restored my faith in the magic and mystery of cinema altogether.We start with a rather simple but cleverly structured story about a very unique red violin that emblematically (and quite literally for that matter) takes on the heart and fate of a 16th century Italian woman as it passes across several centuries and continents on its way to the auction block in present day Montreal.  The unfolding vignettes reveal more and more about the nature of this instrument and, when strung together in the bigger picture, play out like finely orchestrated movements of a great sonata; each movement plucking out its own stirring and poignant variation on theme.  I was so swept up in the majesty and spectacle of this film that it didn't even occur to me until much later that the violin is nothing less than a personification of beauty itself (okay, okay, maybe I'm starting to overly deconstruct things here in retrospect, but the parallels are too perfect to remain unexplored). It's fascinating to watch both the transformative and destructive power of this beauty as it's placed into the hands of a sensitive young boy, a self absorbed musical protege, and a remorseful ring leader of a totalitarian regime.  Much praise goes to director Francois Girard in how he refrained from overplaying the social and moral commentary, repeating this theme at mostly an emotional level rather than an intellectual one -- much in the same way that beauty itself, to some degree anyway, defies analytical discussion and belongs in the realm of pure and simple experience.  You obviously can't dissect it, as co-writer Don McKellarÂ¹s onscreen character thought to do, and so it remains as it was in it's original form: timeless, magical, elusive.  The stuff that pompous nobility and rich collectors the world over will offer a king's ransom for and still never manage to posses in the end.Performances were good to great all around.  It's hard to go wrong with Samuel L. Jackson in a leading role and I appreciated the fact that the actors actually appeared to be playing the violin on camera, as opposed to watching the typical hokey cutaways and cheat shots often associated with onscreen musical performances; nauseating contrivances that always tear down the wall of suspended disbelief with a resounding crash. The costuming, set design and cinematography were absolutely stunning (Oscar nominations soon to follow I'm sure) without taking center stage from the story. I especially loved the amazing period recreations of China and Austria.  I felt like I was fully transported in both space and time to these places and walking among people who really belonged there.Overall I would rate this one as a true film classic on the level of masterpiece. Perhaps this is in part due to my love for music and the undeniable fact that, being the sentimental guy that I am, I'm always a sucker for haunting open-ended films like this where you leave the theater in a half daze, pondering all the implications, mesmerized by the lingering imagery. I'm still speculating about the future of Mr. Moritz and what will ultimately happen when beauty is placed into the hands of our modern world.",,Anonymous,Music
A unique masterpiece.,"Never before has a movie made me care about an inanimate object as much as this one.  Pulp Fiction and Ronin are the only movies in recent memory that I can think of that even gave me the slightest glimmer of interest in an object.  The Red Violin changed all that.  Not only did I care for the violin, but I began to understand how Samuel L. Jackson's character felt towards it.  A beautifully crafted movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Compilation Film Suffers from Same Problems That Plague All Compilation Films,"One of those compilation films, essentially a series of short films linked by a common theme, character or plot hook. In this one, a violin makes its way from owner to owner across centuries, and we follow its path and get a feel for the history it acquires along the way.Like any compilation film, some parts are better than others and none of it is especially engaging because you know the film is going to move on to new characters and places before long.

beautiful music but not much tension,"A Nicolo Bussotti violin, known as ""the red violin,"" is auctioned off in Montreal. It was built in 1681 and Nicolo's last. The movie follows the violin from the story of its construction to the present. Nicolo's wife Anna Rudolfi is pregnant and her servant Cesca reads the tarot cards. When Anna dies in childbirth with her child, Nicolo mixes her blood with the vanish to paint on the violin giving it the unusual red color. The tarot cards foretells the future of the violin and not Anna.This is a difficult thing to make each section as compelling as possible. In the end, that is not achieved. Each section doesn't have enough time to tell its drama compellingly. Also the movie already shows that the violin doesn't get buried or burned. The music is beautiful as long as you love violin music. This is a beautiful sounding movie but the plot doesn't have much tension. There are some poetic moments but it meanders a bit.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
A beautiful film that enchants you completely.,"It has been quite a long time since I have viewed a film that told such a wonderful story so beautifully & in such a touching way. The music, the mood, the settings just made the film so real, so authentic in such a way the you cannot help but feel the passion this film is so full of. The concept of the film which follows the violin through the years from its birth to the present day & how it has touched the people in its  presence is unique & done in such a way that reaches out to you to feel its impact. The physical settings only authenticate things, while some films with subtitles can be sometimes awkward, this films' subtitles only make you feel the film more & draw you into the story more. Lovingly filmed, a score that that is memorable & so absolutely perfect. This film touched me in a way very few ever have.

"A wonderful ride, a bit thin by the end, but great mise-en-scene meanwhile","The Red Violin (1998)A total romantic fiction, rather compelling in its construction over many centuries, and beautifully wrought in each era.I don't suppose the violin needs romanticizing, nor does it need a kind of obvious group hug view of its history, but that's the feel good, up and down, loving story it takes. First there is the small violin shop where it is made, and the tragedy around this particular model, the maker's last. It's supposed to come from the same era as the Strad and other timeless fiddles. It's a great place to begin a story filled with mysteries (and the mystery of a great violin, it's shape, wood, and varnish, is given high tech reinforcement in the end with an electronic awe). So the violin is born.And it moves from a Austrian orphanage (with an unbelievable prodigy) to generations of gypsies (some interesting filming with the violin suspended in space as one after another player takes it up) to a crackpot British prodigy (who acts more like a rock star and an indulgent one, if that's not redundant). Finally it winds its way (not so improbably, because life is weird) to China, which of course echoes the modern rise of the Asian virtuosi coming from that part of the world.So the tale is the history of a violin, a possessed one. The spirit of the instrument seems to inhabit the movie. This is reinforced by an Italian fortune-teller (a kindly witch) who has an early Tarot deck. The Tarot was not used for divination that early--it was introduced a card game in Northern Italy in the late 1400s--but that's okay, because it works into the plot really well. Five cards are chosen by the pregnant wife of the master violin maker. Each is turned over for another twenty minute chapter in the movie. In a key moment, the wife asks the fortune teller, what if I don't like what it says, what if it's evil? And the fortune teller says, ""I'll pretend not to notice.""Promptly the moon is the first card, the most ominous card in the deck (I've studied tarot a bit, which is why, weirdly enough, I watched the movie). But the fortune teller doesn't say that doom is facing the pregnant wife. Instead she lies, and the movie takes one turn after another.You might think this is brilliant stuff, and it has the trappings of that. It could have been, with some slight twist of intentions, artfully transcendent. But it's a hair long at times, and by the last (modern) scenes, a bit cold and unfulfilling. I don't know the solution to what might have worked, but I know it left me interested and curious by the end, not quite bowled over, which is clearly (on the sleeve) the intention.Still, an engaging, musically rich tapestry of great scenes, great music, and a brimming story. Recommended, with slight reservations.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

Good - but could have been much better.,"A very good idea, and, for the most part, a very good movie - but something about the end dampens my enthusiasm.

"Measured, thoughtful account of near-mystical instrument","Literally spanning centuries to unfold its mesmerizing tale, The Red Violin traces the unbelievable history of an acoustically flawless masterpiece crafted in the late 1600s by an Italian master.  Co-screenwriters Francois Girard (who directed) and Don McKellar (who acts in the film) structure the movie around a wealth of richly detailed locales, including Vienna, China, and Oxford, and provide a unique modern-day Montreal framework which intertwines with the often tragic history of the instrument to provide the narrative with a rather unique element of mystery.  The late-19th century English section shows the film at its most baroque, but each of the finely tuned tales reaches for some truth about music, life, love, and passion -- and that is commendable.  Music lovers take note: the sounds that come out of the crimson treasure throughout the course of its journey are utterly thrilling and inspiring.",,Anonymous,Music
emotional,"this movie, like a book of short stories, can hook you once and annoy you the next. The segments follow a violin for 3 centuries obviously shooting for a wide range of settings, thus a wide range of stories and characters. But they are all much different. The Red Violin will be rewarding for those who pay attention, and a pain for those who don't, because the transaction of the violin from person to person isn't smooth, whoever is not willing to pay attention should steer clear. I definitely recommend it to all big movie buffs, because those willing to see it, should. I really enjoyed Don Mcellars work before, and this is no different. Some segments, like 'Vienna' are very enjoyable and sad (in a good way, like bambi's mom getting shot) well some like 'Oxford' are dark and depressing. You may not leave thinking it's spectacular, but ya gotta respect it. Thumbs up.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
A wonderful and very musical movie.,"Independent movies or Asian and European films (to make it easy, let's say all movies that haven't been produced by some big Hollywood studio), always seem to have a certain group of fans, not because they are good, but because they are ""different"". That so-called in-crowd believes that every movie that hasn't been made by a big studio is great art and that all other movies are bad. Never tell them that sometimes the opposite can be true, because they can't and won't believe you. Well, I'm not one of them and I watch all movies with a critical eye. And yes, I try to see as many of those ""alternative"" movies as well. But that's just because I'm a movie buff who is interested in all kinds of movies, not because I'm convinced that this kind of movies is automatically a lot better than the rest.In this movie we don't follow some people, but a violin on its journey through time and the world. The movie starts in present day Montreal, where ""the red violin"", a famous Nicolo Bussotti violin, is being auctioned off. But instead of staying with the auction all the time, we flash back to the creation of the violin in 17th century Italy and then follow it as it makes its way through an 18th century Austrian monastery/orphanage, a violinist in 19th century Oxford and China during Mao's Cultural Revolution... Each time it brings the person who owns it a lot of fame, but also bad luck and despair, often resulting in the death of the owner or someone the owner really loves...What I appreciated in this movie is that it wasn't just an ordinary drama or thriller. It actually tried to be original and it succeeded very well. Another thing that I also really liked was the fact that not every detail of the movie was clear until the end (for instance why the fortune teller's predictions come true, but not for the woman, but for the violin instead.). It sometimes seems that the creators of movies don't even bother about adding some mystery in their movies anymore and I really miss that. That's probably why I liked it so much in this one.Once in a while you come across a movie that you might call a gem. Well, ""The Red Violin"" is one of those truly magnificent gems. It's beautiful in every possible way. The music is excellent (although you better love violin music, because that's all you'll here), the acting is very nice and the story really is very beautiful. I guess I could talk for hours about this movie, but it's better to watch it than to read about it, so I'll end my review by saying that this is a wonderful and very musical movie that doesn't deserve any less than an 8.5/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

Recognition for an unusual epic,"Just to tease those who have not seen this incredible work of art and to make the others think you should see it again !Who could think that a movie about a simple violin could turn into such magnificent beauty? Â«The Red ViolinÂ» whole story is based on a piece of wood and strings, which carries a whole story of humanity and social issues. We travel through 400 years of history and music, to end up in what you might think is the end of the story of the Â«red violinÂ» but in fact, takes you to the next chapter.If you are a classical and historical music fan, you will love this movie. The Oscar to composer John Corigliano was not an option.FranÃ§ois Girard clearly has something for music, as he did another wonderful movie about pianist Glenn Gould, Â«Thirty Two Short Films About Glenn GouldÂ», a movie that really drives us through the life of a great piano interpreter.

We are left more inclined to believe the violin will go on, and that Morritz and his daughter are just another stop in its journey.

The RED violin is supposed to embody the continuity through time of human bleeding and suffering and striving and so forth, but the tool is so blunt it might as well just be a laughably ""cursed"" object as in the old tv series Friday the 13th.

Unforgettable experience,"After watching too many would-be ""great pieces"" lately that are enticing you from TV commercials, leaving you (or me, I should say) disappointed most of the time, ""The Red Violin"" is a gem among all these fleeting flicks or time-wasters. Recommended by a good friend I went to see this piece and frankly, I came out of the theater speechless! I was overwhelmed, enriched as well as happy that I finally, in years, got to see something that's well worth while.From the story, costumes, cinematography, acting and finally its greatest actor -the superb music- all absolutely flawless! S.L.Jackson acts at his best, his performance is unforgettable and I am sure one of his own most favourite; I can tell. I was estatic to see J.Corigliano win the Oscar for the best score, and saddened at the fact that the whole movie wasn't nominated for even more Oscars - are they blind in that Academy or what?! Now that's a shame but you know what I don't care what the Academy has to say, important is my subjective feeling and this movie made my day, and days to come.I couldn't wait to get hold of both, the video and the sound track, and I never seem to get tired watching or hearing that beauty all over again. And believe it or not, that ingenious soundtrack can be so erotic at times that if I may give a little advice to all these men out there seeking to entice and seduce their partners - hey, this might be the way to go - worked for me (and her!)!!!Anyways, I'd like to recommend this movie to everybody with an open heart and mind, I guarantee satisfaction and enrichment in every possible way.

Excellent movie,"This movie was captivating from start to finish and is truly a  work of cinematic art. Anyone who is a fan of great film and not just the mainstream, mega blockbuster, more cgi than story will love this movie. The fact that the movie is based on the violin rather than the people (which isn't a new idea) is what makes this film great because it shows that objects in our lives have stories all their own. I also loved this movie because I'm a huge Samuel L. Jackson fan and this is one of his best roles to date (other than Pulp Fiction of course) because I didn't know if I was supposed to like him or not until the very end. I also liked the twist involved with the origin of the violin's color because it was totally unexpected. Bottom line: this movie was great and one of the best of the year.P.S. - If you liked this try ""Twenty Bucks"" with Steve Buscemi, Christopher Lloyd, Brenden Fraser, and Elizabeth Shue. It uses the same idea of an object passing from person to person but in a span of a couple of days not centuries.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

But despite the splendid locations, acting, photography and story, it was the playing of Joshua Bell which lifted this movie to incredible heights.  The ""Red Violin"" is supposed to (in the story) be unique in all the world.

Plenty of great music.,"""The Red Violin"" charts the journey of a very rare red-coloured violin over the centuries, beginning in Cremona. From there, the instrument goes to Vienna, Oxford, Shanghai, and Montreal. When it arrives at an auction house, an appraiser named Charles Morritz (Samuel L. Jackson) goes to great lengths to study it and determine its authenticity. Naturally, collectors are willing to shell out a lot of money for such an object.This film offers an interesting sort of story (written by actor Don McKellar, who plays the role of Evan Williams, and director Francois Girard) that is of course episodic in nature. Now, not all of the episodes were equally compelling to this viewer, but there certainly are standout moments and sequences. Best of all are the segment in Vienna with an orphan / child prodigy named Kaspar Weiss (Christoph Koncz), and the heavily politicized segment in Shanghai with a woman named Xiang Pei (Sylvia Chang) keeping her knowledge and possession of this instrument a secret.""The Red Violin"" unfolds at a deliberate pace, taking over two hours to weave its tale. But it's pretty good entertainment for discerning viewers, especially those who appreciate classical music and instruments. The music score, which won an Oscar for its composer John Corigliano, is one very worthy component, with solo violin performed by Joshua Bell.The well-chosen international cast includes a number of familiar faces aside from Jackson: Jason Flemyng, Greta Scacchi, Colm Feore, Monique Mercure, Julian Richings, Sandra Oh, etc. Standouts include Ms. Chang as well as Jean-Luc Bideau as Georges Poussin, who attempts to mentor young Kaspar. Jacksons' role isn't really paid off until the later portions of the film.A co-production between Canada, the U.S., the U.K., Austria, and Italy, ""The Red Violin"" makes for an intelligent, literate bit of cinema.Seven out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"Mesmerizingly beautiful, incredible.","This movie is wonderfully executed. It would be a shame to know too much about this movie before watching it. Therefore I leave NO SPOILERS, they would only ruin the movie for you. I almost never feel a movie deserves a ten, but this is one of the few that do. The movie traverses several continents and spans almost four centuries. There are incredibly realistic settings and foreign languages that made me feel as though I were there. The sweeping cinematography and the music are absolutely amazing. The storyline is very moving and touches upon a host of emotions. A majority of the movie has foreign language, but you can activate the subtitles. I watched it first without the subtitles and was so taken by the movie, I watched it a second time with the titles and realized I had missed very little. The actions and facial expressions of the people do an excellent job of revealing their emotions. Trying to read the titles became distracting. I didn't need them so I turned them off. There were several instances where the hauntingly beautiful music gave me goosebumps. I certainly hope it touches you as deeply as it did me. As the movie progressed, I began to suspect the fortune teller was speaking not of the life of the expectant woman sitting before her, but of the violin. That point is not made clear until the final minutes of the movie. To tell you more would ruin the ending. When you learn how the violin acquired its captivating shade of red you will most likely be stunned at first, but then touched by the thought behind it and the bittersweetness of the moment.

The different people who come into contact with the instrument all have there own stories and you find yourself trying to guess how the Violin will affect them.

This movie should be in top 250,"I was disapointed when looking at the top 250 movies list to see titles such as Memento (ranked 10th) or Fight Club (ranked 36th) but not the Red Violin. I had found that movie to be just like music; harmonic, soft. A real delight to watch, a movie I saw 3 times and that I could see again. I think it deserves a spot in the best 250 movies of all time, certainly more than some other titles that lack the type of feelings Red Violin provided its audience.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

The journey of the Red Violin...,"""The Red Violin"" is a Drama - Mystery movie in which we watch the history of one of the most famous violins of the world, the Red Violin. The journey of that violin and the lives it changed.Since I had already watched the trailer, I have to admit that I did not have high expectations but I was happily surprised by it. I enjoyed very much the story of the violin, the characters and their story, and how everything changed from time to time. The direction which was made by FranÃ§ois Girard was simply amazing and he presented very well the main characters of the movie as well as the history of the red violin and its importance not only in the world of the music but its general importance. Finally, I have to say that ""The Red Violin"" is a great movie and I recommend everyone to watch it.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

Ambitious but insufficiently concerted,"Francois Girard's film 'The Red Violin' is nothing if not ambitious: an attempt to make a movie whose star is a musical instrument. Lavishly produced, it shows us a series of stories about the various individuals who own a special violin over the course of several hundred years. Unfortunately, the stories don't really come together to make a resonant whole; and the finale, centred on Samuel L. Jackson's character, is of little interest: there's no underlying reason why we should care about this individual's relationship to the famous fiddle. This is not an awful film; but it lacks the edge of magic needed to make the concept work.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
A most enchanting movie,"There are a few great films about artists like Camille Claudelle, Goya in Bordeaux and Tous Les Matins du Monde (All the Mornings of the World). But this is the only film I can recall about a piece of art, and the remarkable journey it takes, with many people through distant lands, over hundreds of years. With all of it fitting nicely into 2 hours of great cinema, drawn from a most exceptional story. Perhaps I should say stories - as there are many, and of course the stories are about people.I don't think a great cast necessarily means famous names, lengthy reputations, or even a lot of acting experience - but one that simply works well. Meaning actors (or acting ability) that fit the characters, with a flow of believability or at least the right feel. Some of the best movies I've ever seen have had several cast members that were never heard of before or after being seen in the one film I saw them in. Here everyone fits. From the child prodigy in Vienna to the instrument expert in Montreal (Samuel Jackson) - this film is well cast. Shot on location in at least 4 different countries, this is storytelling at it's best. One of my favorite films, it is one of the truest examples of what good movie making is all about. It also happens to have an inanimate object (a violin) as one of the stars of the show.Like so many of the rare occasions in your life when something happening seems like a dream come true, it would sound like a fairy tale if you told it. It's that way here. This is a real gem of a movie and a bit of a fairy tale, but it is one for grown ups . . . and a most delightful one at that.http://fullgrownministry.wordpress.com/2013/05/11/destiny/",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Campy,"Director Girard likes classical music and campy cinematic set-pieces. If you like either -- particularly the set-pieces: hoary, over-the-top grifts and costume dramas -- you'll probably enjoy this film. The sound won an Oscar, presumably for Joshua Bell's lovely, beautifully recorded playing of John Corigliano's derivative violin music; the compositions themselves aren't very interesting. The stories feature a 17th century tarot card reading, an orphanage run by monks high in the Austrian alps, an opium-stocked Edwardian lord whose fiddling makes Greta Schacchi swoon and her prose definitely purple, and one of those high-end auctions where folks call in on the phone and the auctioneer keeps saying ""Fair warning"" in a plummy English accent. It's a showy film, not arty or especially clever, but it's interesting enough for an evening at home.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Take the journey,"The Red Violin is the saga of spirit and soul as they press onward through time.  The adventure begins with Anna, a young woman whose only child brings about her untimely death.  A gift of a violin to be given to the babe becomes host to Anna's spirit.  The Red Violin narrowly escapes the grips of greed, ignorance, and vengeful lust as she is passed from hand to hand of those who would have her.  She wanders about the globe until at last she is exonerated by the one man who knows the truth that she holds within her wooden belly.In spite of the death and despair, the film is truly positive.  It teaches us to appreciate people from all walks of life.  From the violin maker of the 16th century who made the Red Violin for the bittersweet arrival of his baby son, we travel through time with the violin to the Chinese Communist Party who spelled out certain death to any instrument that may threaten the ideals of the collective.  In our travels, we learn the dark and sordid side to each person, but we also learn that to create a shadow there must be light.  That light, or hope, that the people shed is what gives the violin her vitality and will to survive.A truly magnificent film, The Red Violin inspired me to recollect my own past I shared with my aged upright piano; the certain spiritual vibrations I felt while playing a ragtime melody.  Suddenly, memories came rushing back to me tenfold.  I recalled the times as a young girl I would listen as my father played his rendition of Scott Joplin's Maple Leaf Rag.  Wiping a tear from my eye, I remembered how long ago that truly was; how my piano shaped and molded me, as I shaped and molded it.  I am left wondering where my beloved piano is now.  Who is influencing his instrumental life?  In the end, what stories will he have to tell, and will they be of meTake the journey of the Red Violin.  Visit other lands and other times. Feel the strings of life against your fingers; the bow of spirit in your palm.  Rest your chin against the weathered wood of wisdom.  Listen closely and hear the music that is the gentle rhythm of time and change.  See the film to learn about music; to learn about history; to learn the boundless raptures of the spirit.  Perhaps, as I, you will learn just a little more about yourself.",,Anonymous,Music
"Interesting, engaging and emotional drama","The rare Red Violin is up for auction in Montreal. Through a series of five different stories, dating from different periods of time, ranging from 1681 to the present, we see the history of the violin and how it touched the lives of many people.Great drama. The five stories are interesting in themselves, as independent tales. Quite engaging and emotional at times. The fact that the violin links all these stories together just makes it even more interesting.We also have the investigation into whether the violin is the real item. This makes for intriguing viewing as it is like a police investigation.Not perfect though. The ending feels a bit lacklustre: I was expecting something more profound but instead the writer and director went with a more mainsteam conclusion. In addition, Samuel L Jackson, action star, seems miscast as the violin appraiser. I guess he was there for the star power, to get audiences in the door. He is not terrible, but a decent dramatic actor would have done a much better job.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"What do you do when the thing you most wanted, so perfect, just comes?","A fascinating film that traces the history of a violin across 300 years from it's maker to some monks to a British aristocrat who likes to play the violin while he is having sex and a Chinese woman who risks her life to protect a violin from the martinets of the Cultural Revolution.In the process the violin is buried, shot at, and burned before it's secrets can be discovered by Samuel L. Jackson. He desires this instrument and we have to wonder whether or not he ends up with it.It is a remarkable story of perfection and greed amidst the hunger of the world.

Everyone should see this film!!,"When I look at the number of people who have voted on this film I realize that The Red Violin is greatly overlooked.  The fact of the matter is that The Red Violin is a brilliant film that only comes along once in a blue moon. The plot is flawless, and the cast is excellent.  There are not very many big names in the cast (with the exception of Samuel L. Jackson), but the performances are all top notch.  The fact that some of the film is in subtitles does not take away from it at all, it actually adds to the beauty of the heritage that is portrayed during the journey of the violin.I will not give away any of the plot in hopes that when reading this you will take my advise and see this film and judge it yourself.

A Centuries-Long Tale,"A perfect red-colored violin inspires passion, making its way through three centuries over several owners and countries, eventually ending up at an auction where it may find a new owner.I know precious little about violins or about Stradivarius and why his violins are considered the best in the world. But this story is told in such a way where you need to know nothing in order to appreciate that history. Everything is laid out here and in a much grander story arc than any real violin likely ever went through.Perhaps best of all was the casting of Samuel L. Jackson. He is the only real ""star"" in the cast, and his character is among the most complex. Though we go through several centuries and multiple countries, Jsckson's story really ties it all together -- like the moment in ""2001"" where the bone becomes the satellite, Jackson is the modern day counterpart to the violin's entire history.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
An enjoyable 7 rated movie.,"Like many highbrow movies that target a more mature and elderly crowd, I did find this one to drag a bit.However I did enjoy the concept of seeing the history of the red violin as it passes from owner to owner over a period of generations.I also found the stories and characters related to the violin to be mostly entertaining.A good 7 rated movie in my opinion. Not a masterpiece, but worth the rental price.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Very creative,"I thought this movie was excellent. I loved the idea of the woman's soul being connected to the violin over all that time, and how it brought out something different in each person it came in contact with. To the child, she was a mother he who comforted him at night couldn't bear to part with. To Pope, she was a woman he made ""sweet music"" with reminiscent of Pan and the nymph. To the Chinese woman, like an old friend to be protected at any cost, and to the appraiser, a love affair and pursuit like no other, even eclipsing his wife.The arc to the story is chronological and perfectly logical, making progression of the plot easily understood. The tarot cards not only make a nice sub story within the frame (as if the frame itself were not engaging enough), but provide helpful insight to the pending chapter when one knows the cards. The music is an added bonus, and the strains of it will haunt long after the celluloid stops running. The film is artful and tastefully done and is a must own, much less a must see.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
5 Rather Longish Short Films About a Violin,"A beautifully crafted and designed film which succeeds quite well despite its unnecessarily long two-and-a-half hour running time.The film charts the life of the mythical musical instrument of the title in five distinct segments: Its manufacture in Renaissance-era Italy; its initial life as a teaching instrument in a monastery; its possession by, and inspiration of a Victorian English composer; its clandestine life in a Chinese attic during the Cultural Revolution; and its sale at an up-market auction house in modern-day Montreal.Director Francois Girard and screenwriter Don McKellar haven't mastered the fragmentary style and structure as comprehensively as they did in their earlier 32 Short Films About Glenn Gould, but the superb cinematography, costumes and original score more than make up for that.In the ensemble cast, the best performances come from Samuel L Jackson as the instrument's present-day discoverer, Colm Feore as the Auctioneer, and Carlo Cecchi as the Violin Maker. Fans of Greta Scacchi be warned, however; although she appears naked again after a long period of on-screen modesty, she and Jason Flemyng (as lecherous composer Sir Frederick Pope) are wasted in the film's least successful segment",7.0,Anonymous,Music
A good concept gone wrong,"I was really looking forward to seeing this film, but was sorely disappointed when I finally saw it. I found the writing horribly trite, especially in the segment of the movie set in England. The dialogue between Pope and his lover was laughable.  In fact, my friend, an Englishwoman herself, did laugh.  Samuel L. Jackson capped off a poor movie with a poor performance in the final segment of the film.  Then again, maybe it wasn't his acting so much as poor writing.  I simply didn't care about him or his scheme.  The only redeeming aspect of the movie was the segment which centered around Kaspar Weiss.  The writing was much better in that segment, partly because Kaspar rarely talked. In the whole film, Kaspar was the only character I cared about.  If you're looking for a film that progresses through several separate stories, check out A Night on Earth.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Beautiful film,"I had never heard of this movie until I heard about it on the radio. I listen to classical music, and the staion was praising Joshua Bell (an ohio native) on his perfomance of the music. I was curious and saw it when it came on video. not only did i fall in love with the movie itself, but also the music. it was soothing, passionate, and brutal all at the same time. Many people I have talked to have said that Le Violon Rouge was just some crappy indie movie. However, the music is as beautiful as the plot. The storyline and the way it was presented in the form of different people who wanted the violin for different reasons was  not so much genius, but different and fitting.",,Anonymous,Music

Not My Cup of Tea,"""The Red Violin,"" almost like ""The Red Balloon,"" follows the life of a violin created in 1681 in Italy. It was hand crafted by a man named Nicolo Bussati (Carlo Cecchi) and it could be said to be the perfect violin. It was almost supernatural in its abilities to spell bind the listener when in the right hands. This movie was an anthology of sorts as the violin passed from hand to hand and country to country over the centuries. The violin, even as an inanimate object, played an active role in the lives of every person who touched it.It was hard for me to get into. For me the movie dragged and seemed longer than what it was. It didn't help that I'm not a violin aficionado nor do I have an affinity for the violin. The entire movie was one violin score after another.

"This film appears to be a film about a constellation of journeys, the central one being that of a unique violin.","Art is the substantiation of the psyche. Speaking as a painter and poet, and not as a movie-goer, this film is exquisite. My then nineteen-year-old son--while on summer break from college-- made me watch it with him. No, he was not a theatre or other arts major, but a football -player cum chemistry major on his way to medical school. Throughout our relationship he has given me unique gifts, and this was no exception. Not a little part of that gift was sharing it with him.This movie is the best that I have ever experienced. At various times other movies may have taught me, thrilled me, scared me, made me cry or intrigued me, but none has ever immersed me in their artistry as this one did. And still does. Not a little part of my son's gift was sharing it with him.The plot is simple. A violin of unique character passes through multiple talented hands as forecast by a tarot reader. But the plot is merely the ""stretcher"" for the ""canvas"" which is the story. And the story is ""painted"" with the visuals, acting, music, etc.The violin and the movie are metaphors for life. We are all unique and on a journey and we are all connected. This ""little"" gem is beautiful and momentous. To its critics: the making of work of art is not unilateral.

It takes only a few seconds to know that this gem did NOT emanate from the money grubbers in Hokeywood California as one more way to titillate teenagers with sex, violence, and computer generated special effects with a subliminal message that sells products.

The value of an item is increased in the events it endures, and the 'piece of history' the violin is had been through a lot.

A poor excuse for a film...,"This film goes wrong in so many ways. Main problems: 1) Lack of a small group of characters which the audience gets to know and care about. Instead we are given tiny snap-shots of a host of characters who appear, wander about the film for five or ten minutes, then disappear. 2) The one character who we see (in small bits and pieces) throughout the film is the art expert. He turns out to be a crook. We know nothing about his life. We know nothing about his past. He is just a temperamental jerk who lies to his employers and then steals from them. My emotional investment in his character was just about zero. Why should the audience care about him? What did he do that was in any way admirable or even interesting? 3) The director lavishes vast amounts of attention on the painting of the violin and at the end the pay-off for the audience is... revolting. I'm sorry but I did not feel at all uplifted or enlightened to find out why the Red Violin is red.A film just about the violin maker might have been interesting. A film just about the life of the orphan virtuoso might have been interesting.

"ambitious, beautifully crafted tale","""The Red Violin""  is a fine, beautifully crafted film that follows the life of a rare Italian violin as it bears witness to the lives of various unrelated people who come in contact with it throughout the centuries. Through these characters, we explore the universal human propensities for fear, passion, jealousy, love, greed, oppression and survival in even the most dire of circumstances. Like many anthology films, ""The Red Violin"" loses some of its emotional force through the fact that the characters, by their very nature, cannot be fully developed and therefore tend a bit toward ""type"".  However, each segment is so lovingly created in terms of setting, costume and cinematography, that the viewer is drawn into the many worlds the film creates. The most impressive part of the film is the brilliant overlapping time structure that is remarkably complex and creates a tremendous amount of excitement and tension in the last half hour of the film when all the elements from the various narrative skeins are pulled together to reveal the whole picture.  In fact, the last half hour, in which the violin is restored and the man in charge (played by Samuel L. Jackson) must confront a moral dilemma, lifts the film to a plane far higher than one expects it to go. The surprise ending is also very brave for trusting the audience to accept a morally ambiguous resolution. All in all, this is a mighty impressive achievement.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

A finely woven masterpiece,"I won't give you a plot summary.  You can get that anywhere.  But I will give you what the movie flows, feels, and captivates.  Well, from my perspective anyway.The Red Violin takes you through 3 main stories, with two more narratives that are used to tie them together.  The fortune teller tells the story of the Violin from the past, viewing the future through prediction.  At the same time the appraisers of today derive the past through scientific discovery.  The three central stories are very different from each other, and the switching between can seem abrupt.  But it's meant to.  The shock of Chinese story keeps the audience from getting complacent.Although others might have found the characters in each story not fleshed out enough, it is my opinion that they are supporting characters only. They are not the story, the Violin is.If you want to see Stevan Segal in a movie, don't see this one.  There is no great action.  There is no giant climax.  But the scenery and music is masterful.  The mood is haunting.  And the story is compelling.This movie is a good one to rent on a quiet evening when you can curl up and have no distractions.  The movie is one that you have to pay attention to in order to get the full effect.  But when it ends you can't bring yourself to turn on the lights again.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Admiration for an Amazing Film,"""The Red Violin"" could very well be the best movie that I have ever seen, and I almost missed my chance to see it!No film that I can recall has captivated me in such a way as ""The Red Violin"" did. The passion, beauty and mystery surrounding this movie make it a cinematic treat that I will remember for many years to come. The images flooding from the screen are so rich and diverse, showing how people so different from each other can be affected by the same passion making this a truly amazing movie to view. This movie has so much depth and substance to it which make it a movie that I will never tire of watching.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

The glorious music endures,"The Red Violin follows the history of a finely crafted violin from its creation in Cremona, Italy in the 17th century to its present day sale at a prestigious auction house in Montreal. The instrument survives centuries of use and abuse and changes the lives of every one it touches. Five years in the making, The Red Violin offers a great score, involving stories, a terrific ensemble cast, beautiful costumes, and outstanding cinematography. Directed by Quebec director Francois Girard (Thirty-two Short Films About Glenn Gould), the film was shot in five countries (Italy, Austria, England, China and Canada), spans five centuries, and uses six languages, one unspoken. The unspoken language of course is music, and we are treated to the sound of this beautiful instrument played by Joshua Bell performing an original piece, Chaconne for Violin and Orchestra, by John Corigliano.The film dramatizes five stories about the different owners of the instrument through a period of 400 years. Each seemingly unconnected tale is woven into a tapestry, a theme and variation, that is epic in scope and a sumptuous feast for the eyes and ears. The central symbol is the last violin made by the fictional Niccolo Bussotti finished with a red varnish partially consisting of the blood of his dead wife. The story is framed by Cesca (Anita Laurenzi) a Tarot card reader foretelling the future and a modern auction in Montreal in which Samuel L. Jackson plays Charles Morritz, an appraiser of antique instruments who is determined to keep the violin out of the hands of crass global investors. The film goes back and forth between Cremona and Montreal and each segment is linked by the Tarot readings.Rescued from an Austrian orphanage by arts benefactor Georges Poussin (Jean-Luc Bideau), the violin is first used by Kaspar Weiss (Christoph Koncz), a gifted child prodigy with a heart condition. It is then redeemed from a graveyard by a group of gypsies, travels to England where it becomes a tool of erotica in an over-the-top Victorian melodrama featuring violin virtuoso Frederick Pope (Jason Flemyng) and his lover Victoria (Greta Scacchi). After the instrument is sold at a pawnshop in Shanghai, China, it becomes an object of scorn by Communist cadres during the 1966-67 Cultural Revolution who see it as too European. Coming full circle, the violin ends its journey in the hands of Morritz (Jackson) in Canada who investigates its origins and recognizes its true value. Along the way, the violin is shot at, buried alive, used as a tool for political repression, valued only as a commodity, yet the glorious music remains, a testimony to the enduring power of art. Bravo!",,Anonymous,Music
History Through The Eyes Of A Violin,"In many respects this is a rather unusual movie. In fact, you could even say that it isn't a single movie - rather, it's several shorts combined together, with the single connecting thread being the red violin that we watch change hands over the course of a little over 300 years. Built in Italy in 1681, the stories follow the violin through France, Austria, England, Hong Kong, Communist China and finally to an auction house in Montreal, Canada where it's to be sold. The nature of the movie being what it is, some of the stories are stronger than others. The one that really stood out powerfully for me was the depiction of the Cultural Revolution in China.There's a somewhat effective mystery that also holds things together. In 1681, the violin maker's wife went to a fortune teller before she died in childbirth, and the movie makes clear that somehow her fortune is being fulfilled through the violin's travels. I had an advantage coming in, because I knew the basic story and so the explanation of the violin's connection to the woman came as no surprise, but to give credit to the writers, had I not known the story coming in I don't think there's any way I would have figured out the mystery.It's hard to rate the performances here. Again, the nature of the movie worked against being able to identify anyone as the ""star"" of the movie. The biggest name was probably Samuel L. Jackson, but he really didn't have a major part until the last half hour or so. I wasn't really keeping track, but if memory serves, the most screen time probably went to Colm Feore, but his role as the auctioneer didn't really stretch him.Overall, I'd characterize this as a movie that really didn't pull me in, but one with a few parts that I thought were very well done. In all honesty, though, I don't think I'd be tempted to watch it again. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Music

Smart Gripping Movie,"This movie is of a flashback to history ""genre"", but I think it is the first I have seen which runs on three time lines.  There is the pregnant woman at the beginning of the film having her fortune read one afternoon in the 1600's, there is the modern day SamJackson doing his violin consulting work over the span of a week, and then there are all times in all the years between.   The movie saunters among these three times, like moving between delicacies on your dinner plate, with a taste here taste there, etc.  I like how it was put together, and I like the passion running throughout the film. I had to give it a ""10"", and I hope you do too, since it is so much better than some of the films on the ""top 250"" list.  This deserves to be there.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Brings me back,"I watched this a very long time ago and I decided to watch this film again in 2021. I grew up playing the violin and I was never really good at it, but my father showed me this film in my adolescent years and I never really understood what was happening. Perhaps I was not that interested. Nowadays there are not too many films with a plot as immaculate as this one. One part of the film even reminded me of the stories my father would tell of his family living in the Chinese Cultural Revolution. I also never realised that the many of the actors in this film are now in many famous movies and TV shows. However, I don't think it is nostalgia that is making me write this simple review, but actually genuine enjoyment of this film.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

"Way to go, Canada!","While the vast majority of the world's films emerge from the United States, along with a handful from Italy, the U.K., France, and India, a country of only 30 million people, not well known for creating masterpieces in film, has come up with this jewel, ""The Red Violin"". Canada has generated scores of famous actors - Michael J. Fox, Jim Carrey, Donald Sutherland, William Shatner, John Candy, and Neve Campbell to name but a few, but Hollywood's empire of film production has drawn them all down south, while, ironically, so many US films are shot in Canada (especially Vancouver).In the past, Canada made the odd good, low budget film (""Who Has Seen the Wind"", ""The Grey Fox"") but in the past decade, its government has been setting more funds aside for the development of its entertainment and culture industry. The result has been the creation of about one very good film per year (""Decline of the American Empire"", ""Jesus of Montreal"", ""Black Robe"", ""Exotica"", and ""The Sweet Hereafter"" to name a few).Just as Canadian film-makers borrowed England's Helena Bonham Carter in making ""Margaret's Museum"", the latest Canadian creation - ""The Red Violin"" - features a well known US actor - Samuel L. Jackson. Perhaps ""we"" have done this as a drawing card to attract attention to great films that, because they are Canadian made, run the danger of passing unnoticed outside of the country.I glowed after watching this heart-galvanizing spectacle of beauty out of slight feelings of humble patriotism, seeing that my country really is capable of landing a winner in the movie making game. Everything is likable about ""The Red Violin"" - great acting, dialogue, production, cinematography, music (score), compelling characters, and interesting stories woven together into a work of art. And, just think, this was pulled off without Hollywood's gargantuan enterprise of talent, experience, and funding. WAY TO GO, EH!",,Anonymous,Music
Well made however repetitive and slow,Quite slow and a real effort to watch without a iota of humour. Beautifully shot and a good cast just to repetitive and slow paced. I found it hard to connect with any of the characters as well. The scene at the auction was shown to many times. Different eras and using different languages also didn't work for me. I felt it could've been great but just lacked something. Perhaps better scriptwriters may have helped. This movie felt really long and scenes where all over the place. The English character is miscast not likable or charming at all. Feel as though the movie is well reviewed by people jumping on a bandwagon.,3.0,Anonymous,Music

something for everyone,"The basically simple storyline of this film is given a fresh twist by dividing it into historical segments, and showing them intercut with contemporary shots at an auction house, where the full story is slowly revealed through scientific research, and with other shots of a fortune teller predicting the life of a young mother-to-be. What the mother does not know (and the fortune teller can't see in her cards) is that the fortune being told is actually that of a violin. How the mother's fortune got mixed up with that of a violin is revealed only at the end of the film.Samuel L. Jackson, always one for lingering facial shots that allow his remarkable ability to display subtile emotion to be fully utilized, turns in a fine performance that holds the film together, and also gives the film an extra kick as his character participates in a bit of premeditated subterfuge (how premeditated is also not apparent until the end) that gives another nice twist to the film and really helps to advance the character of the plot through the ending and beyond; the violin's story is obviously far from complete (here is where Hollywood will often screw up - they will take a film and staple the ending down so that the story has no life, but is rather obviously yet another project of an uninspired writer). Here we see that the contemporary portion of the plot is not an end but only another stage. Not profound perhaps, but compared to usual Hollywood garbage it seems profound.Throughout the film is fine music, in many styles, depicting the various persons who own the violin (kudos to Joshua Bell, the superb violinist who does all the playing where the red violin is concerned). How the violin affects them, and to a lesser degree, how they affect it, is the work of the great variety between episodes. And they are not all shaped by the same cookie cutter either. Each person is fascinating in their own right, and this would make a fine movie even without the violin (but how else to tie the episodes together so nicely?) And yet, each episode is represented in the contemporary scenes, as it is slowly revealed that the bulk of the bidders in the exclusive Montreal auction house are somehow related to the various historical characters, and wish to recapture the magic that they know once influenced their lives and fortunes.One more point; in most films where actors pretend to play instruments, it is painfully apparent that they are doing no such thing. My hat is off to the film makers for managing to portray various figures playing complicated music on the violin, in such a way that it is almost always totally convincing, and perfectly matches the sound track. Were the actors selected from expert violin players? Were special effects used? I don't know how, but it worked.This movie is a costume drama, a suspense film, a history lesson, has a great soundtrack, and no filmgoer should find themselves left out.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
what music!,"I echo all the above about the story and the directing, but would like to comment more specifically about the musical effort at the core of the film.This is a great achievement, and the first true ""musical"" I've seen in years that really works for me. The score is magnificent. Watching Altered States and this back to back reveals the tremendous range this composer is capable of delivering, and points to the fact that despite Corigliano's status as a legit composer, he really makes a great job of *scoring* this picture. Unlike Copland's Red Pony, or Thomson's ""The Plow that Broke The Plains"" (where it often seems the picture is there to serve the music rather than the right way around)this is the rare case where a great classical guy actually understands underscoring. Girard and Corigliano did an incredible spotting job. And as for the orchestrations and overall composition, the bar has been raised. Goldsmith and Williams and Horner have some serious competition from this fellow.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

Artistic junk!,"Don't confuse my comment with Hollywood junk, which is just pure trash that is entertaining only in fits. The Red Violin is artistic junk, meaning it is a movie that tries to be inspired and that isn't bad, but it isn't very entertaining at all.I caught The Red Violin on Bravo, home of all the ""artsy"" movies, not knowing what it was all about and not knowing that it was supposed to be a ""masterpiece"". I hate it when people toss about that term like it has no meaning because this movie is most definitely not that. A masterpiece implies a movie that not only has narrative finesse but narrative cohesion. The Red Violin is not even entertaining, so it definitely doesn't have the first. At first, I thought The Red Violin was a cool foreign film. But as the movie progressed, it became clear that it wasn't even that. The movie is all about one single solitary violin and what happens to it over the centuries. Sure there are groups of characters that pop up and tell their stories around the violin, but there is no single main character or even groups of main characters. The players don't stick around long enough, and in the end, it's all about the stupid violin. I don't know about the rest of you, but it's hard to care about a violin. The movie jumps about between the centuries so much like they're some kind of cool plot device, that I was uncertain what was going on. As such, it most definitely lacks narrative cohesion. As such, it most definitely is NOT a masterpiece.I don't know what most people saw in this movie. I guess it's one of those movies that everybody but me seems to think is one of the greatest movies of all time. I don't think it's even entertaining. It's not a bad movie, but it's got too many flaws, is just boring, and is just way too artsy and self-congratulatory for its own good. I like artistic foreign films. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.

As Perfect As It's Subject,"Everything about this movie works for me, from the beauty of the story itself to the artistry of the inter-woven subplots, beautiful imagery, music and cast selection. 'The Red Violin' is a remarkable epic history of a musical instrument binding both the past to the present as well as the spirits of the participants along the journey.The movies' mysteries are revealed slowly and poetically in a precisely authored meter spanning the violin's  birth, journey, and ""rebirth"". The violin's precise blending of art and mechanical perfection mocks both Cesca's bones and amulets as well as Morritz's ""mass spec"" and and organic evaluation's to stand apart as something indefinable which soars above and survives Prince's,  Cultural Revolutions, attempts to destroy it and finally - attempts to possess it. Morritz is the only one who understands, with true unselfish love, the tragedy and travesty of allowing the vilolin's nobility to be bartered like a slave on the platform into the clutches of auctioned greed.I recommend this movie to people of passion and lover's of beauty.

It does require the viewer's careful attention, to be sure; this is not a film for those who like to put their brains in neutral and watch the bullets bounce off Arnold Schwarzenegger.  It is really at least four or five separate stories (taking place in widely different locales) about things that happen to the Red Violin, any one of each, with just a little amplification, would have made a very satisfactory film by itself.Of course, despite the score's composer and one of the principal actors being American, the film is basically Canadian, and thus probably will not be seen much anywhere else.

Tainted Melody,"Corruption, fortune telling, lust, and revolution. Not exactly what is expected from a movie named The Red Violin (Le Violon Rouge).Writer/director Francois Girard's dark tale takes us on a journey following Nicolo Bussotti's masterpiece known only as ""the Red Violin"", named for its unique red varnish. The Italian violin maker's wife, Anna, is soon going to be giving birth. The mother, wanting to know the future of her baby calls upon a servant to tell its future with the help of her Tarot cards. When the mother and baby die, Bussotti is left with nothing but his unfinished work. The most perfect violin in the entire world.The violin makes its way around Europe into the hands of an orphanage where the children all learn to play the violin. One boy in particular, Kaspar Weiss, is considered a child prodigy. He is taken in by Georges Poussin who hopes to make him into the next Mozart. The journey of the violin does not end here. The violin travels across Europe once more and eventually ends up in China. What was meant to be a gift has become In present-day Montreal, the violin that was once going to be the prize possession of Bussotti's baby is now up for auction. Several violin connoisseurs and enthusiasts are present to witness the unveiling of the magnificent stringed instrument, including Charles Morritz (Samuel L. Jackson). A person from the violin's past is represented by family or organizations to claim it.It is rare to find a film with the main character being an inanimate object that travels so much. All of the characters are linked by this one instrument through one way or another. The violin's itself is steeped in mystery right until the very end of the film. Everywhere it goes there is one thing it carries with it: the ability to enchant, dazzle, and endanger those who come into contact with it.The film excels in all areas. The cinematography is extremely tasteful and compliments the Academy Award winning score with its flowing movements and well thought out shots. One scene in particular the violin changes hands several times yet it remains in the same part of the frame with each person. It almost appears that the world is revolving around the violin.The one part of the film that stands out has to be the story. The chopped up storytelling much like that of 21 Grams and Pulp Fiction (although not as chopped up and graphic) is incredibly hard to do. It can't be too hard to follow or too easy to figure out. Girard perfectly executes what it should be. The story is easy to follow but keeps you guessing the whole way through. Unlike some directors, Girard uses the languages of the countries that the violin travels through. Some would have had English all the way through. This story seems too real to be fiction.The Red Violin is an absolute joy to watch. It isn't one genre. There is mystery, crime, romance, drama, and scandal. The senses will be delighted with colors and sounds from all time periods and places. This is truly a great movie going experience.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

The Red Violin,"The Red Violin is an ambitious film that traces the journey throughout the centuries of a violin borne by tragedy.Famed master violin maker Nicolo Bussotti creates the violin in 1693 in Italy.

One of the best of '99!,"I just watched one of the best movies of '99.  It's called ""The Red Violin"".  It stars Samuel L. Jackson (in a very surprising and pleasant role change as a violin expert)  and Greta Scacci (Presumed Innocent).  This movie is like ""Shine"" on steroids meets ""In The Name Of The Rose"" meets ""Elizabeth"".  It does a bob and weave like Ali against Foreman.  It's definitely a heavyweight fight before Don King.  The story takes you on a journey in the lives of the people around the Red Violin from 1681 to present day.  The Red Violin has a secret that isn't revealed until Jackson's character arrives.  The ending almost rivals ""The Sixth Sense"". This is two thumbs way up.  Ebert agrees. I didn't know it was going to be this good.  Everything was out at Video Central, so it was only by chance that I saw and rented it.I learned several things from this movie: 1) Gypsies are the true scum of the Earth. 2) Greta Scacci always plays a scorned lover. 3) Samuel L.

The curious power of violins,"It's amazing how easy it is to care for musical instruments.  It's not giving much away to say that the red violin is imperilled more than once; and I was sitting in my seat, mentally screaming to the director: ""Kill off some of the characters if you want, maim and injure them, but for God's sake, don't hurt the violin!""  I don't think I could stand to watch even an ordinary violin damaged.  As for a surpassingly beautiful and sonorous violin, centuries old and perhaps with centuries yet to live ... well, it's no stretch at all to say that such an instrument would be more important than most of us, certainly more important than I.  So why shouldn't it be a central character?  Fictional characters simply have to (a) have things happen to them, and (b) make us care what happens to them.  They needn't do anything else.This is an amazing film.  The violin ""comes to life"", so to speak, in five different eras (and countries), and every one of them is perfectly realised - it's a joy just to watch the temporal scenery.  (Perhaps the third of the five eras, early Edwardian England, is a little harder to swallow than the rest, with its aristocratic violinist who extemporises great music while having sex.  Really!  As if the resulting compositions would have the slightest value.)  It's interesting that the evocation of time and place is NOT accomplished by musical means.  Almost all the music we hear was composed by John Corigliano, and he makes his music as hard to pin down to any one age as he can.  This was an excellent idea.  It gives the violin a character, and makes it seem more powerful than any of the forces temporarily besetting it.  It also suits the story in a way I'm not at liberty to reveal.Although it's easy to be absorbed in ""The Red Violin"", be warned that the human interest in each of the five eras is subservient to the violin interest.  If you are one of those people who can't easily care about a musical instrument much of the film will be lost on you.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Did not rise to its potential,"I enjoyed historical movies and in general find the life of a priceless antique worth reading about (or watching). I find it amazing that we can know every owner for example of a specific pearl going back several centuries, but most folks know about their own families usually just two generations back. So I thought this movie would be one I would enjoy. I also expected to hear some beautiful violin music. Wrong on both counts. The violin's history seemed too manufactured for the film's sake, not a real logical progression from one owner to another. Some of the major changes of ownership were left to the viewer's imagination and at least in my own case, I was unable to make the leap. The change did not make sense. How did the violin get to be owned by gypsies? How did it get to China? It would have made an interesting story, but where the manufactured history is stretched way beyond anything credible, the change of ownership is simply not explained. While I liked the overall concept of following the life of an object, the music, which I expected to be a major part of this film, was beyond disappointing. I don't play the violin but I can certainly appreciate beautiful music. There was very little ""music"" per se in this music. The only time anything that could be called ""music"" was played was some Chinese children's performance and it was made by accordions. The only sounds we heard coming from this supposedly incredibly valuable violin was the endless screeching, and this in spite of the fact that its journey took us through times when some of the most heavenly music on earth had been composed. Not one piece from Mozart, or resembling Mozart's style, had been offered. Just screeching. No music of any of the music's great composers was played at any time. More screeching. The sounds this violin made could have been compared to a cat scratching on a metal roof. That bad. Wonder how many CDs with the soundtrack they managed to sell. That would tell them just how ""wonderful"" the soundtrack was. The soundtrack was thoroughly modern, something that may be considered all the rage today. The music was probably difficult to play, but there is no sugarcoating it - the music is nothing but screeching. No melody, no rhythm, no emotion. No sweet sounds that leave a person in awe of beauty of sound. So no music, just noise. The ending climax likewise is not really any surprise like it is supposed to be, and most certainly not a shocking surprise, because I thought ""the secret"" was already implied in the beginning and so it didn't seem like any kind of surprise, at least not to me. If you can stand the noise that passes for a soundtrack, this is not a bad film. It's different. It's not very entertaining, but just the fact that it doesn't follow the standard mold makes it interesting. Best film ever made (as some of the reviews here indicate)? Most definitely not. I am writing this in 2013 (saw the film for the first time yesterday) and the film is all but forgotten today, 15 years after it was made. I happened to pick up an old VHS tape in a second hand store. Otherwise, it's forgotten.",3.0,Anonymous,Music

The Red Violin - A Masterpiece of Music and Intrique,"The film score of this movie is unforgettable, as is the storyline. It is one of one of my favorite fims of all time. This was the best thing that Francois Girard ever did as a director, and the best role Samuel Jackson ever had as an actor; and he does not drop the ball. He gives a sterling, intelligent performance. This film will not please everyone; it is for intelligent music lovers, and people who appreciate great content within a film. How many films can you name that include stark scenes from the Cultural Revolution in China during the late sixties? Very few I am sure. Those scenes are the among the most unforgettable in the movie. The powerful scenes of avoiding the destruction of the ignorant masses of the Cultural Revolution are highly dramatic. How the violin survived was truly a miracle. The final scenes, which I will not reveal, are also expertly directed and executed, hence, you have a perfect film.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
music to my ears and eyes,"""Le violon rouge"" (called ""The Red Violin"" in English) uses a masterful violin as a conduit to show various parts of history - such as Renaissance-era Italy, 19th-century England, and the Cultural Revolution in China - right up to a 20th-century auction in Montreal. It's beyond amazing how they do the movie and look at the numerous historical events (maybe the scene in China won't make your skin crawl, but it's not a pretty sight).This is definitely the sort of film that would make anyone revere musical instruments. And among other things, it shows that Samuel L. Jackson can do more than play bad mother****ers in movies. A most impressive piece of cinema.

Past Present Future,"From the directing to the cinematography to the acting, the movie has achieved the effect of bringing the viewer into the intimate world of what was portrayed in each context. It also informs the viewer of the social conditions in each of the periods. I can feel the mood, the agony, the little joys of characters as if they were true. I cannot emphasize enough how much I appreciate the efforts in concerting the entire events of editing and art direction to simple details like the prop design to mirror the events following. It was simply elusive and helps add character to the movie as a whole. Throughout the oeuvre, it was inspirational to the soul to help make believe that true love and passion for one's loved ones, possessions could be so deep and extreme for the better. It was like watching an old record being broken at the Olympic games through one's pure suffering during a training process. The events portrayed though nothing ordinary has been extremely human. We see so many things at a time but we can identify and linked together with all. The past is history, the future is unknown, appreciate my family now ;0)",10.0,Anonymous,Music

The perfect film about the perfect violin,"A prized red violin is passed from owner to owner for 300 years before ending up at an auction house in Montreal. We witness its journey, from its creation in 17th century Italy, through an 18th century Austrian monastery to the possession of a violinist in 19th century Oxford, then to China during the Cultural Revolution and back to Montreal, where a collector (Samuel L Jackson) tries to establish its identity. Director FranÃÂ§oise Girard (32 Short Films About Glenn Gould) enjoys working with unconventional dramatic structure, and this episodic offering is no exception.The narrative flutters effortlessly between a modern-day auction hall and three different centuries. The cast is rich and diverse, in particular Jackson's turn as the contemporary violin expert at the Montreal auction. The Red Violin is a little long, but such a minor flaw is easily forgivable, and the accompaniment of soaring violin music is magnificent.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Art in film as an endangered species,"Watching ""The Red Violin"", its story unfold in splendid craftsmanship is much like watching the Italian violin-making master sculpt the perfect instrument for his unborn son.

Magnificent!,"""The Red Violin"" is a great film that shows the travels and exploits of a ""Red Violin"" that was made during the 16th century, I believe.  The story shows how the violin gets passed from one owner to another.  The violin is, at first, constructed by a violin craftsman and then is given to a monastary, some gypsies, a wealthy British violinist, an owner in China and finally at a present day Montreal auction.  What I found amazing about this film is how each of stories come together seemlessly by the end of the movie.  That is typical of most ""Canadian"" movies and I think that formula is great.  I also liked how the Talot card reader's predictions match the events of the film.  It gives the story a sense of spirtuality.Being a violin/viola player myself, I highly enjoyed this film cause I could relate to why the owners of the Red Violin were so intrigued by the little instrument.    This is a movie that I would recommend to anyone.  It also has a very nice soundtrack.",,Anonymous,Music
"Engrossing story, good acting","I enjoyed this movie a lot.

Excellent film about the power of music,"Francois Girard does it again.  Like his last film, 32 SHORT FILMS ABOUT GLENN GOULD, this explores the power of music (and though the subject here is classical music, it applies to all music), in a non-conventional, yet compelling way.  The ""red violin"" is not the overwrought symbol it might have become in lesser hands, but the expression of how moved we are by music in so many ways.  The way it's tied up to fate, passion, and, ultimately, life, is also well done without being pretentious.  It's appropriate that the violin is used, for it's one of the most basic of instruments.  The way Girard weaves in and out of flashbacks is also well done.  Finally, the performances are all good, particularly Jackson as the collector.  I even liked McKellar in his small role, for while he's a good writer, I'm not a fan of his acting.  All in all, superb.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

Never were words and music so Powerful,"Never were words and music combined so beautifully and powerful.  ""The Red Violin"" is about a legend that takes you through time.Its story begins when the violin is made by a violin maker, as it gradually travels around the world for centuries till the present.  Each individual who becomes emotionally and musically involved with this violin, tells a story that captures the heart of the audience.  I mean really captures the heart; it moves it, destroys it, and provokes it.The violin represents that one perfection that everyone strives for.  The conflict is what do you do with it once you have it and how does this perfection effect you.There are some things in this world that are priceless that just can't be explained unless you've experienced it.  ""The Red Violin"" is exactly that. This movie makes your emotions and mind think; unlike many movies that do the thinking for you.  It makes you want to value things more and it shows you utter Beauty.  If there was anything more than beauty, this movie would be it.It makes you wonder why Titanic got best picture.

"A musical feast for the eyes, ears and heart.","Years ago there was a type of film which followed a particular item through the years as it passed from owner to owner (""The Yellow Rolls Royce""). Francois Girard has directed and written (with Don McKellar) a beautiful drama detailing the life of a red violin from its manufacture in the late 17th century through its sale at an auction in the present.Samuel L. Jackson portrays Charles Morritz, an antique violin authenticator. This auction is the framing device for the rest of the film. The tale flashes back to the tale of Nicolo Bussotti, a fictional violin maker. He is planning to give it to his unborn child. His pregnant wife (Irene Grazioli) goes to an old woman fortune teller who proceeds to relate some of the future of the Bussotis and other owners of the instrument.The violin continues on through the years coming into the possession of an orphan (Christoph Koncz). It then is owned by a virtuoso soloist (Jason Flemyng) who gets his inspiration by playing it during love-making with the lovely Greta Scacchi. The instrument passes across the ocean to China where Xiang Pei (Sylvia Chang) is caught in the middle of the cultural revolution. Finally, as a valuable antique, it is brought up for auction in the film's final sequence.This cursory summary cannot do justice to the lush beauty of this film. Joshua Bell plays the violin on the soundtrack to a fine score by John Corigliano (CD on Sony Classical). At an early screening Bell explain that the children in the orphanage are actually violinists. Bell's hands are also shown in other scenes as the instrument is played. The movie cost only $9 million but the production has an epic feel to it. McKellar explained that this is accomplished by lavishing the expense on one elaborate scene in each vignette. It definitely works.Girard has fashioned a wonderful story that probably should have been saved for the fall season. It has award winner written all over it. Especially in the areas of costumes, scenic design and music. It's a feast for the eyes and ears.",,Anonymous,Music

It is all tied together leading you from one century to the next, then back again. Surprisingly the unknown actors in the film were wonderful, while the ""stars"" left something to be desired.  That aside, I eagerly agreed to see it a second time with a friend, and really got even more out of it.  It is written well, and is a first (for me!) in it's multilingual script.

The makers of `The Red Violin' could have achieved this as well, but they were not interested in people, they were interested in a musical instrument.

With great acting and beautiful music score, this film should have had a massive distribution, over here in England I was told it was in cinemas for only a week or so.Unfortunately, I believe that this is one of those films that I can only watch once or at least watch it again after a very long time.

The best film so far this year,A whole film about the history of a violin! How can this possibly make for riveting cinema? But it does. There is not one particular story or performance (apart from the music itself) that really stands out.

Not Your Typical Samuel L. Jackson movie.,"The Red Violin, or Le Violon Rouge, was not the typical movie you would expect from Samuel L. Jackson. It centers around, you guessed it, a red violin. A perfect, red violin which was the last made by legendary violin maker, Nicolo Bussotti (Carlo Cecchi).This movie seems to take place in a somewhat parallel way in the past, with Nicolo's pregnant wife, Anna (Irene Grazioli), and in the present, during an auction for the illustrious violin. Anna is having her cards read by a tarot card reader in between each scene involving the new whereabouts of the violin.It circulates between a child prodigy in Vienna, a music lover in communist China where the violin is an illegal western instrument, a great concerto player who uses the music to seduce women and finally, to Montreal, where the auction is taking place.In between each scene, you learn a little bit more about the violin and it's origin and the fate of the Bussotti family, including why it is red. Also, with each story, you see why certain people participating in the auction are interested in said violin.Charles Morritz (Samuel L. Jackson) does not even really appear, other than a few quick flashes, until the very end. It is then when we understand what Morritz is doing there and the ultimate fate of the violin, at least for the time being.This was a good movie although a bit overrated in my opinion, it was still worth a watch. You have to be in the mood for this type of movie, as it is filled with sub-titles and is, ultimately, a foreign movie. Although I like foreign movies, there are times when I am just not in the mood. With that said, The Red Violin was a pretty good movie and if you know what you are getting into, it can be an enjoyable experience. 7/10",,Anonymous,Music
An amazing multicultural film,"Francois Girard's 1998 film, 'Le Violon Rouge' (The Red Violin) is the tale of a violin that is up for auction with a Sotheby's-like company. As the bidding proceeds, we see the birth of the violin, created in 17th century Italy by Nicolo Bussotti for his son, and it's three century journey to where it is now housed, in France. Between the 17th and 20th centuries, the violin is used for a century in an Austrian monastery, buried for years in a grave, travels Europe with gypsies, becomes the prized violin of an English virtuoso, and finally, the personification of intolerance and loss during the Cultural Revolution in 1950's China before landing on the auction block in France. The film becomes compelling when, after a segment of the violin's history is revealed, we return to present day and see someone associated with that portion of history present at the auction, and bidding on the cherished item. The red violin ties all of the stories together, and it is Charles Morritz (Samuel L. Jackson), a consultant for the auction house who discovers it's secret.There is so much to appreciate about 'The Red Violin'. There are scenes that look like they were blocked in order to look like paintings of the Renaissance and Flemish era. I expected to see Pieter Brueghel off to the side at times, painting a perfect scene. All of the stories with one exception are intriguing, emotional and somewhat enlightening, particularly the scene set in China. The only segment I wasn't crazy about, though it was definitely necessary to the advancement of the story, was about the English virtuoso Frederick Pope (Jason Flemyng) and his lover Victoria Byrd (Greta Scacchi). It just didn't do a lot for me, though it certainly wasn't horrible by any means. The score, with solos by Joshua Bell is absolutely beautiful. The most impressive thing to me, however, is probably something that isn't a big deal or noticeable to most. While the story, cinematography and acting were quite good, I was most impressed by the fact that writers Girard and Don McKellar (who also acts in the film) did not dumb down the presentation, but rather allowed each story to be told in their native languages. Considering what we have learned from the last century of films, that we are to expect that it is natural that everyone, regardless of country or origin speaks flawless English, even in their own native countries, it is like a breath of fresh air to see something a bit more 'real'.If you have seen this film and enjoyed it, I would also recommend seeking out Julien Duvivier's 1942 film 'Tales of Manhattan'. It may be hard to find because it's kind of a buried classic, but it is the same kind of concept, only in this case it follows around a tuxedo jacket. It has always been one of my favorite classic films, and was actually the first thing I thought of in terms of comparison after seeing 'The Red Violin' for the first time. The story concept of 'The Red Violin' is compelling and intelligent and the presentation is beautiful Â I highly recommend it to anyone who appreciates a good story with his or her aesthetic.--Shelly",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Lust in music,"This movie can really be summarized as a commentary on how lust can have disastrous effects on it's ""victims"". The violin is a symbol - it could just as easily be a woman, and how she brought out the worst in people; however, because we are dealing with an inanimate object, we have the luxury of following it through many lifetimes.When I first read reviews on this movie, I was worried that the ""jumping around"" in time that takes place would detract from my enjoyment. I must say that the ""jumping around"" is an essential device in this case, each part of the story making more sense as you see other parts.Expertly filmed, and one of the rare music movies, where it really appeared as if the actors were actually playing the instrument.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

Perfect! Divine! Real Art.,"I finally see one real movie this summer.  I mean, a real movie, a production of Cinematic Art, not some box-office addict.One thing I love the most about this film is that it did not rely too heavily on music, as most of the movies about music did.  This one is simply the storytelling, a story about the divine instrument and the passion, time, love, hate, and people.  It's always amazed me the most not the Art itself, but the stories behind. I must confess, after finishing the movie, I walked out of the theatre with the great sense of regret of my giving up playing piano all those years ago. I hate the music then, because I couldn't understand why I should routinely spend one hour a day to play the piano and listened to the teacher scream at me.  Later I heard about some professional piano players practice 7,8,9 hours a day and found it unbelievable.  I understand now. It's that perfection and passion we should be looking for.

The ending, which revealed the secret power of the aforementioned instrument, was simply irrelevant after the loooong history was disclosed.The historical perspectives of different eras and locations in the world was mildly interesting but dragged on too far.And I even regret to say this, as I am a DEVOTED Samuel Jackson fan, but this movie was so slow and uninspiring that even his performance was entirely lackluster and disappointing.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
A bold attempt falls short,"I enjoyed the multiple storylines and the way the text interweaves them into the final suspenseful scene of the auction.  Most of the film is beautiful and interesting, but it disintegrates when the American actors and English lines take center stage.  The spoken text is awkward and stilted.  As a result, Samuel L. Jackson is wooden and doesn't seem to have any reason for stealing the violin.  He looks neither in love, nor obsessed with an object he supposedly pursued his whole career.  At times he has sudden outburst as if the actor suddenly remembered he was supposed to be at the end of his wits.  At other times you can almost hear him saying: ""I can't believe I'm even saying these lines, somebody please rescue me from this film.""  I could have easily believed Jackson in this role, but the dialogue and his mistrust for it makes it impossible.  Rent the video, and stop the film before he and his even more wooden co-star start saying things like (paraphrasing for effect): ""You don't have children?""  ""No, but I know what you mean.  I just want to take this violin apart.""  Or: ""It's like it's this thing . . ."" Also, equally unbelievable is when the violin maker rushes in to see the body of his dead wife, sending everyone, including the nurse holding the dead baby, out of the room.  This man was making the perfect violin for this child he wanted so badly, but is completely uninterested in him when his body is presented to him.",,Anonymous,Music
Worth seeing again!,"I've been surprised by the numerous negative reviews I've seen of this film, which was spellbinding.  It was not flawless--what is?--but it is wonderfully engaging in addition to having gorgeous music and beautiful cinematography. There are so many films I won't even bother to see, on the grounds they aren't worth $7, and I'd rather wait for the video!  This is one I am eager to see again, to further appreciate the nuances of the violin's travels.

Music and science in perfection,I was intruigued by the title of the movie and I am glad that they waited til near the end to reveal why it was red. I liked how the movie wove together the tarot readings and the different owners of the red violin and I also liked how it was all again brought together at the auction.  I don't mind reading subtitles- that made the parts of the movie that were in Germany and China and Italy more authentic.  The music was very good and the story that most touched me was that of Kaspar Weiss the little boy with so much talent and such a weak body.  A very good film- I also enjoyed the directors other work abou Gould- he has a knack for typing music and stories together.,8.0,Anonymous,Music
"An Oscar winning Score,  to be had by all that can appreciate such.","I haven't seen this film in a few years, yet I often think of it. I recommend this beautiful film to anyone that likes a truly wonderful story. This is one of the least known movies that the great Samuel L. Jackson has done, and although his part is minor, he binds all the individual stories into one. Who knew a movie about only one constant (the violin) could be so touching/heart wrenching all in the same movie. I don't recommend this to everyone, but to those willing to think about the different cultures and how we all can be united by something as beautiful as music. Now I am not a huge fan of the violin sound particularly, (Yo Yo Ma notwithstanding, he's brilliant!) but I think anyone that has a basic understanding of musical instruments will realize and listen to the beautiful sounds that come out of this truly original piece of string family. Now if you like a lot of what is considered music these days, (Britney Spears for example) don't bother with this film because it will go right over your head. I would say when they get to some of the Oscar Winning original score, (It won in 2000) close your eyes to really listen to music. Now I'm a huge movie buff, and I am the last person to close my eyes during a movie, but when you watch this a 2nd, 3rd, 4th time, give it a try. Prepare for one of most amazing sounds ever to come out of this rarely heard of gem of a film.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Interesting... to say the least...,"Hmmm... Let's watch ""The Red Violin"" -  the movie that came out of nowhere and won the Best Score Oscar a couple of years ago.OK - typical story of an object through the years... but wait... it's told in a unique fashion - with clips of various timeframes - now and then - sort of like The English Patient - and it works.This movie is much better than I thought - held my interest - each of the stories is interesting, and tied together nicely by the tarot card reader. The music, of course, is outstanding.Why didn't this movie get a wider distribution? Why did it surprise me at the Oscars when it won Best Score? Why had I never heard of it until then?

An exquisitely crafted movie about an exquisitely crafted violin,"""The Red Violin"" traces the history of the fabulous Red Violin, crafted by the great (fictitious) craftsman Nicolo Bussotti, from its birth in seventeenth century Italy to a present day auction in Montreal. More than a simple collection of stories told one after the other, ""The Red Violin"" is made up of five threads that are sometimes parallel but more often tangled. The movie jumps from thread to thread, sometimes showing us new pieces of the violin's history, sometimes returning to events we have already seen but revealing just a little bit more. It reminds me a bit of Tanith Lee's ""The Book of the Damned."" Both are made up of several different short stories that are largely unrelated save for the connection of a single mystical object and its effects on those who possess it.I enjoyed ""The Red Violin"" immensely as a whole, though some of the threads are better than others. I especially like the Frederick Pope thread. It is witty, sexy, and quite fresh. The auction thread could have been better, but it did succeed at filling its place as an integral piece of the overall puzzle. Although each of the threads would stand reasonably well on its own, the strength of ""The Red Violin"" lies in the brilliance with which the threads are woven together. The jumps from thread to thread are not at all disorienting. The tapestry they weave is consistent and satisfying. All of the threads come together to tell a wonderful story that was far greater than the sum of its parts.Be forewarned that ""The Red Violin"" is a bit slow. That being said, it is an exquisite movie. I highly recommend it.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

a film to be remembered,"I can not say enough good things about this movie masterpiece. Like the film ""The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc"", ""The Red Violin"" contains the rare mixture of drama, music, mystery/suspense, a great cast all the way around, good attention to detail, a good ending, and a cohesive tale that tells a story over a lengthy period of time.The different time epochs and cultures displayed in the movie were all done with quality, and I enjoyed the different languages (English, Italian, French, German, Chinese) and subtitles during the course of this film (I speak some of all of these tongues except Chinese).An appreciation of violin music also developed in me as the movie continued, as well as that of violin players and the history of the instrument. I even am considering giving the instrument a go at it.As some of the viewers have commented, I also am appalled that ""The Red Violin"" did not receive an Oscar nomination for best picture/best producer/best director. This film is truly a masterpiece that should linger in the memories of any appreciative person lucky enough to discover this under-publicized film. What a tremendous oversight by whoever claims to recognize works of art at the Academy.9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
The best film I have seen this year,"""The Red Violin"" is the most beautiful, haunting, best-directed and best-photographed film I have seen this year, and I say that AFTER having seen ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"", ""Life is Beautiful"",and ""Shakespeare In Love"", all of which perhaps equal it, but do not surpass it. I have just bought Leonard Maltin's ""Movie and Video Guide 2000"",and am horrified by the fact that he gives it only two stars! I usually agree with him, but in films relating to classical music, he is usually WAY off-base----witness his 2 and 1/2 stars for ""Amadeus"", 2 stars for the 1984 ""Carmen"", and 3 and 1/2 for the film of Verdi's ""Otello""!""The Red Violin"" is the poetic story of a legendary violin, the greatest musical instrument ever made, designed under mysterious circumstances during the Renaissance in Italy. (The circumstances are revealed fully ONLY near the end of the movie, so if you do not wish to know the solution to the ""mystery"", be careful which review you read.) The framing story of the film is the present day auction in Montreal at which the violin is scheduled to be sold. We are gradually taken, in flashbacks, through the story of the violin and all of its owners, in four different countries and five different languages----Italian, German, English, Chinese,and French.(yes, there are subtitles, but this film is so good that who cares?) The storytelling is absolutely mesmerizing--each twenty minute episode is seamlessly interlocked with the auction and linked by beautiful shots of the sea rolling. The acting is excellent, especially in the German episode featuring little Christoph Koncz as a hard-driven child prodigy and Jean-Luc Bideau as his well-meaning but misguided stepfather and tutor.Greta Scacchi and Jason Flemyng, in the nineteenth-century British episode, are like lovers out of a Harlequin novel, but I have a feeling that this episode MUST have been done tongue-in-cheek; it is just too over-the-top compared with the dignity shown in every other episode. Samuel L. Jackson, in the framing segment, demonstrates incredible subtlety as an actor---watch his eyes as he listens for the first time to the red violin as it is played. The costumes, sets,and photography are ravishing--and most significant of all, there is John Corgliano's music--perhaps the finest musical score written for a film in more than twenty-five years, and no,I'm not forgetting John Williams' score for ""Schindler's List"", though THAT one comes the closest, and violinist Joshua Bell does the ""Red Violin"" score full justice.Don't even think of passing this one up.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Pure Passion,"How can music have the power to stir one's soul?  Perhaps it lies not in the music itself, but within all that the music comes with- the history of it. Its past, all the different hands that have gone into shaping it, the work of the individual that creates that music at that moment.  Music is the most delicate of the arts, for once created, it can never be re-created identically.  And each moment is fleeing, dynamic, related to the moment before and the moment that follows.This movie follows the path of a violin, as it exchanges hands over centuries, touches lives, brings passion and pain.  The theme of the movie, first hummed by the violin-maker's wife, becomes the voice of the violin, linking the human soul with that of the violin.  I wouldn't go so far as to say that her soul inhabited the violin, as other reviews here have. However, I think the movie tries to show how everything that has occured in the life of this violin has affected and shaped it, made it into the perfect musical instrument it is.I was especially impressed by the performance of the little boy in vienna. He is actually playing the violin- amazing!!! And the soundtrack, of course, is incredible.  Joshua Bell is God.Above all, this movie is about passion.  Feelings are not just intangible wisps of nothingness that vanish as soon as they are created.  They remain in the vessels that create them, and in the vessels that are affected by them.  In this case, all the passion that surrounded this violin became a part of it.  When one person played it, the music brought back the memories of all those who had played it before.The story is slower than most movies today, yes.  But why let that dissuade you?  Why go see a movie if you aren't willing to let it take you in, absorb you, and free you from the time contraints of everyday life?  The movie is made to be watched, not as an accompaniment to popcorn.  Let the story be spun around you, and take things in as they come.  Trust in the storyteller to unfold the events fully and satisfactorily.  You have all the time in the world to watch this movie.Finally, let the music itself envelop you.  Feel the sweep of the phrases and the rich fullness in the violin's voice.  Enjoy the lopsided, fun, gypsy's theme (my personal favorite), the firey passion of pope' theme, the frenzied desperateness that comes with the little boy in vienna.  Take in the despair that was the cultural revolution in China, where anna's theme, full of longing and sadness, comes to its prime.Anna knows she is going to die, hence her melancholy humming.  The violin became her child, her last creation, and her voice. See this movie, and let it take you in.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

Nicely Crafted,"Every man wants the Red Violin.  Why?  Well, the reason why is the big mystery revealed in the final scenes of this very clever piece of work. Spanning three continents and several centuries, the film has the look of a lavish production but somehow was made on a small ten million dollar budget.I liked it a lot.  There must be a half dozen stories crammed into this epic, all very well told, some sexy but mostly tragic. The script is merciless on the very engaging characters and it seems to have a slightly wry, almost cruel sense of humor as they are put through their travails. I admired the beautiful, stylish photography and inventive direction that makes the imagery stick with you -- especially one hypnotic montage spanning generations while gypsies play the violin as it somehow appears to be suspended, immobile in the frame.But the real story is the adventure of this violin.  Men fall in love with it, it is buried and resurrected by gypsy grave robbers. It becomes a pawn in the Chinese Cultural Revolution and is nearly incinerated.What really stands out though is the brilliant way multiple timelines are interleaved, overlapped, flashed forward and back rhythmically but without any confusion.  Some say there are three timelines, I counted five.As you watch, you see odd occurrences -- like a woman who discovers her lover cheating.  She finds a gun and shoots -- not him or his companion but the violin.  The big supernatural revelation at the end makes all those puzzling scenes suddenly make sense.  But the end also tends to reduce the whole story to a macabre and naughty little joke that just makes you smile.And the ending, as startling as it is, is the problem.  The movie outdoes the message. When people see a movie that looks this grand, they leave with an empty feeling if they are not treated to profound statements about life and the human condition.  But that is not what the Red Violin is about. True, it has a lot of good drama but it is not a morality play at all. Don't look for heroes (there is a heroine -- but that would be telling).If anything, and even this may be a stretch, it is about lust, the coveting of a finely-crafted thing of beauty.  But that is what the Red Violin is -- an intricately cut jewel of a film. Expect no more than that.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Exquisite,"That's the word to describe this film.Incredibly ambitious, this movie follows a violin through the centuries, up to modern day Montreal, where its going to be sold at an auction.This movie could easily have fallen apart.  IT might have been too ambitious, or badly structured.  Instead, we're given an elegant film, that moves backward and forward through time seamlessly.  At the auction, there are five people who want the violin, and each have their reasons.  Set in Montreal, Oxford, Vienna, Shanghai, and Italy, this story is universal in it's appeal.At the core of this film, other than the violin, is it's performances. Jason Flemyng and Greta Scacchi make a very sensual pair.  Yet my favourite performance comes from Christoph Koncz, as Kaspar Weiss.The music solos, by Joshua Bell, are nothing less than remarkable, and this film ranks as one of the best of the year.",,Anonymous,Music

The story line was persistent and though flashbacks were used, there was a purpose behind all of them which kept the story line moving forward. It would have been very easy to overdo each and every episode, but there was a control present by the writers, director and actors that never permitted this to happen.

Breathtaking and engrossing,"This is one of my favorite movies of the last decade.  I went to see this in the theatre simply because I had never heard of it and the starting time was right.  I had no idea what was in store for me.  My companions and I left this movie in silence, each of us running the story back over in our heads. We talked about it for hours afterward, each of us enjoying different parts most.  I have since purchased the video and watched it two or three more times, still loving it each time.The story of the red violin's journey across time and continents is fascinating and engrossing.  The film feels like four or five films woven seamlessly into one.  The feel for each country and time in the story is crafted beautifully, and the scenery is breathtaking.

Second review...,"A previous interesting comment triggered me to write this and I hope that my humble opinions will help put more light in the interpretations of this movie. I apologize if I may offend anyone, I just feel that I need to give this movie a fair trial.This movie is unique in the fact that it really don't have a main character. Well, it does, but it involves an inanimate object; the red violin. And when you know, if a movie is character based, there will have to be 'attachments (added values/importance)' to this main character, similar to many other movies like The Godfathers 2 etc.but in this case, it is a violin. This movie is also unique in the fact that it has two 'central point' that tells the story; the auction and the tarot cards. In most cases there is only one or at all; like the bus stop in Forrest Gump.I agree in a certain degree that this movie is about antique collecting. But I will go as far as it is present in the movie but it is not by any means to be the sole purpose of the movie. (Like requiem for a dream is about only drug uses or pulp fiction is only about killing people) I agree, in the light of music's meaning, putting too much emphasis on a musical instrument is wrong. But in the light of a main character in a story, it is an inevitable step. But I would also suggest in my humble opinion, putting music on the emphasis on the musical instrument OR the musician is just as bad. To say music is the musician is like worshipping Mozart of his status and values and not his music. Music IS NOT the musician. One hand can't make a sound. No matter how good you are, you can't play the Hungarian Rhapsody on a out of tune piano. Music lives in the relationship between the two parties and it should not exist even in the realms of space nor time. It is the interpretation/understanding that is triggered within a subjective perceiver. Hence, it can never be truly spoken of nor discussed. So if this is the case, movies that promote musicians like `Mr. Holland's Opus' or `Amadeus' will all fall within this error. But of course, there are certain limitations to a movie and all movies have to base on a character whether if it is Forrest Gump or The Red Violin.This movie talks alittle about auctions of a number of antiques. But is it just about collecting them? What about the monks? Do you think they want the violin because they want to collect violins for their monetary values? If so, why get the same one that happens to be related to them? There must be more than just antique collecting.Is this just an object of history and not history itself. But wouldn't we not say that history is composed of objects/events (that is related to objects in the space-time)? It is the summation of these important events/objects that give history its meaning. The sum that makes up the whole; one can't talk about the whole without its sum. It is like trying to picture someone you love in the past. It is hard to picture that person out of context. You need to picture that person in context of something you have done/ shared the same event together.Did Sammuel steal the violin because he wants to rebel against capitalistic values? Do you think he did all that inorder to spike the society? (If you want this issue addressed, red violin may not be the best movie to go, try Fight Club).  Did you think that when the 17th Century violin maker used blood to paint an instrument from his beloved wife, he was thinking consciously, `ahh, this will be later of great value to both antique lovers and musicians and I will be rich, rich I say, RICH! Or do you think that he was just feeling pain and anger and love and hatred and emotions and things which logic and rationality that can't explain LIKE what music does to people. Don't analyze music; you can't. Once you start to analyze music, it no longer music but notes on a page.So what is this movie about? It is about a musical instrument, its history, and the relationship of it with the musicians throughout the course of its life. It survives longer than men, and so it may seem alittle ridiculous. But having in mind that this movie is not an account of facts but of storytelling. It also symbolses that comparing to love/music/beauty, men is minute.It does not matter how virtuous the little girl is that the father hands down the violin to, it does not matter. Nor do I think that the pleasure one finds in music or the meaning/emotions one find in music is not equal to what grade of piano you have hanging on your wall. To be able to understand the true meaning of opera does not entail you to be a fat lady. If one thinks about music parallel to skills or notation on a page, music is no more than an illusion.Is it just about music, no. But it is related to music as it is suggested in the relationship it has with all of its owners. The love and the meaning triggered by this violin is beyond words.  The symbol played by this inanimate object is a great one. It resemble freedom, love, greed, ownership, beauty and music; all entities in men. It is a pure neutral entity that will transform to whatever to the musician's subjective desired.I hope whoever is reading this will see both sides of the coin.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"Music, Obsession, Love, Lust & Intrigue","A poignant love story interwoven throughout several centuries, countries and cultures while following a very special violin and the lives it touches. This movie is definitely near the top of my ""must see"" list.The Red Violin has something for almost anyone of intelligence who is interested in culture and music. It's main theme involves a poignant, yet tragic, love story or, should I say stories, as we witness the way this instrument effects the lives of the people who become enamoured with it.The movie is not difficult to follow, despite the interweaving tales, however, it might be a bit hard on those who hate subtitles, as various segments are spoken in the native language of the people whose lands the violin resides in over the years. I barely noticed it, and probably found it more intriguing and believeable because of it. I hope it's the start of a new trend.If you are a lover of violin music and human nature, this is a film for you!!!",,Anonymous,Music

The most compelling story of the year.,"I saw this film last Saturday (6/26/1999) and was completely moved by the perfect character development, very complex but well structured in the story line, including all the sub plots, and the significance of the reason why it was told.As a student in a film major school, I've been interested in storytelling in flashback structure.  Also, I more understood of it because of the film as well.  How the individual stories progress in the past toward the present to make the essence of the film be told.  Of course, there were betrayal, hate, justice, violence, as much as love in it.  However, what's the most important for the film to tell the audience.  It was love. That's why it was told and I, one of the audience members, appreciated it from the bottom of my heart and applauded when the film ended with other people in the theater.I believe that it is a good storytelling film and there's no comparison so far this year.

Cinematographer Alain Dostie creates paintings on-screen as richly textured and as passionate as a great symphony.

The viewer is then taken back through the life story of the violin and the lives that it touched over 200 years. I have seen this movie several times and I never fail to marvel at my re-enjoyment of watching it. Great story, great acting, great music, unpredictable and unique. It doesn't get any better!!

His wife is pregnant, and the anticipation of a child prompts a special manufacturing effort.Samuel L. Jackson plays, brilliantly, the New York consultant who is commissioned by the auction house to appraise a newly arrived lot of string instruments. Jackson's character knows his stuff.

Music is all that matters..,"This is a story about a spectacular violin that was made long ago.  The story starts off as a master craftsman in Italy looses his wife and newborn during an awful birthing.  As a result hey uses the blood of his dead wife as a varnish for the instrument and it transforms all who come across this violin into pure fanatics as it seems the soul of the dead wife inhabits the instrument and makes music like the heavens.  There are 5 stories as the violin is handed down, traveled through countries from France, Germany, China, and then modern day North America.  The climax of the film towards the end of the story involves an auction house that has the violin in which several parties are all trying to get it.This was a great film and even though it dragged at times it truly shows what music can do to ones soul.  Relationships broken, hopes lost, joy found all through music as it transcends history.  Although some parts were a bit lengthy the music score keeps you sitting tight and pleased.  There are also some humorous moments for the film, certainly lead violinists all have a chip on their shoulder.

A Masterpiece. Mind blowing.,"The Red Violin Wow. I was strolling the lanes of Blockbuster today and I fortunately picked up The Red Violin. I have nearly watched this film about 5-6 times before, but each time I always find another movie just getting ready to go and I put this one back as its always my backup. I didn't really know that much about it, but I was curious, so today I finally used my 3rd rental spot on it. Boy am I lucky I chose this.The Red Violin is a story about this violin that was created in 1683 by this relatively famous violin maker. It passes through many hands and is owned by various people of four different languages, five countries, and 300 years. It is practically mythical around the world. But, out of chance, it ends up in an auction house in Montreal where it is what everyone came for. It is the main event. I'll leave out all the various stories, but they are magnificently done and all quite interesting.This magnificent script alternates between the year 1683, the year that the certain owner has the violin (I believe they show ~4 different owners), and the current year (the present) and does it incredibly smoothly. It constantly keeps you on an edge by giving you bit by bit of the auction, until the end when they finish it up. I found this to be a great way of presenting this. Made you really want to see what happens because they kept repeating this.Besides the alternating between time periods, I enjoyed the great characters of various cultures and many different music periods that I encountered as I watched. All these very different people came upon this violin and you can see that while they were so different, they all hailed it as a masterpiece. As a treasure. They all knew that it was special. They all masterfully linked with this violin.Along with this, every character that was introduced was very interesting. You only were with each one for a relatively small amount of time, but that was no matter. You quickly cared for them and their relationship with the violin. You always wanted it to flourish, while still being disappointed time after time.I'm going to try to leave out any specifics of each of the stories, but they are all incredibly interesting. I put a fair amount of backing behind The Red Violin and I definitely recommend it.Four stars, 10/10, A+ etc.err well I forgot to mention the beautiful score that accompanied this. What was so amazing is how each different piece that was played went along with the character that the movie was focusing on at that time. Each person had their own little piece. Its of course some magnificent violin that accompanies the film. I unfortunately heard about this part and didn't spot it myself. I was looking for it the whole film and I am glad I did. It added another dimension to it.",,Anonymous,Music

I thought The Red Violin was a very surreal film.,"I thought The Red Violin was a fantastic picture, because it followed the life of a very special violin and therefore made the violin the real star of the film, and the film went along so smoothly that sometimes you forgot it was subtitled. Samuel L. Jackson really stood out in a very unique and profound way because he knew how very valuable the red violin was and held it in the highest of regards almost as much as the maker of it, and Kasper Weiss.

An Incredibly Crafted Piece of Cinematic History,"This could very well be the most profound film you'll ever see.

Although it didn't hit me right away, I realized three fourths of the way through this film that I might be witnessing one of the best films ever made. To take an inanimate object and show so much emotion, history and intrigue through it, weaving centuries, people and history through that object is quite simply genius. See it as soon as you can, see it with someone you love, see it with someone you hate, just see it. There are certain movies people call 'hidden gems'. Well this movie might be the one that shines brighter than them all.

The Reduced Violin,"The Red Violin is a random series of events that are not connected in any way, shape or form. I understand the fact that European films often have no point and are usually just ""slice of life"", but this film is even worse. It tells us nothing of the construction of the violin and very little about what it was intended for.
A hole in the plot is that the violin was intended for the creator's ""son"", but we never learn whether his newborn is male of female. What happened to his dream of giving it to his ""son""? How did it end up in a monastery? Why was the violin ""red""?
The whole movie just doesn't add up, but I was willing to bear with it because of the marvelous solo violin playing supplied by Joshua Bell.
Then, came an impasse. The Chinese lady who tried to hide and save the instrument from the cultural revolution had her door kicked in by storm-troopers? I can not forgive the screen-writer this travesty. This kind of cruelty was unnecessary in this film and I ejected the movie and threw it in the trash because of this. Why do they think that seeing a pure heart betrayed is entertaining? I will not accept such darkness in my art. Is there any reason why we couldn't have been shown a happy segment involving Chinese people in China?

Another sign of a great movie is that you are really elated about the successes some characters have or ""depressed"" about tragic things that happen to the characters.  This movie succeeds on both fronts.  And who would have thought that a violin could be a character so successfully?  The score is fabulous - I want to own a copy of John Corigliano's music.  The Paganini-like virtuoso in the middle of the film and the Paganini-like music were remarkable. The well enunciated Italian, German, French, and Mandarin (the last-mentioned I can only say presumably well enunciated) also added to my enjoyment of the movie.

Thoroughly Dull,Honestly nobody in this film seemed interested in doing any actual acting. Wooden unconvincing performances with no exceptions. Samuel Jackson dialed it in while giving zero credibility to his role. Ambitious but execution severely lacking.

Some good country scenes and music but ultimately forgettable. Very clumsy directing that couldn't elevate anyone's role beyond merely bland and/or silly.

An emotional masterpiece that follows a violin throughout history from the 1600's to the present day.,"The Red Violin is one of the best films I've seen in recent times. I saw it this afternoon at a press screening of the Toronto International Film Festival. The story follows the history of a violin, the ""red violin"" as it is known in musical circles, from it's creation in Italy in the 1600's to the present day where it is being auctioned off in a collection of instruments in Montreal. The film is tied together in flash-forwards of the wife of the violin maker, who is having her fortune told with tarot cards. Except that it is not her fortune that is being told, but that of the violin. We follow the violin through numerous and varied owners and across three continents. There are also flash-backs from the present-day auction.As a musician myself, I identify easily with the emotional attachment that musicians, especially string players, have for their instruments, and the importance of music in their lives. I recommend this film to anyone who can see beauty in life, anyone who understands the passion of the Arts, anyone who can feel emotion, because this film will touch you, deep inside your soul.",,Anonymous,Music

Little Kaspar, himself loved by Maestro Poussin, develops an unbreakable bond with the Red Violin.  In the hands of Frederick the virtuoso, it becomes the instrument he has chosen to express both his love and passion for Victoria.  Even in times as testing as the Cultural Revolution in China, love delivers it from peril.  To the earthly and uninitiated (the Gypsies, the pawnbroker, Ruselsky), the violin is nothing more than a toy, a commodity, and a trophy.  In the end, the Red Violin found its way back to how it all began - as a token of love.",,Anonymous,Music
"Life in the day of a Violin, or centuries in this case...","A journey from the creation unto its eventual end brings you through many different small stories; people from different generations all effected by the power of a grand spiritual 'red' violin. Though music lovers should appreciate this most, it has enough elements to satisfy any regular film goer.I myself can't help but feel captivated; looking to see how this one little violin could effect the next setting, how it could change so many lives. Not only did it bring these stories to life in a very provocative, masterful manner, it also kept on fishing out the intrigue even until the final scene. Throughout each instance, you can't help but wonder what will happen next to this instrument, and how it will seek to live on.I loved how, though I don't believe in myself, the tales related to the old house maiden and her predictions. Its seamlessly put together instances of the predictions, the life of, and the present pace of its journey and Its scope is so grand, yet so well done, with the music to match, that I can't help to also feel mystified and intrigued by it all.

As inanimate as the violin itself,"I prefer not to speculate on the reasons why so many people gave such good scores to this movie. This is the worst kind of ""art"" movie, as self-indulging, fawning, simplistic and manipulative as the worst kind of Hollywood product. It intends to portray the power of music to affect the lives of human beings, but it does so in such a facile way that it never achieves the power to move, only to irritate. The only segment I found (a bit) moving was the Chinese story, and even this one wastes the character of the old music teacher who risks prison or worse in order to save his instruments. The English segment was sooooo ludicrous, I would have laughed if I hadn't felt my intelligence so thoroughly insulted. The other segments were just forgettable.The music is pretty, but that's it.",,Anonymous,Music
Could not watch it :),"Everyone seems to love this movie... thought I'd throw a bit of contrariness...Usually I enjoy well-made European movies (and even occasional American ones :). I am not as far into art that I can really enjoy Fellini, but I hope to get there. However, I literally could not watch Red Violin. I barely managed to sit through 15 minutes of it and had to stop. It was completely, unreasonably uninteresting. However, the problem is not with the movie, it's with me.I don't dig music. I am not tone-deaf, and I enjoy an occasional tune on the radio. (And when I do, violin isn't my favorite instrument. It's too squeaky, IMO :) I own only maybe a couple of CDs, and do not have any urge to buy any more or to listen to music in general. And apparently, the movie loses everything when you take out the interest in music. Without it, the first 15 minutes of the movie is just a soap-opera-style sequence of events, totally bland and non-gripping. I simply do not care what happens to the instrument and to the protagonists.I wish I could say it's a masterpiece... I did not see it as such.",,Anonymous,Music
Five aimless tales of a fiddle in red,"This is a ""portmanteau"" movie, with five separate stories involving the same violin on a three century journey from its creation in Cremona, Italy, to its sale at auction in modern-day Montreal. The auction ties the stories together, sort of, but the viewer is still left with a feeling of discontinuity since the object, beautiful and possessed of a fine tone, is still that, an object. The music is interesting and pleasant but can't replace the lack of a strong storyline. The story of the violin's creation is a bit poignant, but mostly trite. The second story, the sad tale of the child prodigy from the Alpine orphanage, has the most impact, but ultimately is pointless. In the third story, Jason Flemyng does a terrific Chopinesque musical Lothario, reminding us that the 19th had its brattish pop stars, but his sticky end is a bit pointless too. Greta Scacchi does make a nice femme fatale though. The fourth story, set in Mao's China at the time of the Cultural Revolution, is pretty dull. The ending, at the auction, is pretty silly.Back in the 1960s, the director Anthony Asquith, did something similar with a motor car in ""The Yellow Rolls--Royce"" (his last movie). There was a fair bit of sexual hanky-panky in and around the Roller but that seemed fitting. The stories were separate but on a similar theme, love, sex, betrayal. This film, on the other hand, says something about creative passion, but I'm not sure quite what - maybe how hard it is to control, to channel productively. It also says, if you want to get money out of five different film funders, give 'em five different plots. Oh well. The crew(s) must have had a good time.",,Anonymous,Music
Beautiful movie - weak final reel,"Girard and McKellar have crafted a fascinating story, served with all the trimmings.  As one who has a weakness for movies that milk beautiful environs for all their worth, I was often awed by this one.  Furthermore, Corigliano's score deserves top billing - as the voice of the violin, it's actually the star of the film.Unfortunately, once the violin makes its way to Montreal, things slow down dramatically.  Furthermore, Samuel L. Jackson is woefully miscast.  One wonders if the producers thought Mr. Jackson's ""Pulp Fiction"" cool factor would attract a younger audience (and thus sell more tickets).Still, I highly recommend ""Red Violin,"" and must also highly recommend ""Topsy Turvy"" for another approach to the musical creative process.",,Anonymous,Music
regarding the Tarot Cards,"True, I did not read all 200+ of the viewer comments, but of the many ones I read: I did not see anyone make the realization that I did: that the tarot cards were telling the future of the violin, not of the lady. A long life. A long voyage. Etc.I almost passed on this movie, but I'm ecstatic that I watched it on IFC. It's excellent and I will watch it again as soon as I see it listed. I agree with other viewers that Samuel Jackson did not emote appropriately, considering he'd been searching for this instrument for so long. I don't have much else to add, but the rules dictate that I go on for at least ten lines. So there you have it!",,Anonymous,Music
Dull portmanteau film,"This was an overlong, dull and disappointing film with some hysterical acting. I wasn't the only one to laugh in the cinema when Jason Flemyng came gamboling along at the beginning of the British section and Greta Scacchi really should have known better than to get involved in this. The whole thing seems as if it had been put together by the film or tourist commissions of several countries and I think I'm right that counting a bit of Latin there were seven languages used in it. It does have a final few twists though and Samuel L. Jackson is always good value.",,Anonymous,Music
Every Violin has a story of its own...,"The violin is my favourite musical instrument! That being the case, I wanted to watch this film ever since I heard of it. I found the story of the passage of a violin across centuries and continents just too enchanting and irresistible! I'm glad to say I wasn't disappointed! This film is a feast for the senses - the cinematography, the acting and of course the music, are top notch!I was most happy to learn that it did receive the Oscar for the Best Musical Score the year it was nominated. With the help of Joshua Bell, John Corigliano, casts a spell with his music! Interestingly the violin that Joshua Bell plays is steeped in as much intrigue and history as the Red Violin. The Gibson Stradivarius that Bell plays now was made in the early Eighteenth century(1731 if I'm not mistaken). It reached the hands of Polish violinist Bronislaw Huberman from whom it was stolen by a John Altman who played it in bars for fifty years, never repairing it although it needed due care and attention. While on his deathbed, Altman is said to have confessed his crime resulting in the Stradivarius being duely restored to its original glory. And then Joshua Bell eventually became its owner, feeling an instant connection with it the day he played his very first notes on it...! Every violin does have a story of its own...",,Anonymous,Music
a review for the red violin,"The Red Violin is actually a two part story. The main story is about Morgan Freeman's character, Charles Morritz. He is musical instrument historian trying to authenticate the Red Violin's origin. The secondary story is the history of the violin from the very beginning in 1681. The theme of the red violin is the journey of one particular item and the lives it can change.The main characters in the film are Morgan Freeman, Charles Morritz, plays a musical instrument historian trying to authenticate the origin of the red violin. Carlo Cecchi plays Nicolo Bussotti. Irene Grazoli plays Anna Rudolphi Bussotti, Nicolo pregnant wife. Anita Laurenzi who plays Cesca Anna's servant and performs the tarot card reading. Christoph Koncz, Kasper Weiss.After Anna's death, the violin was donated to an orphanage in Austria and for the next 100 years many boys played this particular violin. Until Kasper Weiss received the violin and he made it sing. He also was attached to his instrument so much so he would sleep with it. It meant the world to him. He died playing that instrument. The next stop is Oxford, London and it is played by Jason Fleming as Frederick Pope and to him the violin is good and bad. It brings out the best in him musically but personally it destroys his family. So much so his girlfriend shoots the violin grazing the neck. He is smoking Opium and is in the arms of another. He commits suicide and leaves his entire estate to his girlfriend. The violin, however he leaves to his Chinese servant. The violin then moves on Shanghi, China. During this time period the violin must be in hiding because anything to do with Western culture is banned and destroyed. Its final stop an auction house in 1997, where Charles Morritz finally proved it was the original Red Violin. He switched it with one of the really good fakes and took it home to his daughter.Violin3The characters throughout the movie have a special relationship with this violin and it helps many to overcome fears and gives them confidence in themselves. The setting of the movie takes place on five different places and each place is as real as it gets. The rich red color of the violin is amazing. When you craft something for the one you love, of course it is going to be perfect. In its life span it had made many people happy and sad. The journey of life is not all about the things we collect, but the few that we do are special and we want to hold on to them.",,Anonymous,Music

An old-fashioned spectacular,"I see no point in recounting the plot here; many other reviewers have already done so.  If you like large-scale international films, this one is a must-see, but DO NOT WATCH THE COMMERCIAL-TV VERSION!

Also, the showings on Bravo have commercial garbage at the bottom of the screen even during the movie itself, which sometimes makes the subtitles impossible to read.

"A clever, well crafted film that sinks at the end","The Red Violin presents so many striking images and sounds that it is easy to overlook its flat characterizations. What it lacks in emotional depth, though, it makes up for in its sensuous imagination. The film is alive with masses of people, monumental locations, and the artistry of five very different eras. The fact that the plot leaps freely between characters, continents, and centuries makes its sensual impact that much greater. There is no point in trying to predict what comes next, it seems to say; we're wiser to notice what is here and now. Above all, music is here and now.As compelling as these first four acts were for me, the final act (lasting only 30 minutes but feeling like a day) is so outrageously terrible as to nearly sink the film as a whole. Instead of sensuality and beauty, the film meditates on money, bland hotel rooms, laboratory technology, and an unnecessary (and extremely implausible) double-cross that is intended to tie the film shut. Through this tedious action, the movie instructs us about how meaningful the Red Violin is to some people -- just in case we missed this point. Of course, by now, we have a more intimate understanding of the Red Violin than any of the Act 5 characters possibly could, and so their ovations about its deep significance come off as the worst sort of pretentiousness.At one point, an acoustical engineer (yes, the film calls in tech support to explain how good the instrument really is) says that what he'd really like to do is take the violin apart for closer analysis. As preposterous as that suggestion sounds, this is precisely what the final part of the film tries to do to what came before.My suggestion: Skip the fifth act. Go listen to some music instead.",,Anonymous,Music
A Single Flaw,"In an otherwise perfect movie, I only note one flaw.  The tarot reading was WRONG.  It was so wrong that I, a rank amateur, could tell that it was wrong.  Moreover, the tarot segment was not important considering that the auction was already used to separate the segments.I'll leave the rest to the others who have commented before.  Needless to say, the music is exquisite...",,Anonymous,Music
A passionate movie about making music.,"Perhaps the most interesting thing about The Red Violin is the fact that it transcends cultures.  This a film about the life of a violin that travels over 300 years from renaissance Italy, to revolutionary France, through eastern Europe, onto Communist China and into modern day Montreal.  Along the way this violin is the property of several people who have nothing in common, except for their love of this exceptional instrument.The film opens with Samuel Jackson as Charles Morritz, arriving at an auction house in Montreal where this violin is about to be sold.  We are soon whisked back in time to the workshop of master violin maker, Nicolo Bussotti (played by Carlo Cecchi).  His young wife is pregnant and seeks the advice of the kitchen help/soothe seer.  Using tarot cards the seer predicts an untimely end to the life of this woman, but somehow also sees a long and turbulent life for her.  We wonder what this scullery maid is talking about, however it quickly becomes evident that she has tapped into the life of the violin.This violin is still under construction.  Nicolo feels that it is his most perfect work to date, and will present it to their child when he/she is born.  Unfortunately the seer was right about the wife dying, so when all is said and done, a broken Nicolo closes up the work shop and puts the newly created, and quite perfect, violin up for sale.The violin ends up in the hands of several people over the years, and in nicely styled vignettes we see how much this instrument means to people who really know nothing of its tragic origins.  As the film moves from era to era, we hear beautiful arrangements complete with some gorgeous photography. Each story is told like a parable of sorts.  Not one of them are long enough to get into complicated detail, however they are complete enough to create an impression.I thought there were only a few minor disappointments, none of which would take away from the film as a whole.  Jackson seems to draw on his character from Pulp Fiction in various scenes as he tells off hotel staff.  That got a little tiring, mainly because it was so out of place with the rest of movie.Francois Girard directs this film, using styles similar to that of Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon.  Like Kurbrick, Girard allows for long periods of silence, using imagery to tell his story.  The story of the little orphan boy in the monastary, with a weak heart, but a passion for music, was hauntingly stunning.  As we see him going as far as sleeping with the violin, we learn the true value of Busotti's creation.Of course the tragic theme of this film is man's inhumanity to man. Jealousy, betrayal, greed, vanity and bigotry all come into play in this film.  We wonder, in the end, how this violin ever survived all those years.",,Anonymous,Music
Le violin rouge,"Offering both brilliance and disappointment, a second viewing of this still rather enchanting film proved that perhaps the film was after all too ambitious for its own good. I love Don McKellar, he is a big influence on my own writing and his sensibilities fairly close to mine, especially with our shared fascination with multiple intersecting stories, but with ""Le violin rouge"", the sheer scale of the film, spanning three centuries and five countries as we follow the titular red violin, a real thing of beauty, on its journey. Three of these stories are very good, particularly the violin's own 'origin story', the other two quite dull and occasionally painful (Oxford and Shanghai). The screenplay is still excellent despite the flaws, and plays out like an intriguing, particularly romantic ""Twilight Zone"" episode for music lovers, leaving almost everything up for interpretation. Perhaps those flaws would have gone down easier had the cinematography not been a pretty dull TV-level affair in general and Francois Girard's direction so flat much of the time, but unfortunately those aspects also hurt the film overall, though neither are incompetent. A generally strong cast with an unusual role for Samuel L. Jackson help keep the film involving.It's a real charmer, a great idea and with many great scenes, a frame story that more than just does its job, and a truly epic, yet grounded, scope. I wish I could love this film like I used to, but some of it just doesn't hold up like it used to. I do want to read the screenplay at some point because I'm nearly entirely sure that this reads better than it plays out on screen. Despite my expressing disappointment in the film here, I do need to clarify that I still recommend this film, and quite strongly. If nothing else, it is very unique. Thankfully, there's more than that to recommend it. How about this for instance: one of cinema's great scores by John Corigliano, with the violin solos played by Joshua Bell?",,Anonymous,Music
Warning: contains references to the surprises,"A sentimental fantasy; not great, but worth seeing.The wife of a Renaissance Italian violin maker is pregnant with her first child; her husband has been working to build _the_ greatest violin that his son, when born, can learn to play.  His wife, shortly before birth, has a servant tell her fortune with Tarot cards; the prediction proves accurate but not in the way one expects.  The woman and her newborn both die in childbirth.  The movie traces the later journeys of this violin as it passes from musician to musician.Joshua Bell, a young 20ish concert violinist noted for his flair with romantic music, plays on the sound track.  The movie doesn't have so much ""serious"" music that those who don't usually listen to it will be turned off; the reverse could be more often true -- that some of those with an especial love of the violin and its serious repertoire may feel a little short-changed.I've read a few other user comments and agree with those who remark that the transitions from one story episode to the next are somewhat rough.  And agree that the episode with Kaspar Weiss is the most effective.  The episode with an English violinist and his love, a female author, was almost worthy of a pulp fiction romance novel except it lacked enough credulity of gender roles for those times (or combining sexual and musical activities?).  Oh, and the red varnish of the ""Red Violin"" -- terribly sentimental, romantic, and so fantastic as to be completely unrealistic. (Don't they feed these scripts through any technical editors?  Or didn't it matter?)A college freshman friend of mine who's a music major said she saw this 7 times and urged me to see it.  Not bad, entertaining,  but we have different tastes. In the demographics women in the 18-44 age ranges rate it about one whole point higher than men.  Does that make this a ""chick"" movie?",,Anonymous,Music
"style for days, but shallow characters","i enjoyed this movie, in spite of itself.  the word here is; ""style,"" and then some. well told yarn,  woven together beautifully; with flashbacks, a fortune teller, a red violin, and fantastic photography.   problem is,  the characters are not developed, and little boy klaus is the only likeable hero.  we also, after beautiful scenery, and masterful pacing, get rudely slapped in the mouth with western anti-politics.  it was unsettling. still, this is director 101 stuff. definitely worth seeing.",,Anonymous,Music
What could have become a good movie ...,"... admittingly the idea is enchanting. Who wouldn't like to be given the opportunity to follow an artifact through time, beyond the limitations of a human lifespan, particularly where this artifact is a violin that almost seems to live a life of its own and has the passionate power to inspire the muse of its masters.But as is so often the case, a powerful idea is one thing, to put it into reality another. Girard once remarked that he could have going on researching forever, and with all the sophisticated locations and costumes in mind this thorough research might well be a hint for Girard's taking perfectionism too far. Unsurprisingly then that is exactly the film's problem, that it is obsessed with details and effects and misses out on overall coherence and consistency.Location and costumes were already mentioned as an example for sophistication, but this is exactly were Girard's perfectionism goes far too far, as the setting looks remarkable artificial,  even dirt and stains, where they were admitted, look disturbingly sterile.It might be the presence of Mr.Jackson that makes one compare the film with Pulp Fiction, but clearly its episodic character and its obsession with effects, as the ""surprising"" twist towards the end, show some resemblance, and there exactly lies the problem, that coherence, powerful and moving overall motives and the development of characters are sacrificed for a handful of twists.Vivid imaginary and a beautiful score, exploring its different eras musically, make this film worthwhile watching. Not quite a potential classic though.",,Anonymous,Music
The music in this film takes on a life of its own...,"I just recently had the wonderful opportunity to participate in an interview with the director of this film, FranÃ§ois Girard, and it was fascinating. I am a student in a university film music class, and he spoke to us about his thoughts and motivations in making the Red Violin. He talked about the way that the music was a way to speak in a universal language, a language that everyone could understand. It moves through space, time and cultures excellently, much better than spoken words. Girard gave us the interesting example of children he knew who watched the film, and how they understood what was happening even though they were too young to even read the subtitles... The subtitles were a way to stay true to the mood of the characters, while letting the melodies and music played by the characters express their individuality. The soul of the young pregnant woman, 'Anna' becomes closely tied to the 'soul' of her husband's masterpiece, the Red Violin. The song she sings becomes, as Girard told us, the basis for all of the music in the rest of the film... Essentially, this movie is a story about the power of music and how it can change lives, for better or worse.",,Anonymous,Music
Son of Michael Powell's 1948 The Red Shoes with a new coat of red paint,"The Red Violin has trouble deciding whether it is a costume picture or an art movie.  The film traces the history of a rare violin from its birthplace in 1681 Italy.  The instrument is headed for a 1998 auction house to be sold. Enter expert Samuel L. Jackson.  Jackson knows rare violins.  He recognizes this piece as one of a kind. Its not a Stradivarius. Its even more refined, a handmade instrument from an old Italian craftsman.  Jackson is not the only one who sees through the plain trappings of the violin.  A young scientist who measures the richness of fiddle acoustics, is also onto the red violin. The young man is actor Keith Gordon the same young skeptic who doubts Rodney Dangerfield's attempts at getting an education in the 1986 film Back to School. The Red violin is so famous there are knock-offs and copies circulating in the rare violin marketplace.As I mentioned, the first four historic scenarios through which the vintage violin travels are costume pieces.  They are also choppy and differ in detail, authenticity and tone from the last auction house episode. On top of that the auction mystery is so richly separate in tone and character from other sequences, it is as if separate filmmakers were working here.One sequence features a Viennese landowner who retrieves the instrument from a band of gypsies who are trespassing on his property.  The aristocrat is a true eccentric.  The music  he plays  on the Red Violin is extraordinary. His love affair with absurd European Duchess Greta Schacchi is so unnecessary, the episode plays like farce.Another episode takes us to China in the early 20th century then moves the daughter whose mother buys the pawned violin for her, to China's cultural revolution of the '60s. All old things are now considered reactionary. Violins are instruments which play ""decadent western music."" The young girl, now grown up, takes flight to save the instrument.  This sequence echoes the ridiculous woodenness of the cultural revolution itself.  Characters are reduced to counterrevolutionary sloganeering. Its difficult to believe even the Maoists of that period could have cared so much about an off-colored violin.Scenes from the the first 17th century period when the instrument is made, explain its strange color.The last sequence is a mystery.  It pays off a story  that has been difficult to follow.  The auction sequences take place in a European Capital, though the actors appear to be Canadians.  Fittingly, the actor who actually auctions this fiddle played the title character in Thirty Two Short Films about Glenn Gould. The 1998 auction sequence saves the whole film from being little more than a comic book. Most of the violin music played throughout the films is exquisite and interesting in its variety and range.Samuel Jackson, Keith Gordon and the many others in the last sequence are superb. The last part redeems the entire film.  The screenwriting is fine here as is the camerawork. The color photography, if I have failed to mention it, seems excessively red.",,Anonymous,Music

A 300+ year-old violin passes through the hands of its Italian maker, a sickly young German protege in Vienna, a sensual English superstar virtuoso who looks like Carrot Top with sideburns, and a female Party member in Mao's Shanghai.
