Engaging from the 1st Moment,"I skipped this when it came out because I was sick of the Zombie theme. This one intrigued me because it was written by Mel Brooks' son, Max; however, not enough to watch it. I was wrong. It is good because it is an action film first, and a Zombie film second. Brad Pitt is very good as an agent living a normal life until the crisis calls him out of his retirement. The cinematography is way too shaky for me and that is my major criticism of the visuals in the movie. The script, dialogue, plot, acting , and directing are all very good. I like this one and it stands out in the swarm of Zombie films.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Pretty Good,"Let me start off by saying I haven't read the book yet, so I have no idea how they compare. However, this was a pretty good movie overall. Many zombie movies are merely mindless gore and violence disguised within some fragile thing that doesn't even deserve to be called a plot. However, World War Z has a much better plot than most other zombie movies. One thing I noticed right away is that this movie actually made me jump in surprise several times. It's very suspenseful, and truly worthy of being called a ""zombie horror movie,"" as opposed to the plethora of predictable, unsuspenseful zombie movies that have come out of Hollywood. Brad Pitt does a great job in his role, although I felt his character lacked definition in many ways. It would be nice if they had ""fleshed out"" the characters a bit more.Overall, this movie is definitely worth the watch if you have a couple hours to spare. Not the best movie ever made, but a pretty good one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"

More sinister than 7 years ago,"Considering what is happening in the world today, this film takes on a different meaning for me, all the more so because both in the book and in the original version of the script the epidemic has its origin in China
not to mention the North Korean thread, which is becoming particularly ominous.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
it must be fun to play zombies,"Brad Pitt gets billing as the main star of ""World War Z"", but the real stars are the zombies. It's a very intense movie, focusing on the world's response after a virus starts turning millions into the living dead. North Korea figures out an inventive, if gruesome, method of how to prevent the virus from spreading within its borders. But the zombies are definitely the stars. They turn out to be really clever creatures, as seen by what they do in Israel. Watching just about any zombie movie, I always get the feeling that the people playing the zombies must have the most fun.I will say that this is no George Romero movie. It's designed more for widespread popularity, while Romero's movies are specifically for horror fans (and thus are gorier). But it's not a bad movie. OK, not great.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Zombie blockbuster for a generic audience,"I haven't read the book so I'm not coming from viewing this as an adaptation but rather a stand-alone film. (From what I've heard it's pretty far from the original source anyway.) First off, a zombie film watered-down and free from blood and gore? That idea alone would lose a big slice (pun-intended) of hardcore fans in the audience. How does it hold your attention then? By stringing you along on the edge with tension and suspense from beginning to end. It does a pretty good job of maintaining this grip even without the standard horror elements of slasher flicks.Brad Pitt easily slips into the role of a family man desperate to keep his family safe. It's not difficult to root for him and share in his urgency. His charm certainly makes up for and saves the movie from its flaws (and there are many!) not the least of which are its gaping plot holes and loose direction.The audience in the theater seemed to have fun screaming along and allowing themselves to be entertained and toyed with. There are a handful of funny scenes (whether intentional or not). If you're willing to quit analyzing the movie like a critic, you'll probably start enjoying it.After all, when did a zombie movie ever have to be ""BELIEVABLE""?",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Zombie favourite,"Out of all of the zombie based films this is one of my favourites, a really good story from a different angle of a specialist rather than a hero with a gun. Brilliant ending as-well which is always a bonus.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Don't give up,"At the end of World War Z, just as the credits began rolling, a gentleman, scratch that, an idiot spoke up from the back of the theatre exclaiming, ""What? That sucked! The book was nothing like that! Booo!"" I'm sure he scurried away back home, logged online, and began tweeting, posting, and blogging, furthering his rant. Much like my response to him at the theatre, I hope he receives silence in return.It's true, World War Z is nothing like the book. The book is told from the point of view AFTER the war. It's a ""historical,"" account of what happened during the war. Rather than make a mockumentary with flashbacks, which would have been the wrong decision in my opinion, the filmmakers decided to put us right in the middle of the action.When adapting a piece of literature it is impossible to bring every page, every paragraph, every nuance onto the screen. Some have come close depending on the material, but for the most part, they all have to take their own creative licenses. After all, it's called an ""adaptation,"" for a reason, otherwise they would call it a copy or mimic.Where World War Z works (that's a mouthful) and where so many others fail is that just because the world slips into total and utter chaos, doesn't mean that governments, military, and law enforcement agencies go away. Quite the opposite. If anything, these scenarios bring out the best of all of them. We see generals, UN delegates, and scientists trying to solve complex issues that they don't know anything about. Rather than going into hiding, they act. Society doesn't crumble. Bands of cannibals and leather strapped gangs don't patrol the streets with necklaces made of teeth. People do what they can to survive, and the higher ups try their best to find a fast and effective solution.At first, I thought the movie started too fast. How could something this violent and concentrated go undetected, but after a while I got it. The opening montage of news reports said it all. How many of us listen to everything we hear on the news? Exactly. So much goes undetected while we focus on issues that effect us immediately. It's too late when the virus touches US soil. Not even social media can keep up with it.As far as zombie movies go this one is pretty great. Though I think 28 Days Later takes the cake in terms of realism, in-camera effects, and sheer terror, this one holds its own. Brad Pitt plays a former UN investigator who is traveling with his family just as the zombie attack on Philadelphia unfolds. The film goes from 0-60 before you take a sip of your Coke. This is a fast paced, edge of your seat thrill ride led by one of the finest actors of this generation (Pitt's acting ability is far too underrated and lost in the kerfuffle of tabloid news).For those of you who stare at the ticket window debating whether or not to see a film in 3D or standard, you might want to spend the extra few dollars to see this one in 3D (I know it's asking a lot, but maybe you can sneak some candy or a bottle of water to offset the concession stand price - deal with it). I tend to air on the side of ""screw it, I want to see it in 3D."" Now not every movie NEEDS to be seen in 3D, hell there are really only a couple that absolutely have to be seen in all three dimensions (Avatar and maybe Life of Pi), but this one really surprised me. 3D is not about things jumping out at you, but it's about layers. Luckily this film has both. Big chase scenes in Philly, particles floating about in South Korea, and tracking shots in Jerusalem make this one of the 3D events of the year. No exaggeration.Like so many other summer blockbusters before it, civilization is on the brink of extinction and only a handful of experts can save us. What World War Z does that so many have failed is give us hope. Hope that humanity won't dissolve into nothingness. In the face of sheer danger these fighters stand tall, take a deep breath, look the enemy in the eye, and say, ""No.""",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
More Action Than Horror,"United Nations employee Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt) traverses the world in a race against time to stop the Zombie pandemic that is toppling armies and governments, and threatening to destroy humanity itself.Classifying this as a ""zombie"" movie is much the same as calling ""21 Days Later"" a zombie movie. The categorization is not wrong, but kit changes what we typically think of when we mean zombies. These are not lumbering oafs. These are lightning-fast creatures that seem to have some sort of collective intelligence, like a colony of bees. Their abilities (most notably climbing walls) are foreign to what zombies are.Also, this should be seen as an action film first, horror film second, which seems to be the case any time Hollywood has millions of dollars to burn on a zombie film. See, for example, ""I Am Legend"". If you are looking to see Brad Pitt survive car accidents and plane crashes while traveling around the world (South Korea, Israel, Wales) this is a fine film. But if you want some scares or a film that embodies ""survival horror"", you will not get what you want.Probably the most clever thing about this was the referral of zombies as ""rakshasa"", a Hindu demon that feeds on human flesh. Maybe this has already been covered in Bollywood, but it seems that the concept is rather new here. The zombies (or infected) in this film are not actually rakshasa, but it does raise the question: where are Hindu demons in the horror film? If we can have Onibaba and other Asian creatures, why not something from a country with over one billion people? But this is a bit of a sidetrack...Anyway, good film if you want big budget action and Brad Pitt fighting computer-generated undead while sporting the greasiest hair since Kid Rock. Bad film if you want slow, lumbering Romero zombies. But to each his own, I guess.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
good action thriller,"The world descends into the zombie apocalypse. There is some sort of virus and bitten people are turned into violent creatures. Former UN investigator Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt) is caught up with his wife Karin (Mireille Enos) and family. They manage to escape and Gerry is put to work on finding the origins of the outbreak. This Brad Pitt showcase has many good points. My only main complaint is the PG13 rating which imposes the cartoon zombie action rather than a gore bloody fare.The action starts right away within 10min. There's no need to misunderstand what this movie is. It's simply a popcorn movie. Although unlike other post-apocalyptic movie, there isn't the standard eerie empty city scenes. The zombie mystery is investigated in a Bond movie fashion. Brad Pitt travels all around the world following leads. It's actually easy to follow and really compelling. It has a good tension filled horror aspect. It's not all big action. You also get good scary parts with dark hallways and stalking dangers.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
The Most Marketable Movie Ever Made...,"World War Z is a zombie outbreak movie that supposedly bases itself on the amazing book of the same name by Max Brooks. What this movie truly is, is a shamefully mediocre attempt to create a movie that appeals to the widest audience possible. Pee established fan base from the book? Check. Star power (this is Brad Pitt)? Check. Focuses on intensity rather than horror and gore to not alienate non zombie fans? Check. Safe, young PG 13 rating? Check. All the makings are here because this is what the big Hollywood studio wanted. Despite the fact this movie doesn't resemble the book at all, it appears that those attached to make this movie tried to make a decent movie such as the visually interesting director Marc Foster who wanted to make a movie with a message which would emulate the tone the book was going for. However, the big studio disliked this and demanded rewrites and re-shooting that damaged the relationship between the director and Brad and results in a quick, intense action movie that lacks the character development and messages it needed to be a truly memorable movie because almost every one of those scenes were cut so much to the point that central characters get barley any lines. While the action scenes are intense and enjoyable on their own and Marc foster adds style to the lack of substance but its just not enough to save this movie. While it is better than it had any right to be thanks to Marc, it needs more and it lacks in crucial substance. However from the reviews and box office reports it appears Hollwood has succeeded in creating a successful marketable movie that everyone will eat up and it will be too late when we all get the nasty aftertaste.....",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
A Very Puzzling Missed Opportunity,"The story of how World War Z was made is a lot more harrowing and suspenseful than the film itself. After going way over-budget and enduing a complete revision and reshoot of the final act, WWZ wasn't exactly set up for success. Ultimately the movie is completely forgettable and uneven, but not offensively bad or objectively terrible in any sense. What struck me about it was how much of a wasted opportunity it was, given how interesting and entertaining the source material is.Having read the book World War Z, I could tell from the trailers for this movie that it wouldn't exactly be a faithful adaptation. I thought that the most interesting aspects of the book were its exploration of how the Zombie plague affected social and political structures across the world. Anything like that is completely ignored in the film, but I can at least understand how the filmmakers thought that those aspects wouldn't work in a single feature length movie. What I can't understand is how the filmmakers seemingly ignored the book's most obviously cinematic content. The book features a lot of setpiece action scenes, and to be fair, many of these involve world cities falling to zombie infestation and the movie does do enough to cover this. However, the book's immense battle scenes - the meat of the titular Zombie War, such as the Battle of Yonkers, nuclear war between Pakistan and Iran, Chinese civil war and massive formation combat against zombies - are completely absent. I was very surprised that they did not cover these, especially the Yonkers scene, because they would obviously fit so well into a film and the script, even as it is now, could easily be tweaked to include or at least mention them. The action that did make it into this film is very unsatisfying and obscure thanks to the restrictions of the PG-13 rating, and the narrative around is not engaging enough to really get me invested in it.I was also surprised at how cheap this movie looked. This film cost hundreds of millions of dollars to make, but it's hard to see where it all went on the screen. Swarms of zombies look very fake and nonthreatening, and in some cases individual zombies are computer animated, which gave me bad flashbacks to I Am Legend's awful CGI overload. Aside from the opening scenes in Philadelphia and the middle act in Jerusalem, there are no big outdoor sets. A South Korean airbase is portrayed as a series of dark rooms; too much of the movie takes place in an airline seat; there is a lot of sitting around inside of the aircraft carrier, etc. The sense of scale is very inconsistent, and this is accentuated in the bizarre final act, which was obviously the focus of the infamous reshoots as it feels like a completely separate movie. I consider myself a patient viewer, but this very long and dull scene started to bring me down after a while, and my less patient viewing audience eventually fell completely out of sync with the film and began to make fun of it at every opportunity - not really a fair criticism of the film, but it's a real issue when it can't hold an audience's attention. The final act does actually have an interesting idea at its heart, albeit one that completely doesn't connect with anything in the book, but I just didn't think it was a well executed concept. The very different style and tone of these scenes makes it feel like a completely different movie.Again, while there was nothing all that terrible about WWZ, I didn't think it was anything to get excited about. In other words, a perfect 5/10 movie. I wish they were more aware of the source material's potential because without the best and most cinematic aspects of the book, WWZ (the film)and WWZ (the book) only share a title and the central premise of a zombie plague, which is not an original idea in itself.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Good large set-pieces but not so good at producing consistent tension and fear,"I'm generally not a fan of zombie movies, not because I don't like them but rather because they seem to easily have an effect on me, chilling me to the bone and staying with me for days (no walking into dark rooms for me). As a result I put off watching World War Z but I was still interested in seeing such a big budget zombie film. The plot sees some form of outbreak and, well, you know what happens. No sooner has Gerry Lane rescued his family from one city, than he is rescued by his old UN employers who want him to help lead a mission to try and find a solution by escorting a doctor to South Korea. No pressure, but the space for his family in safe haven does rely on him saying ""yes"".After some very brief character establishment (references to ""old job"", happy family image etc), we get the first of many set-pieces as an outbreak sweeps across the city and, like many of the set-pieces, it is pretty good stuff. There is plenty of money on the table, lots going on and the scale of it all is suitable for a plot about a global outbreak. The problem is that it never really feels like more than this and the bits in between are not great. The biggest criticism that I can offer is that it did nothing to be other than make me watch the noisy scenes in the way I would with any big blockbuster – and I remind you that I am normally chilled by zombie movies. Here I felt that apart from once or twice, it didn't really do the tension or the horror well, it almost felt too slick, too expensive.To give a contrast, an outbreak in a closed car park in 28 Weeks Later was really horrific to me (in a good way) but here the one on a plane didn't bring that same feeling. It is hard for me to put my finger on it, but for sure something was missing here. The plot doesn't help – jumping around the world without much linkage and asking the viewer to just go with it; perhaps I would if I had cared more, but everyone apart from Brad Pitt seemed so disposable – just fodder for the attack shots, so I did get numb and also feel remote from it all. Technically it is great and it really is well shot and put together, but it is just the lack of atmosphere that hurts it the most.It is a big expensive movie though and as a blockbuster it works well enough to give it a go, but it really never works in the ways that would have made it a much superior film.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
"World War Z is an entertaining, fun night out but not original in the slightest","Finally, after years of facing difficulty with production and resources, World War Z has come our way, and it promises an epic and grandeur scale. The film definitely contains most of the elements fans have always desired in a zombie movie; it actually mixes horror, suspense, and action all in one movie. One act transpires underneath the roofs of a daunting apartment building when another act takes the audience across the world to Israel where the people left are forced to defend themselves against a monstrously colossal horde of zombies as they pile in. There are jump-scares. There are grisly and highly unfortunate deaths.Anyways, the film focuses on Brad Pitt's character (Gerry Lane) who's required to assist the UN with discovering a possible vaccine/cure to the horrifying virus that's spreading throughout the world and turning human beings into ghastly creatures. If he refuses to comply, they'll willingly kick his entire family off a tanker- one of the few safe locations left in the world. From there on, Gerry Lane is forced to transcend country after country in order to secure his family's safety and possibly save humanity. A hell of a lot is at stake, that's for sure.Now, I can definitely state that one of the best aspects of the film is its acting, especially Brad Pitt's, which, as usual, doesn't disappoint. One can clearly witness the fear and terror present in almost every character's eyes, as well as one specific character quite convincingly pulling off the feeling of sheer pain under horrendous circumstances.With that being said, the very beginning of the film starts off a little bizarrely as the pace seems to suffer. With the running time that the movie possesses, such a rich and complex story is compacted to fit its duration, which means right off the bat, we're met with the apocalypse and the zombie outbreak. We only receive a few minutes, if that, of the main family's daily lives until they're cast into the conflict almost instantly. As a result, conversations feel extremely and oddly brief and segments that could've been expanded on feel like they're set on ""fast forward"" in order to get to the ""point."" This means that there's much less space for character development and characterization in general, and zombie movies (or we can say Horror movies as a whole) definitely need to spend some time on their characters so that the audience is able to connect with them and feel for them as they progress on their journey. When they feel fear, we have to feel fear for them as well. Unfortunately, as this is largely a Hollywood blockbuster and not something like 28 Weeks Later, the film has to reach the action-packed bits as soon as possible.And this is when the film will cause a fair amount of decisiveness- the audience who read the book will approach the film differently than the ones who've seen the trailers and are just simply interested in the plot that's promised. I've read up on reviews, and most of the negative reviews originate from the individuals who expected an honest- shall I say- adaptation of the book (this is exactly the issue that faced The Great Gatsby or any other adaptation for that matter). I haven't read the book, which means I don't need to furiously rant about the film's disconnection from its novelistic counterpart. If you haven't read the book, you have no reason to worry about potential disappointment; that's practically reserved for the book's fans. If you're a book fan, on the other hand, you should be expecting the two's differentiation from one another.So, to put it most understandably, if you're entering this movie the way it was marketed, you'll experience a wild, roller-coaster ride that's fairly effective in its capability of featuring some dramatic moments of diplomatic negotiations and political discussions over the world's collapse and then placing you into intensely impossible situations only to be followed by an incredibly suspenseful, nerve-wracking sequence. It's highly entertaininghowever, it's the furthest from originality a film can get. I mean, it's yet another zombie movie, dealing with the entire world under a deadly zombie virus. You've basically seen everything in this movie already as 28 Days Later and 28 Weeks Later highlighted the serious effects of such an event already. In that case- during its first act- World War Z feels unbelievably similar to the two films mentioned above. Especially considering the decision to exclude the more political aspect of the novel and turning the adaptation into an action flick instead, there's not much here that'll bask in uniqueness, really.This all begs the question: how much longer will these numerous entertainment industries create zombie stories after zombie stories? It's time to move on to another fascinating idea. Leave the genre alone, but then again, as long as these studios continue to rake in millions, they'll continually produce the same product. In the end, World War Z is a fun, entertaining night out, but if you can't make it to the showing, don't feel too bad because you've most likely seen everything displayed in this film already.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Read the book instead!!!,"Why buy the rights to an amazing book and yet use less than one percent of the content? In it's own right it's by no means the worst zombie film but as it had such a wonderful body of work into which to delve it really squandered the potential to bring Max Brooks' work to film. It is then, just another zombie film.Very disappointed at the lost opportunity.This is the usual American ""one man out to save the world"" fantasy instead of the insightful view into what we are at our core as humans and how we 1st worlders view blights and plagues when it involves us directly versus how we seem to simply accept that the 3rd world face calamity, war, pestilence and genocide all too regularly.I'm really amazed that stars who don't need the money and who have a history of doing art house and risky movies would be interested in simply cashing in rather than creating something unique and lasting like Fight Club for example.Take an amazing book with a cult following and simply try and stay as close to the text as possible given the cinematic limitations that exist. Not a new or ground breaking concept.Instead we have man versus a multitude of monsters. Using violence and cunning to save the day and return home to the clichéd wife and kids.Such a pity.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
A good not great end of the world story,"Brad Pitt's return to guy flicks is well intended but it does not live up to the high expectations associated with a Pitt film, nor does it do justice to the film's source material.World War Z, based on the bestselling novel of the same name by Max Brooks, follows former U.N. employee Gerry Lane as he scours the globe in search of the cure for a zombie plague.The story perhaps had good intentions and big ambitions during initial drafts but I suppose due to rewrites and editing, this was lost. There was nothing overly special with it but it was not by any means a bad movie. The effects and acting were good, and the plot was fine. For a movie where the main plot point is to search the globe for patient zero and discover the cure to save humanity, one would think there would be some sense of urgency; however, this was not conveyed. The urgency in each situation was there, but for the overall film it seemed he was merely doing his normal, day-to-day job.One issue that has resonated with me is Matthew Fox. As a fan of Lost, I was excited to see him in the movie, but his role is very small, useless, and that of a nameless actor. Perhaps originally he had more of a role and ended up being cut. Fox could have been cut to seem like a cameo appearance or cut altogether but he ended up as nameless ""Parajumper."" Hopefully DVD extras or a sequel will flesh out this awkwardly placed actor.For a zombie movie the director, Marc Forster, played it far too safe. There was very little in terms of gore, blood and violence, which made for a disappointing horror and zombie movie. The previews also gave the impression that World War Z was an action movie but all action is shown in the preview, which could be disappointing for action movie fans.Like many similar movies, we are expected to suspend reality that the hero can face so many obstacles and come out the other side while many sidekicks are lost; this is no different. I am okay with this though, I enjoy the ridiculousness of it anyways. The children in this movie though should have gotten him killed right off the bat, further cementing the idea to drop the kids in the event of zombie apocalypse. They were overly annoying and needy, even for children.Now, in comparison to the book, of which I am a huge fan, it is even more of a let down. The book is an amazing novel that examines both the brutality and compassion of humanity in times of war. It examines different people from all over the world before, during and after the ""Zombie War."" It is more than just another zombie book. Perhaps due to time constraints, budgets, editing or any other number of reasons, the core of the story is lost. The idea of a U.N. investigator travelling the world and the recounts of Israel are the only aspects of the film that resemble the source material. Hopefully Forster is given the opportunity to make the trilogy he imagined and attempt to redeem himself, but due to the problems with the first movie, this seems unlikely.Although this review may seem like I disliked the movie, I actually found it to be quite enjoyable. I am simply very disappointed that the filmmakers made another race against the clock movie, even though it had so much potential to be thought-provoking and original. If only Danny Boyle was behind it; we could have had one of the greatest zombie movie ever created.World War Z was my biggest let down of the year so far. After a great weekend that included Man of Steel and This Is The End, I would suggest passing on it in favor of these more enjoyable movies. I would suggest seeing it at some point as it is a good movie, but it does not need to be on the big screen or in 3D.From the blog: tilfilmdouspart.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Still good after all these years,"I recently re-watched this movie. I had forgotten how good it is. Unlike most zombie movies that tend to focus on a small, isolated group under threat. Typically, one or more of this group are mentally unhinged which adds to the suspense, but that set up has been a cliche for decades now.WWZ takes the opposite approach. It takes the mile high view through the eyes of one scientist, who travels the globe trying to solve the dilemma.The action pieces are imaginative and large scale. Interestingly, the final sequence is scaled right back down to the handful of isolated people for contrast.It's interesting to read of all the behind-the-scenes troubles that plagued the making of this movie. In spite of it all, it all came together to create a very gritty and entertaining movie.I would like to see a sequel to this movie. Pitt's character could put in an appearance, but it could be about a completely new group of people. This movie certainly left that possibility open, but it doesn't look like it's ever going to happen.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"

Simple Yet Very Kinetic,"Simple and typical may be what I may describe this movie. World War Z is good enough not to fall on the classification of lousy or awful. At least it does not drag; the movie is engaging and never ever slows down to cause the slightest bit of boredom. At best, it feels like what I imagine would be a perfectly well-made zombie video game adaptation. I'm sure that the movie has some intellectual or subliminal message hidden in and around the movie, or whatever message the writers want to convey. Whatever it may be, we could not really notice that since the pace of the film is fast and hyperactive. But at least it's never chaotic and messy.On the horror aspect, it effectively does generate some screams and shouts. The scares are moderately efficient, and the zombies do indeed manage to be horrifying, even though they did not need to be extra disgusting and/or gory.Although this may be considered as a zombie movie, it never crosses beyond its PG-13 rating. Meaning, it does not have the usual gore and violence other zombies have. Whatever violence the movie has is never focused or highlighted. It's a horror movie that may be considered ""pretty safe"" for a younger audience.The problem with World War Z is that it's blown its wad by showing some of the best money shots of the movie on its trailer. The flooding stampede of zombies is the film's most impressive and unique eye candy. We've already seen fast zombies, we've also already seen extra-strong zombies (in ""I Am Legend"" they're not exactly zombies, but they have similarities with the zombies in this movie), but we've never seen them like this, the way World War Z presents them. On one point of view, it's refreshingly unique, on another point of view; it's a childish, over-bloated exaggeration of the concept.But the flooding, stampeding zombies; that's the movie's one ace card. Aside from that, the movie is pretty simple horror suspense. What happens in the end is not your typical summer blockbuster climax scene; there's nothing extraordinary, like a big boss fight of some kind. With the way it was executed in the end, it felt like an indie horror movie.But just because it has a quiet ending, it does not mean that it was a bad movie. The ending is consistent and fluid. It's not something impossible, incredible, explosive, or cartoonish. It's simple, and it makes sense that way in a manner consistent with the movie's tone. Overall, World War Z is a moderately good zombie movie; entertaining enough to be worth your money and time. But you will not be missing out on anything if you happen to skip it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
"Light, family friendly and internationally marketable.","Oh, Hollywood. You saw the zombie apocalypse coming didn't you? Not a literal apocalypse of course, just 16 dozen different zombie books, graphic novels, games and TV shows taking over the world like the plague, and you just had to have your piece of the pie, didn't you?World War Z is based on the 2006 novel by Max Brooks. The novel garnered some quite positive reviews, praised for its international and political scope. It also caught the eye of producer and star Brad Pitt, who after a long struggle with studios, directors, producers and other Hollywood zombies, managed to put together a half decent movie with director Marc Forster.Half decent? Well, WWZ certainly isn't a bad movie. You've got the long-time Oscar-deserving Pitt playing Gerry Lane, a likable, good-looking family man who retired as a UN investigator to spend more time around his wife and daughters. This is all about to change obviously, because after the now seemingly mandatory news-footage-montage introduction, Gerry is called back by the UN in exchange for his family's safety on their big boat.It sounds good enough, but the problem is that WWZ's political/international context is nowhere to be found so we're left pretty much to 28 Days Later with blockbuster pretentiousness. Sure, Gerry travels around the world and makes a few long distance phone calls, but there's never anything remotely compelling enough to warrant his travels and whenever the plot does manage to come close to something it quickly sets it aside in the interest of keeping this summer blockbuster light, family friendly and internationally marketable.After Quantum of Solace there was much uncertainty about Forster's ability to direct action and after WWZ, guess what? There still is. Granted, it's never boring, but when the other elements that should've made the film aren't there it should be more than ""never boring"". Paramount's marketing certainly didn't help; if you've seen the trailers then you've seen the whole plot and LITERALLY every single action set piece, in chronological order too. You know when you see a trailer and think ""they put all the good parts in""? Well, this time they put the whole movie in. The more hardcore genre fans might also want to look elsewhere if they're seeking gory zombie kills; there isn't much of that either as its PG-13 rating might suggest.Brad Pitt is really the film's only strength. Much like Tom Cruise, Brad's got enough talent to singlehandedly pull you through a not-so-great movie without you hating him for it. And at almost age 50 you can't really blame him for wanting to star in his own big blockbuster franchise for the first time in his career when he could've played any superhero he wanted years ago. ""Franchise"" of course, if permitted by the audience, because this is one movie that desperately wants to have sequels.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Quality and Fiction vs. Reality,"Bias: Free-Advanced Screening/ Warry of production woes/ Not having read the source material for comparison.Review: Just like any audience member all that I want is a good return on investment; time wise, money wise or some combination of both. A feature film a film can succeed if its critically acclaimed or commercially successful, but money is usually the bottom line in Hollywood. Fortunately in both cases, my advanced screening of World War Z was free, it wasn't overly long and as a bonus I felt quite entertained.What sells me this film initially as a moviegoer is the mystery surrounding the film both narrative and production wise; and the questions it poses , what is the source of the outbreak? How is this effecting everyone and how are certain countries dealing with it? What is the cure? Is there a cure? What perplexes me as an industry analyst is why certain decisions were made regarding the production of the film. Why, for instance would you hire an indie director with only a little mainstream experience (Quantum of Solace) to direct such a large scale film? Or why on earth would you hire Damon Lindelof to write something that needed an ending? Not all these questions get answered but the film is sufficient enough.There hasn't ever been a zombie film on this scale before so this is something at least slightly new and ambitious. I can't say I respect the choice made for it to be an adaptation in name only because I have yet to read the book, and the original script was so well heralded. At least the political subtext lives on in the original source material, and can be be adapted later into a perhaps better film, that maybe shouldn't be tailor made for a mainstream blockbuster audiences. I wouldn't call this a big dumb zombie movie either as it seems like a cheap oversimplification. Funny enough that is what the movie is in regards to its source material.Brad Pitt tries to help Daniella Kertesz keep it together as he's in over his head at 30,000 feet. There were a lot of compromises made for this film, as evidenced by the script doctor leaving the film, the entire third act being replaced, and various re-shoots. The political subtext is nowhere to be found, and various characters are introduced and never show up again. All this was meant to be done in service of the movie and for the most part works. Each character feels real and two dimensional or is at least interesting, the film is well paced. It isn't glaringly obvious this film has holes unless you decide to sit back and think about it after the film is done. There are no major tonal issues or character defects here, but the film does change direction and speed a bit. I have two gripes about this film; one is the Lindelof trademark of characters either getting caught in stupid situations or making stupid decisions to advance the plot, which isn't as annoying as it was in 'Prometheus' or 'Star Trek Into Darkness' but enough to make you roll your eyes. The other gripe is that because this is a straight-forward action-thriller there is nothing for your brains to feast on afterwards. This is digestible B-Level entertainment.Steven Spielberg and George Lucas recently spoke at a USC conference predicting a film industry implosion. Production companies are spending more and more money on fewer and fewer films, and all its going to take is a few of them to bomb before everything comes crashing down (Say for instance; this film, The Lone Ranger, and Pacific Rim). The problem with this film is that quality wise it is not a great return on investment for it's 200 million+ Hollywood price tag or a $15 theatre ticket for the audience, I wouldn't pay full price for this movie in pointless 3D, but I'm sure a compromise of some sorts can be worked out.Verdict: B/+1/ Worth seeing on cheap Tuesday but not in 3D",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
"Fast, scary and much better than expected!","I was dubious! The rating, the early reviews, my love of gory George Romero movies had all led me to deciding not to see this. But, my wife wanted to go... Well, two breathless hours later I turned to her, big grin on my face and had to state ""That was awesome!"" Yes, I can see why people don't like it. It is very different to the traditional zombie movie, and very different to the book. But you know what, who cares - it's not a traditional zombie movie, or the book - it's different. So suck it it up whiners and enjoy this for what it is! (And I'm a huge fan of all Max Brooks zombie books.) The movie begins with a short intro to the main character and his family (it was enough, it told me all I needed to know) before launching into a fantastic, break neck sequence that establishes the pace for most of the rest of the movie. It's violent, visceral and shocking without any reliance in gore. The tension is racked up (especially in the escape from the apartment block sequence) with a series of spectacular set pieces (the walls of Jerusalem scene is brilliant) and things get better and bigger until the film slows the pace for the final reel with a slow burning, smaller scale sequence set in a WHO research lab in the UK. It's an unusual choice to end a movie with the smallest set piece, but it worked well for me as it was in line with Gerry's quest and the (stated in the movie) fact that the answer is often so small it gets overlooked. The gravity of the decisions Gerry has to make here are greater than any previously in the movie (where mostly he just has to run like hell!) and it's that that makes this such a powerful set piece to end the movie. I learnt several things from this movie 1) to let go of my preconceptions about what a zombie film should be, 2) that a low rating doesn't mean its for kids - I have two sons and despite the lack of gore I certainly wouldn't let then see this. Its very intense and that (not the gore) is what would scare them. 3) to go with the flow - I did here and was swept along for a rapid fire 2 hour thrill ride that was a hell of a lot of fun. I for one will be getting this on blu ray and I'll be first in line for any sequel. But I will admit, an undated version would be very welcome!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Brad Pitt vs. the Zombies,"A highly entertaining, fast-paced zombie flick. It does not waste more than five minutes before introducing the zombies and from then on it is no sleep for mr. Pitt. If you like suspense, action and zombies, WWZ is definitely a must-see. Had I seen this on DVD, and not in the theater, I would have screamed out loud several times.The title is a little misleading, I think. Definitely, a world war is happening in the movie, but it is not where the focus is - the focus is on Brad Pitt and his family. You get to see the world destroyed by zombies, don't worry, but it is more a case of Brad Pitt saving the world than the army saving the world, and this is my main criticism of this movie. Why is Brad Pitt the only one who can figure out what to do all the time? I think he is too superhero-like in the movie, and that took away some of the realism, which is much needed in zombie flicks to not make it too far out there. On the other hand, it was a nice change to see the zombie apocalypse from the point of view of someone working with the system to stop it, rather than from a ""normal"" person's point of view, who is hiding and trying to survive. We have seen that many times, and it is fascinating to imagine to be in that situation, but WWZ is a nice new angle. Expect Die Hard meets 28 Days Later rather than The Walking Dead.And, damn, this movie is scary! The zombies, ones you get to see them up close, are so creepy and so so fast - I was jumping in my seat hoping Brad Pitt and Co. would run faster. I had adrenaline pumping through my body leaving the theater and I almost ran to the car.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Something new in an overloaded genre,"Yeah, since they hit the mainstream zombie movies have died an (un)death many times over, and I can't help but hark back to the old days where only horror fans knew of the genius of George Romero and Lucio Fulci. Nowadays zombie movies are ten-a-penny and zombies are in the public consciousness alongside vampires and werewolves.But WORLD WAR Z offers something new: the first, straight, big-budget zombie blockbuster. Sure, PLANET TERROR skirted with the premise but with a sci-fi twist, while this is straightforward zombie stuff. It's based on the terrible Max Brooks book of the same title, but don't let that put you off; unlike the book, it actually has a structured narrative, and characters.And I loved it. I'm not normally a fan of CGI unless it's done right, but it's done right here. Scenes of the zombies attacking en masse are brilliantly conceived, and the set-piece that takes place in Israel in the middle of the movie is simply phenomenal. It's a film that also manages to be vicious and frightening without being gory, which is a fine achievement. If you thought the infected in 28 DAYS LATER moved fast then you haven't seen anything yet!Sure, the characters are thinly-sketched, but that matters little as WORLD WAR Z follows an action-thriller template. Brad Pitt's lead is both the luckiest and unluckiest guy on the planet at the same time, and the film never deviates from getting up close and personal with its undead menace. The worst thing about it is Marc Forster's fuddled direction, something that also spoiled QUANTUM OF SOLACE, but it's not a big enough to detraction to stop this from being anything other than a solid film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
World War Z - excellent.,"World War Z can only be described in one word - excellent. I recommend this movie to those who like action, adventure and horror movies. But it would also be good for those who aren't really crazy about movies of this genre to watch it. The movie offers entertainment like we haven't seen in a long time. It doesn't waste much time with unnecessary scenes. The adventure starts at 5 minutes and ends 1 minute before the end of the movie.The only flaw is that in some scenes the camera is faster than it needs to be to follow the movie, but it's not a huge bother. Brad Pitt, who is also one of the producers, plays the main role brilliantly. The two main female actresses - Mireille Enos and Daniella Kerz are amazing as well. The film also features David Morse and Matthew Fox in cameo roles, along with the main international cast, which includes - Pierfrancesco Favino, Moritz Bleibtreu, Nikola Djuricko, and many others.In other words, this movie is not a work of art, but it relaxes to the limit, and that is a very important fact when watching a movie. If you want a small escape from reality and relax, watch this high-budget movie of 190 million dollars, where 120 minutes of adventure await you.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"

"Nothing to Do With the Book, Except for the Zombies","The trailer for this film was very exciting. It did not show anything really about what the film was about, except for some big unknown event that was turning the city into sudden chaos one morning.I found out that there was a book that inspired this film, so I sought it out to read it. I was surprised to discover that this book, and I guess likewise the film, is about ZOMBIES! The trailers (wisely, I thought) did NOT show zombies at all. The book by Max Brooks was a compilation of short man vs. zombie stories which were happening all over the world.More than 50% into the book, I did not read any scene that remotely resembled the scenes shown in the trailer. I was ready at that point to concede that this Brad Pitt film will have nothing to do with the book except for the main fighting a worldwide zombie infestation premise. And I turned out to be right.""World War Z"", the film, is about Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt), a UN special operations agent, who had retired from that job to be with his family. (This character Gerry Lane was NOT even in the book.) We follow Gerry's adventures as it starts in his home town of Philadelphia, PA, as we saw in the trailer, when he gets his family to safety, and was then assigned to play a vital role in the zombie fight.The rest of the film brings Gerry to Korea, Israel, and Wales as he was able to observe and hypothesize a possible weakness in these zombies. The latter third of the film happens in a WHO facility where he was able to actually conduct the experiment he needed to prove his theory. Can Gerry discover the key to turn the tide of the war to the human's favor or will the zombies continue to spread their plague?The zombie scenes were NOT unnecessarily gory. There were NO scenes of exploding heads or trailing guts or gushing body fluids which are commonly seen in other zombie movies, even as these were very graphically described in the book. While horror purists would call this lame, the way it was done in this film was not any less exciting, yet makes this movie more accessible to more people. This could have been a spectacular gore fest, but obviously the filmmakers had a different vision in mind.The scenes of the mass zombie attacks were very well-executed by the computer-generated visual effects. The Jerusalem scenes were especially disturbing and heart-racing. The scenes on the Belarus Airlines jet plane were also exciting as they were unbelievable.They try their best to give credible scientific approach to the problem, and I would give them props for that. This is even if the plan was on the simplistic side, and shaky in the medical sense. Opportunistic infections, anyone? However, they did prepare us for that solution by the statement a character makes at the beginning of the mission.Brad Pitt did well as the lead actor. He was practically the only known name in the cast, and he dominates the screen with this star presence. Yet, we can still empathize with his character Gerry and the difficult situations he got into, no matter how incredibly lucky or superhuman he may have become. He had a ""sort-of"" commercial for a particular soft- drink brand towards the end, which was amusing, yet still well- integrated in the action of the scene.Even if the film had almost nothing to do with the book, I found this movie quite absorbing and intense, and ultimately entertaining and satisfying. Maybe they should have just changed the title.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
I liked this movie very much,"The zombie genre gets crowded day by day, but World War Z is one of the smartest films out there as this is more of a pandemic than a zombie movie. It gave the most realistic portrayal of zombies ever done before. It isn't hopeless at all like other zombie films either. It is short, dramatic, fast-pacing. WWZ centers around a former UN investigator with some knowledge about infectious disease, traveling the world, trying to get a fix on the zombie outbreak problem. Hats off to the visual guys for making it all look and feel frighteningly thrilling. The best part of this film is the speed of the zombies here, they move faster than typical zombies. Some of the crazy shots with the zombies are so breath-taking that it literally got my eyes glued to the screen.

"""Daddy, what's martial law?""","Brad Pitt gets to nail his colours as an ecologically concerned citizen in this relentlessly grim and straight-faced adaptation of Max Brooks' novel that demonstrates once again that the writing was on the wall long before the pandemic that recently engulfed the world.Clearly patterned after Steven Spielberg's recent version of 'The War of the Worlds' this provides a worm's eye view of a global catastrophe. The date isn't specified, but a wise Israeli professor at one point says ""back in 2010"". Starting quietly with scenes of cozy domesticity, the encroaching calamity initially reported at a safe distance with radio reports of a rabies outbreak in Taiwan culminates in chaos engulfing the entire planet.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
A great modern-day zombie flick!,"As a regular horror movie, it has everything you want. There are some genuine, high-quality scare moments that will make you jump. The infected look creepy as hell, yet realistically believable. THIS COULD HAPPEN RIGHT NOW. THERE COULD BE A HUMAN-ZOMBIE TIDAL WAVE OF BODIES FLOWING DOWN THE STREET OUTSIDE YOUR JOB RIGHT NOW, WAITING TO ENGULF YOU AS SOON AS YOU TAKE YOUR FIRST STEP OUTSIDE. AND IT WOULD LOOK EXACTLY LIKE THIS. Visually, it is beautiful in its realism, and gives you an idea of how an outbreak like this would actually look in a huge city. Combine that with Brad Pitt bringing his A-game, and you've got yourself a good time.As a zombie movie, there are some things to notice. Typically, your zombie falls into 1 of 2 categories - slower and stupid (your Walking Dead - Resident Evil type), and fast and animal-like (Left 4 Dead, Zombieland, Dawn of the Dead). World War Z goes with type 2, clearly the worse of the two choices in terms of survival, but best in terms of an intense, action-horror movie.Now, this being a zombie movie at its core, there are a couple of clichés that even Brad Pitt can't avoid, like the mass looting of the surviving population, the fact that huge, technologically advanced cities and governments can't figure out how to keep a damn virus from wrecking everything, or the...ugh, going any further with this is a spoiler. Just know that there'll be one point where you'll say, ""there's always THAT guy..."" But still, these are very minor complaints in an otherwise beautifully done movie.Some people might take issue with the lack of blood or gore, but in all honesty, I was so deep into the story and suspense that I forgot this was PG-13.World War Z is a great modern day zombie flick, and a great movie all-around. The 3D is beautiful, but this movie is going to be beautiful either way, so that's really your preference. 9 out of 10 on the BDBOS. Go see it!!!

World War Z Review,"Former United Nations employee Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt) must keep him and his family alive from the zombie apocalypse. Gerry Lane has to travel around the world with a race against time in order to find an antidote and stop the zombie outbreak.I was very excited to watch World War Z, the trailers looks superb and not many zombie apocalypse films are released now a days. Before the film was released I found it had a huge build up in order to become the summer blockbuster. However is World War Z the action packed thriller for this summer? No, no it isn't.The story of World War Z was very vague as the summary of the story is simply ""Kill Zombies. Find Cure"". Many scenes in the films were very predictable for example there is a scene where Gerry Lane is in a near death experience however because your only twenty minutes into the film and his the main character, you know he will survive. World War Z was an 'enjoyable' zombie film however it was nowhere as good as Dawn of the Dead or Zombieland. Brad Pitt is the only well known actor in the film who does a brilliant job of playing the character Gerry Lane. I thought that Gerry's wife and children had the most pointless roles in the film, I would of preferred it if Gerry Lane was by alone and had to survive the zombie apocalypse instead of hiding in a helicopter or plane for most of the film. The only part of the film I particularly enjoyed was when Gerry was in Jerusalem and there was millions of zombies behind a wall forcing them to jump and collide on each other forming a tower of zombies. The CGI in the film was impressive however I felt like there was too many zombies in World War Z if that is possible and the actual zombies in the film can only be described in two words fast and furious. The filming locations are interesting in this film are you don't know where Gerry is going next from the streets of Philadelphia to slums of Jerusalem. This film was directed by Marc Foster who directed Quantum of Solace which in my opinion was the least best Daniel Craig Bond film. As this is an action movie there are no complaints about the action in this film, they were brilliant many action scenes of the films made me on the edge of my seat wanting to know who Gerry is going to escape this disaster. When the film ends it finishes with this quote ""If you can fight, fight. Be prepared for anything. Our war has just began"". This quote left me thinking please don't say they are making a sequel for this film they have found the antidote to stop the zombie horde for gods sake.All in all World War Z was an enjoyable zombie apocalypse film, the action scenes lead you at the edge of your seat. However the story could've been more thrilling or at least more entertaining.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"

Brad Pitt was very awesome as always. i just saw it an hour ago and i can't stop thinking about it. it is an apocalyptic end of the world horror film, it is about survival and protecting your family. you would maybe need to hide your face from the scariness during some parts. it was truly awesome though.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
"World War Z may have some fundamental storytelling issues, but it is undeniably enjoyable.","This is one of those films where my rating shifts constantly between two scores. Depending on what mood I'm in, I'll either give it the better score or the lower. Today, I'm willing to give it the better score. In a decade where we have The Walking Dead and other popular zombie films, World War Z tries to set itself apart from the rest by injecting action set pieces rather than pure horror. The globe is hit with a pandemic, a virus that if contracted within 12 seconds you'll be turned into a 'zombie'. The dreaded Z word that strikes fear into the heart of many...except our protagonist's family who seems to be calmer than most oceans. Like seriously, zombies are ravaging people in the middle of New York City and they are so cool and calm it's as if they witness this everyday! But yes, this is a typical zombie formula where we go from point A to B to C and to D in order to find answers. Along the way, the film is fuelled by exhilarating set pieces ranging from New York City, raining South Korea and dusty Jerusalem. It's utterly watchable and does keep me captivated for its entire runtime. Despite the atrocious human visual effects for the hordes of zombies (which...is just horrendously bad), I like their mannerisms. Little idiosyncrasies like chattering of the teeth, consistent spasms in the arm and, my favourite, nose diving off buildings. Zombie missiles as such, minus the explosion. Brad Pitt holds every scene in a quieter performance than usual. His wit has been substituted for focus and fear simultaneously, and it works. Liked the members of WHO but all over cast members were wasted. What I cannot stand are the huge amount of conveniences in the plot. Wherever our main character goes, trouble shortly arrives. Call it bad luck or convenience, it's uninspired and formulaic regardless. I can't shake it off. Having said that, it's enjoyable for what it is. It holds my attention and is well made...just has a few niggles that I can't forgive.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
"For originality and finesse it fails, but it's fast, furious, and Brad Pitt makes it gel","World War Z (2013)In short: another formula disaster film. Well made, some great acting (and some not so great), and some good scary scenes, and maybe that's enough. It is, after all, a summer movie.But it could have been different. Having the zombies sprint and have superhuman resistance to getting hurt makes for exciting scenes of mass chaos and running and running. It speeds up the normal dread and fear of the classic Romero style zombies. But it also makes the whole thing kind of just a sensation, and it borders on silly, or it would if so many people weren't getting killed and zombified.The whole movie is about excess, everything speeded up and boiling down to confrontation and decision on the spot. There is almost zero expectation or suspense. In fact, one of the clearly best scenes in the movie comes near the end when Brad Pitt (who is great throughout) has a one-on-one with a zombie through a glass door. It takes time, it has the audience wondering. It isn't just about shock and reaction to shock, but about anticipating shock. And then, yes, you don't always need the shock.Pitt's wife in this is a bore and it's not really her fault. She is given the role of being a good wife and protecting their children, which she does. The only woman with substance is a little known Israeli woman (actress Daniella Kertesz) and even she becomes someone Pitt has to save. Which he does. With style and a little out there medical treatment (I mean before they get on the plane!). Ha. The movie is really quite fun and fast and zippy. If it's obvious and superficial, maybe I expect too much.But wait, aren't there other movies that go here and do better at making it work on several levels? Like ""Children of Men"" which has a similar futuristic chaotic vision and yet lots of novel turns and much more amazing filming. ""World War Z"" is not filmed badly by any means, but it depends a lot on fast cuts (and multiple cuts) which create that barrage effect rather than a more coherent following the action through the disaster, which works better for the viewer.And then there is the issue of plausibility. I know, who cares? Well, on some level it changes how you take the movie. If it is just comic book stuff, and the superhero can do anything, then whatever, sure (though even superheroes have rules of play). But for example they realize at some point a way to work around the way the zombies attack anyone living so quickly, and yet don't explain or suggest at all how the zombies would know one kind of victim from another. (I'm trying not to give anything away.) They just ""know"" and this becomes a chink in their armor.I don't know. I found it frustrating just as much as fun. I saw it in 3-D and that was dispensable, I think. I mean--it's a novelty, but the movie doesn't really need it. There's plenty of depth, and action, and visual complexity, without it. Save the three bucks unless you're a devotee.Thanks Brad Pitt for holding this all together. He dominates every scene, and for good reason. And look at the original book, which has a lot of differences (like no main character) and a unique construction (as a U.N. official document). This is an adaptation, and it borrows from the clichés with heavy-handed dependability.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
"Highly Entertaining, Globe-trotting Epic","World War Z, while based off the Max Brooks novel of the same name, is in no way a direct adaptation, and happily, this works for the film's benefit. When Gerry Lane, a former UN worker is tasked to help a scientist travel across the planet to discover a cure for the rapidly growing zombie infection, he also is troubled by leaving his family behind while the world around him collapses into chaos.Directed by Marc Forster, WWZ is easily one of the most entertaining and epic zombie films ever made. Now this being said, many zombie fanatics will disagree, I know this, as some think you need bloody/gory violence and flesh-tearing. This movie proves otherwise, and the zombies here are among the most frightening zombies I've ever seen, being very reminiscent of the ""rage-infused"" zombies of 28 Days Later. Brad Pitt is at his A-Game here, being both believable as a father and an unsung hero. Mireille Enos was great as Karin Lane, being the very sensitive, but careful mother who knows how to deal with the situation instead of screaming her head off when zombies are at her back. The cinematography is absolutely stunning and breath-taking, especially after the incredible plane crash sequence. The music by Marco Beltrami is award-worthy, capturing both the horrific atmosphere of a collapsing world and human drama of what we're capable of in such disastrous times. The script, though, while well-written, went from being Oscar-material, to a normal blockbuster script that (happily) doesn't insult your intelligence, or become stupid. But there is plenty of room to make a sequel or two because the story here is much to grand for one film.Overall, World War Z is one of the best blockbusters of the year, with good acting, directing, and polished visuals that have you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. I would have to say, this is one of Brad Pitt's best films",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Zombie v2.0,"I haven't read the book and am therefore not making a comparison against the book.As a zombie flick on the whole, it is definitely quite different. These are not the traditional slow moving, flesh tearing zombies reminiscent of the Walking Dead walkers or the more classical types. It's zombies v2.0, the faster ones, featured in Resident Evil 5 (the game) and the creatures from I Am Legend. So if you consider this expectation or aspect, then your experience with this movie might be different.The severe lack of blood and biting also makes this movie depart from the classical sense. After all that's said and done, I actually did find this movie 'refreshing' from the usual zombie apocalypse movies. You didn't have large groups of people with a set of melodramatic characters who are quick to whine about every decision made by the group. There is also no cases of a group holed up in any place and surviving the apocalypse. Therefore, there's very less of the older zombie movie formula.If, like me, you've got a good dose of classic zombie or zombie v1.0, then you might find this movie refreshing. Add to that, there are quite a number of intense moments that will keep you on the edge of your seat. There is also another interesting aspect that this film handles which is rarely ever dealt with in classic zombie flicks. I can't give that part away without revealing a spoiler.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
It's NOT a zombie movie... It's ten times better than that!,"If you like zombie movies, don't bother with this movie! It has nothing in common with zombie movies except that it happens that when the virus kills humans they start spreading the virus by biting.So, for an avid zombie lover, the movie is an absolute disappointment. I hate zombie movies. In fact, I didn't want to go just because I was told it was a zombie movie. But I was seriously bored and I thought ""Come on, cut Brad some slack. The guy is very careful with his choices"". So I went mainly or the pop corn, but I was blown away by the movie.Incredible camera work! Solid script. As usual with Hollywood for the past decade or more, scripts are not as good as used to be so I gave this one 8 out ten, missing two points as the some tiny bits in the script could have been better. But, I am definitely buying the DVD.I absolutely recommend it (unless you wanna go for some zombie action). I loved every minute of it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
The EOW genre is constantly evolving — there is no reason why this film should be limited in terms of narrative scope,"tl;dr - Set aside expectations related to the zombie genre and enjoy World War Z as a disaster popcorn flick.**********Max Brook's muscular, world weary ""oral history of the zombie war"", a thinly veiled geo-political mouthpiece on the world at large seen through the eyes of an agent working for the UN, has taken shape and form through a movie of the same name — World War Z. But make no mistake about both being made from the same mold.Rather than pander to the novel's ambitious fictional output of global perspectives (survivors from virtually every continent on Earth were interviewed by the novel's narrator) — this summer flick directed by Marc Forster (Quantum of Solace, Finding Neverland, Stranger than Fiction) is sensibly scaled down on politicking and military machismo. With a tried and tested sci-fi disaster formula, the result works fairly well on its own terms.Vastly different from Brook's scathing, testosterone driven bestseller and the archetypal zombie gore fest; this latest End-of-World extravaganza is less tired and less verbose. By virtue of that, translates to a much more engaging experience.**********Brief Synopsis: After decades of living in risky, high-stakes existence as a UN investigator; Gerry Lane (Pitt) is now comfortably retired to a cozy, domestic life in Philadelphia with loving wife, Karen (Mireille Enos) and two young daughters. Problem is that a mysterious virus has spiraled out of control and gone global, resulting in a win-win proposition from former colleague Thierry -- the state guarantees refuge and protection for Gerry's family in exchange for his unrivaled field expertise.Thus we are immediately whisked to the main exposition -- Gerry, accompanied by the Navy SEAL and a virologist (developing the vaccine) traverses international borders in search of patient zero -- the journey spans South Korea and Israel, to the WHO in Wales and eventually Canada.Trivia: The novel places origin of the zombie outbreak in Dachang, Hebei. Incidentally, the film hypothesizes with narratives about the spread of SARS as a deadly epidemic. It can therefore be understood, that the virus in WWZ is implied to have begun in Northern China.**********It is no controversy that World War Z is plagued with production troubles and the screenplay has undergone a few re-writes, but manifestations of this in film authorship isn't grave or jarring. To the contrary; Forster's version has softened Brook's high-minded hyperbole in exchange for a modest, grounded and back-to-basics approach — this makes for undeniable commercial appeal.Visually, after a cumbersome and erratically edited zombie rampage sequence in the first act, DP Ben Seresin (Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen) and special effects rebound with impressive large scale photography. The outbreak of zombie hordes in Jerusalem's disaster sequence deserve mention — it is here that the narrative's kinesthetic urgency receives a healthy dose of adrenaline. Action aficionados will be pleased.Seresin's chaotic apocalypse overrun by waves of running undeads is also given counterweight by a quiet, noble dimension found in Gerry's measured and cool-in-crisis stoicity. Brad Pitt's iconic persona as a humanitarian in real life, may very well have influenced his portrayal of Gerry, infusing the kind of personality and screen image that transforms naturally in a Hollywood film.But the cleverest stroke in characterization, is that of Israeli soldier Segen (Daniella Kertesz). A sound approach in keeping characters fresh and creative is that material be produced with caveats in mind. Flat, boilerplate stereotypes of women being one example of many. For this reason, I was surprised to discover that much of the film's feistier, more relevant survivalist moments originate from her flair for timing and intuition.All being said, preconceived notions about what zombie films should and ought to be have divided zombie lovers into two main groups. Fans of Romero's classics may prefer depictions of slow-moving zombies (Night of the Living Dead, The Walking Dead), while others embrace the idea of super sprinters (28 Days Later, 2004 Dawn of the Dead). The good news is that this debate, when filtered through the lens of a global disaster flick, becomes irrelevant (or less so). I guess my point is the EOW genre is constantly evolving, there is no reason why this film should be limited in terms of narrative scope.The only real complaint is an excessively dramatized, prolonged exchange between an infected doctor and Gerry in the film's final act. You get less awkward, more authentic moments between Rick Grimes and the bicycle zombie girl back in Atlanta. But that's another apocalypse.cinemainterruptus.wordpress.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
"The movie's okay, but I can't wait for Hollywood to give up on zombies","An okay zombie movie. I think the film's main fault is that it does nothing new with the monster. These are basically the same zombies we saw in 28 Days/Weeks Later, except they kind of drop the whole virus angle fairly shortly in and just admit they're dealing with the undead. The plot has a U.N. operative (Brad Pitt) traversing the world trying to figure a way out of the crisis. Pitt is excellent. There are some fantastic set pieces, and the film moves extremely quickly. I'd call it more suspense than horror here - I do think the PG-13-ization hurts the film a bit. I'm not a huge gore guy, but the constant cutting away from any violence starts to get old after a while. I wonder if there'll be an R-rated director's cut on video - that might be a better film. The actual solution to the problem is pretty lame, and not especially believable. I must say, Marc Forster does a fine job here as director. After Quantum of Solace, no one in their right mind should have let him near an action movie again. He proves himself quite capable, though. I'd recommend this, though maybe not that strongly.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Sweepingly epic but a little too late.,"A mysterious virus like infection spreads rapidly throughout the world and a man in order to guarantee his family safety is tasked to locate the origin of the outbreak and assist in finding a cure.Without drawing comparison to Max Brooks' novel, World War Z's impact has been slightly numbed but the influx and saturation of zombie/virus films churned out over recent years. Nevertheless, under Marc Forster's direction WWZ is epic in scale with its sweeping scope and impressive special effects. Forster wisely focuses on Brad Pitt who is superb as ex UN official and family man Gerry Lane. Although the film may have benefited from an unknown actor for impact to Pitts credit he adds gravitas to the role as he journeys from one continent to another encountering perils and avoiding hordes of the twitching contaminated. The supporting cast give a solid backbone although no one stands out as being particularly memorable.The reanimated are wonderfully well done, menacing and for the most part scary - especially in numbers. The limited makeup design on show is excellently crafted, although there's explosions, fire fights the gore is limited and the film is not necessarily blatantly horrific as one would expect - this works both for and against depending on your expectations. That said, there's enough action and tension to keep the causal viewer happy. For the harden zombie fans there's atmosphere, finely executed visuals, memorably the immense birds eye views of the swarming population like ants and a calibre of realism not found in the majority of films this genre.With a genuine on location feel and despite being reminiscent of 28 Days/Weeks later with fast infected Forster delivers a globe trotting disaster flick with less deliberate rough edges. The communication between the infected is interesting, including their dormant state. What also works at times is an old school horror approach, there's lots of moments where the sound design leaves it to the viewers imagination. Notably though the editing and screenplay does pander to the masses, offering paint by numbers solutions and outcomes. For example the Israel segment (filmed in Malta) takes a little too long for Gerry to hone in on the noise leaving the viewer too much time to digest and anticipate what's going to happen next which robs the scene of much of its intended impact and tension.Nevertheless, the Moscow heroic like ending was infamously re-shot for a more quieter, personal closing and Gerry wife's fidelity left intact, which in my mind works better, more true to Gerry's every man personality and the set up that came before.All in all the apocalyptic vision is a solid, realistic and heartfelt entry if somewhat too late (in a saturated genre) to achieve greatness. Let's hope for a sequel that surpasses this with Pitt on board again.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Interesting to watch after the Lockdown,"Life for former United Nations investigator Gerry Lane and his family seems content. Suddenly, the world is plagued by a mysterious infection turning whole human populations into rampaging mindless zombies. After barely escaping the chaos, Lane is persuaded to go on a mission to investigate this disease.I watched this when it was first released and liked it as an adventure film. However I came across the DVD and decided to watch it in retrospect of the Lockdown.Far from the worlds great and good working together to find a solution, our response was to Lockdown hoping that that would solve the problem: quickly realising it would not solve it, but might slow it somewhat.What was interesting was that they found no cure for COVID, but all Govt's around the world adopted the same dogmatic approach of masks, distancing and isolating, even knowing that these would have no impact whatsoever. So why waste time and money on such endeavours? A project that has cost the world greatly in many different ways and the repercussions will last for generations.It's interesting to see Hollywood's approach which is much more simple and functional. Find a way to not get infected, then find a way to kill the virus.As a film this was fabulous entertainment. As a means of showing us where we get things right and where we get them wrong it was also very helpful. Let's hope if there is another pandemic we will cope much better?Deserves a 7 for an entertaining and suspenseful plot.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"

"So much better than most zombie films, but still only average.","There are some things that you get to feel in your bones after watching a lot of movies, one of those feelings that something is wrong at places. I have not read the book the film is based on, but I was having these spider-sense tinglings that some scenes could not have been in the book.Also, the plot reminded me too much of a book I hated with all my heart: The Passage, by Justin Cronin. It starts with character building scenes mingled smartly with action and suspense, than Blam! Reset! A lot of crafty special effects follow that last more than the character building scenes, then there are no characters left. All but the main character get to move to the next stage. Then it starts all over again. It does this at least three times. It gets old and annoying.You have to see this from my perspective: I've watched movies like 28 Hours Later, where complex characters and spooky music create a truly horrorful atmosphere. I've seen things like Night of the Living Dead, filled with social commentary that made the film interesting beside the moving corpses. I have seen films that use plot devices like crammed spaces to build up what they can't possibly build with their allotted budget. The problem with World War Z is that is it perfectly made, tons of special effects, many locations, scary running zombies (in hordes!), but the story is the same lame ""lone hero does all the work and saves the day"". In 3D, no less!This can be felt painfully in the last scenes, when really well known and good British and German and Italian actors play secondary roles that anyone could have played. It was like a weird twist on the Statue of Liberty text: give us your best and we'll give them mediocre roles, because we have the budget.Bottom line: so much better than most zombie films, but still only average. I know it seems contradictory, but that's how I feel about it. I will read the book only to see if I was right feeling that all those extra scenes were off somehow.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
World War Z: Zombies on the roll.,"World War Z is about an dreadful virus spread across many nations. One Spec Ops put his foot forward to find the reason and try getting an answer for it. Its powerful as an content, fun for action lovers as things keep happening which doesn't allow any Loo Breaks for audience.Zombies are on an roll this time as they are fast, senses details very fast and are hungry for living body. Brad pitt is great as usual.The movie begins with a short intro to the main character and his family (it was enough, it told me all I needed to know) before launching into a fantastic, break neck sequence that establishes the pace for most of the rest of the movie. It's violent, visceral and shocking without any reliance in gore. The tension is racked up (especially in the escape from the apartment block sequence) with a series of spectacular set pieces (the walls of Jerusalem scene is brilliant) and things get better and bigger until the film slows the pace for the final reel with a slow burning, smaller scale sequence set in a WHO research lab in the UK. It's an unusual choice to end a movie with the smallest set piece, but it worked well for me as it was in line with Gerry's quest and the (stated in the movie) fact that the answer is often so small it gets overlooked.World War Z is perfect masala entertainer. Prefer watching it in 2-D as there is no room for 3-D.Cheers !!!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Well tailored zombie movie,"The maker of this move really understood the ingredients of a good zombie movie, any zombie enthusiast would enjoy. Unlike what most people think, it's not about the gore (which this movie truly lacks in a good way).

This movie has it all in the right proportion.The geeks would be satisfied with the sci-fi side of it all. The mystery of the infection, and the subtle but quite fulfilling explanation throughout the movie.The action and visual effect is nothing less than stunning. I was in awe most of the scene.Never in a long time that a movie made me grip the handle of my seats because it's so thrilling.

Another Big Budget with No Script,"World War Z (2013)** (out of 4)Brad Pitt plays a U.N. worker who must leave his family behind and go search for a cause or cure for a zombie outbreak that is pretty much destroying every form of life. On his mission he must travel across the globe trying to see what might work in the human's defense of the zombies. I'll admit upfront that I haven't read the book that this film is based on so I can't comment on if it butchered the book or if the film got it right. That aspect of the conversation just doesn't bother me but what does bother me is that we've got an insanely high budget and yet they couldn't work out some sort of interesting story. For the most part we just see Brad Pitt going from one beautiful location to the next and we see that the once beautiful place is now full of zombies. Every once in a while Mr. Pitt has to walk through dark hallways and what really hurts the film is that these sequences just aren't scary. In fact, I'm going to say it right out loud that there wasn't a single scary moment to be found in this picture and the entire ""disaster"" aspect of what was going on just didn't work for me. Never did I feel that the world was really coming to an end and this is a big-budget that can't pull this off yet look at what someone like Romero did in no money. Another problem is that the zombies are all rather bland whether they're real effects or the majority of them CGI. They're not scary, no creative and the lack of gore shouldn't be bashed because you don't need gore to be scary but at the same time when you have the violence off-screen it just makes the film seem rather childish. Pitt offers a nice performance but this is certainly far from his best. It was nice seeing David Morse and the rest of the supporting players are good as well. I don't know what was wrong with the final third of the movie where they had to go back and film a new one but what we got here just doesn't work as its too slow and boring. WORLD WAR Z, sadly, is delivered as a very disappointing movie no matter if you're familiar with the original source or not.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
"A great action movie, but far from perfect...","Well, as much as ""World War Z"" was hyped up and as it was the summer's big zombie movie, and me being the zombie aficionado that I am, of course I had to go watch it.The movie, however, left me somewhat ambivalent. There were aspects and parts of the movie that were really great and nice, while other aspects and parts of the movie were quite the opposite.First, let me start off with the things that I didn't particularly cared much for. The biggest issue for me was, of course, the running zombies. I never have cared much for agile and running zombies, nor will I ever get to do so. Sure, I can understand it in this movie as the infected was recently turned. But that leads me to the second issue in the movie which I didn't appreciate or understand. If everything here happened in the course of 2-3 days and the zombies were ""fresh"" (read, recently turned), then how come they all looked emancipated and like they had been decaying and decomposing for about 2-3 weeks? It just didn't make any sense.Also the massive pile ups of zombies as they stacked up to scale the walls in Israel of the sides of towering apartment buildings, that didn't really go well with me. Sure it looked cool and it was a new concept idea to bring to the genre. But come on, it was just too much.Without giving away anything of the ending of the movie, then it was really, really anti-climatic. It was like the movie producers realized that they were over the estimated time-slot and budget and had to wrap it up quickly. The ending was abrupt and too much of a happy Hollywood ending.So what was good about the movie? Well, there was an overload of action, right from the very first minutes and up to the very end. There is a lot of adrenaline and speed to the movie. And it worked out well with the panoramic views of the various cities, when you saw all the infected running around in massive hordes. It was on an epic scale actually. I loved those scenes (eventhough I can't stand running zombies). They looked awesome and there was just something dark about them and a sense of looming doom.The scenes in Philadelphia and Israel were fantastic, they really made good use of the locations and the cinematography here. Great shots and a good sense of panic here in the scenes. However, when the movie went to Korea it was a bit anti-climatic. The military airport in Korea came off as something from a distant era. It was all dark and in small, enclosed areas most of the time. You didn't really have the sense of this was a military area in one bit. And when the movie took us to the viral facility in Ireland, well that was just great. Sure, it was in sterile rooms and long corridors lit up by florescent lights, but it worked so well.As much as I don't really consider myself a fan of Brad Pitt, then he actually did a good job in this movie. However, there weren't really any over-the-top performances in ""World War Z"" from anyone. People did good jobs with their given roles, but no one in particular stood out. The characters they portrayed, however, tended to come off a one-dimensional and you never really got to the heart and core of any of the characters. As such, they were very impersonal and could just as well just had been hollow caricatures.I am giving ""World War Z"" a 6 out of 10 rating, because it is a good action movie full of adrenaline, but there were gaps and holes in the storyline and continuity here and there. And also the running zombies didn't help to impress me. There are many beautiful scenes and really well-constructed scenes throughout the movie which makes the movie well worth watching. ""World War Z"" appeals to a wide audience, but in its attempt to get out to as many as possible, it fails to cater to the hardcore fans of the zombie genre.I should get around to reading the book, as I have been told that the movie deviates and strays far from the actual book upon which it is based.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
You should see this if you haven't already.,"I honestly didn't know what to think about this movie at first. It had seemed a little over the top. But when I watched it, everything changed. It was great! You could hardly tell they were zombies from what we perceive to be a 'zombie'. They were incredibly fast and just traveled in gigantic numbers. It really had a totally different take on the horror genre. The movie was almost completely different than the very popular TV show, The Walking Dead. It looked like the movie would have a lot of blood and gore, but it turns out it doesn't, and it really didn't need it, in my opinion. Although, at some parts, I found it completely unrealistic; such as when they were talking about North Korea, I believe, and how they pulled all of their people's teeth out so they would no get infected. But overall, I believed the acting was excellent and Brad Pitt had done very well. This was the definition of a great large budget film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
"Fast paced, fun, decent ending!","Don't worry no spoilers. I'm aware Paramount had over 25 million dollars in reshoots for the initial unsatisfying ending.

Straight to the point with the action. I would have like a LITTLE more backstory besides ""an ex member of the United Nations"" because Gerry gets all this special treatment throughout the film because of his previous job, yet they never really explained exactly what he did.

"Fun, fast action flick without the gore.","This is a great film. It had me on the edge of my seat for nearly 3/4 of the film and served up a good dose of Zombie escapism. It had more than its fair share of mistakes and missed opportunities- but as a fast paced bit of ""the world goes to hell"" this is actually great. And this was just going to be a Zombie movie nothing more. It's not a Brad Pitt movie- his acting was appalling- wooden and stunted at important moments, but that's somewhat forgivable as the action does keep up a decent pace.It's obviously been a long time since Thelma and Louis because Mr Jolie is looking a bit ragged around the edges. The plot is completely unrealistic- however this film has cleverly shown what a 2 hour movie should be for escapist movie goers- outlandish plot turns and global travelling that would make Richard Branson go weak at the knees. But that is the whole point of any fun flick- it's not reality and therefore we can actually use our imagination and go with the unexpected turns. It is kind of ironic that the movie isn't realistic- well no, it's about Zombies and they are made up.... Some of the missed opportunities include dramatic moments with planes that could have done with a bit more ""2012""-the movie panoramic CGI- it could of turned this into a great movie. The dialogue seems to occur in batches. There were a couple of brilliant dialogue moments, but that was it. However by keeping the dialogue down it turned the movie into more of a visual feast then what we are used to. I wonder if anyone will notice this. And if it marks a turning point in CGI films that are more visually based as a genre. If you want good dialogue then go read Shakespeare or Ibsen. The lack of blood was unsettling- but then considering the budget hit $200 million I'm not surprised they need all the family friendly tickets they can sell. I'm not a big fan of blood- I find suspense far more enthralling so this made a surprising change. However I am not sure it will work for die-hard Zombie fans. And there are some things that just should not be messed with. It's obvious somebody has watched 28 Weeks Later- however the mass Zombie hordes set a new benchmark for sphincter clenching madness. And the rather subtle revealing of how the Zombies operate (I don't want to spoil it) is actually quite intelligent and kept to just the right tempo. It's nice to see a Zombie film with a bit of thoughtfulness. Do not read the wiki listed drama until after you have seen the film (it will just distract you from enjoying the way out moments- because you may be thinking ""oh this is what they were talking about"") - but then do go read the diabolical mess some fool/s got themselves into over this film- it's hilarious. It also helps explain why so many people are gossiping badly about this film. It is far better than people are saying. It's over the top, a lot of fun and I am sure will be very popular as a DVD because it does have some great CGI moments. Die-hard Zombie fans- maybe not so much.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
I agree - One of the best Zombie movies made,"Saw the Movie at a Sneak peak, and even though it was free, I would pay just to see it again with my Wife, instead of the buddies, because she would really enjoy it as well.A Very well done Zombie movie. Unlike other Zombie movies, it not solely just based on action and killing of Zombies, but more on survival and finding a cure. The movie really brings a new level for the Zombie genre and is on the Top of my list for Zombie movies.Another good plus, is that the Title World War Z is very true, because it is not just based in one City like other Zombie movies, but all over the world.

"A great popcorn movie. Marc Forster delivers a true world war against zombies, with locations in several countries and literally thousands and thousands of bloodthirsty undead","Directed by the versatile Marc Forster, responsible for works as disparate as Finding Neverland (2004) and 007 - Quantum of Solace (2008), the film bets on grandeur as its greatest differential, presenting - as the title says - a true world war against zombies, with locations in several countries and literally thousands and thousands of bloodthirsty undead. The cutscenes are impressive. Unafraid to use aerial shots, exactly with the intention of conveying this epic scale, and computer graphics, Forster creates visually appalling moments, with hordes of creatures scaling giant walls and dominating entire cities. They are some of the most fantastic moments zombie cinema has ever produced. The director presents us with an efficient American summer popcorn movie, with some legitimately excellent scenes. The first of these is the opening sequence of 25 or 30 minutes, in which we see Gerry and his family (wife and two daughters) desperately fleeing the contagion in Philadelphia. This entire sequence, which wastes no time getting started, is extremely tense, with genuine horror movie undertones.Sadly, though, ""World War Z"" offers little beyond that. From the first minutes, the spectator already realizes that he is facing a film that will not worry too much about history or characters: there is only a short scene in which Brad Pitt's family is presented and, soon after, the mindless rush has already begun. Start. From then on, truth be told, Forster manages to imbue the work with a breakneck pace, reducing the most intimate moments to a minimum. ""World War Z"" jumps from one action scene to another without much parsimony, with the characters - and, consequently, the film itself - always in motion, which guarantees energy and dynamism.The film's three-act structure is marked by six main action sequences, well-executed and different from each other, designed to not only keep the viewer on the edge of their seat, but also move the story forward. In the most striking attack, as Palestinians and Israelis finally put aside their territorial and religious differences, a brainless mob turns a celebration of peace into carnage, in a sad parallel with the real world. The direction gives the tape a frantic rhythm, something that mirrors the ferocity of its creatures. Don't expect slow monsters here, but real rabid animals, capable of anything for ""food"" and imbued with the mentality of an uncontrolled mob. Forster's camera, during the first two acts of the narrative, rarely approaches the zombies, avoiding detailing their faces, showing them from afar as uncontrolled and faceless crowds. At these points in the narrative, the face of the ""zekes"" is focused only in a punctual way, almost always in extremely short shots, aiming to scare the audience (especially with the use of 3D). Already in the third act, when Gerry already has a greater ""familiarity"" with the zombies and the story itself calls for a greater exploration of them, Foster allows himself some medium shots focused on the zombies, valuing the make-up work carried out by his team, risking even a quick subjective plane. Note also the absence of blood or gore in the film, which prefers to invest more in suspense than in shock (and the fact that the absence of these elements reduces the indicative rating of the production is also not a mere coincidence).Because of this, the story focuses a lot on the personality of its protagonist. The film quickly establishes Gerry's personality, his care for his daughters and the relationship of complicity with his wife. Also in an economical way, his professional qualities are soon exposed, showing his intelligence and capacity to adapt quickly to the different problems that are presented to him. Brad Pitt, the only star of the project, is always up to the role, transmitting the sense of urgency that the role asks for and never transforms Gerry into an invincible figure, giving him enough vulnerability to make us worry about his fate. The character's line of reasoning is always accurate and we follow his decision process, which never seems forced by the script.Through Gerry's relationship with the other characters, the importance of concepts such as love, loyalty and kindness is questioned. Even with these supporting actors not being explored in a deeper way, they are far from being mere pieces of meat to be sacrificed to the zombie for the sake of the audience's enjoyment. In this sense, the main female figures in the film stand out. Mireille Enos, like Gerry's strong wife, Karin, conveys through looks and half-words all the complicity that their marriage carries. Daniella Kertesz lives the brave Israeli soldier who accompanies the protagonist and ends up stealing some scenes with her attitudes. The experienced David Morse also has a short participation in the scene, which became remarkable thanks to his eccentric performance as a CIA agent.However, ""World War Z"" lacks repetition. From the opening sequence, what we see is it happening again and again only in different countries, with different supporting actors and on ever-increasing scales. The episodic character of the film is extremely latent with this, with little effective impulse to the narrative. This problem is especially obvious in the gigantic sequence in Jerusalem (the one with the undead mountain that is shown exhaustively in the trailers and posters). Though original and technically very good, it is ultimately thrust into the script in a completely implausible manner, even within the fantastic structure of the narrative. The justification for the construction of the wall, the very existence of the wall and the events since Gerry's arrival are funny, such is their improbability.If, on the one hand, the work does not drag on, on the other hand, this almost exclusive focus on action also results in an emotionally sterile experience for the audience. The screenplay, written by Matthew Michael Carnahan, Drew Goddard and Damon Lindelof (all with good work in film and television) and adapted from a book by Max Brooks, seems to have been written on total autopilot. There is no attempt to make the audience really know Gerry Lane and his family to the point of being interested or concerned about them. Not only are the moments shared between them few, since the protagonist is separated from the family right at the beginning, but also all the scenes that could generate some dramatic impact seem to have been cut or treated in a sloppy way, such as the woman leaving and of their daughters on the ship. As a result, the experience of watching zombie attacks becomes purely visual, without ever causing any kind of tension or feeling.In addition, the script still suffers from a lack of development, or at least a lack of goodwill on the part of the writers. Gerry's investigation, for example, is incredibly easy and superficial: all he has to do is get somewhere and the first person he talks to already has information about the epidemic. And the fact that no one knew where it all started, what does it look like? In fact, ""World War Z"", more than just a movie without much intelligence, is a movie that doesn't respect the viewers' intelligence. At a certain point, in the moment of the protagonist's epiphany, Forster and his writers prefer to show scenes and lines previously seen, in a literal and unnecessary representation, as if the audience was not able to understand what the character discovered. As if that weren't enough, the plot is still full of holes and inconsistencies (what end did the boy Tomas' parents take, for example? By the way, what is his function in the story anyway? And throwing a grenade inside a plane? Seriously?) and, contrary to most productions of the genre, does not seek to use zombies as a metaphor or allegory for some social commentary; they're people eaters, that's all. And didn't Carnahan, Goddard and Lindelof realize that cutting off a limb to prevent the infection from spreading was seen on ""The Walking Dead""?""World War Z"" also promotes an update of the figure of the zombie, something that had already occurred in 28 Days Later (2002). In Danny Boyle's film, the living dead are no longer slow, affected by rigor mortis, and unintelligent as we see in George A. Romero's classics. By the hands of the British, they became agile, smart and potentially deadly. Now, World War Z proposes a new generation of zombies: from a contamination that occurs in seconds, they became extremely fast, acting as a deadly amorphous mass that takes over streets, climbs walls and takes over everything, giving little chance of defense. However, much of this new generation of the undead is created digitally, which takes away some of the scenic impact traditionally provided by tons of makeup, blood, costumes and other tangible elements. Even so, the tension and dread these new zombies provoke is very real. These are feelings that refer both to our most primitive fears and to a fear related to the fall of the State and the advent of global social chaos. The zombie apocalypse echoes not only the hideous figure of the cannibal undead, but also the feeling of an uncertain, anarchic future filled with varied privations. In this skeptical scenario, wild individualism becomes the prevailing order.And it's worth a last comment, this time about the lack of blood in the entire film. Considering this is a zombie tape, it was a financial choice to gain lower ratings and reach more audiences, but one that doesn't fit with the spirit of this type of work. As a result, deaths, even those of zombies, happen off-screen, some with well-thought-out solutions, others quite simplistic. It doesn't quite spoil the movie, but it distracts in the wrong way. In the end, ""World War Z"" is great popcorn-movie fun that shouldn't disappoint anyone looking for just that.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Much better than expected.,"I usually do my research on movies before seeing them as I do not like wasting my time on terrible ones. This movie did not seem to have outstanding reviews or anything, the featured review was one star. I really felt like going to the theater and I had already seen everything there pretty much. So you can say I wasn't expecting much, even though there was a lot of hype for this movie.The main complaint behind this movie is that it is PG-13, which means it has minimal blood/gore. What this movie lacks in that aspect it makes up for it in thrill. You feel like you are on the edge of your seat the entire movie. There are also many scenes that will make you jump, the movement of the zombies is also quite frightening.The movie wasn't too predictable and this is one of my complaints about most movies, typically natural disaster movies where no matter what at the end of the movie, it's ""happily ever after"". Up until the end you didn't know what was going to happen, although a few hints were dropped into the movie at previous points.In general most people might be turned off by a few things they see before they see the movie, but it genuinely is worth seeing, it's not your run of the mill zombie movie, it's actually quite thrilling.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
So Much Potential,"With zombies on everyone's mind, I supposed it was inevitable that Brad Pitt would find himself running away from a mass of the snarling living dead. The trailers promised unparalleled visuals, and it delivered, let's say, about twenty seconds more than we saw in the trailers. The rest of the movie is pretty standard fare. Plenty of scenes in dark rooms with zombies chomping at a door that won't quite lock. There's an original scene on an airplane. As far as zombie movies go, World War Z will probably not be remembered well (like I Am Legend is not remembered well in the vampire genre). But, it's certainly not a boring film. One wishes that it had done more.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Family outing ruined by zombie plague.,"What is it!, with fathers? Tom Cruise, almost as soon as he is in charge of his kids, gets caught up in a Martian invasion, in 'War of the Worlds' (2005). Here, Brad Pitt cannot even drive his kids down the road without being swept up in a world-wide zombie plague.This reviewer was offered a choice of 2D and 3D, and decided if the film was good enough it would stand on it's own merits in the 2D format. It did.Film comes from Brad Pitt's own 'Plan B Entertainment' film company and was released via 'Paramount', therefore Brad Pitt is a producer and the film opens with the 'Paramount Mountain'. The rest of the credits are shown with quick views of US urban scenes and TV. Views are partially distorted by clever graphics. Scenes are typical and pleasant. About halfway through though, this reviewer was disturbed to see a few brief seconds of Piers Morgan, and after that the scenes became more sinister, ending with prophecies of doom.The mood changes though when the film proper starts. We are in a suburban house with Gerry and his family. Gerry is played by Brad Pitt. We quickly find out, thanks partially to the TV, that Gerry is a house-husband and that his most important job is making pancakes, however his old job was a lot more dangerous and involved him travelling to dangerous places around the world.After breakfast, Gerry and his family drive through down-town Philadelphia and get caught up in a traffic-jam. They also get caught up as a swarm of zombies engulf this part of town. These scenes are very intense, the pace slackens only after some time, and only then did this reviewer notice their own very accelerated heart-beat.Around St Valentine's Day there was a nice little Rom-com zombie film called 'Warm Bodies', that told the heart-warming story of love conquering all, including zombies. 'World War Z' is not that film. 'WWZ' rather is a fast action horror and thriller (which also makes a few interesting little political points). The only thing that 'WWZ' shares with 'WB' is regarding the speed of the zombies. If, dear reader, your own previous experience of zombies, extends no further than the slow lumbering clumsy zombies, populating the shopping mall, in George A. Romero's 1978 'Dawn of the Dead', (one of a trilogy), then be prepared to be shocked and scared. Like the bonys in 'WB', these zombies can move, and run, very fast indeed. Again, unlike 'DOTD', the gestation period for developing into a zombie is much shortened too in 'WWZ'.The film starts in Philadelphia but there are also scenes of different parts of the world. In reality however many scenes were actually shot in the UK. Most of the opening scenes were shot in Glasgow, Scotland, UK; mostly in and around, George Square. Glasgow, like many North American cities, has a grid-system street layout. So it is then that in a ten minute walk from 'down-town Philly' you can come to the street in 'San Francisco', (this reviewer had always thought ""San Francisco!"" for many years), where Halle Berry did some filming for 'Cloud Atlas'. Glasgow also has some interesting buildings that could help it pass for many a European city. Previously the Council's City Chambers on George Square have stood in for the Vatican (in 'Heavenly Pursuits'), as well as the Kremlin (in 'An Englishman Abroad').Some have thought the pace slowed later in the film. This reviewer disagrees. The danger from zombies is always there. It would be ridiculous if this film was just one long chase scene. The film starts, like 'War of the Worlds' with the family caught up in the situation, however unlike that film (which seemed to spend half the time in one cellar, and the rest in the US country-side), this film moves around a lot more, various countries are seen. Seen too are the zombies, who are ready, able, and willing, to chase throughout the film, and do too.Brad Pitt should be rightly proud of this very exciting and scary zombie film, (rated 15 in the UK), that he has produced and starred in. If you liked 'War of the Worlds' or you like zombie films then you will enjoy this. Top marks. 10/10.Health Warning: Beware of zombies! They tend to bite and their bite is usually fatal. When being chased by a zombie, or even seeing zombies moving, you may experience an accelerated heart-beat. Most importantly, take all the necessary precautions you can to avoid being bitten.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Just a nice zombie apocalypse movie,"The plot of the movie was basic, all zombie apocalypse movies are kinda the same. Just a group of people, trying to survive the apocalypse, nothing new. The storyline was well-written, nothing innovative. The characters weren't very interesting nor well-developed, but they were very likeable. I have to admit that the cinematography of the movie was AMAZING. In my opinion, that movie should be R-rated instead of PG-13 rating, because the kills weren't bloody at all and most of them, were done off-screen... It wasn't scary, but there was only one jumpscare, the one in the building (it was totally unexpected and so scary). There were too many intense scenes, and they were very well portrayed. Actually, the zombie's design was really good and they were so powerful (probably, the most powerful zombies I have ever seen in a movie, lol). The opening scene was really intense and totally unexpected. Overall, it was just a nice zombie-apocalypse movie. The ending scene was expected and I hope, they're gonna make a sequel!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Honnestly the best movie i've seen in years and the Best Zombie movie I've seen so far,"First I all I won't give any spoiler or anything on the story but I will tell you of my feelings about this movie that I consider to be a masterpiece. I went to see this movie with good feelings about it but with a bit of doubt. The movie starts slow for about 5-10 minutes max then speed up a bit then kicks in. The strength of this movie is not the action it is the atmosphere you are always asking yourself what could happen what you hope won't happen. The characters are well played, smart brilliant, not that they are all genius but they act like real human would. They don,t go running all over the place screaming for no good reason when they know that if they make too much noise they will get in big trouble. The reaction from the characters are realistic. You care for the characters you encounter throughout the movie. The scenario is great, I have not read the book from Max Brooks which this movie is the adaptation but this movie is well written and you never really know what's gonna happen, of course you often predict what happens but when you think about the possibilities they are so numerous that you don't say ""OK so now the only possible thing that'll happen is this...OK I knew it"" their is always a myriad of possibilities. The movie is not a gore fest it is not full of guts or dismembered limbs at every 2 steps. The movie is creepy, even scary when you put yourself in the place of the characters boots. When the movie ended I was speechless, I see a lot of movies, I love independent films like Exit Humanity, but this movie WOW, I will go see it next week end and maybe the next too and maybe the next too. I only did this for 2 movies and they were 1. The Lord of the Rings : Fellowship of the ring 2. Lord of the Rings : The Two Towers.I hope that my review helped some of you, i give this movie a 10 out of 10 and can't wait to see it another time. Also I hope it does pretty well at the box office so there could be a sequel, it would be really awesome and great if there is a sequel and that it is done with the quality and efforts that the ones who were put into this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
"Epic, optimistic and so tense","World War Z is a worthwhile addition into the fast zombie canon by offering a fairly optimistic look at a zombie outbreak on a rarely seen global scale with an uncommonly high amount of selflessness. The globetrotting adventures are as smart as they are stupid and even with neutered PG-13 zombies it can still deliver plenty of epic and suitably tense set pieces.In a film as nail-biting as this, having Brad Pitt as the lead works so well because he can really anchor everything. His character is competent, resourceful, relatable and always trying to save as many people as he can which makes him the best character to experience this film through. There's a steady stream of recognisable faces in small but well developed roles too.Marc Forster seems cursed to direct large scale blockbusters that go through production hell but his direction of high octane, hyperactive action sequences has gotten a lot stronger since his last outing (Quantum of Solace). Marco Beltrami's score can be sinister and sombre with ease but what makes it stand out are the moments where it's full of hope.The chaotic production is well known and obvious from the three massively different credited screenwriters and yet the film comes out the other end with minimal damage done. Swapping from gigantic hordes of CG zombies in open areas to practical ones in a confined space makes it clear where the pivot is; however, it allows the film to go from delivering one kind of spectacle to a different but equally effective type.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Everything I wanted in a zombie movie.,"I really didn't want to have high expectations for this movie but now it has officially made it to my top 5 favorite zombie movies of all time. Right from the beginning you are thrown into this world where the chaos starts and escalates like wildfire. You are really given a sense of how quickly and easily civilization could break down. This movie really managed to capture the sense of hopelessness, fear and urgency of a zombie apocalypse.The crowd scenes are just spectacular! The Cg is amazing and so visually stunning. The intensity of those raging hordes of zombies is something I haven't seen since 28 days later. It was gripping right from the beginning.I have to say that there were a few bits here and there that got laughs where they weren't necessarily meant to. But overall I was thoroughly entertained and my thirst for a good zombie movie was satisfied.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"

Brad Pitt's character is believable and appealing. The film is fast-paced and fun from beginning to end, there's tension and excitement throughout. I personally love zombie flicks, even the direct to video lot. Movies where the viewer can't even begin to imagine the horror lend an excitement that's only available in modern zombie horror, in my humble opinion. World War Z also has it's share of predictable moments, but without giving anything away, you will still enjoy the film.

Unfaithful to the source but also underwhelming as a whole.,"I liked the book. I watched this with an open mind that it may be ""altered"" to be more entertaining as a movie.Still thought it was way too far off from the book to even have the name ""World War Z"". If they were going to change this much, there was no need to use WWZ. To people who don't know the book, they won't care. To those who do, they will be insulted by the movie. Isn't the whole point of adapting a book to a movie, based on the fact that the book was a success? Thus implying that a good portion of your target audience are the book readers. So why intentionally slap the readers in the face? It makes no sense when you watch this movie, since it probably resembles 20% or less of the book's story, concept and characters.Even with the book differences, I could have lived with this movie being a solid zombie movie if the movie was actually about zombies. The ""infected"" may be fast and united, but the movie is pg-13 and that is just baffling. How can you possibly expect to make a movie like this and limit yourself with a pg-13 in an attempt to sell more tickets to kids? That's pretty much trading quality for quantity...or ""selling out"".It was hard enough to watch this and hardly see any resemblance of the source material that was amazing, but then you are also limited to pg-13 action and violence for a movie of this nature. There was almost no blood, diluted violence, bad CGI and annoying ""cut-away"" action scenes. Very disappointing.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Big Surprise,"I've read WWZ by Max Brooks and wasn't really all that impressed. Still while reading it I visualized a much different film than what appeared in the first trailers for this film. But in it's long journey to the screen there were rumblings of troubled set reports and than a huge release date shift, never a good sign. So it is indeed surprising that the finished product is as solid as it is, not to say it's flawless by any means. The cinematic adaptation works more as an inspiration than a story base. The girth of the novel is still there. It is a world taken over by the undead. But the creatures in this film are of a different sort. Similar to the fast zombies of 28 days later and the Dawn of the Dead remake these are even more aggressive if you can imagine that. Not only do they run but they dive and jump. The movie like it's zombies possesses an urgency that makes the proceedings work fairly well. Moving from one expertly choreographed action set piece to another as it spans the globe. That being said there is some goofiness here an airplane attack although shocking is a bit silly and some of the zombie moments come across a little unintentionally funny. Still the idea of the zombies moving like a virus swarm through the human body and the defense strategy are impressive and do breathe a bit of life into the concept. As for the human characters they are decent if a little generic Brad Pitt does surprisingly well in the lead giving a depth to his character that is much needed. I only wish they would have slowed down more throughout the film to develop a depth to the material a bit more and amped up the soft ending. But after the massive opening weekend there are now talks of a sequel as it was originally planned as a trilogy. which leaves me a hopeful that they will iron out the few kinks. Still what stands is a solid summer film. Very entertaining and breathtakingly intense. 3.5/5",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Unique ending that is different than other zombie movies deserves the postive rating,"(2013) World War Z
SCIENCE-FICTION THRILLER DRAMA SUSPENSEIdea based on the popular novel written by Max Brooks whose the son of comedic films Mel Brooks of ""The Producers"" which showcases something I've never seen before, and that is the start of the evolution regarding the zombie virus which this film is like a reminiscent of a prequel of ""28 Days Later"", ""Dawn Of The Dead"", ""Zombieland"" or ""I Am Legend"" to name a few since those movies centers on the aftermath -never before. From what I've remembered from watching the previews, they either didn't tell nor explain me anything. The only thing I remembered from the previews is that Brad Pitt is the star but don't quite know what role he has in this film except that the direction must be something different I've never seen before. The reason I say this is because the scene from the preview where he's with his family in the car when all of that excitement was happening occurred right at the beginning. Because almost right away, someone becomes infected and we get to witness how long it would take a human being to turn into a zombie and that is being observed by Gerry Lane played by Brad Pitt because he is a doctor(but according to ET Weekly he's a strategic army man) as he's trying to escape with his family. New York City is being ravaged by this zombie epidemic and is spreading recklessly at a uncontrollable ration as more and more people are infected where it's even worst than the plague but instead of rats we get zombies. Only a few glimpse of human people are left and are eventually going to succumb to this epidemic as well, except that we are invested by Pitts family and no one else's, making other peoples lives unfortunate but less sympathetic. And because he used to work for the gov't, he once had an important position that most other people don't have, and it is during at that time that is going to guarantee him and his family safety not optioned to anyone nor to many other people. To say anymore would be pointless as the Brad Pitt character is going through many close calls similar to what a real nightmare would look like. Although, this film had many rewrites and postpone dates upon the movies release, I find that it's Brad Pitt's persona is what is holding this film together as it's like a mirror image of his own family since he cares about his wife and daughters as well as take another kid under his wing and will do whatever it takes to guarantee their safety. He plays a family man and we can identify with him since it's built to also be a part of his dilemma in the decisions that he makes as a human being and you don't get to see that happen to often much in zombie movies very much no matter how many zombie films you have seen already.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"

Aa far as a zombie movie goes! Its got it all,I was with this film only expecting what i always expect from a zombie movie. Entertainment and action with some horror and tension through out and this delivers. As for the science behind it i ignore that anyway since a zombie is basically a walking dead person its already rubbish to try base anything in a zombie movie on the science behind it.My only negative is i didn't really get why Brad Pitts character was so important to the UN as he doesn't display any special characteristics that make him an asset to the UN.

A hero called Gerry,"A movie that is on annual rotation for me. A zombie movie for the squeamish who don't want to see a small intestine whilst chewing on their popcorn.It's more inspired by the book than trying to recreate it. A die hard fan of the book may take issue with the movie, but a fan of the movie will love reading the book.I love the music and scale of destruction shown. Instead of a close up of several zombies nagging into flesh, we get viral waves of chaos across several time zones.Into the maelstrom steps our reluctant hero, Gerry (Pitt). Recently retired from an unknown role in the United Nations, Gerry is pressed into service to act as the chaperone to the scientific effort to combat the puzzling virus.Bouncing from the US, to Korea, the Levant and UK, our ever observant hero works to solve the puzzle in a unique way.If you like your zombie movies full of gore, you may be disappointed. I don't hate gore, it's just some movies rely too much on it. If your triggered by acronyms like UN or WHO you'll love to hate this, but if you want to see a different take on the zombie genre I'd recommend.A convenient plane crash perhaps the only flaw (along with a convenient syringe), but extra kudos for giving the jacked Matthew Fox a role to shine in.Finally a zombie movie you can watch over dinner.

Not much happened during the whole movie, nothing much developed story-wise or character-wise, the zombies were not very zombie like, and the cleverness of the original material was completely missing in action.I'm sure they could make a good movie on a tenth the budget, instead of a not so good action blockbuster for hundreds of millions.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Zombie flick of the year!,"World War Z gets its concept from the novel written by Max Brooks. Although this movie is not an exact adaptation of the book it still impresses in its portrayal of the zombie apocalypse seen through the eyes of UN employee Gerry Lane (enacted by Brad Pitt). Gerry Lane has been tasked with investigating the outbreak of a virus that turns humans into mindless, angry zombies similar to those infected with the Rage virus (28 Days Later) and pushes mankind towards extinction.

"Not 28 days, but it will do for this summer.","If you like Zombie movies, crave them so to speak, then you'll be pleased with World War Z, a work in the genre somewhere between Night of the Living Dead and 28 Days, my fav. Actually it is closer in quality and modest believability to 28 Days, with a bit of Contagion, as UN operative Gerry (Brad Pitt) struggles to find the source of the pandemic that is consuming the world. The implausibility of most horror films is built in; the genius of the filmmakers is to make us believe anyway.Unbelievable, yes, ludicrous no, for it speaks even in its grand setups of human vulnerability and the capricious power of Mother Nature. Although 28 Days had a minimalist approach, fewer zombies and more good guys, WWZ has a focus on hero Gerry with close-ups aplenty—but then it's Brad Pitt, who was born to be photographed.The zombie tropes are all there if you're checking: the hero coming out of retirement, the loving family he has to leave to save the world, the unreal transformation of millions into undead monsters, the good guy bitten, and so on. Yet director Marc Foster has assembled the best looking zombie horde to complement his star's good looks. Foster has also depicted thousands of zombies climbing and being shot down in vast groups, and image I have not encountered except in films about Nazi atrocities.The almost two hours are as fast paced as the virus—nary a moment of peace—from transporting Gerry and his family to various safe spots to running from the legions of zombies to finally a relatively quiet World Health Organization lab, where the creatures are ready to stop Gerry from finding their weakness and producing an antidote. The allegorical implications of HIV or chemical warfare are there if you want them. Otherwise, it's just an enjoyable ride along the suspense express.However, I have to admit the pandemic has a ring of truth to it , as if Ma Nature had decide another Black Plague would be good to get the population to reasonable size. For that scenario, see Dan Brown's Inferno. For nothing more than edge-of-your seat thrills, World War Z will do for a good old-fashioned adrenaline rush.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
"More action than zombie horror, but still entertaining","So a couple of weeks ago, I won passes through a radio contest to the New York City premiere of World War Z, which went down last Monday(6/17/13). When I initially won, I was more excited about the thought of seeing Angelina Jolie (and her new breasts) in person than the actual movie, but it turned out that she was MIA that night. It was still cool to see Brad Pitt in person when he stopped by to introduce the movie after the film's director Marc Forster spoke for a few minutes. Pitt ensured us that they had a good movie in store for us, and he said that we should get the film going and not waste any more time.When I first heard about World War Z, I had no idea that the Z in the title refers to zombies, and even when I saw the trailer, there was no mention of zombies. If anything, the scene they showed from the beginning of the movie, when everyone was stopped in traffic and they heard explosions, made it look like it might be some kind of lame monster movie like Godzilla or even worse, Cloverfield.Brad Pitt stars as a former United Nations investigator who reluctantly abandons his family in order to face the task of figuring out what's causing the zombie pandemic all over the world and stop it before it destroys all of humanity. I've never read the book it's loosely based on, but people who have say the only thing the book and the movie share are the title. They wonder why Brad Pitt's production company Plan B Entertainment bothered to buy the rights to the book, which is a collection of individual accounts of the ongoing war against zombies.Despite his underrated talent and tendency to take on a wide range of roles, I was surprised that he did a film like this, being this is his first ""disaster/end-of-the-world"" movie. This seems more like something Will Smith would do, not Brad Pitt. In fact, the amount of violence and the creatures themselves were somewhat similar to the vampires featured in I Am Legend.The zombies featured in this movie are a combination of the virus-infected victims that are featured in 28 Days Later and the traditional Romero-esque zombies. The zombies in this movie would've been a hell of a lot scarier if they weren't CGI 90 percent of the time. Personally, I find the classic slow-moving zombies to be scarier than the fast-moving zombies. This film felt more like I was watching a Roland Emmerich film, like Independence Day, than a horror film. It seemed odd to me that a zombie film is rated PG-13, and I can imagine that hardcore zombie fanatics will be even more disappointed than I was.I'm not the biggest zombie buff around, but of the handful of zombie films that I've seen, the remake of Dawn of the Dead is one that really stands out for me. Shaun of the Dead was also great at spoofing zombie movies while simultaneously being a great zombie movie, similar to what Scream did for slashers. I can't really see World War Z going down as one of the greatest zombie flicks in history, nor as a great apocalyptic flick for that matter.Historically, I've never been too impressed with 3D, and this film was no exception. There were a few ""jump scenes"" that, although looked slightly cooler, I'm sure would've made me jump just the same. For much of the film, wearing the 3D glasses is just distracting in scenes where they're unnecessary, such as the first few minutes inside Gerry's house. At least the official World War Z 3D glasses that I decided to keep are a cool souvenir.Overall, the film definitely looks great, and some action sequences kicked so much ass that the audience erupted into applause.

A Goreless and script-less Zombie movie..mediocre at best.,"I went into this movie with no expectations whatsoever, having read several of the reviews here..and they turned out to be perfectly true. Quick Overview: The plot: Brad Pitt shuttling across the globe, trying to find a cure for the 'Zombie' menace. Pros: 1.Excellent CGI effects, which makes watching the movie in 3D worthwhile. 2.The pace of the movie keeps you riveted even though you kind of know, what's about to happen. Cons 1.Poor script, which could have been put together by a 12 yr old kid. 2.Characters are not at all developed, which makes you wonder, what the hell is the director trying to do? Brad Pitt is especially wasted in the movie. 3. No blood in a zombie movie?? I am not even sure who the target audience for this movie is.12-16 yr olds? Verdict: If you are fan of 3D movies, go for this one. Don't expect any award winning performances, but just enough action to keep you interested throughout the movie. The worst part of the movie is that the director makes you laugh inadvertently at scenes which are supposed to be dead serious.Perhaps they could invent a new genre for this movie.... ""Comic Thriller""...",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
A vision of the end of all things,"For me, this film is at its heart an existential horror film, not an action film. Within moments of the start of the film, the unknown threat is upon the protagonist and his family. Very soon, the dimmest outline of the beast come to devour the world is shown. The desperate race to flee, to fight, to combat, to do anything in response to that which exists only in my most symbolic nightmares is on.The Beast moves with speed, fury and determination, but its full dimensions always remains unclear, unknown and terrifying. It hunts, it lurks and it waits for every opportunity to consume mankind. In the face of this unknown devourer, our protagonist carries on with his mission with only the barest glimmer of hope of success or understanding of what he is facing, while all around him the world is consumed.As I left the theatre and made my way home overwhelmed by what I saw, a dream I had long ago that marked me arose. I saw the destroyer of worlds, the unthing, from beyond again, its long grim strides consuming existence with every step. Everything in the destroyer's path was annihilated and was as if it all had never been. No past, no present, no future remained in the wake of the unthing from beyond. The only thing to do was to flee before the end of existence, desperate to cling what remained as nothingness strode towards me.Allegorically, World War Z,with its teeming rivers of once human tentacles of destruction depicted the unthing of my dreams to me. The terrible all consuming horror summoned forth grips me still and I cry and whimper in fear. The destroyer of worlds was evoked in World War Z, as clearly to me as it was to Dr. Oppenheimer when he witnessed the first atomic bomb and the first unthing was put within man's grasp.I knew fear again, the fear that existential horror films rely upon to work and I knew that World War Z had done its job admirably. If you enjoy such films and enjoy glimpses of the destroyer of worlds, this one's for you.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
World War Worth It,"Zombies! Can't understand the obsession with the undead, but as zombie movies go, this one was at least entertaining. Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt in an appreciated understated performance) is a former United Nations operative who battles the entire state of New Jersey to get his family to safety aboard the only refuge not infested with zombies, an aircraft carrier in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. Once aboard, Gerry is briefed on the news that the entire world has been contaminated. Unfortunately, as the viewer, I would have liked just a little more discovery on what the possible cause of the zombie virus was. Gerry soon finds out that his being able to harbor his family in this safe compound comes with a price. The military wants him to escort a scientist to South Korea who may hold the key to a cure. When Gerry refuses, he is given the ultimatum, become unretired and lead the mission or his family finds another refuge. His family's safety his only concern, Gerry leads the team into South Korea which has also become zombie land. Pitt basically puts on a one man show from this point on, with an occasional assist from a human or two. This easily could have turned into a Swartzenegger hero against the world blockbuster, but Pitt takes the lower road, showing something that movie super heroes rarely show, fear; fear of the unknown, fear of failure and fear he will never see his family again. I didn't expect to like this film, but it was a pleasant surprise and I would recommend this for it's entertainment and intensity value. While there isn't a lot of actual bloodshed as one would expect from a movie about walking cannibals, the film might be too intense for younger viewers.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"

A forgettable blockbuster but still entertaining,"""World War Z"", directed by Marc Forster, is a big budget blockbuster among his diverse output. It starts with a jaw dropping scene of unexplained traffic chassis in New York city, followed by mass evacuation from zombies. Brad Pitt's character then attempts to find out what stated the outbreak, but his efforts (or the portrayal of such) is rather lacking in intensity. The plot then descends into a mindless cat and mouse chase, without much depth given to Abby characters. Although thrilling and entertaining, the plot is not very memorable or emotionally engaging. Though the scene of zombies breaking through a high wall is quite spectacular, it still is just a forgettable blockbuster.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
"A few good ideas, lots of bad ones.","Pitt plays some former UN employee who on a regular morning leaves with his family. But as they're driving through the city, something is wrong. People start running, cars start crashing and Pitt distinguished some people attacking others who then start contorting violently only to end up attacking others.Pitt I guess is still so revered at the UN that they send a helicopter the next day to rescue him and his family. But first he has to survive the night. They are taken to some aircraft carrier where the military is running things, while the President has been attacked. The UN wants something from him. It's still not clear what he did at the UN but he's the only one who can take on this mission. The mission is to guide a scientist to discover the origin of the zombie disease. He and the scientist and a special ops team fly to Korea because that's where the first mention of ""zombie"" came from.In Korea, the scientist suffers a surprising and neat fate, not before giving an interesting speech on how mother nature works. They learn from a US base military team that a prisoner was ill and attacked his doctor and then military guys. Pitt finds out that the israelis apparently had advanced notice of the outbreak because they finished building a wall surrounding their country just in time and thus are not affected.So off Pitt goes to Israel where he meets an agent who gives him a fascinating insight into Israeli strategic thinking and tells him that they heard for the first time of the undead from a communication coming from India. But by then some sporadic dancing and singing attracts the zombies who climb over the giant wall and attack almost everyone. While Pitt tries to make it to the airport to travel to India, he adopts some little soldier girl who got bitten and he realizes that his pilot flew away so to they stop a plane on the runway and climb in.A zombie hiding in the restroom is freed and soon enough we have zombies on a plane, so Pitt does the next logical thing- explode a grenade midflight. The plane crashes conveniently close to Pitts new destination near a WHO research facility. Of course only Pitt, the girl and a zombie survive. At the facility Pitt experiments with the solution he has come up with.Not sure what the title World War Z refers to as there is no war. While we don't get a story of the origin of the disease,we get a very interesting solution to the problem. The movie starts out pretty good, but soon enough goes on mute as no one has anything interesting anymore to say. The zombies are the usual--for these days-- quick running zombies. In fact they act like little Hulks ambushing people sideways and toppling them like bowling pins. The effects are fairly cartoonish, too. There is a single scare, but it's a good one that had the entire theater crowd jumping. The movie is 30 minutes too long wasting too much time on Pitt's family- something no one cares about. The ideas here are smart, but the script at times is very dumb.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
don't expect too much,"I'm not sure if it's the self-confidence of Brad Pitt or the missing focus of the movie, but I think that World War Z is a zombie movie which although it creates a nice atmosphere has too much problems to be a massive experience.The first thing I ran into and what bugged me the whole movie was that I didn't care if Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt) makes it 'til the end or not. It was like i followed the story but had no one who I wanted to survive the movie... and one thing a zombie movie must have (in my opinion) is one or more protagonists I share the excitement with. So the whole movie doesn't really cause some tension.Another problem was the self-confidence of the protagonist what is too uncalled for a zombie movie (what may correlate with my first problem) because there is no weakness in his character and so there is no need to be afraid for him.Nonetheless there were also some nice things, I really liked the zombies and there abilities. There were some really nice scenes (especially in Jerusalem) where they staged the zombies in an awesome way.Another positive aspect was that you felt the zombie cataclysm on the whole world and not like in other movies just in one town which creates some really oppressive atmosphere.All in all it's a zombie movie like you get dozens of out there. But it really has some nice footage and the zombies have a nice touch. So if you like zombies you can watch it but don't expect something special like I did.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Go in open minded - and hope for a sequel...,"Well, I've seen it today in 3D. First of all, I actually didn't mind 3D, although normally I hate it. I guess it's because the movie was obviously made in 2D, so the 3D effects that were added later on didn't really rape my eyes. And there are several of scenes in which 3D really gives you a sense of depth and scale.Oh, I also read both books and knew beforehand that the movie doesn't really follow the storyline.To sum it up: it's a really nice zombie flick.Perhaps a bit too nice, since the aimed PG13 rating hides away something that is a staple of all zombie movies: gore. If you're a gore fan, there's NONE here. I mean zero. This movie is gore-free. Gore is implied, it's part of the storyline, but you don't actually get to see it. Kinda like soft porn.The story follows Gerry Lane, an ex UN investigator who finds himself and his family engulfed in the developing world wide pandemic. The story quickly jumps from a nice family setting into running for their lives and we get a glimpse of how fast this thing is spreading, of the panic that ensues, the collapse of the modern society etc.Gerry's skills as a UN investigator are his get-out-of-jail card, since he is rescued by remaining military forces and sent off with a SEAL team to figure out the source of the infection in order to procure a vaccine.From there on, we follow Gerry around the world and learn little bits of information that help us paint the global disaster that seems to be getting worse by the minute.The action is non-stop. There's really no slow parts, it's a jump from one action packed scene to another and just as we barely catch a breath, the zeeks start pouring over walls, ever eager to take a bite at the closest human.CGI scenes are epic. There's no better way to describe it. We have never seen zombies like this, literally huge pouring masses of them, rolling through cities like an unstoppable river of hungry undead. This is a great concept and it's kind of a shame they showed some of those scenes in the trailer. Still, seeing them again is breathtaking.The ride is really full of thrills, and while some of the plot devices seem too simple, it's easy to understand how hard it is to film a global story like this and still keep it in focus. There's not much time for character development, so except our hero and his family, we don't really get to know much about others. Which is actually also kind of understandable, because, as anyone who's ever been in a war, you basically don't have time to care that much about others. You're looking out for yourself and your closest family. Brad Pitt offers a good performance, as well as the supporting cast.The bad things about WWZ... Well, there are several. First of all, I can't say the screenwriters managed to paint the global picture as much as I'd hoped for. I know it's very hard thing to do, but still. The climax is basically an anti-climax. It's a quiet ending that more then obviously states it's intention to reveal more in the possible sequel.It basically tells us that this is just the begging, it even takes a couple of clear hints from the books, which leads me to believe that if they ever make a sequel, it will follow the books more closely. And I hope they will.The lack of gore is disappointing. We live in a time when there's a split zombie head every week on The Walking Dead. I expected more. Also, I'm not too keen on the concept of super-fast, super-strong zombies. Aforementioned The Walking Dead proved that you can do very impressive stuff even with walkers.The thing that strikes me the most is the fact that in terms of revelations, everything is really, really toned down. There's no epochal findings, there's no grand discoveries, or gotcha scenes, it all sort of happens... Well, like in real life, I suppose. And this is something that is also the underline of the book. While it offers much more details and stories from around the world, it deals with the subject at hand in a basic ""trying to survive"" way.So, in the end, the 116 minutes went by very quickly. I was definitively entertained, scared and left wanting for more in the end. With all that said, I would recommend you do go and see the movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Not As Bad As I Thought It Would Be  (SPOILER ALERT),"The action begins when Brad Pitt and his family are trying to drive through Center City Philadelphia. No family in their right mind would ever do this. Suddenly a massive zombie outbreak occurs and Brad Pitt is able to flee Philly within a few minutes. This was probably the most unrealistic part of the movie as it would take about an hour to get out of that part of the city during a normal day without zombies.Brad Pitt then takes his family to Newark, NJ, presumably because it was an unaffected city. Although there are no signs that Newark has changed, Pitt decides to rescue another third world orphan, who he renames ""Tommy"" and then gets choppered out to sea to study the outbreak.Pitt flies to South Korea next, where the zombies have caused constant darkness and torrential rain. Pitt talks to David Morse, who has pulled out all of his teeth but still talks fine, and then Brad decides to go to Israel to pacify Arab-Israeli relations. Unfortunately, a large group of Palestinians storm Jerusalem and Pitt flees in a Russian airliner.He crashlands somewhere near England and goes to a research lab. While trying to make vaccines, he encounters a strange guy who keeps grinding his teeth and it is a little unclear if this guy is a zombie or just British, and I think this scene confused a lot of other movie-goers.Then some other stuff happens, there is some more product placement and the movie ends.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Against All Odds,"Severe deviation from the source material? Check. Production problems and reshoots? Check. A zombie movie with a PG-13 rating !? Check. With all these ""issues"" I was ready to swear off the movie completely, but curiosity got the better of me and I'm glad it did because World War Z is a movie that certainly shouldn't work, yet it does.As a fan of the book (I read it 4 years ago) I went into the film knowing that the script contained a cohesive story built around one character. Certain detractors of the film may dislike it solely for this reason because it is so different from the book. I would urge them to consider them as two separate entities. Once that is accepted, the film can be a pleasant surprise.Let's be honest, in the last 5 years film has become over saturated with zombies. So the makers of this film made some wise decisions intending to set their film apart. I'll admit I'm more of a traditionalist (slow moving zombies), but I like when film makers take risks at a new approach. The fast zombies in this film often use coordinated attacks,swarming like insects and that is something to ponder as well as visually behold. The film has a breakneck pace, with intense sequences...and it really has the feel of a global epidemic since it takes place in various locales around the world. I knew I wasn't the only one in the audience on the edge of my seat, as many times during this film I heard the rest of the audience let out a collective sigh of relief. By presenting zombies as a global problem in the first stages, it is a breathe of fresh air compared to the standard ""few survivors vs thousands of undead"" in a secluded fortress scenario. The film feels more like a political thriller than a zombie film, which belief me actually works to its benefit.Lastly, one gripe I have heard about the movie is a lack of character development. I agree, but I think character development would actually detract from the film. How many times in horror movies are supporting characters only there to serve the purpose of cannon fodder? Also, often times side characters are given moments to make a poignant speech before being killed off, which is a ploy by screenwriters to generate emotion from the audience. You'll see no such tricks here characters come and go, and we are often left to wonder about their fate. The film's frantic pace and lack of clichés really make it a surprising treat. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
A Surprisingly Decent Film,"I was avoiding watching this film for quite a while because I was afraid they would torch the zombie genre, however I was presently surprised to see this film not take the imagination too far. The film stuck to a realistic view of a zombie apocalypse, not from some fantasy world perspective, but from the real world.The cinematography was well done, using the low-lighting to add to suspense while still lit enough to see what was going on. The sound design was nice, no jump-scare screeching sound or over-the-top score/soundtrack. (8/10)Not a fan of the cast, but they did a good job with their roles. I was honestly most impressed with the zombies, especially during the hospital scene. The movement was directed very well. The CG was visually impressive/appealing and the editing went unnoticed. (9/10)The story at least had a common goal, ""find a cure"" although the plot (how it unfolded) was all over the place. It seems like a lot of the plot was only introduced to carry on the story, and didn't feel natural, although it at least felt believable. The dialogue was mid-tier. (4/10)The films conclusion is probably the best it could have been, which is why overall I feel the film was decent. It introduced an idea, took us for a (slightly confusing but believable) ride, and finished with a bang. Overall the film was a good one for the genre. 7/10!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Compulsive viewing,"Whenever this film is on, I feel compelled to watch it. I know that maybe it's not that great, but there are some simply brilliant set pieces in this.I don't think it pretends to be anything other than a cool zombie action film. It's tense, exciting, moving and occasionally silly. If there's one criticism then it's the overall flow. It seems to lurch from one exciting scene to a completely new one. But that hardly seems a criticism!There's some originality in what in fairness is a well trodden premise. If you haven't seen it, just watch the first episode 15 minutes and make your mind up after that. But I promise that you'll want to see the rest!Come on it's Brad Pitt and zombies!

Movement is life.,"World War Z is a 2013 action-horror film directed by Marc Forster and starring Brad Pitt. The movie is loosely based on the 2006 novel of the same name by Max Brooks.The film takes place in the aftermath of a zombie outbreak that has devastated the world. Brad Pitt plays a former UN investigator who is tasked with finding the origin of the outbreak and developing a cure before the infection spreads any further.One of the strengths of World War Z is its fast-paced action sequences. The zombies in the movie are not the slow-moving, shuffling creatures of traditional zombie films, but instead they are fast and agile, creating a sense of urgency and danger that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats.Brad Pitt delivers a solid performance as the film's lead, bringing both physical and emotional intensity to the role. The supporting cast, however, is somewhat forgettable, and the characters are not given enough depth or development to truly care about their fates.The film also has some impressive visual effects, particularly in the scenes where the zombie hordes swarm over cities and buildings. However, the CGI can be somewhat uneven in places and occasionally looks a bit fake.One of the weaknesses of the film is its lack of a strong narrative. The plot feels somewhat disjointed and episodic, with the film jumping from one set-piece to another without much connective tissue. This can make the film feel a bit shallow and unsatisfying.Overall, World War Z is an entertaining action-horror film with some impressive set-pieces and solid performances. While it may not be the most deep or nuanced film, it's a fun ride for those who enjoy zombie movies and action thrillers.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
The Final Days Of The Zombie Movie,Released at the end of the zombie apocalypse craze World War Z was going to be pretty tough going for audiences over saturated with The Walking Dead and countless other terrible undead cannibal fare. This starts off pretty pedestrian and actually becomes a tense little vehicle for the genre. The scenes in Jerusalem are extremely effective and Brad Pitt plays an understated everyman attempting to find the source of infection. This is nowhere near as great as the Dawn Of The Dead remake but it will entertain. It won't change your mind about being fed up with zombie movies but at least you'll be engrossed enough to enjoy it.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Better than Most Zombie Movies,"I think this movie is just OK.Not great. Not the best zombie movie made. Just OK.The action scenes are cool, in a sense that wherever he goes the chaos goes to.The story from point to point is OK but I think it lacks the deeper understanding of the outbreak.Lastly, the way they found a cure is somewhat easy and the origins of the outbreak hasn't been found so I think this movie will satisfy what Resident Evil movie franchise can't bring but at the end of this movie you're going to ask yourself, is that it?",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Excellent adaptation of a great book; different but complimentary,"This is a really tense film, exciting and visceral. It engages from minute one and keeps you tightly bound until the end. The premise is simple; zombies have spread wildly and are taking over the planet. Nowhere seems safe, and unlike ""traditional"" zombies, these are fast and the turn around from bite to zombie is twelve seconds so infestation of an area is exponentially fast.Brad Pitt is believable as the ex-UN worker, who gets called up to help out, he's convincing as a man who's seen action in the field and picked up a thing or two, and is fit and able to run around and take care of himself and his family. He played the action guy but also the guy who is worried about his family, and those he's in a team with sensibly. The ""solution"" isn't stupidly come across, by a leap or intuition, or without realistic casualties. It doesn't keep close to the book at all, but has taken the spirit of the story and made a huge film out of it. It was a massive scale film, with epic CGI vistas of zombies taking down whole cities - and the SFX of the film, the zombies themselves are brilliant. Everyone in the film acted it very real, and you hope against hope that there is a solution but you have no clue what it could possibly be.There are flaws in the logic of the film, and much is left unexplained, which is annoying, but it doesn't really detract from the film experience, which is a spectacle to be sure. I don't get the 'fast zombie' thing but in this genre-version it seemed to work. The end of the film left an opening for future films without being too obviously cliff-hangerish and I was pleased how international it was and wasn't too flag-waving American. Overall a great film, very entertaining.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
This is the definition of Hollywood horror,"World War Z (2013) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently rewatched on Netflix. The storyline follows a zombie outbreak due to a virus in the blood. A man who is in special ops is lucky to survive with his family; however, he has to work to stay safe, and his line of work makes him a perfect candidate to work for the United Nation to find the origin of the outbreak and possibly the cure. Can he survive such a mission?This movie is directed by Marc Forster (Finding Neverland) and stars Brad Pitt (Fight Club), Mireille Enos (Gangster Squad), Daniella Kertesz (Incitement), James Badge Dale (The Departed), David Morse (The Green Mile) and Ruth Negga (Agents of SHIELD).This movie has very clean and crisp cinematography and special effects. This is the definition of Hollywood horror with a solid cast, straightforward storyline and over the top action scenes that are unrealistic but fun to watch unfold. The airplane crash was a bit rediculous, but the zombie wall and helicopter scenes are legendary. I will say the camouflage idea was over the top and caused me to roll my eyes, but okay. The makeup and depiction of the zombies was first rate and more films should leverage zombie sounds and biting noises, which were excellent in this. I will say I didn't love Pitt as the main character in this.Overall, this is a fun watch and not as bad as some make it out to be. I would score this a 7/10 and strongly recommend it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
An Absolutely Excellent Suspense and Semi-Horror Film,"After reading tons of reviews on IMDb about how so-so and almost bad World War Z was supposed to be, I decided not to see it. But my sister's birthday came around and that's what she wanted to do so ""I had to."" And I am SO glad I gave it a chance!I'm an actual movie-going human being, not a critic. And I was RIVETED by this movie.I'd never heard of World War Z or that it was a book before it was a movie. Perhaps World War Z is like the X-Men series, in that it is far better if you have little to no knowledge of the ""canon"" material. I can't know.All I know is, to me, an outsider coming into the World War Z setting and concept completely fresh, I was swept up and blown away. In my honest and humble opinion, the acting was believable, the effects were never over-the-top or under par, the writing/directing was spot on-- I have no complaints at all.Also keep in mind that I am a 100% bona fide pansy who becomes easily terrified by movies that are not even supposed to be scary. My sister, on the other hand, is a scary movie junkie. I was clinging to her every time the music changed, and even she jumped a few times.TL;DR: This movie was exciting, engrossing, and held my attention 110% of the time. There was never a lull. And, if I'm honest, I was plugging my ears and squinting during a majority of the final third of the film. ;) If that doesn't speak for a thrilling movie doing it's job, I don't know what does.Do yourself a favor, and give this movie a chance.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"

Best movie so far off the summer releases.The movie has a mixture of emotions, action sequences, thrilling encounters in a correct proportion. The director might have tweaked the book a lot but he has done enough work to keep the movie very much alive. The book lovers may dislike it but for others it is purely en-thrilling experience. One more plus point for the movie is the Cinematography. Usually the zombie movies are in dark and you would be always feel in dark.

2nd Favorite Movie of The Year So Far,Came back from World War Z and in my opinion an awesome film. I never really liked Brad Pitt in the past but I really liked and respected the role that he played in here as a family father and former military officer on a quest to save mankind compared to most of the playboy macho like kind of roles that he's played in the past. Not much to say about the other characters since they didn't' really play a huge role in this filmI really liked the 'your enemy is your friend' concept that they used in the film which I would rather not spoil here. The plot of the movie was very interesting and there were some really cool moments in the film. There were also moments where I felt like I was watching a video game adaptation. World War Z is definitely the best zombie films right now (even better than the Resident Evil series)This definitely listed down as my 2nd favorite film of the year so far (number 1 goes to Tom Cruise's Oblivion back in March). I would definitely see it again if I have the time,9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Quite surprised,"Just another zombie movie? Not quite..World War Z was a bit of a refresher for me in this overdone movie genre. As I have seen my fair share of zombie movies, WWZ puts a new twist on the 'Zombie Virus'.I couldn't help but notice key similarities between WWZ and the latest zombie console game, The Last of Us. Normally we expect nothing but long drawn out chase scenes involving a plethora of bullets, but WWZ and TLOU actually contain some strategy. Obviously if you are in an abandoned building and you make a lot of noise, zombies will come. However, the way WWZ executed these scenes, was much more favorable to me then all the typical crap out there.Instead of 30 zombies running down the hall quickly just because a door shut, they become more agitated as they hear more sound. Not just one thump.I did not read the book so I cannot make comparisons to the original content, but this was definitely entertaining and intense.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Fast paced action and on-the-edge-of-your-seat suspense.,"I thought the movie was a great watch! It's so fast paced you don't even have time to feel remotely bored. True, it's not an in-your-face gory / blood and guts zombie movie, but that's all been done already! It's quite refreshing to watch a zombie movie that isn't just all about ripped body parts. The story line may be simple, and perhaps rather predictable, however the movie doesn't fail to keep your eyes completely glued to the screen and you on the edge of your seat throughout.

The positives outweigh the negatives.,"Let's just not compare this to the book because we all know they're barely related in any way. World War Z is a really good zombie flick that makes up for it's weak characters and plot elements with it's thrilling action sequences and apocalyptic atmosphere. Now I'm not saying it's great, but if you're looking to get started with the Zombie genre this would be a very good first watch. The gore is minimal but it doesn't really hurt the movie in my opinion. My biggest negative with the film is it's rushed and re-shot ending, which I of course won't spoil. Anyways it really brings the film down for me since it really doesn't fit the rest of the film in my opinion. As I said the characters are pretty dull and there are a lot of rushed elements throughout the film, but I can overlook those things.The ending is far from great but I still really enjoy World War Z and I'm going to give it a 7.2/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Better than reviews say,"I went into this movie thinking it was not going to be good because of all the reviews on how bad it was. Good thing I didn't listen to the reviews. This movie was an amazing zombie film except that it was PG-13. Even though it was PG-13, it didn't need to show gore to be good. WWZ just didn't show a lot of blood but somehow it worked. At parts it can get really scary. World War Z had a lot of action and it kept you on the edge of your seat until the very end. Overall I was very impressed with World War Z. I would recommend to any zombie movie lover. This is one of my favorite zombie movies. I can not believe someone would write a bad review on this movie. -Nick",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Great take on a tired genre,"World War Z must have one of the shortest first acts in film history. The first act, usually the first half hour is generally where the conflict is introduced. This film opens with Gerry Lee, Brad Pitt, a former UN investigator having breakfast with his family. Five minutes later, BAM, zombies. No time is wasted getting straight to the conflict. Begin second act.The story is not complicated: zombies take over the world and Brad Pitt is obliged to save the day. The assault of zombie movies over the past few years has been such an onslaught that by default the genre itself now gives me an automatic feeling of ""I don't care."" World War Z is very much another zombie film, but a damn exciting one. Even the script's name for becoming a zombie, turning Zeke, is subtlety refreshingly""It's not what you say but how you say it."" With cinematic excellence, Director Marc Forster breaths new live into this tired cliché. It's all in the delivery, and WWZ is all delivery.As Gerry Lee (Pitt) travels the world trying to solve the mystery behind the infection causing people to turn ""Zeke,"" the scenes that unfold during his expedition are so exciting that story arc is incidental in comparison. A memorable scene is when a military commander becomes infected. He's got about ten seconds: ""I'm a goddamn ZekeI got this one boys."" He puts a bullet in this own headThe exotic set designs of the adventurous locales are the highlights of the film. First an adrenaline pumped escape from an infested Philadelphian housing project, then to a US navy ship at sea, then over to a US military base in Korea where a massive fire fight breaks out. Next Lee arrives in Israel where the citizens have protected themselves against the Zekes in a totally ingenious, but vulnerable walled up construction. The set design here is just incredible and when the situation goes awry, and things start blowing up, the visual effects are some of the best around, bar none.For more film reviews visit getthebonesaw.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
"Even though you've seen many zombie movies, you should give it a chance","At the start of the movie, I thought: Oh yeah, here it goes again, happy beginning, stupid dialog, poor scenario and always the same virus. But, I was wrong. The tempo of this movie was very fast. There is a lot of going on. I thought it was predictable, that it was going to be stuck on one scene till the end. But, that was not the case. The scenes,the places, the characters kept on changing, except the main lead of course. It's not a very scary movie (said from a person that is easily scared), but there are some scenes in which the biggest cities in the world are shown, filled with zombies at every corner and it makes you wonder how you will react in a similar situation; when there is nothing but panic and chaos. It's not some memorable movie, but it's very entertaining and definitely worth seeing (at the cinema also).",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Typical.,"This film is not only extremely American, but also very Brad Pitt.Unfortunately, it didn't really play to his strengths as an actor.Many interesting characters appear only to be tossed out after a single scene.It's engaging and thrilling right from the start, the atmosphere is tense and the editing is too class.But what keeps this movie from being great (at its genre) is the third act.Very out of character, very forced and just overall way less enjoyable.The most costly set, Jerusalem, was also the most interesting. Which they could have kept up the intensity afterwards.Enos is great but isn't used cleverly.6.8.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Kind of new concept in Zombie world,"We all know Zombie comes from virus. No cure, no medicine to reduce, people who turns to a Zombie can only be killed by destroy the head (It seems Zombies respect the theory that only brain death is really died). In this new Zombie movie, the turning process is still so quick which only needs 10 seconds, even faster than this in Resident Evil. Now here not exactly same as Alice, Gerry is a normal person but with Seal training, retiring at home enjoying his family happiness. He was reluctantly convinced to take part in the action looking for the cure of the virus. He is kind of stupid, so does his wife, they tried to not go, but any guy who can brainstorm will see why they are rescued and allowed to stay in the ship. So I have to say the director waste nearly 3 minutes to explain a plot which supposed to be an obvious thing. However, from the three minutes if we consider it from the direction of Peter, maybe it makes sense. Maybe it is what the real Peter wants to say. He wants to company with his family but he could hardly let his career go. Finally he has to get back again.It is possible that this movie will have several continuations, because of Darwin's Evolution Theory. But if so, it probably will be as same as Resident Evil. So my suggestion, making some differences or let it go.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
It's NOT just a survival movie... It's ten times better than that!!,"I think this movie in my personal opinion reigns supreme above most zombie movies , the ideas behind this movie is so diverse and unique in comparison. The zombies are fast where in pop culture most tend to be slow , thus raising the danger and the overall fear that these creatures bring to the table . This movie shows the government/scientific side of a zombie apocalypse where most zombie themed movies follow a small group of survivors and it's always heavily implied the government is gone and no longer exists , but this movie provides the opposite , the government isn't only actively fighting to find a solution but they actually do end up finding one. The idea that this virus only seeks out a healthy host is brilliant , these creatures refuse to target the terminally ill which brings such an original concept to the table . Most zombie movies are fun but imaginative where this one feels like it could be a reality one day given the right circumstances. Overall I will always highly rate this movie above most zombie themed shows and movies for its refreshing originality . It's satisfying to see such a unique concept come to life in a seemingly overdone genre .",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Souless Zombies take over the world,"Zombie movies are traditionally low budget and tend not to take themselves to seriously.As a result they are often either intentionally or unintentionally very amusing to watch.With World Z suddenly someone is taking Zombie movies seriously and have put serious amounts of money into producing this adaptation of Max Brooks' book.The book is essentially a series of recollections from survivors of a zombie apocalypse and as such doesn't offer one cohesive story to adapt and as a result the film-makers have had to go for a more linear plot.It doesn't follow the usual story though, of a group of people slowly being eaten until only the lead characters are left to single handedly kill all the risen dead.No - World War Z has a much wider world view with Brad Pitts' Jerry cruising around America, Korea, Jerusalem and Cardiff (!) trying to find a cure.This isn't the only thing grander in scale as there is no doubt the zombies hoards are vast.Really then should be the greatest Zombie movie ever made, but for a fan of the genre this for me is where it comes unstuck.The CGI zombies to me don't feel real in the way a person with an old suit, latex on his face and his arm hidden behind his back does.The whole mood is very serious and humourless, although to be fair a zombie war is never going to be laugh a minute affair.However I also didn't feel engaged with Brad Pitts character or family which meant I didn't feel any jeopardy when they were in dangerous situations.Don't get me wrong, as I enjoyed watching what is definitely a well made and entertaining movie, but it just felt a bit like the zombies..... a living thing but without a soul.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"

It's okay. Just a little baffling how it came about.,"I was a bit baffled I must admit, because as I watched this film I found myself wondering if Will Smith's character from Legend was going to pop up in the distance when they showed a New York scene.And that's the thing, it's basically the same film really, just with more people and locations.I watched it though, it was kind of fine, kind of okay. But all the way through I was struggling to really care, either about the rather predictable premise that human stupidity created the zombies through some form of virus or sickness even though the zombies seemed to suddenly have impossible strength and speed which would require significant bone, muscle and organ replacement surely...or indeed about the people trying to survive.Perfect film to watch if you are going to sort of pay attention, but might make a cuppa now and again or check the sports scores on your tablet and don't mind missing 30 seconds here and there.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"

Brad Pitt saves the world,"Not a terrible movie, fairly average. Some of the computer-generated effects were somewhat impressive, like the armies of zombies climbing over one another like ants. Brad Pitt has his certain charisma and ""star power"" but they seemed to be minimizing that throughout. They gave almost nothing for Mireille Enos to do. (She's from my home town!) Daniella Kertesz seemed to play the most interesting character, the Israeli soldier who travels with Pitt's character.

"Deviation Aside, Enjoyable Thrills","Your enjoyment of World War Z doesn't hinge solely on your enjoyment of the book which it claims to be based on, but owes it to anyone who has read the book to disclaim ""loosely based"". That being said, if you've read the book beforehand, the trailers alone should let you know that the film is going in wholly different direction that Max Brooks laid out in his novel.I am a huge fan of the zombie franchise, which George Romero essentially put a patent on and dozens of films have branched off from over the years. What ""World War Z"" does is attempt to mesh the behavioral patterns of the ""28 Days Later"" infected undead (I refuse to call them zombies, zombies are the slow, shuffling Romero staple) with the essential ideas behind Brooks' book. It does this admirably, but it's a direction that ultimately didn't need to be taken in order to make the film successful. In my mind, it felt like a lazy way of telling a story that builds itself up, cutting time off of the reel in favor of a more fast-paced, energized film experience.Being a huge fan of the book, I refused to shell out the $10 to see it in the theaters; as I said, the trailers told me clearly that the film was going to diverge far enough from the book for me to lower my expectations. As a rental, and for what it is, it's nowhere near terrible. Remove all comparisons to the book it takes minor inspirations from, and Brad Pitt does a solid job of weaving his way through a decently scripted and constructed horror film.This ended up being Pitt's highest grossing film to date, and a combination of factors play into that, not least of which being a rather stale list of opposing options in theaters at the time of its release. Still, it's an enjoyable film, however far it deviates from the source material, and however ridiculous some of us may think calling something that runs a zombie. Could have been better...and could have been a whole lot worse.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Bit shaky but all together a satisfactory movie,"Brad Pitt fights zombies and tries to find a cure to the widespread pandemic of the un-dead that are tearing the world apart. The movie is very fast and lots of things happen, Pitt seems to go every place there is on earth and just brings trouble wherever he steps foot, and he doesn't even kick that much ass. Now OK the movie is well OK and it goes along well, bit of a shaky start but it gets into an fairly nice flow, sometimes I didn't feel much of a connection with the characters but all in all they are fun kind of and the actors playing them do an alright job. The film suffers from an abundance of special effects and they seem weirdly outdated seeing as this is a high budget high octane thriller, you expect it to look good with the CGI.The movie is set in a whole lot of places, it feels like your typical disaster movie but of course add in the zombies and you have ""The Day After Tomorrow"" but instead of snow falling, it's zombies. It's as mentioned before very fast, the cameras go a little crazy with the shaky cam and some scenes with a lot going on get lost in all the movement, it feels like some kind of relief when the camera finally sits still. The movie mixes action but also a kind of emotion to not make this OTT but also not overly emotional either, it feels like action but with brains behind it.Brad Pitt produces and stars in this movie and is very acceptable in the role, sometimes the pace doesn't really work and I'm not going to sit here and say Pitt was great, but he is satisfactory in the lead role as Gerry Lane a former United Nations employee. The cast is not really an all star cast other than Pitt which is nice because you don't feel that blockbuster kind of feeling when the characters are simply talking to one another. The films pace yet again makes some actors roles very insignificant, it can feel that the people behind it don't want you to feel anything for anyone other than Pitt and some people he meets along the way.I liked Marc Forster as director but I can't say he knocked this out the park, his handle on the movie can overuse some things like effects and of course the cinematography, well I don't know if it was him or Ben Serisin who was the cinematographer for this. As the writing goes it can be good and bad in equal measures, it is exciting work in the writing for sure but it never truly lets the plot mature and I wasn't so keen on the ending, even Forster can't make the end any better. The locations are truly great and hats off to the people who found the places or built the studio sets because it at least feels real, it never looks like its fake or anything and it makes you feel like this is more real than many other zombie movies out there.I can't say I really liked the movie but I certainly didn't dislike it, for me it was alright and from what I have seen of others they mostly like it but many do not, not quite a love it or hate it kind of film but still one where moments can annoy people. A thing to add is don't watch this if you have read the book this is adapted from and expect it to be the same, try as hard as you can to watch it as a movie piece rather than comparing the two because this is completely different storytelling and to judge it on how it compares or according to some ""pales"" in comparison, it would be harsh on this.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"

MUCH better than expected!,"I just got back from viewing a special screening of WWZ, and I must say that myself, and the people I was with, were all very impressed.When the trailer initially came out some time ago, we all felt that it looked a bit rushed and cheesy... that it would likely be long on action (and probably exclusively of the CG type), and short on practical effects, story and character development. Well, while there are some impressive displays of CG throughout the film, the movie does, thankfully, retain its ability to keep the viewer emotionally invested in the goings-on and the characters circumstances. This can be a very tough ratio to balance, given that the movie studios tend to push too much for action much of the time in an effort to generate ticket sales, neglecting the story.World War Z is impressive in that it incorporates action and the CG elements into a larger whole. Meaning they are used to serve the story, instead of being its substitution.This is the type of movie you'll go into and as soon as it starts, it's over. Almost two hours have gone by, and they just fly. The pacing is perfect, as out protagonist treks the globe, racing to find a reason to hope. The effects and cinematography are superb, which adds to the overall thrill.An amazing adventure, be sure to catch this one.

Not a Typical Zombie Movie,"When I saw posters of this movie, the first thing that came to my mind was the ""Zombie Attack"". Keeping in view my history with the ""Zombies (in the fiction off course)"", I thought of this movie as a typical horror with some Brad Pitt ""Extra"".But When I actually saw the movie, I came to know, I was quite wrong in my perception. As opposed to many other movies on the Zombies subject, this particular movie is a actually a good combination of horror, thriller, disaster & some good humor lines. One thing that I particularity noticed was the bloodless action making it perfect for family and audience of all ages.Brad Pitts performance was excellent as usual and I think his presence in the movie would have attracted a lot of Pitt's fan base (even those who do not like the Zombie genre). Other actors performed well too.All in all it was a good movie and I give it 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
There's much to be impressed by in this film.,"It seemed to be on the cards that this movie was not going to attempt to recreate Max Brooks' novel, so I'm surprised by how many people still seemed to expect a faithful rendition of that book. I was more interested in seeing if the movie-makers had found anything new to do with the undead; surely by now even the most ardent of zombie fans are sick of the slow, shambling corpses who lose pounds by the moment as whole chunks of them fall rotting to the ground.The only real, significant innovation in the Zombie genre of late came, of course, from the UK, in the shape of ""28 days later"", with its depiction of the undead as vicious, hyperactive lunatics. World War Z's zombies have been wisely depicted in this manner, but this doesn't give the movie any points for originality.However, the concept of how these creatures are seen to run amok is arrestingly unprecedented: In this movie, the endless hoards of the dead are so numerous and so wired that they form mountains as they scramble over each other, and then said mountains suddenly seem to become tidal waves that crash down onto towns. I found these scenes to be quite mind-blowing - especially those set in Jersualem, whose security measures prove to be disastrously inadequate.Finally, I'd urge you not to pay much attention to those who are panning the performances, dialogue and plot as being feeble and lazy. They aren't. I think all of that is a case of sour grapes from those who feel betrayed by the fact that the movie wanders so far away from the philosophy of the source material.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
A PG-13 Zombie Movie,"3/4 World War Z is loosely based off the novel by Max Brooks of the same name.The story involves kind of the standard plot with a virus going around and people turn into zombies. Brad Pitt plays in the starring role where he has to leave his family and look for a cure for the virus. So the plot is pretty basic but smart at the same time with some great dialog and good direction.Yes, this is a zombie movie that is rated PG-13 which makes it obvious that this movie is not really going to be gory like earlier zombie flicks like Dawn of the Dead (2004) or Zombieland. It has a lot of zombie action but never gets to be gory where they make it involve no casualties or they cut the camera before there's any explicit gore. It kind of comes more to a disaster film where it really shows the global effect of the zombie apocalypseBut just because this film isn't gory, and stomach turning, doesn't mean it's not entertaining. There are many great thrills through the movie, but it does get a bit uneven which can throw audiences off. It isn't very powerful, but its a smart thriller of how they find the cure by using a familiar and kind of weak narrative.

A Crazy Movie,"The Movie delivers a thrilling and intense experience with a fresh take on the zombie outbreak. The film's rapid escalation of the zombie pandemic and its heart-pounding music add to the excitement. The transformation of zombies is impressively portrayed, creating a sense of fear and chaos. The movie's realistic portrayal of how the military handles the crisis brings a sense of authenticity often lacking in zombie films. The solid resolution to the infection sets it apart from other movies in the genre.However, while the film is gripping, more jump scares could have heightened the suspense even further. The implausible scene where the main character's plane leaves Jerusalem without him feels a bit contrived. Additionally, the main character's phone battery seems to be conveniently unreliable, which could have been better executed to maintain the tension.Despite these minor flaws, ""World War Z"" remains an engaging and refreshing addition to the zombie genre. Its relentless pace, chilling transformation sequences, and intriguing take on a global pandemic keep viewers on the edge of their seats. With a few improvements, it could have been even more terrifying, but overall, it offers a satisfying and adrenaline-fueled cinematic experience.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"

mediocre in parts but refreshing to the genre in general,"After all the badmouthing I was actually surprised about how enjoyable this title was. Sure, it follows your usual dramaturgy so very well known from about a quarter million other movies from Hollywood but against the background of the genre, WWZ really manages to shine in some parts.The Novella by Max Brooks, which this movie is based upon, is definitely recognisable even if the writers of the screenplay took their freedoms. The parts where the film borrows from the book are also and unsurprisingly the strongest. The whole setting is a refreshing approach to the genre as the initial outbreak and how people and governments probably would try to fight it is portrayed and not the dystopian aftermath, which is the case with pretty much every other title of the genre. I also like how the fast spread of such a virus/disease in densely populated areas and the consequences with gigantic hordes of zombies are displayed. All these are authentic aspects (as far as a ""zombie apocalypse"" goes however) you rarely see in other titles of the genre except the beginning of the original ""Dawn of the Dead"" from 1978.If the characters wouldn't have followed your usual stereotypes and the film would have dealt with the socio-economic implications of such an event more (a bit like ""Contagion"" from 2011 - e.g. what about oil, food, power etc. if everything comes to a standstill) it could have even been a truly great addition to the genre.

"Outstanding ""Zombie"" Drama","What a surprise this movie is. I am always skeptical of ""M"" rated horror films (PG-13 in the U.S.), they are usually to tame to be scary but this film was genuinely scary and suspenseful. I have been watching horror movies since I was 3 years old (over 50 years ago) so very little scares or surprises me ... this film did! I felt compelled to write this review because I saw there were many negative reviews on IMDb and I simply don't understand why? I suppose most Zombie buffs would be looking for more gore but do not be put off by that, I nearly made the mistake of not going after reading some of those reviews, however the lack of real gore is not an issue! This is an intelligent Zombie/Virus movie and certainly about as realistic as you could get and I've seen probably every Zombie movie ever made. By realistic I mean that if we did actually have a Zombie apocalypse, I believe it would be very close to what is portrayed in this film, it is believable in that way.

Unbearable,"About halfway through my viewing of World War Z, I was ready to walk out. Then I realized something, I was in my own home. This movie made me want to leave my own home.

The is the scariest movie I have seen in a long time,"This movie worked and moved in a class all on its own. It brings the concept of zombie movies up to a serious point, the way Dark Knight elevated comic book movies into a serious realm. I want to start of responding to some points made by others.To start with, trying to compare this with other zombie movies borders on a bad idea. This may indeed be yet another zombie movie, but it takes the idea of zombie apocalypse to a whole new level. And also offers something all the more precarious that none of the others have really ever put forward, hope. I have noticed people trying to compare it to 28 Days Later. This is an immense mistake for one major reason. 28 Days Later is not a zombie movie. It seems like one but in reality none of the infected are dead. Not zombies.As far as Brad Pitt being in this, to be quite honest I was skeptical. I couldn't picture Brad Pitt fighting zombies and taking him seriously. He surprised me. He did an amazing job in this movie. Far better than people have given him credit for.Despite what many others have said, the zombies are actually quite realistic. Though when moving in mass (you will see in Jerusalem) you can tell there is CG involved it doesn't take away from it. Especially when seeing them up close. The make-up easily rivals Walking Dead. As far as the athleticism of the zombies, that can be easily explained. They are not limited by pain. Nearly every human body is capable of great speed, strength, agility, and dexterity. What stops us from doing all of those things, is pain, and our own sense of exhaustion. Take away the ability to feel pain, to get tired, to need air and food, and you have an unstoppable machine. Give it a single minded determination and you have a World War Z zombie. In an interview someone said that the zombies in this movie are treated as if they were, ""a force of nature."" They succeeded.The misfortunes you see that occur through out the movie, are so realistic and possible you can almost feel the doom to yourself proceeding each event. This not only leads showing great acts of selflessness and courage but also deplorable acts of cowardice and stupidity.I loved that this didn't rely on super amounts of gore. Modern horror movies no longer rely on suspense, surprise, and that adrenaline rush that leaves you nearly hyperventilating for the hero. Nope, just blood, and guts, and the biggest shock value possible. This movie doesn't leave you feeling like your popcorn is going to make a repeat performance. It gives you an adrenaline rush. One thing people also always talk about is the fact that zombie apocalypse couldn't happen. But the reality is that it could. All it takes is a virus, a single virus, and everything is possible. That sounds crazy, but new virus' are found all the time, develop and evolve all the time. Someone points out that zombies are such an improbable possibility, that unless some is saying, ""what if it it possible?"" then there is no hope for survival.Though I do not get where anybody would get the ludicrous concept that this movie is even remotely sexist, I guess everybody has to find a PC controversy to make themselves feel better.The need for Brad Pitt's character to emotionally develop throughout this movie is almost cliché. His character didn't need to emotionally develop, he needed to intellectually develop, which he did. To say that everything was felt and only impacted skin deep, completely misses the fact that zombie apocalypse isn't the place for emotional growth, and wasn't paying attention to how things played out between Gerry and many of the other characters.Now after this bit by bit response to other complaints, let me say this. This movie kept me on the edge of my seat (and many others in the theater as well, the only reason I noticed was because the guy behind my husband came close to falling off his seat and into my husbands lap.) I never hide my face during horror movies, but I did through this. It scared the heck out of me, and yet it left me contemplating. This is, without a doubt, the best zombie movie I have ever seen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Should have been epic....,"Great book, lousy movie. Pretty much no character development, it never really goes anywhere besides finding a ""neat and clean"" ending (which was pretty much a huge sellout...) It showed nothing of a ""zombie war"" as the title suggests.. When they say this was loosely based on the book, thats being generous..there's maybe 3 small elements or dialog from the book. It was more of the same fast-paced drivel pumped out by studios these days...no substance. I couldn't believe how little zombie action there was and the CG zombies look ridiculous. It was not the worst movie I've ever seen, but I wish I hadn't spent ten dollars on a movie ticket and had just waited to rent it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
World War Zombie,"World War Z is a top tier zombie action/thriller. It was adapted from book to the big screen in very successful manner. It's probably one of, if not the best zombie movie I've seen before. The beginning with the outbreak is particularly entertaining and fun to watch. Brad Pitt's character Gerry Lane is also very well done and fun to root for. It's sad the sequel keeps getting delayed here because there's a lot of potential for a series built off of this if done correctly with the right people involved. Definitely worth the watch and an instant zombie classic. IMDb needs to get rid of these minimums though!!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
More like World War Zzzzzz,"I know. Clever title, right? But seriously, this film is thrill-deficient. Sure it's got a global scope, but it has a tiny scale. That may be par for the course in your typical zombie movie, but this one happens to have the word ""War"" in it. Yeah it has a few large-scale set pieces, but it really doesn't add up to anything more than hordes of computer generated zombies descending like locusts on groups of hapless victims.Attempts to add character depth by saddling our hero (Brad Pitt, in a solid turn) with a family that we know is never in any real danger because Hollywood would never kill off kids in a PG-13 film, fall flat and only serves to slow down the film's already lethargic pace.World War Z isn't a bad movie, but its attempt to blend popcorn movie aesthetics with zombie movie sensibilities doesn't quite succeed.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
"Not awful, but all the same disappointing","I am always up for a good zombie movie - emphasis on ""GOOD"". Most zombie movies I've seen have disappointed me, and ""World War Z"" is other notch on that list.I haven't read the book the movie is based on, but I suspect it must have been a lot better than this. What went wrong? I'm not sure. Despite all the money that was thrown at this movie (including refilming the ending), the movie at times doesn't seem that expensive. Another problem is that the zombies themselves aren't explored closely. You never really get a sense of what they are like and what they can do. Why would they only bite people instead of eating them, like zombies in other movies? Well, that's probably because the movie stubbornly sticks to being at a PG-13 level. Yes, that's right - a zombie movie without that much blood and gore, which I know will annoy many horror fans.Well, I guess the movie isn't THAT bad, but it's a big disappointment. I should note that I saw the movie for free at a theater. If I had paid any money to see it, I strongly suspect my review would have been a lot more scathing.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
"Fast, pacey but not scary","In todays 'Call of Duty' generation where viewers can't seem to go without action for more than 10 seconds, horror films have to be diluted into action spectacles. Removing the subtleties and tension that make films scary only creates a mindless action fest. World War Z follows Brad Pitts character as he travels around the world investigating the cause of a 'rabies' style outbreak which is turning people in fast, agile crazy people. The zombies themselves are more like rabid dogs, so calling them 'the undead' doesn't seem appropriate. The film relies on large CGI set pieces rather than tense and claustrophobic horror (although to its credit, the film does include some of this classic horror later on) In terms of characters, the film leaves them undeveloped and one- dimensional. There is potential, but the film would rather jump from place to place, feeding you the same formula each time without really giving you any deeper meaning or discussion.World War Z suffers from what many generic action films do - a huge VFX budget and a bland un-engaging script, designed to wow audiences with a flashy look but leaving very little food for thought or substance.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
"""Every Human Being Saved is One Less To Fight""","This film was quite an experience, it oozed the audience into the actual scene and did not let you get out until the credits started rolling. World War Z gets right to the action from the very beginning, and it creates the most hectic environments you can possibly think of. Brutality-wise, it's obviously not as gory as zombie flicks such as Dawn of the Dead but it fully pushes it's PG-13 rating to the extent. Throughout the movie, it blends it's genre of horror and action masterfully and even though there are a few laughs, it's overall tone is pretty serious yet still entertaining. The ""father"" role seems to fit Brad Pitt nicely and the trailer may have represented this film as if it was brainless but as far as zombie movies go, it uses it's brain. You will be jumping out of your seat not because of fright but because of how tense the scenes are. The score goes along with the numerous moods in the film. It's completely original, to every single detail, even the zombies(appearance and behavior are different from the average zombie). Overall, this isn't a movie but better, it's a journey that will contain surprises and above all fun.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
The First Big Zombie Movie In Several Years,"It's been several years since the last big zombie movie. 'The Walking Dead' kind of took over the whole zombie franchise with their mind-blowing series. Anyway, 'World War Z', just like 'Man of Steel', was brought up to be huge. When it went into the box office it immediately made millions of dollars because of all the fans that have been waiting for it to come out for several months. So, anyway, the pressure is on. Here's what I thought about 'World War Z'.It started out moving very fast and flying through scenes, which disappointed me a little. I enjoyed that there was action, and that it didn't take forever, but it just went by too fast. Well, a few scenes after that I realized that they had a reason to go fast: They needed time to build up to the action. The reason I realized that is because it started to go really slow and bored, so 'World War Z' didn't start out that well in my opinion. It needed to redeem itself in the rest of the movie, which it actually did.So, at this point, I had no idea what to expect. I was wandering what was going to happen and how it was going to end. Soon after this, though, what I thought was the coolest part of the movie came up. It was scene where in the previews there were 100s of zombies climbing up on each other up to a wall. That part was in a huge context, well explained, and had a very entertaining and exciting action sequence. I truly loved that part. Also, shortly after that, there was another very cool scene, but then the slowness came back, which is what this movie is: Action, then slowness, action, then slowness. I thought that was okay, but I didn't expect the movie to be like that.There was something in this movie that was interesting. This was the use of the word 'zombie'. Most other zombie movies or television series' don't say zombie. They say 'walker', 'infected', 'diseased'... etc. In this movie the use of the word 'zombie' comes up every now and then. I thought it was kind of cool because no other movie that I've seen about zombies have said it, other than 'Abraham Lincoln vs. Zombies', which was terrible. No other monster movies have restricted saying the word of what we call them. Vampires, werewolves, giants, robots, etc. I also thought that in these zombie movies of television series', they wouldn't live in a world without zombie comic books and shows and movies.Near the end of this movie it was getting really slow, and I thought, ""Come on now, pick it up."" The movie was starting to lose its good points from me... Well, when it got to the end, there were very interesting and entertaining things. It wasn't really action, so you'll see when you see the movie. That part kept me on the edge of my seat, though. There was a lot of suspense in that part. It eventually turned into an action scene, which was cool. Anyway, after that, there was a bit of a twist, which I really liked. Then, the movie started wrapping up, and when the movie stops, it kind of just stops. I was thinking, ""Whoa, I guess it's just... Over."" My 8/10 rating means that I thought 'World War Z' was really good. I very much recommend this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
You'll Feel Like You're There,"I'm not understanding some of the lackluster reviews here but I respect that everyones entitled to their opinions.

No filler, just action. Much like movies such as Cloverfield and 28 Weeks Later/28 Days Later you'll feel like you're in the movie experiencing it as one of the characters. It moves so well it feels like it flies by but in a good way. I recommend it. The acting is good too. Cinematography is epic and special effects are above average.

Thinking Man's Zombie Movie,"Looks like the Zombie genre is growing up. This movie goes beyond the usual blood and gore and individual heroics (Resident Evil series), to the next level.Brad Pitt is convincing in his role. But the story isn't cohesive, there is no sense of urgency in the whole movie. It doesn't build any palpable tension as the movie progresses. All in all, it could have been a truly great movie.And I can't figure out how this movie could have a $200M production budget. There isn't much of ""action"" that shows a well spent $200M (like in the Michael Bay Transformer movies). On a lighter note, if it were the US army/CIA and not the UN, this movie could have been made with $50M instead of $200M.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
"Bold, adventurous, action packed","I haven't read the book and I like zombie movies enough, but this movie is a unique mix of zombie, natural disaster, and the new end-of-the-world-super-disease genre. It has just enough scientific basis to make it plausible but at the same time the cinematography is absolutely brilliant. In terms of scale, it is also unusual in that this movie spans the entire globe, thus giving a relatively macro-view of what a global zombie pandemic looks like. Overall a must see!Positives: the fall of Jerusalem is arguably one of the best scenes I've in a movie theater in a long time. The initial buildup, the calm before the storm, the first victim, the gathering of momentum as the zombies begin to gain the upper hand, absolutely brilliant! Fast action without a lot of the cheap suspense of people walking around in abandoned places and being jumped by lone zombies. Lack of character development has been cited as a negative for this film but I'd have to say that most of the characters were surprisingly well-developed WITHOUT falling into the standard zombie apocalypse tropes. More importantly, it's a freaking zombie movie, exactly how much character development do you want anyways? It's a good mix between action and humanism, without neglecting either aspect.Negatives: ending was a little abrupt, some questions remain unanswered, less emphasis on politics, minor details.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Don't stray from the path and you'll be fine,"Although I claim that all zombie films are good, I would say this is a good film even if you disagree with my axiom. The recipe is known and doesn't stray much from what we've seen so many times before - but it's always enjoyable: zombie outbreak, hero leads a team in search of answers regarding its origin. The film plays it safe and focuses on having good action and a lot of suspense rather than try to have a deeper message or get smart, and it's probably for the best. Meanwhile, it avoids the clichés it needs to stay away from: fluke solutions, (too) bad science (like the ""oh, we have a drop of blood from patient zero, the vaccine will be ready in 5 minutes"" phenomenon), etc are fortunately absent. Brad Pitt has no difficulty pulling off a not too dramatically demanding role and the ending is open enough to satisfy everyone, after a somewhat anticlimactic last confrontation scene. Somewhere in between a few original ideas for the genre are carefully placed.Finally, the film did leave me wondering about one thing. Even though there are some very impressive scenes (especially the ones in Jerusalem) where it makes the difference, is there a reason for a zombie film with such a huge budget, when wonders have been made with -small- fractions of this one's cost? But I suppose this is a question for the producers.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Better than expected,"World War Z (2013) (7/10)When I first saw the trailer my first thoughts were.. Not again.. Reason for that being, is that for the past years all companies whether it's a Movie(pictures) or a Game development company, have been trying to make a zombie hit film/game, and in my opinion almost every single one of them has failed. Of course the hit series ""The walking dead"" Is without a doubt not a failure, more like a huge success. But the fact that there were so many failed games and movies about zombies, roughly made to fit in with the Apocalypse trend in 2012. Made my expectations very very low.Now somehow Marc Forster, managed to have a twist of originality in the common zombie themed movie. Which made me actually like it, I really did. Brad Pitt was of course as expected outstanding, but that wasn't the only thing, the plot actually was good. Now I won't spoil what the original point is in the movie obviously, But I will guarantee you, that you will enjoy watching this. You won't be able to relax throughout the entire film, it's a classic. Every minute will be exciting and entertaining at the same time.So people, want a more realistic view of ""zombies"" ? or you just want to be entertained?

"Worth at watching at least once, in my opinion","I read the book a year ago and it was great. When I found out there was going to be a movie adaption, I was excited. Then I read a little about the movie, watched the commercials, and noticed that it would be nothing like the book. And it isn't. It's a whole new zombie story in itself with the only similarity with the book being the title. The movie is decent, but it's nothing special. In the first half of the movie, they throw everything they've got at you and the last half felt like they got bored when writing the story line. It felt like it was only a 45 min. movie and left me wanting more. And not in a good way. The acting is decent, the sets are believable, and the writing is...alright. I only found one thing laughable in the movie and that was the Pepsi product placement. If you enjoy zombie movies and are wanting a new one, I'd recommend this to you.

These Cannibals are Quick!,"What You Should Know – These are not the slow-strolling-down-the-street zombies of yester-year. These cannibals are quick! And ready to rip into you faster than you can say World War Z. They can climb skyscrapers, take down helicopters, and even break into secure hospitals if there's an ounce of blood nearby. As expected they spend the first thirty minutes of the movie destroying the most significant cities (i.e. New York, Washington D.C. – any place that has a well-known landmark) and its Brad Pitt's job to bring the epidemic to an end.What Works – His long beard and even longer mane makes Pitt completely believable as a United Nations investigator. He's not a typical action hero. His mission isn't to save the world- just preserve what's left of humanity.What Doesn't Work – The wife and kids. Every man needs something to fight for but these people aren't it. Mireille Enosase doesn't have the sexiness and strength necessary to play Pitt's wife. And Sterling Jerins and Abigail Hargrove are two complaining kids that would barely survive middle school let alone the apocalypse. Angelina Jolie and their third-world adopted kids would have endured the zombie epidemic with no problems.What I Thought – Worth the Admission World War Z is worth the admission. Its action/drama/horror sequence is all the genres mixed into one and makes this summer movie so intense. Is it typical? Yes. A virus breaks out unexpectedly. Lots of people run and scream, some die, others are turned. There are aerial-shots of all the usual tourist attractions and in the end it's the race to find a cure. But still it's a fun and scary journey worth taking a tour to see – at the very least worldwide zombies are more fascinating than the domestic ones you've seen before.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"

Good but had more potential,"'World War Z' was a film that I enjoyed but feel it had potential to be something great. It does involve a lot of zombies but I would class this as more of a disaster movie. The zombie were mainly seen in hordes going up buildings and over walls, rather than up close and personal. There wasn't much blood either.The film was shot incredibly well and looked very realistic, the scene on the plane was probably the most impressive and the scene I enjoyed the most. The atmosphere is dark and the tension builds up nicely. The action scenes are very fast paced when we get them as well. Some of the scenes are actually breathtaking and just crazy.The acting is solid all round and we do feel for Brad Pitt's character because we found out a bit about him at the start of the film, and we know he is doing it for his family first and foremost.The way it ended was a bit unsatisfying and I feel the plot was a bit rushed in places. It is a solid action flick but some parts may drag a little.I would recommend it though, it was enjoyable, well filmed, acted well, had tension and atmosphere, good action. But there was just that little something missing, I can't quite grasp what but it definitely had potential to be more than it was.7/10.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"

A good zombie film,"I really liked this film.It was the perfect mix of intimate intensity, emotion and absolute, terrifying spectacle.Directed by Marc Forster (Quantum of Solace, Monster's Ball), and starring Brad Pitt, the film deals with a zombie outbreak on a global scale and the attempts to find the source and cure.Certainly, the film is barely ten minutes young when it all kicks off. We're quickly introduced to Gerry Lane (Pitt), his wife (Mireille Enos) and their children and then the outbreak begins. Certainly the difference between this film and almost any other zombie film preceding it is scale. It is a LARGE scale film, the CGI is used incredibly effectively for portraying thousands of zombies at a time.It is this that creates the intensity. The sheer numbers and volume of the zombies overwhelm and the film certainly has fun with the large scale scenes and the behaviour of these creatures. There are a few times where the sheer scale of the events on the screen is awesome in the very literal sense of the word, you are in awe.This scale is impressive on a technical level but it's even more impressive that Marc Forster, Brad Pitt and scriptwriters (initially J. Michael Straczynski, then later Matthew Michael Carnahan, Drew Goddard and Damon Lindelof for re-writes) manage to find the human story and relationships amid all the mayhem. Certainly the supporting cast provide compelling roles, special mention must be made to Daniella Kertesz as an Israeli soldier.The humanity of the story helps to fuel the tension for the other kind of 'zombie' scenes, which are the quieter, scarier type of scenes which don't feature as many zombies. Is it here that the pacing (and scale) are dimmed down hugely. The film doesn't stop to a halt, but the tone of the third half of the film is certainly slower than the rest of the film. Apparently, it was here that the rewrites and re-shooting had their main impact on the film. It's a noticeable shift in the overall tone of the film which actually is quite welcome for one main reason.There is no way they could have gone bigger than scenes earlier in the film. They don't try to outdo the earlier scenes in scale or number of zombies present, instead, it shifts the tension much more to the characters and I found it works. I could imagine that people could have disappointed with the lack of 'bang' at the end of the film but for me, it worked.The film has a few really nice touches in there as well, nice actions the characters take that seem very honest and real as well as you hear about some countries reactions to the outbreak which make sense.Now, it is most certainly true to say that the film differs from the book. That is a fact. The book deals with World War Z as a series of interviews from people important to the event itself, separate narratives and so on. The film has a single narrative path, beginning, middle, end, and only really following Gerry Lane throughout the events. However, I found the film to be a superior zombie film as well as a stunning (and intense) action picture.The point was also made afterwards that whilst it has scary moments and is very intense, it is light on actual gore. Certainly the usual zombie cliché of some guy graphically getting eaten alive is not present. The film certainly isn't a 15 for explicit violence but the general tone of the film is not only intense, but pretty bleak too(I don't often mention the film's rating in my reviews btw).Anyway, really enjoyed the film. Would easily watch again.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
not a horror at all,"So much negativity about World War Z that I was afraid almost to go watch it but I had to watch it because it's all about the hype of nowadays, Zombies. What I really can understand is the difficulty to categorize this flick. I just should file it under post apocalyptic, not a straight horror.To call it a horror it should be scary or for a zombie flick maybe even gory but none of that is here to find. We have seen it all before, flicks with major names trying to make a horror but failing in the fact that people who are used to see the big names dropping the flick because it's so-called horror. That's what happened here, Pitt buffs never went to watch it because the zombie theme and horror geeks are into The Walking Dead nowadays full of gore and here we don't have any (no gore and brutality off-camera) so they discard this flick too.Not that it was bad after all, but a lot of zombies are done CGI wise. The quickness of the zombies and the cleverness (climbing over a wall) do makes it a bit creepy but the scene's in dark alleys never makes it scary. Still, post apocalyptic lovers will adore this. It's a nice start for a zombie evening, to watch with the whole family before the children go to sleep and you are plugging in the real stuff.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 4/5 Story 4/5 Comedy 0/5",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Zombie Mayhem at its Finest,"Rating: 4.9/5 stars Reviewed by: Dare Devil KidA first-rate zombie film by all accounts. Brimming with palpable tension, replete with suspenseful moments, and pulsating with heart- pounding action. Fans of zombie movies or horror film in general will love this latest Hollywood rendition of sprinting, wall-climbing zombies. Traditionalists don't need to be put off by the this new, revamped version of zombie mobility and should instead, graciously welcome this innovative conceptualization of zombie action.The back-story is appropriately integrated into the proceedings and the each course of action is well justified from both, the director's as well as the viewers' perspectives. But make no mistake, the movie offers no spoon-fed helpings and you need to pay proper attention - even though you won't need to rack your brains - to attune yourself with the flow of this apocalyptic environment.One of the most delightful aspects of ""World War Z"" is that it boasts of an abundance of memorable, nerve-wracking scenes - the hallmark of most great films - that will remain with you for days after leaving the cinema hall. Some of the scenes literally have to be seen to be believed (especially the entire scenario in Israel and the film's climax in the WHO building), and you'll be begging yourself to catch a second serving of this delectable film at the earliest. Fans of the novel won't be disappointed, as the author's vision (though certain aspects have been tweaked for creative and cinematic purposes) is maintained in essence and pertinent and crucial parts of the novel have been retained.Most impressive is director Marc Forster's (Finding Neverland, The Kite Runner) assured craftsmanship. With just a few credible projects on his resume and no proof of expertise in the horror or action genre (please don't even mention the appalling ""Quantum of Solace""), one could easily be forgiven to dismiss his merit as a director for a movie of this magnitude. But after watching the film, one would again be easily forgiven to plead with the studio not to change the director for the movie's sequel, and make no mistake, this is a sequel that will be eagerly anticipated when it's announced.Finally, Brad Pitt once again proves why he's regarded as a global cinema icon. He succinctly balances the complex task between being a moviestar you'll root for and an actor who you'll empathize and care for. Among a cast (excluding the zombies of course) that has virtually nothing to do - besides the intensely riveting Daniella Kertesz - he ably shoulders the film from the first scene to the last and prevents it from being relegated to just another mindless and fun zombie flick. ""World War Z"" is yet another jewel in his already studded crown and shall go down as a genuine horror classic in years to come.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"

My husband and I both woke up from zombie nightmares later that night. :-) As for the Brad Pitt angle, he managed the role just fine. I am still not his fan, but you might be, so you will enjoy the movie that much more. Happy Watching!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
This movie is insult to intelligence,technical after 5-10 you had to walk out of this movie as your jumping from one plot hole to the next plot hole basically I should vote 0/10 but i could see it for free so 1/10 is OK besides from the plot holes (this movie has no real story) the directing and camera movement is awful too you cant see anything with this shaking and dark mess you cant even see who is a zombie from 3m onward distance to make a zombie movie with pg16 is genius too I don't even know why they are called zombiesi am surprised they didn't call-in the Prometheus scientist team again which has already proved it can handle such stuffabout the people you know that brad Pitt will survive and about the rest you don't carelol lol lol what a crap movie,1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
"Not as bad as i thought , but not as good as i'd hoped","First off , I am a Zombie movie fan. I've seen a lot of Zombie movies and i'm a big fan of The Walking Dead. I've never read the book to this movie , so i don't have anything to compare in that regard. After watching the trailer to this movie , i have to say i wasn't entirely excited about it. The whole running/ant-like movement of these zombies didn't seem to fit what i like about zombie movies. This movie just looked like it was going to be just another action movie with zombies inserted in as the antagonist. I wasn't to thrilled about Brad Pitt playing the lead role either. I like Brad Pitt , he is a good actor , but just hard to see him in this role. So as you can see i had some mixed feelings going into this movie. Well after finally seeing the movie, there was one word that best described this movie for me - ""incomplete"". I felt like this was the beginning of a story (and perhaps it is). If i knew for certain that this movie was a part 1 of ? then the movie would have given me more closure. Overall still worth a watch in my opinion",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Extremely breath-taking,"World War Z is extremely breath-taking and action-packed. This is the best zombie-movie ever made so far. The characters played their role very well, the story line was great. The ending and how the zombies are shown are uniquely depicted. I even find myself breathing nervously and scared, even covering my eyes in some scenes because it is really fascinating. I just really wish the movie was longer because it really happens very fast, but fast in a good way. Each and every scenes are very unique and I even find myself at the edge of my seat. But what I love the most about this movie is that it doesn't only focus more on zombies, because aside from being a horror movie, there are also some very funny scenes and lines.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Definitely worth watching it on d big screen i had my apprehensions but was surprised!,"I dint really have a lot of expectations from the movie & i guess its better to keep ones expectations low rather than build them up for being let down aka last week and man of steel case in point. Every week apparently this year Hollywood is throwing at us how the world will end or change in different versions...be it Man Of steel fighting ZOD or the dud After earth or upcoming Pacific Rim. The tendency is to give u a big blockbuster action packed visual feat where the world is at stake. After a while action without purpose tends becomes repetitive and if u always get what u expect and have seen before then what's the purpose of watching a new film anyway i say? This is where exactly ""World War Z"" differs, u do have action scenes, big visuals but not at the expense of the story, it serves as way to forward the story instead the other way around. Zombies and gore are something we have seen umpteen number of times but to see how this particular Zombie situation could actually turn things around the globe in a split second around without gorge is more of an achievement i would say than a let down. Brad Pitt is more than just a pretty lad, he has somewhat an enigmatic presence on screen which keeps u hooked, u do connect with him at some level and think that gosh if the world did need some1 to save it from Zombies (since no superhero here or avengers would b useful here) u would want to have Brad Pitt be that man on your side!His search for a solution to the Zombie problem is pretty much the crux of the story.There are a few shock moments which does make u jump in the seat though 3d is pretty much wasted an useless. I haven't read the book so cant draw a conclusion but in my experience besides Lord of the Rings books always tends to be better than the movie itself, so i would say its a blessing in disguise if u haven't read the book! Not often can a whole family go and see a Zombie flick which is pretty much Rated R but this 1 actually is PG13 which makes it that rare kinda scary movie a family of 4 could go and see together which i guess is also a bonus. The movie does have its faults and could certainly be better but the fact that in the roughly 2hr runtime of the movie the story constantly moves ahead with a purpose and doesn't drag it feet is what in the end makes it watchable and is the real icing on the cake! Don't be 1 of those blokes always looking for gore & over d top action & give the story a chance & u will enjoy it otherwise u will come out cribbing!To wrap it up i would like to say this movie is more personnel in the form of a blockbuster which doesn't happen 2 often now days!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"

So Close.....,"I rated it 7, would have been an 8 maybe 9 but too much ridiculous child angst.

I also like that you can't get attached to anyone. That makes the suspense and action much more realistic.It lives up to the title with it's scope, it really is a World War.

"Could have been better, but still decent","This zombie movie features Brad Pitt as the main protagonist, Gerry Lane. This worried me at the beginning. However, the movie was surprisingly good but could have been better. This film is nothing like the book and I feel like they should have named this movie something else that way someone else could make a real World War Z. This movie doesn't do anything new or groundbreaking, but parents will appreciate the minimal gore in this movie. However, this could also be viewed as a negative and might disappoint some of the more mature viewers. It tries to be smart and suspenseful and almost succeeds, but falls short. There is some nice acting and it does divert from a few clichés but there are still many throughout the film. Overall I would say that this movie is not a waste of your money, but you shouldn't expect anything too spectacular.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Sci-fi genre with spectacular action scenes and many plot twists,"From the moment the credits stop, the action takes off. A threat to the World has come upon the human race. The clock is ticking as some of the planet's greatest minds attempt to resolve this ultimate threat. Brad Pitt, an investigator for the United Nations, is tasked with defining the problem and stopping it in its tracks. Leaving his family behind, he sets out across the World to look for answers to a problem that may have no answer or does it? He drops into numerous countries, yet by the time he arrives its too late to help. Elements of the pending catastrophe become clearer as he moves through his assigned tasks. Brad Pitt gives a fine performance. His costars flesh out the darkness looming over the World with sequences of better than average acting. This movie needs to be observed closely. There is so much action occurring simultaneously, you may need to watch it more than once to realize the total story being told on the screen. In a few interval scenes I had some trouble understanding the plot, but it becomes more clear with each passing section. I recommend this move to those who enjoy sci-fi or enjoy movies with many plot twists.

This is the best zombie movie I've ever seen. the zombies in this movie are much more terrifying than any other zombie film, sure they don't look as gruesome as the walking dead zombies but you can expect that from a pg-13 movie, but the real reason they're more terrifying is that they move very fast and they move in swarms. the acting was good, brad pitt was amazing as usual. the visual effects are better than what others are saying, in my opinion they're better than avatar, world war z is also way better than avatar. world war z proves that movies don't have to be violent and gory to be good. this movie deserves way better reviews than what it's getting.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Much better than feared with plot holes you can parachute through.,"While a prefer more gore in this type of thing, I didn't really miss it this time. The film, which seems 20 minutes too long, has some clever ideas but quite a few unrealized ones. The strongest sell for this film is that, despite some uncomfortably boring moments and some unconvincing acting, it comes back with big, juicy scenes that keep you excited. Many films fail at that and the audience walks away feeling half-disappointed even with the pluses. The early scenes with the family and the mismatched reactions they have to ""the end of the world,"" somehow makes one feel like the family dynamic was unnecessary. No one reacted correctly to the sudden annihilation of mankind. I mean, not one person even said ""What the hell is happening?"" They all seemed like they had been through something like this once before. It's not like zombies take over the planet every day. The children are poorly written as characters. If I saw my parents half eaten by zombies, I'd be in a screaming fetal position for weeks. But Tomas is as unshaken as if he merely lost reception on his iPhone. And the outcome to the crashing airplane is stupidly unbelievable even for a film that's supposed to be unbelievable. The scenes in Israel are stunning and luckily, when you think the film is falling under it's own weight, they bring back visually powerful scenes to make up for it. You'll have to forgive them some for the flaccid ending which seems written 5 times. The points made at the end are even repeated. But, even with the trouble it has, it surprisingly keeps you entertained and convinced, which, especially with the overblown groaners they've spit out this summer, is hopeful.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
This is the film Zero Dark-Thirty wanted to be,"I haven't read the book, and yes, I hear it's brilliant, but the people I know who have read it think it was unfilmable. There are also critics who suggest this is a fine film that should have been called something other than World War Z.Maybe so.Regardless, I thought this film was tense, smart, real, and thoroughly engrossing.The action starts about 3 minutes after the opening credits and doesn't let up. Brad Pitt reminded me of John McClane from Die Hard in his inventiveness and smart, straight-ahead thinking. He is very practical and logical in his actions - he just doesn't have the clever one-liners.This film has a high opinion of the human spirit - higher than I do - and a keen sense of politics. It doesn't feel rushed, even though it clocks in at a brisk 116 minutes.I enjoyed Star Trek, This Is The End, and liked Man Of Steel, despite that film's problems.

"Generic zombie movie, with A-grade production and star","Generic zombie movie, with A-grade production and star.Zombie movies have always been a B-grade type of movie. The cheap production values fitted well with the apocalyptic horror of the genre. Add to this the fact that every zombie drama has pretty much the same main plot, and it's a recipe for easily making hundreds of movies which are fairly indistinguishable from each other.The only innovations in zombie movies have come in zombie-comedies, which are often parodies of zombie dramas. Zombieland and Shaun of the Dead are the best examples of these. Warm Bodies was probably the most original zombie movie since the first one, as it took a very different tact. Plus, it was half-comedy.Plot-wise, World War Z isn't anything new. Where WWZ is different is that it has A-grade production values and a mega-name star. Take those away and it could be just another zombie movie.This said, the special effects and other big-budget features do help. The scale of the movie is huge, and makes the production seem so real. Makes you think that what happens in WWZ could well happen in real life.Performance-wise, Brad Pitt does his usual action-hero plus caring- family-man routine, and does it well. His appearance must have used up almost the entire acting budget, as there are no other big names in the movie (unless you are a fan of The Thick of It: good to see Peter Capaldi land a Hollywood role). David Morse, Matthew Fox and Moritz Bleibtrau have minor roles.Reasonably entertaining, but nothing special.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"

Brad Pitt did a great job, I haven't seen him in a proper action movie in a while and it seems as though he still has the talent for it. I thought the supporting actors also did a great job. The special effects were terrific and zombies were extremely well done and believable, they are a lot more aggressive and much faster than the usual zombies, especially compared to the ""The Walking Dead"". I left the cinema with a big smile on my face and would definitely recommend this film!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Fairly okay two hours of entertainment,"As with most zombie movies the plot is rather contrived and unbelievable (even if you accept the existence of zombies) but if you want to watch zombie movies in the first place that is something that you are supposed to be immune to.This is another variant of zombies being created by some virus and rapidly taking over most of the planet. As I said, the entire story is somewhat unbelievable. When I first read about zombies as a kid there was always some supernatural/magic stuff involved. I think I liked that ""explanation"" much better than the virus nonsense which just have too many holes in it. For example there is no way a virus could make human bodies roam around aimlessly inside a sterile laboratory for days without nutrition. Well, as I said, it is a zombie movie so one just have to get over these little issues.As an action movie with zombies as the main adversary it is a fairly good movie. The action is solid, the special effects okay and the entire movie continues at a reasonably brisk pace. Pitt is also doing a decent job of his role. There are few of the other actors that are very memorable though. The scenes where the zombies pile onto each other to scale walls and even reach choppers are rather cool. The movie is not very gory for being a zombie movie. Whether that is a good thing or not depends on the viewer I guess. Personally I do not mind some gory stuff in zombie movies.There are a few annoying parts which Hollywood always seem to have to throw in. For example, the world is on the brink of the apocalypse and Lane and his wife just doesn't want to get involved. What the f? Also why do people always let their kids wander away in situations where they really should keep track of them? Not to mention how clumsy people always get when they have to sneak around and be silent. These things are just annoying.Anyway, this movie fulfils its purpose as two hours of action-filled but not too intelligent entertainment quite well.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Pure suspenseful entertaining that should not be misled by its trailer,"World War Z was in production hell for quite a bit, changing writers and choosing directors for several times, leaving a fear that this project could have had a tragic ending. However, World War Z ends up being a really satisfactory movie. The directing has glimpses of quality and Brad Pitt is very well as the United Nations employee that travels the world looking for a possible cure. The movie is very tense from the beginning until the end delivering with quality what it promises: pure suspenseful entertainment. What I feared the most about this flick was the use of CGI for the infected zombies. However is does not go any farther than what the (very bad and totally misleading) trailer shows. World War Z does not use any gore either, choosing closed settings to build up the tension, and exploring the world's reaction to this plague in very different countries, which is interesting. Character development is a weak point tough, compared to the likes of 28 Days Later or even Dawn of the Dead.

Very loosely based on the book, the storyline provided is well enough and I found myself sincerely caring for them all and routing for Pitt's character and bravery to protect his own.

It gave a vulnerable feel to the main characters and that you can't necessarily guarantee a getaway when their faster than a marathon runner. The ending and resolve left one with hope as it was intended in the story as a whole. I will definitely purchase it when it comes out.

On the other hand, the movie is rushing things, too fast, no chance for characters developments... You don't feel attached to them. Plot gap, if we can see, in many turning points of the movie..

"Fast, Furious, and Infected","This film is recommended.Things have certainly changed in our fast-paced world. Our need for speed has become insatiable. Never is it more apparent than in the zombie genre. The dead are no longer walking. Today's zombies have been redesigned for maximum efficiency. Danny Boyle's ground-breaking 2003 horror classic, 28 Days Later energized that genre, and so does this skillfully-made offering entitled World War Z, the latest apocalyptic cautionary tale in a long line of disaster-oriented movies this summer. (This year's primary theme has showcased the bleakest possible view of our future and paraded those films before us with very mixed results.)In WWZ, the scenario takes a global look at the zombie fever as we hopscotch to various locations (Philadelphia, Jerusalem, Korea, Wales). The virus cannot be contained and we are almost immediately classified in Code Red epidemic level. The film is Contagion revisited as a horror genre exercise in terror. Gone are the slow-moving brain munchers, monsters one could outwit and out-walk in the past. This newer model is fully equipped with a metaphysical souped-up V-6 engine and can travel at breakneck speed, literally speaking. These undead are the new fast and furious with a ""yum,yum eat 'em up"" attitude.Brad Pitt plays Gerry Lane, a United Nations investigator who is trying to find a cure to stop this pandemic. But first he must somehow manage to get his own family out of harm's way before confronting the problem head-on. Throughout the film, Gerry is put in action hero mode, having to be brave and resourceful as he faces off against the attacking hordes in an effort to discover the virus' origin and stop this epidemic. The reasons why Gerry is the world's only savior and foremost zombie exterminator remain unclear, but it is Brad Pitt after all. Who else can save the world when Tom Hanks isn't available?Meanwhile, the zombies swarm, multiply, and destroy what is left of human mankind, like crazed Walmart shoppers on a typical Black Friday rush (and just as terrifying). Director Marc Forster seems more concerned about CGI effects and creating horrific tension. He sets up one action sequence after the next to insure full audience interest and stages those set pieces quite effectively. (Particularly memorable are the siege at the fortress sequence and an in- flight zombie encounter that is edited for maximum tension and a scene involving ) The gore factor is surprisingly low by today's standards, which might disappoint some hard-core horror aficionados, but I applaud the filmmaker's restraint. WWZ is a fast moving and suspenseful diversion. Production values are all first-rate with special kudos to the sound effects editing team and Marco Beltrami's seamless musical score.However, the film spends hardly any time on character development or much narrative. Pitt carries off his role well, within the limits of the script that is more invested in pumping up the adrenaline rush than emphasizing the personal dramas and dilemmas of its characters. The talented Mirelle Enos as his wife, Karin, is not given enough screen time to help build more emotional impact as are many secondary characters who tend to be dispatched the moment they arrive on the scene. (Was that Matthew Fox who delivered one line of throwaway dialog or was my vision impaired?)But World War Z is essentially an action/horror movie that delivers much of its thrills and excitement due to Forster's vision as a director and the film's strong visual imagery. Seeing this film on the big screen will only enhance the movie-going experience. And if the world's gotta end, well, at least Brad Pitt is there for good company.

It sure kept me on the edge of my seat...,"...but boy, for a 2013 film, it really makes you think that, already then, they were planning and priming us to follow a certain narrative for a certain pandemic that would develop a few years later (wink, wink). It's so obvious, that it's laughable! And it's not the only film that has that aim, obviously. There are others and they all follow the same formula. In fact, for the past few years, all you have to do is look at the narratives of the Hollywood films being made to know what's gonna happen IRL a few years down the line.On a technical level, the medical/scientific make-believe is just ridiculous.

My first review and I had to make it,"This is my first review and I just needed to write one after seeing all the bad reviews about the movie.As you can see from my voting I truly think the movie deserves a lot more than given. I can say that I am not a person who have read the book/books and can judge from that aspect, however, you cannot change the fact that I went to watch the movie only to be grossed and entertained and ended up so, in a positive way if you could say.Some people hated the movie because it was not true to the books and missed a lot of good things. But people you should know by now that books are always better than the movies(a reader creates a world in his mind that no other person can imitate) you can never expect a producer to make scenes exactly as you wish. Nor can you find every thrilling scene(you loved) to be in the movie. This movie wanted and needed to be a blockbuster and the fact-that it became one but did not fit the normal sort of sci-fi fantasy far fetched movies-made it a favorite for me.The climax was different from expected and what is better than to be intrigued by the producers choice for an ending, this is what you will get from the movie - something to think about.What truly scares me that this time an apocalyptic movie seemed really doable and something that can happen to us any moment. The first thing I asked my friends after watching it was ""what kind of an illness will look the most plausible to a zombie Apocalypse"" and will even Jerusalem be safe from it, because I truly believe that Jeursalem is the third world Power and our next high commander, before forming a ""New World Order"" the ones on top will find an inexpensive way to get rid of half the population of the World, make an infestation and find a cure for the privileged ones- not us ofc, we are doomed :D",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Chix Cat on File review: Aggressive zombie infestation,"The trailer made World War Z look like the zombie population had gone extreme, with them developing the new talent of running. What an unfair advantage now in their favor considering the lumbering gait was the only thing that provided some level of protection for the human race. This year has been evolutionary for the zombie, since we now also know from Warm Bodies that there's even zombie love. There is some consistency in what has been the recent approach to zombification, it starts with some fatal contagion, not like the good old days when a vampire enslaves a human which keeps the numbers low, or a voodoo casting or the result of some improperly contained hazardous chemical, now everything is a virus run rampant. Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt) is a United Nations employee and is reactivated to track down the invading agent and try to figure out how to stop it. I don't know what UN employees do and after this film I still don't. There was a segment where Gerry is sent to accompany mankind's best hope for finding a cure and I'm not sure if he was supposed to be some level of protection but the situation just got direr rather than better. My favorite aspect about the story aside from Mr. Pitt of course is what puts the human race at its greatest disadvantage, the speed of the zombies. The special effects that allowed for them to climb atop each other and perform record breaking tackles added to the intensity. Although the movement and feel seemed very similar to the creations from I Am Legend, it was still rather chilling to watch as the human race was quickly being annihilated. My biggest complaint about the story is that I left the theater with no greater insight into what was the intrusive culprit than I had already gathered from the previously mentioned trailer that it's a contaminating virus with unknown origins and is aggressively spreading. I did not find this story particularly scary but it did pass my 3-D test, yes I flinched, actually a few times. I just kept thinking keep that guy Gerry away, because it just seemed that wherever he was the zombie infestation grew. That may not have been the reality since the problem was supposedly worldwide, but as good as Mr. Pitt looked as 'every man', he was bad luck for everybody except himself. I liked the film, but felt as if too much was given away in the trailer, therefore I give it an amber light.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Surprisingly very good,"After reading the reviews I anticipated watching this movie with a sense of dread. I was very pleasantly surprised. (unlike Prometheus where I very unpleasantly surprised!)

Maybe a tad fast but the movie was 2 hours. 3 hours would have made it epic. It could easily have been 3 hours long. The problem with these movies is they try and fit a lot into a short period of time. Inevitable corners are going to be cut to get to the punchline. The storyline was plausible. Bizarely the only character that didn't make much sense was Brad Pitt's. Not sure who or what the guy was supposed to be. All they had to do was make him some sort of hot shot military scientist or Doctor and voilà, everything would have fallen into place. That said if you just except the character and pretend he's a Doctor or something the movie is a very entertaining watch. If you have seen the trailer. You definitely have not seen the movie!

"Weak, rushed and silly.","In my opinion 28 days/weeks later is the best zombie film out there so I was expecting a mordernised version of it. I saw the trailer for World War Z and I was absolutely excited, but unfortunately I was left feeling very disappointed.First of all, the 'zombies' in this film were created by a virus which came out of nowhere. There is no story to how everything happened. It just did. And Gerry (Brad Pitt) is given the task to find out where it originated from for some reason. The film states that he's had experience in battle before so he knows his stuff but as of now he's abandoned that profession...so why do they need him when they have perfectly able marines and seals on hand?Additionally, World War Z continuously switches between the enemy being 'infected' or 'zombies' or 'undead'. They are not undead. Undead is where they were previously dead and have been reanimated. They're just zombies. The bite transmission kind. You don't actually see anyone get killed by an infected person.Also, this film was so evidently rushed. At one point Gerry is in South Korea, and then a moment later he's on a plane to Israel. The action scenes last five minutes each and the action involved is short lived and predictable. In fact, Gerry is hardly involved in the action scenes.If you're looking for a zombie film which will thrill you, this film is not what you are looking for. Action is weak, there is no gore, the story is pointless, all of the characters are pretty much expendable...it's amazing it can even be rated as a 15.World War Z. Z, being the sound produce by the audience.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
So and so...,"Oh Brad Pitt what were you thinking? A very large pay check is probably an obvious answer.As with all such films, the story suffered from the start. In all seriousness there is not much place to go if you base your film on Zombies who try to infect the rest of us. At the same time, I must admit that whilst expectations were low the film was made in a way that kept us engaged throughout and there were moment of very heightened tension.Despite this, unlike Contagion, it left me largely uninterested and hope Brad Pitt will resume making the good films he has accustomed us to.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
World War Z,"An ex United Nations Investigator is forced to help identify the origin of a virus that envelopes the world transforming the living in to Zombies. The fate of humanity hangs in the balance as he scours the planet trying to stay alive and keep his family safe.Director Marc Forster, the man behind Quantum of Solace, takes on the daunting task of transforming Max Brooks' novel on to the big screen and does so handsomely. Forster seamlessly ties in the grand locations and manic pace with the intensity of the film leaving the audience at the edge of their seat for the most part. In spite of having a good idea of the outcome, you still find yourself rooting for Pitt's character.Although the visuals is the real star of the film, Brad Pitt performs expectedly well while his wife, Mireille Enos from The Killing and Big Love fame, plays her role adequately.Although not an epic and a tad predictable, World War Z is definitely an entertaining blockbuster that ranks among one of the better Zombie films. This is undoubtedly one to watch and enjoy!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Perfectly Good Zombie Flick,"I am not a total Zombie fan, but enjoy some of the films and TV shows (Walking Dead). Went into this with average expectations and an open mind and was pleasantly surprised. I thought the zombies were thoroughly creepy and terrifying. Thought the action and storyline were fine. Some of the camera-work was confusing at times (in an effort to portray the insanity of the moment i suppose).With ""popcorn"" films like this I make a point of not thinking too deeply about plot holes or realism. Just enjoy the ride on the film's terms and you'll be fine. And I actually like the idea of a PG-13 Zombie flick rather than R rated. I don't care about the excessive gore that R rating allows. I can be scared just fine with the implied gore of PG-13, plus my son could come see it too. Win win.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Not The Best Of It's Genre But Acceptable,"World War Z, a zombie film with a big budget and has Brad Pitt as the leading man, it sounds excellent. Turns out it's only decent. I came into this film thinking it's a zombie film in a much more grand scale. Now that I've seen it, I now know that I came in expecting too much from it.This film was based off a novel of the same name, which I haven't read so I came into this blind in plot. The film's plot is quite straight forward and doesn't take a genius to understand the goal of Pitt's character but what made this film feel a little flat is the stakes. In a zombie or apocalypse film, usually there would be more than one guy that the film is following and with that focus, the characters then have a sense of weight to them if a soul is lost but in this film there isn't a lot of people to care about aside from Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt). I understand that this film shows a much bigger picture than intimate survival films like Dawn of the Dead but at least those films had characters that means more to us as an audience if they die. I see the tragedy and horror of the situation but these are people seen from a distance and they feel expendable. The film's ending may seem underwhelming but it makes sense as zombie films never truly have a defining conclusions, it usually ends with everyone dead or stuck somewhere hoping someone will save them. This film feels like the first step in fixing the issue and needs at least a second film to tie up the loose ends. The film though has it's strengths. I love that it still had it's suspenseful moments and that it didn't really focus on the killing for survival but rather the search for a cure in order to survive. Overall, the film's story feels like a mixture of Soderbergh's ""Contagion"" and Emmerich's ""2012"".Marc Forster has proved that he could make action with Quantum of Solace but so far his films with high amounts of action have been not so strong with it's core story and this film is another example but his work on the simpler dramas like Stranger Than Fiction and Finding Neverland seem to receive more positive responses. His efforts here is not horrible though, it's just not up there with his better films. I like the fact that the film has large moments, the attack on Israel, and frightening small moments, World Health Organisation in Wales. The film doesn't feel deep and with a film like this with such ambition, it would have benefited from it.The cinematography feels very generic and is an aspect of the film that won't be remembered. It does what it does, captures the image and creates some sort of tension, but I hoped for a film like this that it would be a little darker and moody.Beltrami's score was fantastic in films like The Hurt Locker and Resident Evil because they create this dark mood that supports the film. Surprisingly for a film that focuses on zombies, it feels more like a action film which at the same time is unsurprisingly as the moments with tension is very fast paced and exciting. The scenes at the WHO centre or the refueling of the plane was fantastic, the times where the film are at their most suspenseful and dark.I have no issues with the acting in this film, my issue is that the screenplay doesn't flesh out these characters enough that anybody besides Pitt could show off their acting range. Brad Pitt, as always is fantastic, but this type of film doesn't really try to challenge actors in showing their skills. The supporting cast were fine but wish was used a little more.Definitely won't be up there along with my favorite Zombie or Apocalyptic film of all time but it's good enough for me to watch again when it comes out on Blu-Ray or DVD just to pick up on things I may have not picked up in the story. I had fun though.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
A solid movie that holds up,"One of Brad Pitt's great performances in an extremely tense apocalyptic film. I saw this in theaters when it first came out nearly 10 years ago. I didn't remember too much of the film so decided to rewatch. A great movie night choice!The filming and atmosphere of ""WWZ"" are spectacular. Palms sweating, edge of your seat, eyes covered, the whole shebang. This movie brilliantly draws you in with the tension it's able to create.The story itself, especially in a world that has now experienced COVID/the year of 2020 feels very authentic. The panic, the questions with no answers, the international implications, etc., Etc.While not a perfect movie, it certainly held up. I enjoyed watching ""WWZ"" nearly a decade later.

Exceptional!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I was skeptical, as I don't typically like 'zombie' movies, but this was very well done. There's lot's of suspense, and Brad Pitt was great.What I also liked is that they made the movie without a lot of bloody gore, which I find amazing given the subject matter. There are a lot of scenes that could have been gory for sure, but the Director chose not to focus on that, for which he is to be commended. Instead, he stuck to the plot line and the end result is exceptional.No need to see it in 3D; stick with the 2D version and save a few bucks. Well worth the price of admission!

Pretty well made Zombie movie overall,"so I went to the drive in to see this movie , note I have never read the novels or anything like that. I just wanted to see what looked to be a great zombie movie, which in this case it wasn't spectacular but it was better than average. it overall had great acting, intense scenes, and scary pop out moments throughout the film. all though the lack of blood, and its PG-13 rating though stopped this movie from being great, and I don't want to put any spoilers out there but also it seems at some moments in the film there is numerous plot holes, and points in the script were they seem to rush things. other than that the film is good. I would say it has potential to get better, but still is a good movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Pretty good movie,"I don't really watch zombie movies because i can't really take blood gore but I saw this because it didn't contain any of that and I thought it was pretty good not the best but pretty good. The acting was excellent as always, the story was good enough to keep me in to it but I've never read the book and I don't know if the movie to it but from what some people say it's not. The action scenes were was above average scenes and the zombies look like regular zombies with less blood up-close but when they run around in those weird groups they look like ants or something but i liked that idea. For all of those people who didn't like it because it wasn't like the book you should know by now that movies that are based of books aren't really like the books most of the time so you shouldn't be surprised when a movies aren't like the book nowadays.

Well made movie that was missing a little something?,"This movie almost had it all for a zombie movie. Its like they took a zombie movie and tried to make it bigger and better. Sure it was a good movie with some high quality effects and acting. It was also not boring at all, nor was it the same old zombie thing.. However it was missing something I couldn't quite put my finger on. It was good and I really wanted to like it a lot, All the way to the end I wanted to like it but is was missing a zombie movie quality. Maybe because it didn't seem that scary? maybe because there were too many zombies that i was desensitized?Anyways I will watch it again on DVD or HBO to see what I think about it then. Even though it was a fast moving movie I found myself thinking about work, thinking about my kids or what to have for dinner. It didn't quite have that zombie movie grip on my mind where nothing could distract me til it was over.

Refreshing Zombie Movie,"In Philadelphia, the former UN Investigator Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt), his wife Karin (Mireille Enos) and their two daughters, Rachel and Constance, are trapped in the traffic jam. Out of the blue, they witness several car crashes caused by the attack of hordes of zombies. Gerry runs with his family and he steals and drives a RV, heading to Newark, New Jersey. Gerry calls his old friend, UN Secretary General Thierry Umutoni (Fana Mokoena), who promises to send a helicopter on the next morning to rescue Gerry and his family. Gerry stops at a supermarket to get supplies and medicine for his asthmatic daughter and the RV is stolen. They flee to an apartment building and a Latin family helps them, lodging the family in their apartment.On the next morning, Gerry invites the family to go with them to the roof, but they prefer to stay in their apartment. However they are attacked by zombies and the boy Tommy joins Gerry and his family in their runaway. The helicopter brings them to an aircraft carrier anchored offshore New York City and Gerry is assigned to travel to South Korea with the virologist Dr. Andrew Fassbach (Elyes Gabel)to seek out the patient zero to develop a vaccine. When the team arrives at the base, they are attacked by zombies and Fassbach panics and has a fatal accident. Gerry has a conversation with an insane ex-CIA agent (David Morse) that is imprisoned and he goes to Jerusalem to talk to the Director of Mossad Jurgen Warmbrunn (Ludi Boeken) to learn why he built a wall and transformed the city in a safe zone. When Jerusalem is attacked by a horde of zombies, Gerry observes that the zombies do not attack terminally ill persons. Now he travels with his escort Segen (Daniella Kertesz) to a research facility in Wales to disclose his findings to the scientists.""World War Z"" is a refreshing zombie movie, with a tense story full of action. I know that the movie is not faithful to the novel, but the plot is a combination of zombies and virus movies and entertains. The characters are likable and the special effects are top-notch. Matthew ""Jack Shepherd"" Fox is wasted with a minor role but in accordance with a research in internet, his character would have an important role in ""World War Z"", having an affair with Gerry's wife and taking care of his family during his journey seeking a cure to the epidemic. The dark ending, with Karin trading her body to survive, was changed by Paramount to a commercial (and probably better) conclusion. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Guerra Mundial Z"" (""World War Z"")Note: On 01 October 2023, I saw this film again.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"

apocalypse-zombie style,"I would call this movie in one sentence as ""apocalypse-zombie style"" and here is my review:STORY AND PLOT: This movie is a sci-fi thriller with apocalypse background and zombies as a main course. though the story line is simple the script is strong enough to make this movie a thumbs up in critics and audience.CAST AND PERFORMANCES: there is nothing much to discuss in this category as the casting has been kept to minimal and the whole story revolves around the character of Brad Pitt. the characters played by his wife children and his fellow colleagues are short lived but yet they did their job in their role. and what more to say about brad as he played his role in ease .TECHNICAL DEPARTMENTS: the first thing i want to speak in this category is the OST/BGM in this movie which i personally liked very much. The graphics though not very realistic can take your breath and especially eye feasting for thriller movie lovers.

A surprisingly racist bit of rubbish.,"The big scene, glimpsed in all the previews is a mass attempt to over top an Israeli wall. In the old American tradition of racist propaganda the zombies (yes zombies) behave like colonial insects reminding me of all the times I heard Americans compare the Chinese to ants. The countless zombies move like lightning to over top the wall where they spill down on the smiling happy Israelis below. Previously the Koreans were treated as zombies and murdered without pause or hesitation.One could argue that the Americans were suffering the same difficulty and that the epidemic depicted was on a world wide scale and that is, perhaps, a mitigating factor in the guilt of whoever devised this malodorous bit of slop.One suspects that had the Palestinians, crawling like souped up ants, been black and the smiling happy citizens on the other side of the wall white the movie would have had little or no audience. As it is I think you are ill advised to support this sort of movie making with your dollars.In general the film is just one long desperate chase, of a sort that I find tedious, but which I understand some people enjoy, so if you like a chase and you don't mind the portrait of the subhuman non Americans you might find it pleasant. I certainly didn't.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
World War Z: Movie Review,"World War Z is an interesting movie. It's smart at times and yet it makes the same cliché mistakes that many of zombie movies tend to make. In World War Z zombies no longer turn people into undead flesh eaters, but it's a virus like Swine flu or Sars, it moves from host to host infecting them. No one is safe but if it's a virus there must be a cure. Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt) is the U.N. investigator who is called in to find and root out the virus. Going around the world chasing leads from South Korea to Israel to find the potential cure.There were time in the movie that seem so foolish and an obvious set ups for zombie attacks that it took away some of the charm of the movie. Randomly phone ringing when making a dash for safety, zombies hiding in the closest, kicking the cans in an empty hallway, and random Arab girl leading a celebratory song in Israel on a loud speaker, when it has been established that zombies are attracted by loud noises.World War Z is an intense ride that picks up within the first 5 in of the movie and doesn't stop till the very end. There were slow points but they were necessary because they gave us some background story. The fast zombies worked in this movie, they were first introduced in 28 Days Later and this movie uses them appropriately.World War Z is yet another movie that shows how fragile the society is and how quickly people turn to anarchy and looting.When facing impending doom how will you react? Will you follow the rules or do whatever it takes to survive?I give World War Z 7 deadly zombie bites out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Satisfyingly good!,"I love Zombies, ranging from Romero to Resident Evil (the games not the films!) to the Walking Dead. The trailers for this and the marketing emphasising mass terror in all major cities got me quite excited.This movie will not blow you away, nor will it win any awards. That said, it isn't a bad movie and I left with a strong feeling of satisfaction. In a word, this movie is ""good"". It has moments of tenseness, but is never scary, which for a zombie movie is very disappointing. I guess that is due to the age rating, which allows it to be viewed by a larger audience rather than your average die-hard gore fiend.The special effects in some places (not often) is abundantly clear and looks hurried and this is never a good thing in a movie. Characters are good, though Brad Pitt's character has more than his share of luck. You do feel for them, but I personally think this is down to the actors than amazing characterisation.It would have been useful to have explored the devastation around the world in greater depth rather than just cities that are visited. The chaos caused to humanity is never fully explored and limited to dialogue.If you want a scare and gore, then this isn't the film for you. If however you want to see a good, entertaining movie, then this is a must.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
"Repetitively gripping, ferociously captivating the audience.","It's pretty hard to describe the this movie without spoiling it, but if you haven't been exposed to any content, simply walk to cinema and watch it uncontaminated. I have to give credit to the trailer for being subtle enough to not ruin the tension. World War Z is an apocalypse movie with plenty of seriousness, incredibly quick pace and neatly hidden scares lurking steadily. The fresh set pieces bring more substance than the usual thrill as they constantly move forward while keeping the audience invested in the journey. Brad Pitt delivers a great performance, the movie can't ask a better protagonist. He displays calmness and desperation with equally refined stature. The whole movie is about this man who keeps getting in life threatening situations without resorting to hulking up to usual action role. It's fascinating to see how he struggles for dear life, and those of others, as he goes through such extreme frays.There are some novel ideas that are inspired by wise internet proverbs ""If it looks stupid but it works, it ain't stupid"". These bits provide more natural survivability to the scene and prevent it from being too silly. Graphical gore and action are well executed, creating threats are seemingly more lively. Gripping sequences are thrown frequently without much delay between them. These captivate audience by steadfastly lurching the action in consistent occurrences.Effect of 3D is somewhat lacking, at least in my experience. Some might not work well, although the graphic prowess of the movie itself if certainly above average. The way it changes setting is remarkably done, providing sense of progress as it goes along. One minor complaint I have is the ending is a bit bland, it doesn't conclude or wrap the movie in any significant way. Seeing the scale of the crisis, it's understandable for not being resolved instantaneously, but it feels less interesting that the previous parts of the movie and a bit prelude for sequel.World War Z is a frantic fast-paced fervid ride, and it's even more so if you watch it without any prior knowledge of the movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Killin' it.,"About six weeks ago, I was invited to a fifteen-minute sneak peek of World War Z, an allegedly troubled project from the usually untouchable actor-producer, Brad Pitt, and underrated director Marc Forster (Monster's Ball, Stranger Than Fiction, Quantum of Solace). Given the buzz- or lack thereof- I was understandably tentative, but was quickly sucked in by the film's grand scale and penchant for genuine horror. Having seen the finished product, the matter is no longer up for debate; World War Z is unlike any film of its genre before it. Endlessly marketed as another snooze fest holiday blockbuster, it is actually a taut, engrossing thrill ride seasoned with merciless, edge-of-your-seat terror, the likes of which haven't graced the big screen for a long time.Pitt plays Gerry Lane, a former UN representative who gets called back into work courtesy of a virus that has rapidly turned most of the earth's population into a soulless, superhuman race of ravenous zombies. In his worldwide search for answers, Lane faces all comers head-on in an environment that would compel even the most reckless Marine to bail with a resounding 'Nope!' before word of the outbreak hits the evening news.Virtually every supporting character is useless, from Lane's inconvenient wife to his irritating children, but it doesn't even matter. Pitt carries the film with a grounded performance, crafting a rational, believable character that so deftly toes the line between the invincible action hero and the out-of-his-element everyman. Forster made the right decision injecting a main character instead of following the scattered journal entry format of Max Brooks' novel, giving the film the accessibility it needs to be successful without resembling a carbon copy of every blockbuster this side of the 3D revolution.And it is on that point that World War Z excels. Anyone expecting a fun but forgettable romp ablaze with heavy artillery and indiscriminate loss of life is likely to cop a pleasant shock.This is not to suggest that the film doesn't cater to the mass market. On the contrary, each set piece just gets progressively more ambitious, making a glowing spectacle of the film's $200 million budget, but it is the moments of deathly silence that are most effective and, ironically, most likely to turn the event into a holistic cinema experience; one in which you and 300 fellow viewers can uniformally share your inner cowardice amidst nervous laughter and clenched fists, jaws and many other parts of the human anatomy. Here is a film that has grabbed every potential setback by the scruff of the neck, thrown it across the room with the force of an undead army, and nonchalantly delivered a jaw-dropping masterclass in suspense for its troubles.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review. If you're looking for a writer for your movie website or other publication, I'd also love to hear from you.*",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Good action with strong performance but not much story,"The name is definitely a problem. I asked my partner if she wanted to watch World War Z with me and she said, ""No,"" because she was convinced that this was a war movie, owning to its name. Well, a war movie it is not, but It's not a conventional zombie horror movie either. Thankfully, World War Z is considerably better than its title.The premise is: Brad Pitt + worldwide zombie epidemic. Like in some twisted new travel show, we follow his character around the world, as he is trying to find a solution to the crisis. There is a repeating narrative pattern in which Brad Pitt goes to a location, things go tits up, cool apocalyptic stuff happens and then Brad Pitt escapes to a new location, where the cycle repeats itself.If you examine a single sequence, the narrative works, but when you consider the plot as a whole, there is not much happening. There isn't really a good reason for this dude to travel all over the world, but the plot is filled with conveniences and ludcrious science, in order to keep itself moving forward and keep Brad Pit moving to new places. It feels like the space-time continuum revolves around this character, in whichever way it suits his cause. It's like, any moment now, this guy might wake up and find himself in that dream machine from Total Recall that makes you have adventurous dreams, in which you are the hero, but in reality, he's just some construction worker with a beer gut.This awkward Brad Pit gravitational anomaly makes more sense when you look at the book on which this film is based. The book describes how the zombie problem is addressed in different parts of the world by different people. The film writers wanted to keep that international aspect of the book, but they also wanted to brute force Brad Pit into everything. Unfortunately, they did not find a smooth way of doing that.On the bright side, the events are unpredictable. The film will just take a left turn out of nowhere and this keeps the narrative fresh.World War Z is all about the spectacle in each new location. The action is well dispersed, and when it kicks in, it is intense. The cinematography is punchy and contains enough variety, from chaotic close-ups of people wrestling with zombies to those fancy overhead flying shots of the zombie horde flowing like water. All the set pieces are impressive and memorable. There is an epic feel to everything, thanks to the scale of the action and the globetrotting.There are many recognizable names in the supporting cast, and the performances are good all-around. It's a shame the contributions are short, as Brad Pit has to leave those people behind to go somewhere else. Of course, if you got yourself a Brad Pit, then you might as well use him, but it is a shame that none of the other people stick around for long enough to make us remember them. There is a somewhat memorable Israeli woman that serves as the main character's companion for a while, but that is about it.Despite minor problems with the plot, World War Z is still a spectacular thriller and is worth seeing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"

"An horribly made movie, trust the bad or mediocre reviews.","Where do I start? The film was just horrible, the story was awful, the casting was awful, the shooting was awful, and the special effect was mediocre.First, let us talk about Brad Pitt. I loved Fight Club, watched Troy, and Mr. & Mrs. Smith. I had not, saw him acted so badly like in this film before. There were too many scenes that he should be looking at the other directions rather then glimpse over to the camera or stare at it. Poor performance.Second, what's up with the vending machine in the end? How much did a drink company paid for the film to add the obvious subliminal message of ""drink this s*** and your life will be good?"" I thought I was watching a TV commercial from Asia rather than a zombie movie!The plot was horrible. The protagonist fly from one place to the other like......an investigator.. which was his job description in the UN. But this is what actually went wrong with the movie. It is suppose to be a zombie movie, not a poorly written Sherlock Holmes, where every trance of hint was too obvious to discover.Further, the supporting character has no story of their own. What makes a movie or a book great was that there were many minor stories hidden within a big story and somehow they were all related. We saw this in Max Brook's book World War Z, but not in the movie itself.About the book... all I can say the book was a zombie classic, while the movie was a disgraceful disaster. It has nothing resembling to the book. If a person read the book, there are already pictures, images, and stories that filled up a person's mind. At least several movies could be made out of the book with each of them focused on few related person's story and their view point regarding the World War Z. The Japanese, the Eastern Europeans, the America soldiers, the Chinese doctors, the battle of Yonkers... etc. But the film didn't do it, they have to be creative to a way that made the film tasteless and cheesy.I mentioned previously that the special effect were mediocre. As I reflect more about the special effect, I decided to change my mind. The special effect was horrible. Good special effect integrated into the scenes that makes you feel inside the movie without noticing the special effect was at work. For World War Z, you can tell specific effect from beginning to end. Dead people became zombie and sudden gained a extreme stamina boost that made them jump and tackle people like professional athletes, absolutely ridiculous. Even worst, you can see special effect cut in right the way during the tackling. Horrible, horrible special effect.The supporting actors also acted poorly. Most actors who played zombies were merely acting, and the end of a joke. The zombies in the lab were performed by actors who simply acts without getting into the roles.The actors who played the soldiers, the wife, the scientists... also acted poor. From the beginning to the end you just can't help to notice that they are ""acting"", which is the poorest performance done any actor. When an audience can tell that you are acting and not drawn into the story, then you have failed as an actor.The movie itself was a horror movie, watching a zombie classic by Max Brook turned into a joke surely horrified many zombie fans. The movie itself was not worthy to get your movie money.

Great new concept for Z.....still a great opportunity missed,"watched WORLD WAR Z ...its trailers were so awesome that I couldn't wait the for the movie & thus read the book this film supposed to be based on BUT fellas except for its name & few(few) other things its nothing like the books in a slightest...NOW the movie..it has a new concept for Z they are fast,furious,organised n fast & its good we have seen numerous amount of Z flicks so we also needed a change...BUT film hasn't exploited that idea cause all the OMG scenes are already shown in the trailers n the movie just fills in the story between them...this film has everything the cast, the set-up, locations, VFX, pumping background scores..everything was great but its plot that they failed to copy from a book! ..its climax was so lame it gave me AIDS...the book was huge very vast but in the film they ruined it, its unforgivableI say _WORTH A WATCH_ just for that new concept",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Good Not Great,"I watched the HD unrated version on demand last night. First, the only relation this movie has to Max Brook's book is the title. Second, the first 30 minutes were fantastic and had me on the edge of my seat - maybe because I am a father with two girls about the same age as the characters in the film. Lastly, after the first 45 minutes or so the storyline devolved into the typical Zombies want to eat humans and humans are trying to stop them apocalypse film. Having said that, if you liked 28 Days Later and Dawn of the Dead (2004) this movie is definitely worth renting; it is full of solid action, a different kind of zombie (if you're a Romero purist, this ain't your genre) and interesting ideas about defeating the zombie plague.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
World War P.C.,"The basic plot of this sci-fier is pretty good. A rabies-like pathogen is rapidly spreading and zombifying folks over the greater girth of the globe. For viewers who dote on CGI, there are scenes where scads of the afflicted swarm at lightning speed. For those in the audience who prefer killer suspense, there is a slow, scary struggle through the halls of a zombie-infested laboratory. One scene--the flick's creepiest--has Brad Pitt and one of the litchy-looking creatures separated by a mere glass partition. As the two silently size each other up, the monster grotesquely glares and gnashes his teeth. Despite all the snapping and snarling, however, the film has a dearth of blood and gore--which probably disappoints many fans of the zombie genre. The movie seems much more concerned with political messages and, sadly, not the sort traditionally seen in science fiction. There is no hint that the dread disease is related to the recklessness or poor choices of mankind, no clue that science has somehow gone mad and birthed a world- destroying monstrosity. The message of this movie is non-subtle and non-stop, and it's the same one that infects almost all modern, English- language cinema. And this offering is so full of it that a viewer might find himself counting incidents of political correctness rather than attacks by the creatures. The film's creators couldn't change the fact that ticket-selling Brad Pitt is a white male, so they made him a pancake-cooking Mr. Mom in an otherwise female household. His neighbors are a Hispanic couple who don't speak English, his old boss an African, his new helpmate a macho Israeli woman. When the latter's countrymen erect a wall to forestall the zombies, they just climb over it. (Of course, like the Mexican border, it's unguarded!) And, naturally, Pitt's humanity-saving mission doesn't land at world-class Ben Gurion Airport, but at Arafat Airport--which is, in reality, a bombed-out, non- functioning ruin. Fortunately, this film has just enough action and suspense to avoid the same fate.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"

My least favorite zombie movie so far...,"Geez, what a disappointment. Not the best idea to watch ""Braindead"" and then ""World War Z"" the same day. That will say, first the BEST zombie movie ever, then a... not so great one. Unfortunately, the movie is rated PG-13, which means that the violence is extremely toned down (you'd in fact be surprised at how little you can get away with), but ironically, that's still not the biggest issue. I thought at first that it was still KINDA bloody for being PG-13, not ""Woah"" exactly, but sort of ""Huh, I didn't know they could do that"". I realized suddenly I was watching the unrated version. WHAT?? Lame! Is MPAA sensitive or are they sensitive? Anyway, thought I might count down why this movie didn't quite fit in with my tastes: 1. I thought it would be a quirky little dark comedy considering the book it was based on. Guess I was wrong. I didn't even smile except at the scene where the zombies root for the Pepsi-cans, but that was UNINTENTIONAL comedy. 2. The characters are surprisingly forgettable. Sure, in some zombie-movies there may be stereotypes, but they are often likable enough that you can look past that. In this movie, everyone except for maybe Gerry Lane had little to NO personality. 3. The score is unoriginal and not notable. Not the biggest grip I have though, some movies are excellent even with very forgettable music. 4. Brad Pitt is normally excellent, but for some reason, I felt that he didn't use his capabilities to the fullest here. Watch Fight Club and then this movie. You will notice a HUGE difference in acting-enthusiasm. Most of the time he just stares into the air blankly. 4. Zombie-movies are often full of witty and funny dialogue. Here? Nope. 5. The make-up is terrible. It's hard to believe these are actually zombies. 6. The first half in general didn't seem to have much going for it. The second half was better, though not by a long mile. 7. The ending. There are ALL reasons to hate it.So in short, it's not a complete waste of time, but also not a complete spend of time. Wait, what the hell? That phrase didn't make any sense. Watch ""Shaun Of The Dead"", ""28 Days Later"" and ""Braindead"" instead. Those are REAL zombie movies. Heck, even ""Warm Bodies"" is a zombie-movie, just of a different kind!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Great thriller.,"This is a great thriller, filled with impressive visual effects and intense suspense. The set design of this film felt grandeur and spectacular, which I felt was great but it inhibited some much needed emotional human moments. Something this film had plenty of were jump scares, which can only be seen as effective in a zombie movie. I did like the realistic tone that was present throughout, making me believe that a zombie outbreak could really happen. Unlike I Am Legend, I thought the way World War Z solved this global catastrophe was believable and eye- opening. Of course the star of World War Z is Brad Pitt, and he does a great job in my opinion portraying the character. My real problem is with the actual character itself. It seems as if this guy is invincible and can overcome any obstacle that comes in his way. I didn't read the book so I'm not sure if that's how the character is written, but it did draw me out of the movie at times. The ending felt very rushed which did affect my grade of the movie; however this is a solid film with more style than substance.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Truly an experience.,"It's a very mediocre movie, and the production of it sounds like complete misery.But unlike most movies that enter horrible production problems, this movie is pretty coherent. Yeah, it doesn't follow the book, but it's still really fun.The early 2010s were quite the years for zombies. And this movie doesn't do much to add on to that genre, but the ending is actually pretty clever.I'm glad they didn't have that final act in Russia where it shows Brad Pitt killing a bunch of zombies with a gauntlet. That completely contradicts his everyman sort of character.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Terrifying and epic scale pandemic horror!,"Out of all the post-Resodent Evil zombie films (including The Walking Dead, even though it's a TV show), I think my favorite is this one. Sure, it's nothing like Max Brooks' novel but that book would have been unfilmable. Instead this movie is intelligent and action packed and is also a kind of mystery too. It's violent but it is not gory and to me that's refreshing as seeing zombies rip out guys and eat them gets boring. Forster directs the hell out of this too, and it never stops moving. Love it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Great Movie!!,"In my opinion, probably one of the best zombie movie yet. A close second would be 'Dawn of the Dead' (where they're all stuck in a mall).

Another Zombie flick,"Wondering why I gave a 7 out of 10? Well, by not bringing anything really innovative into the plot doesn't mean that it deserves a bad review.Again, the concept its not new, you might find something fresh in the aggressiveness of the infected, demonstrating a new kind of horror to the zombie genre, but then again, its always the same.The main effort in this movie are not in the characters (except for Brad Pitt), neither the plot, the horror, soundtrack etc... what really comes out shinning in this movie are the zombies, here you get the real feeling of the threat, the contamination is fast as the madness and blood lust on the infected, that makes you realize that you wouldn't survive with a samurai sword in the same event.Anyway, if you are in for a zombie apocalypse worldwide movie, then this is it, nevertheless you shouldn't go in with big expectations.Enjoy :)",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Like watching Brad Pitt play a video game he's really good at from his lounge,"Visually there are some good scenes in this movie but the story is set up like video game levels and then most of those scenes play like a video game. The town escape, the W.H.O run, the airplane battle, Jerusalem. There are many elements to them that are cool but Pitt sails through them like he's already played the game before, no real engagement, he runs blankly from one vantage point to the next (via controller, left left, nudge pause), picking off targets (fire fire fire). He hardly breaks a sweat. The revelation points couldn't have been any more signposted if they'd circled them with highlighter pen for us. So really a video game with cheat sheet codes. Add to that the complete rewrite of the last 3rd of the story, it kind of leaves you wondering if the makers really had anything to say when they started the project.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
The bar has been raised in the character department,"World War Z has the direct makeup of a summer blockbuster; a premise that is appealing to a large percentage of the public, enough action to fulfill another percentage's demands, enough background knowledge towards the final act, and a universally recognizable stare at its center. On that note, the film is a success because it features a lot of things that will appeal to a great deal of people. However, examining it from a smaller viewpoint, one that analyzes character-investment, development, and layout, one will see a cluttered film that goes on for a long time but never seems to make much progress.Even though I have not read the book, I can't help but feel that the film does something of a disservice to it. If I had not read the novel a film is based on, I try and research the contents and the impact it has garnered in order to provide something of a relatability point. The novel appeared to have contained a wide-variety of characters impacted by a zombie apocalypse, a series of instances that bring up commentary points for contemporary America, and provided readers with a plausible ""what-if"" story about a zombie apocalypse.My immediate question upon viewing World War Z; where was this in the film? Where was the broad focus, the multiple characters, and the points about social and political life as we know it? Even if I'm misinformed about the novel, Brad Pitt's Gerry Lane character and story are still very thin and underdeveloped. If the film has incorporated all of the above, or even half of it, it could've possibly raised the standard for summer blockbusters into shockingly subversive territory. Instead, it sells its material and cast short, and the deeper the analysis, the clearer the evidence; World War Z is basic entertainment with a gargantuan budget, which is rumored to be over $500 million with advertising expenses.The story revolves around former UN employee Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt), his wife Karin (Mireille Enos), and their two daughters as they try to survive a zombie outbreak that occurs right when they are sitting in New York traffic. When all hell immediately breaks loose, they hide out in a small apartment, where Gerry learns he must go assist Dr. Andrew Fassbach (Elyes Gabel), a virologist looking to find the source of the outbreak. Once an origin, production on a vaccination can be mass-produced and quickly-delivered before the entire country is nothing but a wasteland inhabited by the walking dead.The first act of the film assumes traditional action and disaster movie-style, which is to portray a cacophony of catastrophic events occurring all at once in an overpopulated cityscape. At the middle of this chaos is, as stated, Lane's family, who survives numerous instances of peril akin to how John Cusack's family survived numerous close calls in Roland Emmerich's 2012. However, as these close calls aren't what World War Z rests on, thankfully adhering to a more cause-and-effect relationship with the way this outbreak began.This relationship takes up about the last hour of the film, and as a result, drags a bit because character-investment has been traded for meticulous and plodding plot-development towards the outbreak. With that being said, World War Z makes for efficient summer entertainment, but if one is seeking a zombie picture with a human focus, selective gore, and true vibes of uniqueness, the undiscovered gem The Battery lies on all video-on-demand services waiting to be viewed.Starring: Brad Pitt, Mireielle Enos, and Elyes Gabel. Directed by: Marc Forster.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
"Finally, a zombie movie showing the outbreak, not just the aftermath","For many years I've been waiting for a zombie movie showing the outbreak on a global scale. This is what ""World War Z"" does, and it deserves more appreciation for that. Instead, critics moan that it was like ""28 Days Later"" with more budget, missing the obvious difference between those movies even though the titles say it all. For once, here is a zombie movie which gives an idea of the world wide consequences of the disease and which does not play in a post-apocalyptic setting but shows the outbreak right from the beginning. I also could not care less whether the movie was true to the novel. Nor did I miss gore. There is plenty of gory schlock out there, watch that if you need gore so much. What I didn't like though was the science. This movie had the potential to give you the feeling that this could actually happen, but the science was just too awkward for that. Still, I found the movie very entertaining, and it has a couple of very memorable scenes.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Good one time watch with remarkable visualization. Appeals to a wider audience however a flailing attempt at showing the audience a new perspective on zombies.,"I had high hopes from the movie, the trailers along with the lure of Brad Pitt being in the lead were highly stimulating. It was a good one time watch although barely escaped marginalizing the zombie genre with a good dose of de ja vu moments. And it fared better because of some superbly contemplated shots and action sequences with masterly special effects. It can appeal to a wider audience because of abated violence and intense visuals.Brad Pitt monopolized screen time for obvious reasons and practically stole credit for nearly every major turn of events; I sympathize with the director for having to balance the star's ego and contribution of the other cast members.At the risk of drawing parallels with previous productions having similar themes, which to be honest is inevitable, I would place the 28 days/weeks duo far ahead of WWZ. Without the star power the two movies were able to create the sense of true despair and a very eerie and uneasy sense of reality that pushes you into an adrenaline high enough to kick start your survival instincts while keeping the thrills in tact.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Surprisingly Awesome,"With Brad Pitt it is a hit or miss performance. Examples are Mr. and Mrs. Smith, a strike out to end the game while Fight Club is a grand slam. Then he did a movie like Troy which is more like an intentional walk. He was boring and almost unnecessary but still useful. With World War Z out I gave it a fighting chance it's easily an RBI double. You know I should have said Moneyball with all with all the baseball references but I haven't seen it but I assume he did well. World War Z is a zombie movie loosely based on the book and with all the zombie stuff that came out in the past few years with The Walking Dead and all the videogames about zombies I feared this movie would be too little too late.I had high hopes for this movie and I was not disappointed. The movie starts with a bit of a far-fetched action sequence but it kicked off the movie in strong fashion. We saw a little bit of his normal family life and everything seemed really good. We get a hint at an old job Pitt had but he left to be with his family. I personally liked his family. I was afraid once he left them they would not really be seen again but every now and then the audience is reminded of their existence and that is important. His family is why he fights and it is his drive for everything he does in the movie.With the way the movie kicked off I was a bit worried. In terms of action it was awesome and set a great pace but in terms of story it lacked, badly. The zombie outbreak just happened. No idea how or why. It was sudden and it came out of nowhere. One second the family is in traffic and the next there is an explosion and a huge truck plowing away traffic like snow. I was sitting in my theater giving myself a reality check seeing as that truck would never get thru those cars so easily but I let it go. The movie then took a turn and dug deep into the story. It turns out Pitt used to work for the UN and he is set out on a quest to find the origin of the virus and the leverage to actually do it is his family. I also loved the little Spanish kid they take in while they are in Newark, kid is a beast.Brad Pitt gives another stellar performance and so did the actress who played the little girl in The Dark Knight Rises, it's the little girl with the shaved head we all thought was a bay, yeah her, she was a good fit. In terms of acting Brad Pitt was the only one that mattered. By that I mean nobody else got enough screen time to get connected to. Anthony Hopkins plays a criminal in a South Korean prison and his character was awesome. The conversation between him and Pitt was my favorite scene is the entire movie. I wish it was possible to see more of his character and many others but to push the story along they had their fifteen minutes of fame, literally, and moved on.In terms of suspense this movie was grade A. The scene where the zombies are climbing up the wall by using a giant pig pile was brilliant. That whole scene was a giant mound of awesomeness I didn't want to end. The zombies themselves looked amazing and real. When I say real I mean if zombies were a real thing they would look like these zombies. The way they run in packs and swarm cities is terrifying and awesome to watch. The transformation from normal person to a hungry zombie was creepy and hard to watch. The action scenes were great, especially the scene on the plane. I saw it in the trailers and I was afraid it would be awful but it was awesome.Other than explosive and physical action there was a sense of suspense in sneaking around. Pitt finds himself in a hospital because he thinks has found a way to become immune to the virus. He and two other people are sneaking around and its gets intense. The crawling and sneaking is like something from a video game and it was fun to watch. It wasn't a short thing either, it took a long time for the scene to finish and it was highly entertaining.Overall, I thought World War Z was going to be a disgrace of a film but I walked out enjoying it very much. I heard this was the beginning of a trilogy which I am now OK with. With the way it ended I left with a feeling of wanting more. Brad Pitt did way better than I thought he would have and when it comes out on blu ray I will buy it. For now, World War Z gets the WillyT Honorable mention. It is a very good movie for the summer and is one that you should go see and enjoy as much as I did.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
"A Competent, if Mostly Forgettable, Zombie-Squasher","Strip away the title and any associations with the source material and this is a mildly above-average action/horror hybrid. It's nailed the gritty, vivid tone I expect of a dawning modern zombie apocalypse - the panic, confusion and outright helplessness of civilian life at ground zero - but does gradually get carried away in terms of scope. Brad Pitt as not just humanity's last great scientific hope, but also its vigilant watchdog and bombastic action hero, is something of a reach and smells like several characters were mashed together for the sake of simplicity. In a few instances, World War Z tests the waters of political and social reactions, enduring themes of the novel, but these are contrived token efforts at best and certainly not the film's forte. It's generally content to simply flush the screen with crumbling cityscapes and spitting, sprinting, screaming infected hordes, both of which perform quite well. At moments it's intense, shocking and borderline iconic, but storyline depth is an Achilles' heel, and most of the third act plays out like a bland, predictable obligation.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Now you know how to be prepared for Zombie Apocalypse,"Good film, good cast, good narrative.

Almost relentlessly entertaining,"They use to stumble around aimlessly, flailing rotting limbs at you pathetically as you casually jogged by, or swung a baseball bat at their heads. But no more. Yes, it seems that in the 45 years of existence that zombies have had on the big screen, they've evolved from shuffling corpses to monsters who pose a real threat. Danny Boyle taught them how to run, and made them more of a virus that we can recognise than cadavers craving brains. So now, zombies have gone global. Not just in popularity, although in that regard they certainly have with the help of AMC's The Walking Dead (amongst others), but they have swept across the globe. And only Brad Pitt can save us.After about three years in development hell, where there were more script re-writes and cast and crew shuffling about than you could keep up with, World War Z is finally here. Based on Max Brooks' multi-layered and heavily satirical novel that is told from the points of view of many different characters that reside throughout the globe, World War Z was always going to be a hard sell. Zombies are all the rage so naturally Hollywood wants to get their fat fingers on their piece of the pie, meaning World War Z was going to be a blockbuster. So, is it the giant pile of rotting brains that most fans were expecting, proving incoherent due to the many changes made throughout production? Surprisingly, no, and in fact it proves to be almost relentlessly entertaining.After an array of obligatory news-reel footage foreshadowing the upcoming apocalypse, Gerry Lane (Pitt), a former UN employee, with his wife Karin (Mireille Enos) and two daughters are stuck in Philadelphia traffic when the zombie attacks explode on the streets. They are saved when a helicopter ordered by an old friend of Gerry's, Deputy Secretary- General Umutoni (Fana Mokoena), flies them to a U.S. Navy vessel in the Atlantic. Gerry is then persuaded to search for the source of the cure when it is made clear that he and his family will be booted off the vessel if he refuses. His journey will span the globe from South Korea to Jerusalem to, most oddly, Wales.It's a flimsy plot to say the least. Most zombie computer games have more depth in the story, so we simply follow Gerry as he trots the globe. But where the film fails in story and character development, it makes up for in some outstanding action scenes. We are no longer in one man versus a horde of zombies mode, this is on a global scale, and when they attack, they attack in a ferocious swarm, piling on top of each other to reach massive heights and when they engage, they fling everything they can at their victim. Director Marc Forster, who proved himself inept at action in the Bond dud Quantum of Solace (2008), redeems himself somewhat with some fine set-pieces. The attack in Israel shows off some stunning CGI, but makes sure Gerry doesn't get lost in the mayhem.Another overwhelming positive is the performance of Brad Pitt, who proves that he can carry a franchise-seeking blockbuster with ease. Even at 50, well past the age you would expect of an action star, he injects his criminally unrecognised acting talents into what is ultimately a thinly-written role, and again shows that there is more to him that simply being really really ridiculously good-looking (to quote Derek Zoolander). The supporting cast either don't get a look in or don't last long enough to make an impact, so Enos, James Badge Dale, Elyes Gabel and Matthew Fox barely register. Fox especially, after having his entire sub-plot cut down to the point that I didn't realise he was in it until the credits rolled.The ending, which was re-wrote by Drew Goddard, reeks of indecision. The original ending, that saw a huge zombie battle in Moscow's Red Square, was canned, probably due to the political undertones of the setting, and the new, more low-key ending, was introduced to give the movie a more satisfying and coherent climax. While by no means a bad ending, for the film to start out global only to shrink to a sneaky one-on-one final note, it's somewhat of an anti-climax. It adds actors Peter Capaldi and Moritz Bleibtreu and offers some hope with a potential cure, but it just feels like everyone on board had no hope for the film. Given World War Z's commercial success, a sequel has now been greenlit (Pitt saw this as a first of a trilogy), so ultimately, the film did what it came to do. The many relatively minor quibbles aside, this is a success. But a film can surely only survive one troubled production shoot, so the people involved with the sequel will need to clear their heads and step up their game.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"

"Not quite your typical zombie flick, but not quite anything else.","There are a few reasons why this isn't your typical zombie-movie fare, with the foremost being that it came in that period when the genre was already over-saturated even with spin-offs and 'clever twists' and various other gut-guzzling variants that all essentially share the same essential features. As such, 'World War Z (2013)' tries it's best to stand-out but inadvertently blends in with those aforementioned titles. It's getting to a point now where you either have to be really creative but in the process make a piece that isn't really a 'zombie' flick, or just go back to the old Romero way of doing things in order to make something seen as 'original' - although the latter hasn't really happened yet in a big way. This particular picture also falls into the pitfall of having eyes too big for its budget, as its shaky special effects often soften the impact of some of the more grandiose - and frankly silly - fast-running walking-dead set-pieces which usually lean on the crowd-clambering conceit the picture tends to use almost like a crutch. It's telling, though, that the successful third-act is a much slower one that values suspense over splendour and that the more ostentatious moments pierce the overly serious tone to provide the most enjoyable memories. 7/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
"Improves on a rewatch, entertaining zombie-romp","I first watched WWZ back in 2013, tho' I was fatigued as it was the final film of a 4-movie marathon with three poor Blockbusters before that: Star Trek: Into Darkness, The Hobbit & Pacific Rim. WWZ was still comfortably the best of this group but I was so put off by modern Hollywood-spectacle I gave up on it for a few years.Nowadays I've learnt to avoid most of the modern stinkers, or quickly skip through them if they're clearly pants. 10 years later decided to give WWZ a rewatch and it was very entertaining! Jumping from a 6/10 to an 8/10. It has quite absurd OTT zombie-action, with excellent CGI to make it all seem relatively plausible (their behaviour recalls swarms of parasite-infested ants). Brad Pitt is an engaging lead. The little bits of 'science' are welcome, even if this movie is more of a 'turn-brain-off-and-enjoy-the-ride' type.The camera is a little too shaky at times, tho' it does suit the action. And the movie is lacking something more substantial or deep about it to earn above an 8/10. Yet if all you want is a fast-paced thrilling action-zombie rollercoaster, then WWZ is one of the best.The King of zombie films remain the immensely immersive and visceral REC 1 & 2 (not 3 & 4!).

As you can tell by the trailer it is up to Brad Pitt's character to try and find a way to stop the zombies. This guy seemed to have the worst luck in the world, or maybe it was the best?

There was never a dull moment in the entire film, and you will find your heart rate beating uncontrollably in anticipation throughout most of the movie. I could not have wished for a more amazing film. World War Z more than tripled my expectations with both out-of-this-world excitement and a clever plot. Brad Pitt plays his role of the star character Gerry Lane perfectly and gives the audience of the film a hero to route for. I promise that if you go and see this film you will not be able to take your eyes of screen, and you will come out with much better lung capacity after tightly holding your breath for almost two hours.

Can Max Brooks resell the film rights given the book went unused,"Imagine Max Brooks, who wrote the book by the same name and which was the supposed source material for this big budget popcorn film, sitting down at the premiere and wondering if he wandered into the wrong screening. Some film adaptations stray from the book, this one used nothing more than the title. However, out of sheer financial power, the resulting film comes across as a fast-paced, slickly produced action-adventure movie. The badly-coiffed (was he growing out his hair for a future role while filming) plays generic good-guy: smart, paternal, intrepid and, as always, good-looking. His globe-trotting would have exhausted James Bond as he searches for a way to quell a zombie (and is there a more stupid concept?) outbreak. Violating George Romero's prime directive, director Marc Forster's zombies in this particular outbreak run and are pretty scary when provoked. However, when not in attack mode the actors forced to play them look distractedly unsure what they are supposed to be doing - some stand still while others bang their heads against parts of the set and others nash their teeth in what is supposed to be intimidating but is mostly just dopey. Maybe give them some clearer direction Marc? Speaking of zombie rules, apparently helicopters don't count as noise as we see in Fort Israel but singing (and everything else) does (if a zombie crashes into something does that send all the others running?) Of course, you can complain ad nauseam about the plot and logic but you have to give it up for the expensive looking and engaging set pieces most of them involving plans or helicopters. Although the movie decidedly decelerates and loses its big bucks sheen in the final act, the non-stop, edge-to-edge excitement entertains up to that point. In short, the cliché' is to impress people by saying the book was better, if anyone tells you that here you know they didn't read it given the film bears not even a passing resemblance.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
"Good film, the book is better","I had high hopes for this film when it was released. The book is amazing and even better on audible. Like most book adaptations, they have taken some major parts from the book which makes the movie, however, if they had made this like book I feel the film would have been much more of a success. It feels rushed and just goes with the motions. That said it is a great movie! Great acting and great premis. A sequel would amazing, focus more on the aftermath, just like the book and treat it like a documentary style. If you like your zombie movies, it's definately one for the list to watch. Read the book first.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
"Watchable, but ultimately disappointing.","Watchable zombie blockbuster with decent special effects, some effectively tense moments, and a solid central performance from Brad Pitt. However, it's a letdown with a strange mixture of apocalyptic/zombie material, an episodic storyline in constant motion (sometimes just to keep moving), and an emotionally blank script tagged with a PG-13 rating for the masses. The movie frequently substitutes impressive CGI shots of zombie swarms for storytelling. The rushed ending feels cheap, and fans of Brooks' source material are going to wonder what happened. Too often it feels like empty chaos in an over elaborate disaster movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Surprisingly Entertaining!,"World War Z is a movie based on Max Brooks book by the same name and the similarities ends there. Having read halfway through the book, the movie is nothing like its book counterpart. For long World War Z was said to be in production hell having issues with directors and budget and naturally I was skeptical about it. Brad Pitt was announced to be the lead but it never came off as a consolation. Marc Forster as a director made it worse for me to accept it. No offence but Quantum Of Solace wasn't a gem of a James Bond movie. I was genuinely concerned as I was a zombie genre fan first and foremost, and wanted it to work out well.I was surprised when I read on IGN that World War Z was not a complete let down. Believe me I had not kept my hopes high for this one so a news like this did revive my hopes for the same.World War Z starts off with Brad Pitt's character Gerry Lane, a former UN personnel stuck in traffic with his family. And without a moment to spare, all hell breaks loose from there. Gerry and his family is put in the midst of the zombie outbreak and along with it, so are you. The first hour or so Gerry is hellbent on taking his family to safety and with his contacts at the UN he does accomplish it but in return he is sent to investigate the source of this zombie outbreak and he goes off on his mission moving from location to another in search of a possible cure.We, as an audience, are just dropped into midst of the ruckus in like 10 minutes. There wasn't much time for character development. Of course horror movies never demand character development but this is not your usual horror flick where characters are used as cannon fodder. In, World War Z, the only character you end up caring about is Gerry and thats about it. Although he has his heart with his family tucked away far from the zombie outbreak, you just don't feel the same. World War Z works out very much like a disaster movie. Think 2012, think The Day After Tomorrow. WWZ plays out exactly so, where instead of natural calamities you have a zombie apocalypse to deal with. It wasn't the zombies thats of interest here, it was the setting which was direly grim. It reminded me a lot of Contagion. That being said this is not the movie for hardcore horror fans and for those who go in expecting to see brain- eating zombies or gore would be disappointed sorely. Its more drama than horror. Then again this ain't a rehashed 28 Days Later. Where 28 Days Later had a solid storyline WWZ falters there a bitthe story of the movie could be encompassed in one paragraph but that owes to the fast pace that it'd got too. Tense moments were aplenty and yes the first as well as the second half of movie does put you at the edge of the your seats. I was never given a moment to breathe. I was either taking deep breaths or keeping my breath in at times of those tense moments. The 12 second zombie-bite-turnover time was what made it tense most of the times. There was this scene where Brad runs to the edge of a building, away from his family, having had zombie brain matter in his mouth and counting to 12 to see if he'd turnit striked to me as ingenious writing. My problem was that it was all too fast. If you watch it individually and as snippets its quite gripping but the team globetrotting their way to find the source of the outbreak felt way too quickWAAAY TOO QUICK! I know my statements could contradict here but this is exactly how I felt.Brad Pitt was awesome as Gerry. The film was solely on Brad Pitt's shoulders and he's put in his best here. A bit of credit could be given to Mireille Enos, she didn't have a lot to do here but she was convincing as Karin Lane. Apart from these two, the only cast members worth mentioning are Daniella Kertesz and Pierfrancesco Favino/Peter Capaldi duo each having the shortest of screentimes ever.Qualms regarding the ending was inevitable. The finale felt very unsatisfactory. The right word would be 'precipitous'. Everything that had it going for the movie was put to an abrupt end. PG 13 hampers the experience a bit. But not completely; all the slashing/hitting and the gore that followed, they were all implied and it makes for some effective scenes as well. the The second half didn't come up to its first counterpart and had serious issues with the pacing, where the first half screamed urgency the second half was more akin to playing a stealth game, taking its sweet time to keeping you in strain.World War Z is good movie but far from perfection. But of course you have to give in to the makers for coming up with something as entertaining as this despite going through the worst of production. It also has an intense score composed by Marco Beltrami. PS: Watch this movie in 2D.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Gore-Down,"There isn't much you can do when a Movie is made as a PG-13 when it is a Genre crying out for an R. But here it is. Take it or leave it. If You take it, there is a lot of Sprawl and Globe Hopping, neither seen before in Zombie Movie Land. Gone is the Flesh Tearing and Muscle Munching, in its place there are Zillions of Zombies speeding and jumping around like Track Stars and numerous Aerial Shots that make them look more like Insects than the Living Dead.That's what you get and a lot of it. But there are problems Infecting this, that are quite Troublesome. Like building a Wall around Israel. You could read that as an Isolationist Political Statement separating the Israelis from the rest of the Middle East.Then there's the Biological Weapons thing. When Brad Pitt determines that some sort of Germ Inoculation is needed at the WHO, the Scientist there respond like a Clerk at Baskins Robbins, 31 Flavors to go, We got your Sars, Ebola, Smallpox, and many more, take your pick. It is handled like these Caretakers and Makers of Biological Weapons are the Worlds Friend and Saviour. That is up for Debate.The Movie is Entertaining somewhat and the PG-13 Kids will most likely Eat it up. The Humongous Budget and Superstar Brad set this apart from others of its Ilk and that alone makes it a sorta Silly diversion from the usual Crunch and Munch Movies. Zombie Film Fans will most likely be Furious at the Gore-Down but others may find it Action Packed enough and give it a Pass.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
"I'm tired of zombies, but this...","Every time I see a new zombie movie I usually get pretty disappointed. The last good zombie entertainment i saw was the first seasons of The Walking Dead. Then came this unusual twist that made me smile in horror from start to end. Action packed, scary, apocalyptic and interesting. I almost wish they made a second one. What if the solution at the end made everything even worse after awhile... ;)",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
"Different, disappointing, gritty and grim.","Zombie movies should have gore. Lots of gore. In what seems like a statement of dramatic intent from director Marc Forster, WWZ has very little blood and guts, instead focussing on building tension and presenting a rational view on what it might be like if there ever was a zombie-apocalypse. It's a shame, because there's no reason Forster couldn't have his cake and explode heads all over it too. In an attempt to ground proceedings and maintain a realistically sombre mood, this undead-pandemic yarn is also unrelentingly grim and overly serious, sorely lacking in both humour and action sequences designed to thrill (rather than chill). On a better note, the screenplay, based loosely on Max Brooks' acclaimed novel, emerges as ruthlessly pragmatic - despite having had at least five people work on the script at various stages - and gratefully sets the story in parts of the world rarely seen on the big screen. The hordes of CGI zombies are intriguingly conceived and the cinematography by Ben Seresin is unquestionably the film's greatest asset, whilst Brad Pitt is typically solid and charismatic as the ex-UN investigator who gives the audience a man to cheer for. Disappointingly, WWZ is not the film it should've been, but if you're looking for a gritty, Contagion-esque drama that gets under your skin then it largely succeeds.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Brains...Brains....Brains,"OK.....Firstly I am not a great lover of zombies that can run....however, I can move with the times and if that's what the kids want these days then so be it......Secondly I am not a fan of overused CGI but you can't go back to the days of Rick Baker. That said I found World War Z a really good film. I eagerly anticipated the release of this film and I wasn't disappointed. Those who slated this film really need to watch it again. The story line was good, if a little far fetched at times (but we are talking about a pandemic Zombie virus here) and the action sequences were well paced with the...well...not so action scenes...also there was some humour which was needed. The film gave the viewer the chance to figure things out for themselves rather than giving hugely over explained scenes that would've slowed the pace which I feel was one of its stronger points.So to all those reviewers who went to the premier or got tickets to see it at a film festival remember the film is there to entertain the masses and not just you so don't analyse the relationship between director and star or talk about how we've seen it all before in 28 days later......BECAUSE 28 DAYS LATER IS NOT A ZOMBIE FILM, THEY WERE INFECTED WITH RAGE.......ahem.....I digress .....my point is that this is a good action film and definitely one to see.

Better than expected,"'World War Z' hasn't had an easy road to the big screen. Work on the film began around 2006 and from then on, the production was troubled. Brad Pitt became involved early on, putting up much of his own money for it – with his production company Plan B – yet even he must have been worried when he saw how difficult the making of the film was becoming. Directors were changed and the script passed through the hands of about five scriptwriters. The budget started out somewhere around $120 – 130 million, but it continued to rise and is now reported to be over $200 million. Rumours abounded reporting tensions between Pitt and director Marc Forster. Then, the original ending was entirely scraped, so reshoots were required to somehow be weaved into the existing narrative. After all this trouble, I went into 'World War Z' expecting a mess with cracks evident on screen. However, in a pleasant surprise, it flows nicely with the new ending working seamlessly.This film is many things, but it isn't really an adaptation of Max Brooks' 2003 novel of the same name, even though it started out as such. Brooks' acclaimed novel has a multi-narrative structure that would better lend itself to a TV show as opposed to a film. Whereas the book concerns multiple narrators, the movie solely follows ex-UN official Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt) who experiences a zombie outbreak first-hand, narrowly escaping the chaos with his family. However, his former boss asks him to travel the world to search for a possible cure for the pandemic.Most zombie movies and TV shows (good or bad) take place after the initial outbreak, whether it be 'The Walking Dead', or Danny Boyle's brilliant '28 Days Later'. In a refreshing turn, 'World War Z' depicts the outbreak the minute it happens, and these scenes are some of the best in the film, conveying a frenzied feeling of panic. It feels what it would really be like - cars crash, people scramble in every direction, disaster everywhere. Secondly, the majority of zombie films and shows find their characters confined to a small area; for example, the shopping centre 'Dawn of the Dead'. One of the best aspects of 'World War Z' is that it shows the zombie pandemic on a global scale, with the central character travelling from the U.S. to Korea to Israel to Wales. This globe-trotting element provides the film with some thrilling setpieces, in particular the relentless scenes where thousand- strong swarms of zombies flood through the streets of Jerusalem or the initial panic in Philadelphia.Marc Forster is a director with a mixed back record – 'Stranger than Fiction' may have been great, but he followed it up with the huge disappointment that was 'Quantum of Solace' – thankfully, 'World War Z' is significantly better than the latter. It's no masterpiece, but it's a quite good and consistently enjoyable romp. Pitt delivers a solid performance and makes Lane an engaging protagonist. The lack of gore and the presence of fast zombies may annoy fans of the book and zombie traditionalists, but I found that both worked (especially the latter) in the context of the movie. It's not the book, but 'World War Z' is still a good film, especially after all the trouble it went through.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
"This is a perfect zombie film, in every aspect. But remember: it's just a zombie film!","I saw World War Z last weekend, and I decided to give it a quick review after reading so much negative and unfair opinions about it. These are the facts: It's an apocalyptic zombie thriller, so what do you expect? It's a perfect film on the things it proposes. It's the best apocalyptic film I've seen to this day.It has a very good pacing, with a very fast and explosive beginning that gives hints on what's on the way. Different from some apocalyptic films, this does not ease the pace at almost any moment, keeping your eyes glued to the screen. The characters are not the deepest on the world, but they're built just fine.What I really enjoyed about this film, is that it explored lots of interesting and relevant issues on a zombie Armageddon that are usually left out: how did it begin, where did it begin, how it works, and what's the cure, without, at any moment, dropping the thrilling pace. And it actually showed humanity fighting the zombies... This was something that always bothered me on zombie films, and I'm a big fan of the genre... Why the hell does not everyone gather up and fight'em with everything possible? And I also liked it that the cure is actually very plausible.There were some interesting geopolitics references that gave me chills... I'm not going to give them up, but they made me think ""Wow, that makes a lot of sense!"" And as if it was not enough, there's a great soundtrack, with an incredible theme song by Muse. There was also one of the best uses of 3D that I've ever seen. The scene on the vault on South Korea, with the flying dust around the dead bodies is very beautiful... Honestly one of the few times I've seen a justified use of 3D on a film.As for other important aspects, the acting is fine; the fast action scenes are well filmed, succeeding to pass the whole chaotic situation to the viewer without making him confused. The photography is very cold, exactly what I expected from this kind of film.Well, to sum up: This is a perfect zombie film, in every aspect. But remember, it's just a zombie film, so don't expect anything rather than that.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"

The movie was just very well done. I came in expecting an action flick,and encounter a movie that kept me to the edge of my seat till the very end. Taking into account the fact that horror movies these days suck,I was just really glad to feel like that watching a movie again,all the tense moments and the creepy moments are excellent and couldn't relax till the end of the movie.

What Happened To Slow Zombies?,"I waited a long time to see this movie. For what seemed like years (it was), I remember reading in the ""Trades"" about all the problems this movie had getting off the ground. I was getting a little worried as I read more and more about the issues as time went on.I like the Zombie genre and from the short clips of World War Z I was able to see before it was released, I thought this was going to be big. Like $100 million opening weekend big. Heh, yeah, I know right.I never got a chance to see the movie until just a few months ago. Was it worth the wait? Well, yes and no. Brad Pitt fans, and Zombie fans will love it, but not without some brickbats and caveats. I am a big fan of the latter, and a so-so fan of the former. I read the book before I saw the movie, and I understood the difference between the two and that is what made it even more interesting to me. Plus, I really enjoyed the book and after reading it I felt I had a good comprehension of the characters and I was prepared to see them in action now, which in the movie takes place before the book.I wasn't disappointed when I finally saw World War Z. Yeah, it could have been better (I gave it a 7...any movie that keeps my interest for at least 95% of the time gets a 7...that seems to be the median that I follow here at IMDb). But it was disappointingly sort of anti-climactic. I was expecting more, and I thought there would be more to it. After, I just sort of sat there on my cardboard box wondering, ""is that it? Did I just miss something?""It sure felt that way. It's kind of like the feeling you got when you were a kid and you wanted a dog for Christmas but got a cat instead. Or the day you went to see Star Wars but you had to sit at the back row because you were late getting to the theater. You still sort of got what you wanted, but not what you expected. But, I have seen World War Z three times already so it's not that bad. Be warned though, that could just be my OCD, just my OCD, my OCD.I have seen it three times already, but another thing that bothers me is the Zombies, which, for a movie that is mostly about Zombies, is a little bit of an issue. I completely disagree with the whole running Zombie thing – or at times sprinting! George A. Romero would be just as saddened to hear of these super-fast new Zombies that can climb walls higher than what Trump plans on building to keep the Mexicans out, and run faster than most living humans. Not to mention this super strength they have? WTF? Where did that come from? But then again, the world is moving a lot faster than it did in 1968's ""Night of the Living Dead"".I did like to see the live transformation from living human, to undead Zombie happen before my eyes. Whether that is physically possible, or not, it's still kinda cool. The CGI is awesome for those scenes, as it is for the rest of the film (well, that damn movie cost $190,000,000 to make so it better have great CGI).I wouldn't have paid whatever it costs now to go to a movie on a weekend, but perhaps middle-of-Wednesday-afternoon-prices instead. In my case, I got it free from the library 4 years after release date (yes, they still do exist and now with fancy new automated check in and check outsoon, no more librarians!).Well, now I wait yet again to get my fill of Zombie flesh. There's always the very good and reliable ""The Walking Dead"" to fill the void until anther apocalyptic Zombie movie comes about. Perhaps the new string of Zombies that will soon be released upon civilization will be exactly like those in World War Z. It may have foretold our fate. We can look at World War Z as a training film.You'll soon look back on this day when ""The Idiot Savant"" was right, yet again. Meanwhile, I'll be holed up in the nearest prison (voluntarily this time) with my own minions of loyal followers protecting what's left of this world from the super-fast-super- strong World War Z Zombies.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"

Brad goes slumming in this load of (very enjoyable) tosh!,"Is there an intentionally Biblical parable in the spectacular incident at Jerusalem's infamous 'Berlin Wall'? Another stunning set-piece takes places on the airliner transporting Brad to (no kidding) Cardiff Airport. The climactic scenes at a besieged WHO facility in Wales are more firmly rooted in the George Romero or 28 DAYS tradition of zombie flicks, with Brad Pitt trying to avoid a smaller group of the Undead on a claustrophobic set. The ending does not seem to rule out the possibility of a sequel - WORLD WAR TWO? - if Brad wants to go 'slumming' again (Tom Cruise does it all the time).Pitt acquits himself well in his role, much as Dustin Hoffman did in the 1995 pandemic movie OUTBREAK but we would rather see our leading actors in roles where they're playing against something a bit more challenging than rampaging CGI monsters, wouldn't we? A lot of money was clearly spent making WORLD WAR Z and it shows, but this really is - how shall I put it? - a load of tosh. Hugely enjoyably tosh, though, and I look forward to sitting through a sequel or two.

That being said, in any case you do get your dessert.World War Z is as fast as the zombie horde that explode onto the screen, edge of the seat thriller, some scares (even without gore) and jumpy moments so this movie worked for me. It's tense, it's exciting and a little unnerving due to the fact that this film depicts very well how things would play out if a virus was to break out in densely populated cities.I don't know who to thank but I was pleasantly surprised that when using cities around the world for various plot points they didn't go with London in the UK but for Cardiff in Wales in the UK :o) made a nice change as I come from Wales.In essence, the pros outweighed the cons,and yes there were cons(not so fluid plot, no foreplay,plus this movie could of been at least an extra hour longer).Final statement - I'm a massive zombie movie fan and I was not insulted by the movie, to be honest it nice to have a bit of variation.

Nothing revolutionary to add to the zombie genre,"When I first saw the trailer for World War Z (WWZ for short, naturally) I wasn't too impressed. First, yet *another* zombie movie and second the CGI looked very shoddy. Plus I had heard that the movie had been plagued by production issues, numerous rewrites and whatnot.Fast forward to a couple weeks ago and for some reason I became interested in seeing it. I think I remember reading an article saying early reviews were positive. Shows how easily I'm swayed. Or it could just be that I love movies and I'll watch anything (can't say I'll always pay for them though)The positive scores on rotten tomatoes sealed it for me so I went today after work.I was just about getting over the headache that Man of Steel gave me so I wasn't looking forward to the 3D. Surprisingly, the 3D was well done. Zack Snyder needs to get in touch with Marc Forster for some tips on properly post converting.Aside from the 3D, there was nothing revolutionary to add to the zombie genre except maybe showing that a zombie movie can be done without copious amounts of blood and gore and still be quite entertaining. The CGI wasn't an issue like I thought it might be.Am I the only person who thinks Brad Pitt is a bad actor? He's not Channing Tatum level but he can't hold a candle to say DiCaprio in my opinion.WWZ is a decent 2 hours at the cinema.

"Really --- Aren't You Sick of Werewolves, Zombies, and Vampires YET?","A Brief Prelude:Kids were laughing about werewolves, zombies, and vampires by the 1940s -- is there really anything more to any of them?

Disappointing,"I gave this a 6/10, which means it's okay but not something I really want to watch a second time. There is one major and two minor problems with WWZ. First, the first 25 minutes of the film is almost unwatchable because the editors kept switching the camera angles every one or two seconds during the action sequences. It makes your head spin trying to follow the action. That's the major problem. Second, the zombies move too fast. They move so fast you can't really get a good look at any of them. I'm used to the slow-moving ones that you see on The Walking Dead. That to me seems more realistic. Third, there's a little too much CGI. It's not as overused like in The Hobbit or 2012, but those action scenes in Israel definitely did not feel real. Overall, this film was disappointing.

"Infectiously good, even if perhaps not a true zombie film","Although it deviates from the source material more than a tad, World War Z is a certifiable, credible thriller that's part old-time adventure film and part new-school medical procedural. It's a fast-moving, intricate, and solidly acted by the indomitable Brad Pitt.Okay, sure, the ""Z"" stands for zombies (in the book and in the film), but let's be frank (or Bob or Justine) - these aren't zombies, really. Well, they're sort of a cross between a zombie and the victims of the Rage virus from 28 Days Later. The bitten turn into homicidal maniacs about ten seconds after infection has set in. But they're attracted to noise and to life itself, so essentially if you both have a terminal disease and are really quiet, they won't see you. These infected are sort of like the T. Rex of the human populace.Brad Pitt plays Gerry Lane, a former UN employee with some knowledge about infectious disease. He's driving his kids to school and his wife (Mirielle Enos) to work in Philadelphia when it happens - sudden stop of traffic followed by cars crashing, police scrambling, and finally, a horde of contaminated peoples running amok over the city, coming after those who still live. This sets off the expected chain of events of Gerry and his family ushered out of Newark, NJ to a ship in the North Atlantic, from where the UN is running its operation of Find the Cause. The UN, in the person of Thierry Umutoni (Fana Mokoena), pulls Gerry into the scrum: they feel he's their man; he's the one who can find out not only where the infection began but how to stop it.Gerry's adventures take him to such incongruous places as South Korea, Israel, and Wales at a frenetic pace. Some scenes are eerily reminiscent of John Carpenter's The Thing; in one, Gerry and a military escort must silently pedal bikes to a plane for refueling, so as not to alert the walking dead and thus turn them into running dead. It's a creepy, chilling scene, and never has riding a bike looked so difficult.Now, if you've read the book by Max Brooks and plan to see this movie, you should know that the overall structure of Brooks' book (narration by Lane) is jettisoned for a more straightforward action-movie approach. And you might well be put off by that at first, but once you get over your faux outrage, you may discover that the movie is actually the better for the change; the result is much more suspenseful and riveting on the big screen than a true adaptation might have been.I like Brad Pitt, and this makes up for Killing Them Softly in spades. He's his usual terrific self as Gerry, who isn't some hardscrabble, world-weary action guy but rather an authentic everyman who could be any of us, only with better hair. His Lane is shown to be quite vulnerable (physically and psychologically), and Pitt's able to pull it off magnificently - unlike, say, a Tom Cruise or a Leonardo DiCaprio (the latter made a heavy bid for the rights to Brooks' tome). This is part of what makes Pitt such a fine actor. He's malleable; he can play bad guy, good guy, action hero, clever bastard, and so on without looking out of his element. He is the driving force of this film.As I mentioned, the movie moves (shambles?) at a quick pace. Ordinarily, this might mean that there's little plot involved, but if anything the movie is overplotted. Thankfully, time isn't wasted trying to explain to us every little detail about how Lane arrives at certain conclusions or on secondary or tertiary characters and their reasons for being where they are. It's a succinct plot that makes the best use of its runtime.World War Z, although perhaps not a true zombie film (are the victims killed and then turn or are are they infected and then turn?), is a perfectly good adrenaline-rush movie with a punchy, intelligent script and a typical knockout performance by Pitt.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Mother Nature is a serial killer. No one's better. Or more creative.,"Brad Pitt stars here as Gerry Lane, a former United Nations investigator who's pressed back into service when the whole world is over-run with zombies. Nobody knows exactly how this got started, but the results are devastating. A live person bitten by one of these things typically ""turns"" within a dozen seconds, although sometimes the process takes longer. After getting his family to supposed safety, Gerry goes globe trotting in search of answers and solutions.This loose, mega-budget adaptation of the novel by Max Brooks (son of comedy legend Mel Brooks!) doesn't lack for sheer spectacle. The filmmakers, led by director Marc Forster, try very hard to make sure you're not bored, with one over-the-top action set piece after another. They counteract these unintentionally amusing scenes with more human moments, as well as some suspense (such as the finale with Gerry avoiding the living dead while obtaining a possible solution in a World Health Organization building).You'll likely never see another movie with a higher count of zombie antagonists. They attack the living with true ferociousness, and in enormous numbers. Unfortunately, due to the expected plethora of CGI, a lot of these scenes often end up pretty funny to behold, rather than simply exciting. The story has its share of ridiculousness, with Gerry proving to have almost as many lives as a cat.The well-chosen international cast (Mireille Enos, Daniella Kertesz, James Badge Dale, Ludi Boeken, Fana Mokoena, Elyes Gabel, Peter Capaldi, Ruth Negga, etc.) provides excellent support, lending this material all the gravitas that they can muster. There's an especially vivid cameo for David Morse as an ex-CIA agent who's gone more than a little loopy. The character of Gerry is not fleshed out to any great degree, but Pitt makes for a decent hero nevertheless.Overall, the movie is watchable, without achieving its full potential. By this point in time, it does feel like stuff we've all seen before. Certainly it has some intriguing elements, and Forster & company waste little time getting started, creating intense moments of disaster within the first 10 minutes.Six out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"

Fun but forgettable,"World War Z is a movie about zombies. Lots of zombies. Enough of them, in fact, to literally take over the world.It starts with an unknown patient zero somewhere in Asia. Then there are bizarre reports of Indian soldiers fighting what they call the ""undead."" Gradually cases of a strange disease which re-animates the dead infiltrate major metropolitan areas. Our movie picks up with a sudden outbreak in Philadelphia, and we witness a generally peaceful city transformed in minutes into a sea of chaos, fear, and terror.One of the survivors of the Philadelphia outbreak is Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt). Gerry was once a troubleshooter for the United Nations, and once it becomes obvious that zombies are literally infesting the planet with incredible speed the U.N. wants Gerry back in the field. If he can discover the origins of the disease, then perhaps a cure will follow. Reluctantly, Gerry agrees. He leaves his beloved family behind on an aircraft carrier and flies off to South Korea with a team of Navy SEALs.South Korea proves to be merely the first stop on what will be a globe-spanning odyssey for Gerry, however. As he travels from one international hotspot to another, Gerry slowly pieces together a little information about the zombie threat. But can he come up with a solution before the whole world is ravaged by the undead? To its credit, World War Z tries to be more than your average zombie film. Most films of its type aren't very good, typically being badly written and grotesquely gory. World War Z isn't especially gory, and the shocks it generates are more likely to be generated by suspense and surprise rather than splatter. Pitt is a solid lead, and he clearly delivers his best effort, so that Gerry comes across as a real person rather than a superhero impersonator.Sadly, none of this elevates World War Z above the mundane. For starters, the movie fails to deliver the scale its premise dictates. With the exception of a great scene set in Jerusalem, the movie never captures the magnitude of what is supposedly happening to the entire world. The film keeps us focused almost entirely on what Gerry is experiencing, presumably to establish viewer rapport with our protagonist. But for a movie about a World War, you don't see much of the world or the war.Perhaps more importantly, the film really isn't very scary, and only haphazardly interesting. As mentioned above, there are a few suspenseful moments and it's nice to see a horror movie where something is left to the imagination, but the movie is very slow and has lots of down time where the zombies aren't directly involved in the action. The result is a movie that just sort of rumbles along, hitting a few high points here and there but ultimately failing to reach a suitable climax. Even though World War Z isn't quite two hours long, it feels closer to three.World War Z is one of those films that isn't an outright failure, but it isn't anything special, either. If you really like zombies then go ahead and give it a go—you've most likely seen worse. Otherwise, you should probably just save your money.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
This movie is pretty bad...,"I do admit. The special effects are amazing, but there are loads of plot holes and the acting is extremely bad. Also, what's a zombie movie without at least a little blood? I mean, come on!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Not Bad (If You Didn't Read the Book),"Like ""I, Robot,"" you can choose to take this film on it's own merits, or you can compare it to the book. Like most films with a literary origin, ""World War Z"" fails to live up to the joys of the book, not making it through the transition from page to screen. But if you take it on it's own terms and forget the source, this is a perfectly decent summer blockbuster action adventure movie.The seven-star rating I gave is treating this as it's own thing, with no connection to the amazing fictional oral history of the Zombie Wars by Max Brooks. WWZ-Movie has effective thrills, decent choices by the characters (for the most part; I'll get into the picky things that pulled me out of the experience later), and images that stuck with me days after I walked out of the theater. A parent and spouse making sacrifices for his family, putting himself into danger to give his loved ones a better chance at life is a theme that speaks to me. The flood of rage-filled infected pouring over a wall like a tsunami with all of their humanity drained away, the face of an ally suddenly turned into an unthinking, unreasoning deadly threat... these are compelling, and worth the price of admission.Acting is solid, and didn't distract me from the narrative. Brad Pitt is reliably pretty, and he played this role with subdued confidence. Special effects ranged from spectacular and jarring (think of the trash truck turned into careening death) to the subtle and unnerving (a charred corpse with a finger still twitching, searching for a new victim.) Practical effects were first-rate, while digital effects have since been eclipsed by modern games. But if you squint a little you can stay in the story.What yanked me out of the experience were a few errors that had me saying, ""wait, what?"" out loud in the theater.About a half hour into the movie, the protagonist boards a Russian-made AN-12 Cub taking off from a US aircraft carrier. Wait, what? That should be a C-2 Greyhound. A transport that big just isn't used like that (there was an experiment back in the '60s, but it was just that, an experiment.) Okay, I told myself, engage artificial suspension of disbelief. And this is a UN project, so maybe they got air transport support from an eastern European air force. Then we see the Cub banking... and it's in US military paint. This zombie apocalypse is already an alternate universe so why not one where the USAF or US Navy bought some Cubs? Weirder things have happened. Moments later we see a different angle of the plane in flight, and now it's a real C-130. Come on, filmmakers! The two planes may have the same role and similar performance, but they really don't look all that alike. It's a small thing, but it knocked me right out of the movie.WWZ-Movie had several little errors like that, like the water system of the carrier getting diesel contamination, or the magical trash truck forming out of the traffic jam when just five seconds ago we saw there was nothing but parked cars for blocks.Another problem I had was the writing. For the most part, it was... fine. But Hollywood sometimes is a little too slavish in following Joseph Campbell's ""Hero With a Thousand Faces,"" and the Hero's Journey that all adventure films MUST follow. Just after being rescued from a horrific rooftop zombie swarm, Pitt's character is asked to make a dangerous journey, what sounds like a Call to Adventure, one that he's uniquely suited to accomplish. So, what's he do? He turns down this Call. Unsurprisingly, he's told that he must go or they'll kick him along with his family back to Zombie Hell (an obvious and pretty reasonable if harsh conclusion, one that Pitt's character should have known.) Reluctantly, he agrees. Turn, if you will, to the Great Circle of Adventure Storytelling, and you'll see we just ticked off the first two steps, the Call to Adventure, and the Refusal of the Call.Sure Campbell's work does a good job of describing the near universal adventure story. But such strict adherence to The Rules is sometimes annoyingly transparent. It's like the suits at the studio need to justify their obscene salaries by demonstrating they've read Campbell.This isn't great filmmaking. And it sure as hell isn't the book. But it's good enough for a few hours of entertainment. Just pretend that the title is ""Brad Pitt Fights Zombies,"" and then go read the completely separate and unrelated work by Max Brooks, the spectacular fictional oral history titled ""World War Z.""",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
It fails as an apocalyptic film but works as an OK action flick,"I have finally just got round to watching World War Z after all the hyperbole has died down.Now I must make it clear that I read and thoroughly enjoyed the book when it was first published and that I agree with all those other critics' who question the film's faithfulness to its source material and that it is was indeed a real opportunity wasted to make a worthwhile and credible film about global politics and the fragility of human society. Zombies in the Romeronian sense have always acted as a visual metaphor for society's cultural Other, yet this film lacks such depth and therefore I think it is only fair that the film should be considered in isolation, that we forget about its faithfulness to its source material and view the film for what it is –a Hollywood star vehicle and money making visual blockbuster.-If we keep this in mind then the film is not as bad as everyone has made out.There is a lot to be admired in the film. Brad Pitt is steady as always and some of the set pieces including the beginning in Philadelphia and the scene in Jerusalem are visually impressive. The decision to make the zombie's fast rather than lumbering as in Romero's films makes sense and it gives the film a sense of dynamism which is administered effectively in the set pieces. Also I think the lack of gore as some fan boys have complained about does not detract from the overall film and there are a number of jump out of your seat scares, although these do become predictable after a while.Of course there is nothing original about this film, there is nothing being offered here that we haven't seen before and done better. This is a shame, but given the amount of money invested in this film is it any surprise they played it safe? We can also sit and pick apart the plot holes until the cows come home, they are numerous but it still shouldn't detach from the overall film, I mean how many times do we watch the Die Hard films and think ""no, that wouldn't happen!"" This is pure visual popcorn fodder and as such it does a competent, sometimes good but never amazing job.Where the film really falls down is in its lack of overall cohesiveness. It feels like a series of separate spectacular action sequences loosely tied together with poor dialogue. Brad Pitt's love for his family is unconvincing and the story of human survival which should have underpinned the whole story is seriously underplayed. As such the film just doesn't work as a whole and you come away at the end feeling a little cheated, a little unsatisfied.As a huge fan of apocalyptic cinema in general I found the film disappointing because it plays down the human struggle and it really doesn't have a lot to say. Given the promise of its source material this could have been spectacular addition to the genre if it had been placed in the hands of the right director. Nonetheless, zombie films have always tended to be more niche in cinematic terms and have not always fostered mass appeal. This was a huge blockbuster film made especially for mass appeal so it is understandable why certain generic elements take centre stage.In view of this the film works better as an action film that just so happens to be about zombies but really they could have been anything and the film would still feel the same.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
"Great Movie, not the usual Zombie fare which is a good thing","This was much better than I thought it would be, probably for the very reasons some didn't like it.It was a real movie with story, good characters, touching moments, and real suspense (slasher/gore isn't suspense). This actually raises the stakes and probably makes it more impactful in a real way. The whole set up is very plausible. The stakes for the family are also very real. It also did a good balance of how these situations will bring out the best in most people but also the worst in many. It wasn't all ""everyone is out to take advantage and evil"" but there were some.And sometimes people in the movie didn't react well or did stupid things. But that is realistic if you think about it. Most weren't trained for combat never mind ""the end of the world as they know it"". Stuff happens and they way it was dealt with made it more interesting.Many movies smooth these things over so they are less realistic and therefore make less of an impact. Let's face it, the majority of zombie fair is ridiculous, even when they have a basic premise that is possible. They are like video games that you know aren't real and half the time you are trying not to laugh or get annoyed at the stupidity, just like the average slasher/gore movies. The movie isn't about the zombies, they are just the threat and the backdrop. The movie is about the people. It's kind of like The Walking Dead in that aspect.I'm also not a big fan of movies that have action scenes that just go on forever. It's usually stupid and ultimately boring. More is often not better. This had great action scenes broken up by real human moments. Like I said, a real, well balanced movie.I loved it and it went by very fast. People I was with also weren't too sure going in but loved it coming out of the theater.And you shouldn't never decide a movie based on a book. They never compare well. Unless you want to go the LOTR route and make 3 movies more than 3 hours long, you aren't going to do what was in the book. As a result, even the best adaptations combine characters, merge situations,etc. Judge a movie as a stand alone piece of work.I agree this probably isn't for kids. The stakes are more real and therefore it would be more upsetting. Unfortunately, kids are used to gore these days, but this isn't that.There is at least one minor clip in the trailers that doesn't seem to be in the movie. There will no doubt be an extended version at some point.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Great Zombie Film But Went By Too Quick...,"The action and stuff really entertained me with some blood splatters and the references from the book.

What I loved was it's plot on finding the origin of the virus. The thing I didn't like was the fast pace of the film. Firstly the zombies were literally fast paced, second the action started after 5 minutes into it. With 2 hours they really put effort in putting in action!
I don't recommend this for younger viewers but i'm not the parent. No sexuality, lots of violence, some gore, and some language.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
A typical zombie movie with unusual budget,"Most zombie movies are trying to have a unique approach. As Norwegian ""Dead Snow"" (2009), who was the first with Nazi zombies. Danny Boyle, best known for ""Trainspotting"" (1996) and Oscar winner ""Slumdog Millionaire"" (2008), was in ""28 Days Later"" first with zombies that are not dragging themselves through life, but was fast as hell. A real shock for all zombie fans the first time the film was shown.""World War Z"" has zombies running so fast that Usain Bolt would be eliminated already in the trial heats. Furthermore, they are many. Too many. It appears a little too obvious that it is computer animated zombies climbing on each other like ants up the walls and barricades. The film was preceded by disaster rumors, including after an informed article in Vanity Fair. It was about a budget that is constantly rising. About a discord between the film's director Marc Forster and star/producer Brad Pitt. About an super expensive final third set in Russia and that has been completely discarded in favor of a totally different ending. It required several well-paid screenwriter to find. And so on.Many great films suffer similar rumors. They are not always true. And ""World War Z"" is by no means a disaster. Initially and finally, really good. In the portrayal of the chaos that occurs in the middle of an American city when the zombie epidemic breaks out. And the bare tension that arises when Brad Pitt's UN inspector Gerry Lane in a sophisticated way try to fool a small number of zombies who have barricaded themselves in a research institute where a possible cure for the epidemic can be. It creates scenes that sends shivers through intimacy and silence. Otherwise, you can hardly blame ""World War Z"" to be a small film. When Brad Pitt's UN inspector travels around the world, it's thousands of zombies just everywhere, as if the whole world had been infected in a few hours. A bit silly. Besides Pitt, it is also just one person in general who makes a impression, a tough female soldier (Daniella Kertesz).Eventually, ""World War Z"" is becoming as any other zombie film, only more lavish.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
"Good zombie thriller, but next time they should adapt the book","Max Brooks' book ""World War Z"" is a masterwork thriller. It drips information about the zombie apocalypse to the reader through short stories, so that as you read the survivors' accounts you piece together a much bigger story. It would make a brilliant anthology series on HBO. They could hand chapters off to individual filmmakers to adapt into hour-long episodes. Rumour is that there was an earlier script that would have made this film 3+ hours and stuck much closer to the book's structure. The rumour also says that it would have been the first Oscar-worthy zombie film.But that is not what happened. Instead, the filmmakers behind World War Z, including producer Brad Pitt, have looked at the macro-political story that Max Brooks wrote and wrote a Hollywood hero into it. Brad Pitt plays Gerry Lane, a former UN agent who is drafted to find a cure. Forced away from his family to globe-trot the apocalypse, he deals with a variety of situations borrowed equally from zombie films and apocalypse disaster movies.Plenty of fans of the novel will be disappointed by this. But the fact that the movie follows a new character while (roughly) following the bigger story of the book means that the characters of the novel are out there. They are facing their own apocalypses. They just didn't cross paths with Brad Pitt. Sequels or (hopefully) an HBO series could give them their time on screen, but for now we have this film starring Brad Pitt.As far as films starring Brad Pitt go, this one is quite good. It didn't try to be funny, which most zombie films do, and the resulting tone was closer to Contagion than Dawn of the Dead. Brad Pitt is a solid leading man as usual. Mireille Enos (The Killing) is his wife, and in her short time on screen she manages to be a competent survivor.Something that often sinks apocalypse films is a transparently manipulative character. The screaming blond in Jaws 2 should have been the first one eaten, but she stubbornly survives to annoy the audience to the end. Fred Astaire's part in The Towering Inferno was specifically designed to break your heart. 2012 was hemorrhaging selfish and annoying characters to hate. These cheap emotional manipulations reveal bad scripts more often than bad actors, so it was nice to see World War Z did not burden its good cast with cheap tricks.Perhaps we will see a WWZ adaptation some day, but for now there is a solid zombie thriller starring Brad Pitt that happens to use the same title.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
"World War Z has a rushed ending and is choppy as a whole, but thanks to pulse-pounding and wonderfully visceral set pieces succeeds as one hell of a thrill ride.","World War Z has an abrupt ending, and it isn't much of a cohesive film, but rather a string of extremely intense, pulse pounding, and wonderfully visceral set pieces. Definitely see it for some summer bait to chomp on and one hell of a thrill ride.The story: The plot, generally, is supposed to be set on Max Brook's (interestingly son of comic genius Mel Brooks) bestselling mock-non fiction book World War Z. The novel essentially is a retelling of the history of the world after a global outbreak of the zombie infection. It aims at portraying a satirical while realistic display of the brain chomping carnage, and provides all of the juicy political and social commentary any zombie fan could ask for. Now for the movie, they use the term ""based on"" fairly loosely. Cut most of the statistics and commentary, this movie is about action and white knuckle suspense. Newly retired UN worker Gerry (Brad Pitt) has chosen to settle down with his family, who reside in Philly, but his plans of relaxation are far from fruition as his life and world are hit stuck with a disaster. Zombie infections begin to breakout all over the world and here's the worst part; not only do these zombies run, they topple and climb over/up each other like ants. Also, without giving to much away, they can multiply faster than you can tie your shoe. Soon, cities crumble, and millions of the population have been ""lost"" as Gerry and his family are escorted to battleships in the Atlantic for protection. But Gerry is far from safe as he is called upon to help aid research and fight against the plague across the world, and let's just say that things get tasty.The good: The film's action set pieces are genuinely spectacular and create some of the most nail-biting and intense moments of celluloid that I have experienced since Zero Dark Thirty. They are big, bad-ass, and also very in range. While some have big-scale moments of terrifying moments of awe, think back to the ant-like antagonists, others are quieter and build up to an explosive boil of terror and excitement. The great pacing also truly helps create the fluid nerve- racking energy that is so present during these scenes. Pitt is also good as the lead and is subtlety charismatic and like-able as our reluctant survivor. The rest of the cast is strong and do a perfectly serviceable job. The special effects are solid and create many frightening and spooky visuals of carnage throughout the film.The bad: The film has been notable for being a partial disaster in it's production and writing and it does slightly show. The film reminded me more of The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956), or a Mission Impossible; it skipped around from enjoyable scene to scene, but you don't always have a clear reason why. The ending also cuts the film of a little to easily and leaves more of an implied resolution instead of a more finite and tactile one. Also the action is far to often shot in some scenes with shaky-cam, and it becomes at times distracting and or confusing. I also wish we had some more close ups of our blood thirsty protagonists. There is one entertaining use of social commentary in the movie, but I wish that it would take the time to make a few more clever insights into the potential-filled lore.My take: World War Z isn't as much of a scary movie, but rather one that is immensely thrilling and suspenseful. It isn't prefect, but it sure is a nice slice of summer entertainment that will get your heart going, even if you leave the theater wishing for a little more food for thought.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"

There was action throughout the movie from the beginning to the end. There were certain parts of the movie that I did not enjoy however, particularly the ending. Nevertheless, this movie kept on in suspense and it made me want to watch more movies of it's kind. I enjoyed this movie more than ""I am Legend"" which was surprising because that was a good movie as well.

Much better than I expected.,"A major studio, PG-13 zombie flick starring Hollywood heart-throb Brad Pitt: rather unsurprisingly, I opted to pass on this when it was in the cinema, preferring my undead movies to be very gory and very scary. But with the film released on DVD in an unrated version, curiosity got the better of me, and to my surprise, I really enjoyed what I saw.The script isn't perfect, certain plot developments being hard to adequately explain, and Brad Pitt's character must be the luckiest sonuvabitch alive to survive so many encounters with zombies (and a plane crash!), but disengage the brain and accept the less likely aspects of the story and there is a huge amount of fun to be had with this spectacular, fast-paced horror offering.Lots of brilliantly realised scenes of zombie mayhem, delivering plenty of scares and tension, go to make World War Z a thoroughly thrilling flick from start to finish, with the superb set pieces including a breathtaking race to the top of a tower block, an awesome 'zombie swarm' in Jerusalem, and the discovery of a stowaway zombie on a packed jet in mid-flight. Throw in a few superbly executed jump scares and what you have is a hugely entertaining movie, despite the questionable moments in the narrative.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"

No CPR needed. This film was undead on arrival,"Now I admit I've read the book so just from that you can probably get an idea of where I'm going with this. But I'd read enough reports beforehand to realise that aside from the name of the film and the soldiers calling zombies 'Zeke', everything else from Max Brook's work was pretty much discarded.That's frustrating to know given the source material, but as a fan of zombie movies in general I thought I'd at least give it a shot. That shot means there's two hours of my life I won't get back.It's badly paced, the zombies are more like the a poor version of the 'infected' from films like '28 Days Later' or 'I Am Legend' and rather than be an interesting story, it's comes across as an excuse to show off Brad Pitt's acting chops.Now I know Brad gets grief for his celebrity lifestyle and some really really terrible perfume ads, but generally I quite like him as an actor. This had the potential to be an ensemble story told from numerous perspectives. Failing that making the lead have any kind of personality may have helped. Instead it's Pitt going into a terrifying zombie encounter followed by a talky bit. Rinse and repeat.The fact these kinds of films (and I would very much throw it into the group of 'The Day After Tomorrow' and '2012') make money is quite tragic for the industry. They'll continue to make these films and people will continue to waste time watching them. CGI floppy zombies flying across the screen are not scary. You feel no empathy for any character, there's no real grandness to the scale of the zombie apocalypse, the score is filled with loud 'bangs' for the sake of making you jump but builds no atmosphere and no emotion. The score wouldn't have sounded out of place from a Van Damme film rather than a film budgeted at a reported $190m.To watch this as harmless entertainment it's frustrating, to watch it with any thought of World War Z the book or even audio book, is downright painful. I just can't figure out for the life of me what they spent the money on. It certainly wasn't the script.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
WWZ - almost a 10 star movie... misses the almost,"As I always say when someone comes and critics this movie in a negative way because "" bhaac, this is not a zombie movie at all"" or "" what the hell, the movie has nothing to do with the Max Brook's book!!!"" I, just say : - what's a zombie movie for you? have you already seen a zombie ? Do you know how they are, move, act? well, here is what a zombie is : "" is a hypothetical being that is indistinguishable from a normal human being except in that it lacks conscious experience or sentience"", so, your imagination is the limit! the zombies in WWZ are so acceptable as the zombie in The Walking Dead. Regarding the second negative affirmation by some of critics I remind that in every official advertising or movie information site is explicit that the movie is ""based on the novel "" and not an ""adaptation of the novel"" Yes, yes, I've loved the movie because I love zombie theme movies, because Brad Pitt is one of my favorite actors, because the Muse musics are great, but why only 8/10? well, the first part of the movie deserves 8 stars for all the tension , vfx, adrenaline but the second part... nope .... forget it , to soft, a break in the action, a real production error. So , here are my vote: 8/10",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Worthy of watching,"World War Z is a fast paced film, like most zombie movies. But it is also very ""detailed"" in a sense, that it at times shows the Undead very up close and personal and they even have some interesting behavioral qualities. The zombie masses are surprising in their efficiency at and in their persistent strive to kill (recommended in 3D). In some tense episodes we can get acquainted with the personal qualities of individual zombies quite closely, like a clapper of teeth, inspired by hunger. Or something similar.This film, like many other end of the world films, contains a good scene of a regular morning, when everything looks normal, but then suddenly a mass of people starts attacking other, peaceful and pacified, mass of people, who are unable to resist in any way. One can sense hundreds perishing (and then rising). The turning of fortunes towards the living is the story of this film.Interestingly enough, I had the impression of a ""green message"" this movie was somehow supposed to convey - that the zombie epidemic was Mother Nature's punishment for the Mankinds ""evil ways"". At least one can get an idea like that from the opening scenes.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Quite a ride,"All in all, it was a very enjoyable cinematic experience. Very fast pace, lots of scares and tense moments, and besides everything I noticed that the movie managed to keep a hold of the whole audience until the end where I watched. There were a couple moments where hysterical laughter and collective sighs were heard throughout...Now as far as doing justice to the book, it veers off pretty quickly, the main difference being that in the book you get several different viewpoints that end up forming a bigger picture. I had no expectations going in as soon as I read online (about a year ago) that ""the zombies were running, they were the fast kind"". Every fan of the genre knows that it's unusual for something positive to follow this last two sentences, so I was expecting something more along the lines of ""28 Days"" instead of ""The Dead"" series (which does no justice at all to the book).I can understand people getting angry about this as someone who appreciated the book, that this was actually a waste of an excellent book in its translation to the cinematic format, but since I had no expectations to begin with, the ""running zombies"" ended up adding to the overall pace of the action, and with the best 3d rendition I've ever seen in a movie, it ended up feeling more like an amusement park ride than an actual movie experience. The only major critique is the way it ended, it left me with the impression that the production topped out of their budget before they noticed they had to end it...All in all, totally worth a watch. The 3d is natural and gorgeous, and makes the whole experience very involving. Coupled with the pace, it was FUN.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
OMG! Amazing Movie!,"I saw World War Z in the movie theaters when it first came out, and I loved it. I saw it in 3D, which was even better (highly recommend seeing it in 3D, by the way). It, first of all, was not cheesy like most zombie movies. It was intense the entire time. I think I hardly relaxed during the entire movie! The zombies were very realistic, which was a major plus. There were a couple of times when I jumped. I've seen a lot of zombie movies, and this was tops all of them without a doubt. It reminded me of it. I'd recommend it for anyone above the age of about 13. Awesome movie! If you haven't seen it already, you definitely should!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
"""Mother nature is a serial killer.""","There is a certain expectations with zombie-pocalypse movies. We expect to see social order breaking down, ripping itself apart, just as we expect to see the undead ripping out the guts of all their hapless victims. World War Z looks to be the end-all-be-all zombie flick, with zombie outbreaks exploding all over the world. Regardless, I wasn't expecting much, given the turbulent production history behind this movie (resulting in the entire last act being re-filmed at the last minute) and the watered-down PG-13 rating.If nothing else, this movie gets the ""World War"" part of it right, while giving some good attention to the ""Z"" part. The action hits early and fast, and hardly lets up until the last act. For the first two-thirds of the film, the characters are constantly on the run, having to face danger on all sides, with hoards of zombies pouring out at them. These are zombies that run, sprawl, and hurl themselves at everybody in a frenzy, which could only be topped by the spazoid zombies in 28 Days Later. At key points, they become a vast sea of bodies rolling over everything. As bizarre and intense as these images are, they are slammed into the audience's faces to hard that it becomes exhausting and jarring.......until those last forty minutes, which were completely reshot and inserted into the film for what the producers felt would be a better ending. Frankly, I'm glad they did; as thrilling as the rest of the film is, I was finding it tiresome, especially in regards to the narrative. In the last act, the action slows down, the camera stops shaking, and the scenes become gripping more out of suspense rather than heavy-handed action. These last scenes are actually my favorite part of the movie, and I probably would have liked it a lot better if the film was made this way all the way through.As it is, however, the film feels like a long string of scenes loosely tied together with a flimsy plot structure. It's a pretty contrived series of events; the hero predictably hops around the world simultaneously protecting his family and trying to find a zombie cure. There is no particularly good flow from one scene to the next; the guy just gets told where to go next, and then he's on his way. The film tries very hard to make the characters compelling, thanks to putting the guy's family into danger, but none of them are that well developed or even interesting. Things are made even more iffy with the occasional stupid moment (chief among them, the department store looting scene, the landing in Korea, and every moment where characters make noise to attract the zombies). There are a few smart moments though: who would have thought that taping a magazine to your arm could be an effective zombie deterrent? Having never read the original book, I'm not sure how close of an adaptation this film is (I read that it isn't close at all). From what I've seen, the book touches upon some interesting thematic territory regarding politics and isolationism. The movie ports over some similar themes, thanks largely to its international locations and situations. As the zombies roll over Jerusalem, anti-isolationist themes emerge, suggesting that no nation is safe from war, no matter how secure the borders are.The film uses some very herky-jerky camera moves most of the time, and it can get tiring very quickly. There are occasional moments of good photography though. Editing is good. Acting is okay from the cast, but never felt exceptional to me; same goes for the writing. This production uses okay-looking sets, props, and costumes; special effects are not bad. The film has a pretty decent music score.World War Z is a decent thrill ride of a film, but little more. I felt it could have been better in many ways, but it'll satisfy most movie-goers looking for a quick and fairly safe thrill.3.5/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Average | Film: Pretty Good)",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
zombie enthusiasts will love this,"of course this movie has clichés, its a ZOMBIE movie overall. the thing about this movie is that it's actually believable in that the zombies are a complete threat. they're fast, ravaging, mindless monsters that when there's enough of them they literally pile over each other to get to you and holy sh*t if that's not scary I don't know what is. everyone in this film has only one thing in mind and that is to SURVIVE and keep having hope when all seems lost... pretty sad for our human race. I gave this film an 9, I know it's a bit courteous of me but its just me rating the film itself and take of simply because of the camera angles as it was hard to see at times.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Brad Pitt's Zombie movie,"Zombies !!!Let me get that out of my system straightaway. In India we recently had our first zombie movie, Go Goa Gone, which was ummmm.., but this review is about World War Z.I am a big zombie movie fan, have watched countless reruns of George Romero's zombie flicks on AXN. This is not just a zombie movie, its an action movie which straightaway cuts to the chase in the first five minutes. The zombie's here are a part of a much bigger canvas and that has been integrated well in the script.This movie has some jaw dropping aerial scenes and there is hardly any part where you would get bored, even though Brad does not get enough convincing scenes.All around its a good summer movie though its not comparable to the zombie classic.So if you just want to enjoy and see a good action flick and zombies are your cup of tea, go ahead and indulge yourself.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Brad Pitt delivers the goods,"When I went to see this movie, I was expecting pretty much what I saw in the previews. In otherwords, I saw Brad Pitt saying stuff in a soft voice while the zombie's run rampant. What sets this movie apart is how the Zombies are so fast and never run out of breath. It was amazing to see some of these special effects. There are many unanswered questioned such as the nuclear blast that caused Brad Pitt to lose cell phone reception. There was a lot of good stuff in this movie though. If you can overlook the plot holes, you will love this movie. You will have to get past the David Morse cameo and why his teeth are grinded into fangs. Great movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
WWZ worth a look,"Having read the negative comments during production of WWZ, and knowing they reshot the film's ending, I went into it hoping that the film might live up to the hype.This film is all about Brad Pitt. He is the one constant throughout the film. Other characters were not as developed.The action starts early in the story. The viewer is thrust into the thick of things in a way that might be too abrupt, but the premise of the movie is that the global issue developed so quickly that the authorities could not contain it.The action is consistent. Once we understand what the problem is, the story quickly--through the efforts of Pitt's character--takes us to the heart of the action. We are transported from one location, and its tasks, to another. A claustrophobic feeling is achieved through darkness, confined spaces, offscreen sounds, and even rain. The mood is consistently engaging.The suitability of the ending might be argued, but I was okay with it. It did have an abrupt feeling, like other films that set themselves up for sequels.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
A flawed but fun Zombie Action movie,"I saw several negative reviews regarding this movie, yet in the end I still had fun watching it.For starters, just forget about the name because it has little to no relation with the book. And in second place, you should approach this as an action movie rather than a traditional ""horror"" or ""suspense"" zombie movie.It is, for the most part, mindless action with some cool set pieces and decent special effects. The plot is rather generic (main character trying to find a cure) and there are several plot holes and unrealistic parts.So yeah, I don't really feel like there is much else to say about the movie. If you are like me and you don't think that every movie out there should be about ""character development"" and a ""deep/clever plot"".... and you can enjoy a movie once in a while for just being a fun summer blockbuster with mindless action, then I don't see a reason why you shouldn't watch this",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Good movie,"Seeing some people here giving this movie bad reviews and low rate I must say I totally disagree. I thought this movie was good and very well done. The action starts right away and never stops and I was very curious all the time where all that happens in the movie would eventually lead and how the people in it would solve the huge problem they are up against. All in all I thought this was a well made, well written, well acted and intelligent film in many ways, given that it is of course a zombie movie, and of course that requires the viewer to have tolerance towards the adventure. But it caught my attention from the very beginning and I would recommend it to anyone who likes fast movies and tension.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
It was O.K. but the book was so much better.,"I am a big fan of the book. It really surprised me as to how compelling the stories really were. it was fascinating to get the perspectives from all of the different cultures and walks of life that Max Brooks included in his writing. It was really convincing. The movie however, barely scratched the surface. It would be almost impossible to wrap that book up into a two hour flick but they could have used more elements from the actual writing. It seemed to to me that they just took the idea of the book and created their own story for it. The characters in the film were basically composites of the people that Brooks wrote about. The film was fun enough to watch but it could have been any zombie movie really. It just didn't have the ideas and depth that Brooks brought to the reader. I don't think that they even referred to the virus(Solanum) at all in the film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"

Zombie Holocaust!,"World War Z gained a lot of notoriety from all the rumors of production problems, reedits and expensive re-shoots. From all those negative stories, you would be forgiven for expecting an incoherent vomit of a movie; that it's not only easy to follow, but also well made and gripping is a massive plus. WWZ tells the story of a mysterious global pandemic, the source of which is unknown, but which turns the majority of the earth's population into rampaging zombies. We see the outbreak from the perspective of Gerry (Brad Pitt) and his family, as they witness it first hand while stuck in rush hour. From there, Gerry – a former government agent - is coerced back into action to find a cure and it is action all the way until the end.You have to admire this movie on many levels. It's supposedly a summer 'tent pole' release – traditionally a time for family movies - yet, it features lots of zombies running around biting people while getting shot in the process. There are panoramic shots of zombies running amok and the ensuing widespread destruction. And even if the bloodletting and gore levels are appropriately sanitized and restrained for the summer audience, still you have to revel in the joy of an actual summer zombie movie. When has that happened before? When is it likely to happen again?Brad Pitt (looking about 35 here) makes for a solid action hero as he goes through one hellish experience after another. Strangely, he doesn't really have a regular counterpart/sidekick to bounce ideas/dialog off, resulting in a lot of him asking questions on behalf of the viewer. The one time it seems as if he's going to get a sidekick, said sidekick is dispatched rather quickly in an unintentionally amusing fashion – presumably to give Brad/Gerry more to do. Furthermore, there isn't really the usual secondary subplot to cut to and as such as we see the chaos unfold mostly from his viewpoint. This has the unforeseen consequence of giving the movie a very 'chaptered' form; one-off events – almost like little mini-stories in their own right - take place in one country after another with their own beginning middle and ending and usually as Pitt the lone protagonist as the witness.The zombie action is excellent and we see suitably large-scale set- pieces of wanton zombie destruction. There is a level of scope and ambition here that you just won't see in something like 'The Walking Dead'. Though it has to be pointed out that those wide vista shots of the zombie hoards building 'ant hills' to scale walls happens only a handful of times in the movie. Even at that, you've probably already seen them in the prevalent trailers, which admittedly takes away some of the 'Wow Factor'.Now onto the aforementioned 'productions problems' and 're-shoots' that littered this movie's gestation. It's hard to evaluate it without taking those 'issues' into account. Why? Because the telltale signs are so evident. The story takes strange turns, focusing on some elements while completely ignoring others. For example, early on in the story, we see Gerry and his family rescuing a young boy – who we assume Gerry will semi-adopt and become a surrogate father figure to since his offspring are girls; this is how it seems it's being set up - yet the child is never seen or referred to again.Similarly, Gerry later takes a wounded Israeli soldier under his wing but she is so underwritten and cipher-like, you wonder: what's the point? If that's not enough, then take a high profile actor like Matthew Fox (of Lost); he features early on in the story and you assume he will figure prominently later; instead, he just shows up a handful of times in what could be the role of a background extra and one not worthy of Fox's talents. Just like John Cusack's shorn role in Terence Malicks's 'The Thin Red Line' (1998), what you begin to suspect is that Fox too was a victim of all the re-shoots/re-edits and his arc probably featured more prominently in the earlier version. And if you really want to nitpick, a scene at a facility, while admittedly a stand out that's very well executed, still feels very glued on almost as if it came from a different movie. Yet another legacy of the re-shoots? Probably it certainly feels that way.As for the pandemic, a reference is made to rabies early on in the story, then it's never really mentioned again. It's vagueness like this that rears its head again and again. Still, it's not the disaster that had been foreshadowed by some members of the media. Yes, it may feel chaptered but it's an intelligent film – for a zombie movie, anyway – that has stuff to say while showing you big spectacle. You really get the impression that this is truly a global pandemic.And that's the one thing this movie has going for it over a lot of movies of the genera: take any of the Romero zombie movies or any zombie movie from the last few decades, and what you find is the action/outbreak is always restricted to small areas/backwater towns. Not so here – this is the real zombie deal on a massive scale. For the first time ever, you see a zombie apocalypse taking place in cities in populated streets and not just on some back road in the middle of nowhere. But there has to be a trade-off: you can do spectacle or gore but you can't do both. That type of thing costs money, and if you're spending a lot of money, you want your product to be seen by the widest audience possible – meaning what essentially boils down to a bloodless zombie movie. Still there is enough good material in here to keep you interested and make the idea of a sequel/sequels a not altogether unwelcome proposition.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Worst Adaptation Of A Book To Movie Ever,"I loved this book. It was interesting and creative. Then I watched this horrible movie that just stole the title from the book, and called it a zombie story. Do not watch, or watch at you own risk. It will boor you to death.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
A PG-13 zombie movie.,"In an era which saw the resurgence of the gore-centric zombie in movies and now with the television show ""The Walking Dead"", how do you make a PG-13 zombie film interesting? The answer is, you can't really. And as much as ""World War Z"" tries to abide by the MPAA restrictions by replacing the skin tearing horror aspect of today's zombies with high amounts of action and suspense, at the end of the day this is still a PG-13 zombie movie that seems to have left most of its visual potency/potential on the cutting room floor.Synopsis: Brad Pitt (who looks like he just came off the set of that Chanel commercial) plays Gerry Lane, a family man who is just trying to eat breakfast with his wife and two daughters when the zombie apocalypse hits. But little do the zombies know that Gerry is equipped with ""a special set of skills"". These special skills (I guess) give him the ability to be one step ahead of everyone else in the movie, while simultaneously the ability to continuously claim to have no idea what's going on. Oh and let's get this joke out of the way. Yes, his character does sort of adopt a young Latino child little a less than half way through the movie. Coincidence? Side Note: OK, so I haven't read the critically acclaimed Max ""son of Mel"" Brooks novel that ""World War Z"" was loosely based on, but I've heard the allegations of how only the name was used, while pretty much all other aspects where scrapped. And though this may anger loads of people who loved the original source material, they need to get over it because this is nothing new in the world of Hollywood adaptations. Plus, there is much more here to gripe about than a non-existent adaptation.But first the good stuff: In a movie like this where your average viewer is all too familiar with the villain(s) at hand, what audiences really want to see is something new when pertaining to the zombie look or mythos. So it was not surprise that the things I enjoyed the most about ""World War Z"" were the few aspects of this zombie movie which could be perceived as fresh or different. Such as: addressing the eccentric ways other countries would deal with an outbreak of global proportions and presenting these particular zombies as an unthinking mass liken to a psychotic mob that quickly devours cities full of people like locusts.While it does speak to how post-heavy the CGI is when Brad Pitt is on record criticizing the look of a movie he financially backed, for the most part the direction from Marc Forster (Monster's Ball, Quantum of Solace) isn't bad. In fact, his direction is more or less the reason ""World War Z"" is way more entertaining and suspenseful than it has any right to be. That said, the visuals are hindered by a story with hardly any preface and a troubled script that is unbearably sentimental at times.Along with a few battle sequences and more than a few stretches of unexpected suspense, Pitt's performance is a smaller, but still prevalent reason as to why ""World War Z"" is watchable. He does his best here, much in the same way Tom Cruise attempts to save ""Jack Reacher"", especially during the overly melodramatic lulls when audiences may be pleading for some kind of action. There is also one really memorable cameo from character actor David Morse (The Green Mile) who plays a toothless Ex-CIA Agent. And while he is only on screen for a few minutes, he does make enough of an impact to garner a few lines in this review.OK, so I know you thought that I was never going to get to them, but here are my gripes: There are basically two huge factors which hold ""World War Z"" back from being a strong recommendation.1. How the zombies look and act: In mass quantities (shot from extremely long distances) the zombies take on the terrifying feel of the aforementioned swarm of locusts devouring everything in their path. But in latter scenes, when Pitt must go one on one with these zombies (in extreme close ups) their mannerisms do come off as involuntarily spastic and awkwardly laughable.2. The PG-13-ness: The cut-aways here are nothing short of embarrassing. When somebody gets attacked, Forster cuts. When a solder has an appendage cut off, Forster turns the camera away as if something more interesting is going on on the other side of the room. Suffice to say, when any kind of violence that could beget blood or gore rears its head, Forster cuts away in a back handed constant reminder that, like a small child, there are things in this movie that we (as audience members) are being shielded from. I guess you could say that as much as Forster does to make this tame zombie movie entertaining, he does just as much to relegate it to the B movie status that it takes on.Final Thought: Filled with suspenseful, entertaining and surprisingly well thought out moments, in the end ""World War Z"" is too PG-13 for its own good. And even with the few ""new"" zombie elements, I would never expect someone to pay for this movie if they have access to a zombie television show with more brutal realism and better writing.Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I.

A Good Movie with a bright future.,"Okay just to begin I want to tell everyone to calm down and think about this movie realistically. The hardcore fans of this book, like the ones of any book made into a movie, love to pick every detail and flaw out and claim this movie is crap. Yes it is not a 10/10 movie BUT it is definitely worth the see. I read the book and I though it was absolutely amazing. But from a realistic view point they could have never pulled off the book word for word. It just would be impossible. For those who have not read the book the story is basically a compiled series of interviews with people who experienced the zombies first hand. Now the book tells the stories of over a dozen people that have no real connection, only the single fact that they are dealing with the zombie outbreak is what makes them simular. This would have been IMPOSSIBLE to make into a successful movie. The way this movie was made was terrific. There was no boring 30 min start scene, it truly started intense right off the bat. The SFX were good, the story was good, the acting was great and is set up in a way were they can make multiple movie about different people and their experience.

"Pitt's fast-zombie blockbuster was good, but a little underwhelming.","Anybody that knows me knows that I love zombie moviesand my favorite type of zombie is the fast zombie. I also have a great deal of respect for Pitt as an actor. So this movie was all set up to be a big winner in my book. It wasn't badbut it was a bit underwhelming. Like I said, I like fast, adrenaline-charged zombies, as in 28 Days Later. But these zombies were too fast. They looked more like locusts. Also, this story is really about humanity's fight against the Zombie pandemic, rather than about one family's struggle to survive it, so I didn't feel very invested in the protagonist's survival. Don't get me wrong, the movie was good, but I just feel that I would enjoy the book more (although I haven't read it), because the story is more of a cerebral chess match or puzzle than the action blockbuster that the film's producers tried to create.For more reviews and a kickass podcast, check out www.livemancave.com",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"

I love it when reviewers try to compare it to Zombie movies that have already been done! IT'S Dead People running around attacking living people, how original is it going to be? Give me a break folks! What it really boils down to I think, is a lot of die hard Zombie movie fans were expecting a gory head splitting flick and came up empty.REVIEW: My wife, daughter and I went and saw it last night not expecting anything earth shattering seeing as we were going to see a Zombie movie. The movie was fast paced, had a lot of action and for the most part it was a very interesting movie. The acting was good and there are several heart felt moments in the movie. If you have your heart set on seeing a gore fest typical Zombie flick you might want to find another movie. There is a PG13 rating for this movie so it is tame in comparison to a lot of other movies in this genre. Pretty sure this is the reason a lot of the public reviewers are slagging the film so bad.Thanx for reading my review, Robert",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
The Zombie Genre Is Far From Dead,"The fact that 'World War Z' has finally been released is more of a miracle then finding the cure for a zombie virus. With a very troubled production behind it, 'World War Z' at one point was thought to be scrapped and not released. With the script going under re-writes, scenes being re-shot, the film going almost $100 million over budget and rumours that director Marc Forster and Brad Pitt had a falling out, it is safe to say 'World War Z' has had a bumpy ride before it had even set off. As for the film itself, Paramount are hoping the bad press surrounding the production is over shadowed by the film hopefully being a box office success and pleasing not just mainstream audiences, but fans of the novel too.Brad Pitt plays Gerry, an ex worker for the U.N and now full time father and husband who is caught up in a world wide epidemic. A zombie virus is spreading the globe and taking one country at a time. After taking his family to safety, it is now up to Gerry to go out into the world and try and find the cause of the virus and possibly a cure.Marc Forster has always been a director who focuses in characters, and here he is no different. The film isn't about the zombie virus, but more about Gerry's determination to get to the bottom of the virus and return to his family. This is Forster's best film since 'Finding Neverland'. Forster was hand picked by Pitt (who produces the film also) to direct and you can see why. Most film makers can fill the screen with violence, but if we don't care for the characters at the centre of the film then the violence can seem gratuitous. Don't get me wrong, the film is filled with blood and gore, but Forster never looses focus of the characters involved in the situations.Pitt gives a solid lead performance and all the supporting cast are excellent too, including a short but crucial cameo by David Morse. 'World War Z' does have its problems. We are less then 10 minutes into the film before we are swept away into the plot. Personally I would have liked to spend some more time with Gerry and his family, but the characters still become well established as the film goes on. The script also doesn't forget the political source from the original novel. We hear how different governments are going about tackling the virus which leaves our characters questioning if they are trying to go about their mission the right way.The script is full of edge of your seat moments. I can't recall the last time I was ever as tense whilst watching a film in the cinema. The action set pieces are great and the script tries to pull our characters way from certain clinches that may be found in this type of film. The soundtrack for the film is provided by Muse and is nothing less then spectacular. I saw the film in 2D instead of 3D and not at one point did I see any shot or set piece where I thought I was missing out on the 3D experience. The film was great without paying more money to wear a pair of glasses.Certainly the best film of it's kind since Danny Boyle's '28 Days Later' and proof that you can breath new life into a genre that is always being recycle. Tense, terrifying and utterly terrific, 'World War Z' is the best blockbuster of the summer so far.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
The best zombie movie that I watched,"This is the best zombie movie I've watched, together with 28 days and 28 weeks later.Brad Pit is a great actor and is acting very well in this movie, as usually.All the tension, ferocity and fear that comes of the situation is present in the movie and the pace is frantic until near the end, when the paces slow down, even though remaining tense.The worst problem in a zombie movie, in my opinion, is to be credible, because the subject is something that doesn't exist in the real world. In World War Z they had success to deliver a credible plot, credible behavior of the ""alive"" people (with some small flaws, little dumb choices) and a credible outcome. The scene at the traffic is simply impressive, for example.So that's it! Watch if you want a good action movie with a good plot and and if you like zombies movies, watch too.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Exciting Cliff Notes Adaptation of Novel,"First of all, I really liked it, and I am grateful to the producers for omitting the grisly stuff. The blood-curdling shriek of these zombies was still ringing in my somewhat shaky ears an hour after I left the theatre; I didn't need to see human gore dripping from their mouths as well every time I closed my eyes.I am about two-thirds through the novel and can verify the objections of those who say it departs significantly from its source material, but so what? I recall the famous author who, when asked how he felt about what Hollywood had done with his books, waved his hand at his library wall and replied, ""Hollywood hasn't done anything with my books--they're all right there.""Besides, the novel begins with the conceit that it is not the ""official"" report of the war historical commission--the overarching narrative--but rather, a collection of oral narratives of various survivors from around the world. Hence one can approach the movie with the view that Gerry Lane's (Brad Pitt) story is just one of them, although one that turns the conflict in favor of humanity. Or, think of it as the Cliff Notes version. Either way, see the movie for the thriller it is (oh boy, is it!), then read the novel for a collection of other survivor stories and the sort of detail that could not be adapted to a cinematic structure.Were I to quibble, I'd rather the movie had not diverged so far as to have borrowed the 12-second bite-to-zombie transformation from 28 DAYS LATER. There are few known toxins that work that quickly, let alone any virus, which has to commandeer the DNA of a cell and reproduce itself in order to take over the host organism. But I rather liked the war-changing discovery that the screenwriters invented just for the movie in the retrofitted third act. It's a doozy.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
"A typical summer blockbuster, all visuals, no characters...which isn't a bad thing","World War Z is an apocalyptic drama that lacks the same bite as The Walking Dead but packs enough of a punch to satisfy summer audiences. With it's melodramatic dialog, intense action sequences and Brad Pitt, it elevates a rather tiresome genre to new heights. While the film is absolutely stunning as an action thriller, it lacks in one of the most important elements of an apocalyptic drama...characters that the audience can relate to and sympathize with. Running at a little over an hour and half, World War Z could have easily been a three hour epic that included great characters along with its great action. Unfortunately, it fails to deliver any memorable moments throughout the film. Overall, World War Z features a good performance from Brad Pitt, great action sequences, and a story in the vein of Contagion. It is highly entertaining and is definitely a recommended watch but I fear it would fail to impress with repeat viewings.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
world war zzzz,"Here's the thing, Zombies are a metaphor. The Zombie character is a symbol of the blue collar office workers that drone to the corporate hive and than totter out in wearing a blank facial expression. Zombie epidemic is impossible and Zombie movies epidemic is pointless for quite some time. Longer than the first draft (of many, we learn) of world war z.While Gerry lane (Brad Pitt in a reasonable but unmemorable performance) prepares pancakes for his kids as the ex-UN officer-turned-homemaker that he is, a growing army of the undead is spreading through every city. Brad is called from retirement to try and find a cure. After a brief and rather cryptic meeting with a virologist, Brad heads to Jerusalem to examine close hand the solution they effectively devised against the Zombies. As an Israeli, I was surprised not only by the fact that the Israelis actually solved a problem but also from the visions of unity between Israelis and Arabs. In one scene, Arabs and Israelis were standing and singing peace songs in unison. Maybe such an eminent threat will make us Israelis and Arabs set aside our differences and unite us all as one family but it definitely won't turn us into the Von-Trapp family.Gerry (the formerly retired UN officer) has little time to dwell on the petty. After a brief session with a Mossad official with the least Israeli name anyone can think of and after roaming in in a city that never won the ""Jerusalem lookalike"" contest ,He continues with a wounded female Israeli soldier named ""Segen"" (Hebrew for ""Lieutenant"") to the last resort to cure the world of this endemic. Some of you might think I'm a little light handed when it comes to quotation marks but I assure you there is no one named ""Segen"", the Jerusalem in the movie has very little resemblance to the real Jerusalem and the entire premise and plot evolution seem like one big quotation mark that's not worth quoting.The authenticity problems with the Jerusalem of WWZ is meaningless to the 99.99% of the people who, in my estimate, have never set foot in it. The thin plot and the flatness of all characters but Pitt's are the movies major flaw and when the sluggish pacing (especially during the last half hour) builds in for the big climax, it's poorly executed and the pieces of the story are rashly held with a duct tape dialog. The flawed writing is evident by the realization that if the (few) surviving characters would have fallen victim to the epidemic, it wouldn't have mattered one bit to the story's appeal. I'll go the extra mile and wildly speculate that the extensive rewrites made the problem even worse.I think the movie's biggest problem is that it misses its mark. If it's meant to be a Zombie movie with a hidden criticism of human ineptness, it loses to the masterful ""28 days later"", if it's a one man journey in a dystopian apocalypse movie than it waddles behind ""I am legend"".I have seen these aforementioned movies many times and I assure you I have no plan to see WWZ another time. The only good reason to see this movie is the opportunity to write a snide review in which I strongly suggest to Hollywood to bring the zombie movie genre to a final overdue rest.The zombie metaphor, it seems, is undead too.5 out of 10 in my FilmOmeter.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
"Its like the Pilot Episode of the Walking Dead, magnified!","If the world was run by zombies, are you ready to fight and live your way out? My answer is, I haven't thought about it. Encouraged by his children, Brad Pitt stars in this thriller flick, WORLD WAR Z which deals with marathon trained flesh eaters.A rabies like virus is on the loose and its rapidly affecting humanity. Think of it as a biological warfare gone haywire and as a former UN employee, your previous boss and your conscience is dictating you to save not only your family but the also the world. The plot just revolves there but the transition of the scenes, character development and denouement were well executed enough to let you go through the next hour.And since its a zombie film, the thrill factor lets you scream on your seats or curse the characters on screen. It is like watching the pilot episode of THE WALKING DEAD.Although they did not find the perfect solution and the medical aspects were quite obscure, the ending gives the audience hope that they will eventually discover a better antidote later.

Not a bad experience,"Saw this today. I was looking forward to it because I really enjoyed both the book and the audio book. Author Max Brooks was inspired by The Good War, an oral history of World War II by Studs Terkel.Written ten years after the official end of the zombie war by an agent of the United Nations Postwar Commission, the book is a series of oral interviews with survivors of the global war against zombies.The movie takes place at the beginning of the war as a U.N. investigator attempts to locate Patient Zero. This story is not told in the book, and the ""solution"" postulated by the movie is not, to the best of my recollection, included in the book. But it is a valid theory and a plausible story.I enjoyed the movie and was not disappointed. There wasn't a lot of gore and in the end the victims of the Z-virus were pitiable.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
World War Z Takes Zombies to a New Level,"Brad Pitt has gone from youthful sex symbol to versatile actor and producer. His biggest project to date is this filmic adaptation of Max (Mel's son) Brooks' novel, World War Z, chronicling a massive, worldwide zombie apocalypse. For a subgenre that has ranged from classic horror, (Night of the Living Dead), to science fiction, (Resident Evil), to modern updates, (Dawn of the Dead remake), and parodies, (Zombieland and Shaun of the Dead), this film represents a rare depiction of the zombie invasion as a global, mass annihilation. Previously, these films focused on a small group of survivors (TV's The Walking Dead) with a news blackout and no idea as to the magnitude of the infection. After publicized problems with the screenplay and director Mark Forster's (Monsters Ball, Finding Neverland) rough cut (particularly a climactic battle scene), a new ending was shot, and the result is a remarkably engaging film.Gerry (Brad Pitt) and his wife, Karin (Mireille Enos), ready their two daughters for school and get caught in a traffic jam in downtown Philadelphia. Suddenly all hell breaks loose and panic sets in amid an invasion of zombies who are bent on mindlessly attacking and converting humans into the undead. As cities fall worldwide, the infection spreads exponentially with startling speed as the family flees to Newark for supplies and a lifeline from Gerry's former UN boss, but while the family finds a brief refuge aboard a US Navy ship, Gerry is called into service to find the source of the infection or risk having his family kicked off the ship as non-essential personnel. Tracking down random clues across the globe in such disparate locales as South Korea, Israel, and Wales, the trail for a cause and potential cure proves challenging as time runs out on humanity.In many ways, this film, which shares much in common with pandemic tales as Contagion, Outbreak, and The Andromeda Strain, is more a thriller than horror, and that's not a bad thing. Rather than relying on gross out murders and graphic blood spattered effects, this film looks at the bigger picture without sacrificing the more intimate moments of sheer terror, not an easy balance. Don't let that PG13 rating fool you! Some scenes are suspenseful and agonizing as the threat of zombies is ever present.The film, particularly in the Newark apartment scenes and an unbearable moment of truth at a World Health Organization lab, is like one big funhouse ride where the scares are just around the corner. Other memorable set pieces include the opening pandemonium in Philly, which is well crafted and builds to an alarming level, a walled in city of Jerusalem stunningly challenged by a growing sea of undead, and perhaps the best moment, a horrifying passenger plane flight from hell that starts innocently enough but quickly devolves into an impossible situation.The film takes the scary notion of fast running zombies from 28 Days Later and adds even more lethal traits as in their ability to not only swarm like insects, but to hurl themselves with great ferocity at their intended victims even through car windshields. Their victims aren't devoured as in other films, but rather a bite turns them into more zombies almost instantaneously. They are also real sensitive to sound as Gerry learns at the worst possible moment.What distinguishes this film above most others is its smarts. The script, while written by many hands, still shows an intelligent approach to a devastating crisis, and the dialogue never sounds phony. Further, the film is like one big mystery with nature's clues in full view waiting for Gerry to piece together a solution. Some of the plot points are a bit open ended and push the limits of plausibility, but things move so swiftly and convincingly, that most won't mind.The supporting cast is effective in brief roles with a strong turn by Daniella Kertesz as a soldier. But this is Pitt's show, and he is the right leading man who has the presence and charisma to carry even a zombie film. Being able to improvise and display cool under pressure, he is the ideal savior that the world needs. Perhaps his Gerry is guilty of being too perfect, but he does it so well.(It is amusing to note that Gerry and his family become guardians of an orphaned boy, and one wonders if Angelina Jolie was smiling at the parallels with her and Pitt's real life, nuclear family.)With a mega-budgeted production, the CG effects are a standout especially when creating the hoards of zombies, and there are many effective camera shots with some particularly startling, overhead views. There is also great use of sound effects that add to the visceral chills while the brooding, pulsing music score (Marco Beltrami) complements the tension.A thrill ride from beginning to end, World War Z is a thoroughly entertaining, scary epic that takes the zombie lore and heightens the stakes with an impressive budget and a star turn by an actor/producer at the top of his game.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Well executed but anti-climatic,World War Z starts out with a bang. Barely after introducing the main characters you are caught up in their frantic efforts to escape and survive. The movie does an excellent job of making you care about the characters and their plights and drawing you in to the story and action as a result. The pacing is excellent as the story unfolds in an interesting way.My only complaint is that movie is over quite suddenly and feels very anti-climatic. This is not the ending I expected or even wanted for this film. Although the destination may have been disappointing the journey surely was not so I can genuinely recommend this film.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Outstanding,"Just seen this and my thoughts from the start were Outstanding.A nice revamp on zombie type films with a clever script and lots of good acting. Brad Pitt is excellent from start to finish. The best thing about this film is the fact that nothing is overdone. No action scene is dragged out to long, like man of steel and others have done. And no silly decision making takes part by any of the characters, such as running up stairs instead of using the front door to get away from the bad guy as seen in most horrors.

Rampage of the undead,"A zombie film that entered production hell, very much like a zombie. The film had to be revived with re shoots and a different ending.The result is a modest success even though the film is not without flaws.Pitt with his long ironed hair which must surely be contender for best supporting actor Oscar (the hair that is, not Pitt) plays a former UN troubleshooter who left to raise his kids in New York city.Suddenly an outbreak occurs where people bite each other and soon become zombified with blood-lust.In order to protect his family Pitt with a virologist goes to Korea to locate the outbreak of the source and a possible answer. Well the virologist takes a nasty fall and Pitt ends up in Israel and later Wales where he might have discovered a chink in this worldwide pandemic.World War Z is an adaptation of a popular book but liberties were taken with the adaptation, especially the ending as the original cut of the film was deemed to be too grim.The film has great scenes of panic with zombies on the loose, zombies attacking as a team as in Israel but some of the lines and scenes make you wince with its cheesiness and lapses in logic.This does not mean its terrifically entertaining. The film starts off the blocks with a bang, there are some visceral scenes depending which cut of the film you have seen and it does rack up the tension.It is rather refreshing to see a film being so successful when it had such public post production issues.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Arguably the best zombie film since George A. Romero's classic 'DAWN OF THE DEAD'!,"'WORLD WAR Z': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)'WORLD WAR Z' is probably the best zombie film since George A. Romero's 1978 classic 'DAWN OF THE DEAD', despite it's PG-13 rating (the film should have been rated R but the studio bought a commercial friendly rating for it). Romero was a big influence on the writer of the book it's based on, of the same name, Max Brooks. The book 'World War Z' is a 2006 sequel to Brooks' popular 2003 hit 'The Zombie Survival Guide'. It's a collection of different characters' accounts of a ten year zombie war and what follows. The movie deviates quite a bit from the book and centers on a retired U.N. agent (played by Brad Pitt) that travels around the world looking for a way to stop a zombie apocalypse. It was written by Matthew Michael Carnahan (who also wrote the political thrillers 'STATE OF PLAY', 'LIONS FOR LAMBS' and 'KINGDOM') and J. Michael Straczynski (who's well known for creating the popular sci-fi TV series 'BABYLON 5' and the comic book 'Rising Stars'). Two of the best writers in Hollywood, Drew Goddard and Damon Lindelof (who both wrote over thirty to forty episodes of the immensely popular TV show 'LOST'), rewrote the entire third act of the film. With all that talent attached to writing the script you know you're going to get something good! Marc Forster (director of 'MONSTER'S BALL', 'FINDING NEVERLAND', 'STRANGER THAN FICTION' and the 2008 Bond film 'QUANTUM OF SOLACE') directed the film. The result is nothing short of spectacular!Pitt plays Gerry Lane, a retired U.N. investigator who is now a stay-at-home dad as the film opens. He's stuck in traffic in Philadelphia one day, with his wife Karen (Mireille Enos) and two daughters (Abigail Hargrove and Sterling Jerins), when the world suffers a zombie outbreak. Gerry and his family survive the night, on the run, and make it on to a roof top where they're rescued by Gerry's former employers. He's then asked to go back to work and travel the world looking for a way to stop the zombie pandemic before it wipes out all life on the planet. Realizing his family won't survive if he refuses Gerry reluctantly complies.The film is a masterpiece of the horror genre. It's also the first zombie film to take it's subject matter this seriously (since maybe Romero's early work) and portrays it (for the most part) realistically. Some fans of the book hate that it strays so far from it's source material but if you look at it just as a film inspired by a book (rather than the book in movie form) you should be able to enjoy it more. Even the author, Brooks, said Stracynski's last draft of the script was ""amazing"" and 'Aint it Cool News' claimed the film could have many arguing ""whether or not a zombie movie qualifies as 'Best Picture' material""! I doubt it will be nominated for best picture but I agree it should. It's taken the horror genre, and zombie films in general, to new heights in respectable filmmaking. The filmmakers compare it to the 'Bourne' movies but I think it's even better. It works as a political thriller, an exhilarating action film and a creepy and disturbing monster movie. Pitt makes a great 'thinking man's action hero'; he rarely ever fights or uses a gun but instead thinks his way through every situation. All of the characters are intriguing and there's great cameos from the likes of David Morse and Matthew Fox (in a very small part). The film is full of great suspense, fast paced action, spectacular visuals and cool zombie moments (and the zombies look and act great). Forster's directing is more than adequate but once again it's the four grade A writers that really make the film work. It's full of good plot development and amazingly clever dialogue (with lines like ""Mother Nature is a serial killer""). The movie should make George A. Romero proud.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGWqCYOhcJs",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"

Z For Zombies. A for Stars,"Saw the trailer at the Man of Steel's premier last week. It WHOA-ed me enough to buy the tickets 2 days before the screening. World War Z is the mother of virus-spreading-zombie film! Less than 5 minutes after the intro credits, the action already begins. No slow introduction, no rubbish talks.From New York streets to New Jersey apartment to Pyeongtaek military camp to Jerusalem fortress to Belarusian airplane to Welsh WHO facility, trust me, you will be GLUED to the screen, because the action are non- stop. Quoting my pal Fairuz, ""there's no resting while watching this film"". Your adrenaline rushes, anticipating and dreading of what would happen next.Salute to Brad Pitt for giving splendid performance as the (retired) UN- special-officer. The Pepsi-drinking scene is quite cool. After surviving the holocaust in the US soil, he's given the task to protect a promising-young virologist Dr. Fassbach in searching for the cure, the vaccine of the pandemic.Little did they know, what awaits them in South Korea. Didn't recognize any of the other cast, except for the WHO doctor, whom triggered my usual ""who the heck is this dude/chick? So darn familiar!"" sense. Later found out that he acted in Angels & Demons and Narnia.The zombies look real enough. Have the standard of rabies-infected- people like in Rec. They're vicious and fast and intelligent too. They react to something and they refuse to something. I won't spoil that.But I just gotta say this: the piling up to overcome tall fences is pretty sickening! I never thought Zombies could that. That's why I said, the Zombies in WWZ are smarter, than their cousins in Resident Evil or Dawn of the Dead.World War Z is like the fusion of Contagion, 28 Days Later, Dredd, Rec and Resident Evil.

World War Z is more about the visuals than the characters.,"With the summer blockbuster movie season in the swing, audiences expect all the usual trappings that come along with such; i.e huge explosions and no plot. That's what you'll get with World War Z, a film that is flash and substance, cranked to insane levels with bucket loads of CGI and little regards for smooth and cohesive narrative which could've elevated it beyond just action and special effects.I'm not familiar with the original novel on which this film is based, but from the looks of it, it seems to be aimed at only a specific demographic; that is those that crave mindless action above all else. There's nothing wrong with that, but I suppose those(like me) that want story and character development ALONG with action, will be disappointed as World War Z, to them, only resembles the original novel IN NAME ONLY. Superficial performances from some of the lead characters, save for Brad Pitt, dull the experience immensely as a film of this caliber demands hard, vicious violence and tense, frightening atmosphere, that, unfortunately enough, are sparsely sprinkled about in this film. There's no doubt that some of the film's action scenes are impressive, but one gets the feeling that because of it's PG-13 rating, a bane of zombie flicks, are so tame that to call it a TRUE zombie flick would be an act of blasphemous disservice. Ultimately, it would seem that with so many rewrites to the script and filming of scenes, it clearly became a case of ""too many cooks spoiling the broth"".The potential for something like this to be greater than the sum of it's parts were here, but the execution of such potential into something natural, organic, and emotionally and intellectually engaging, falls equally and devastatingly flat on it's cinematic ass. World War Z once again proves the inept and ADD-riddled filmmaking process of Hollywood is once again, cropping up and utterly ruining a film's potential to be something great. I'm not sure if I want to see this film again; I'll wait for the director's cut. IF indeed such A CUT exists, then I suspect it would be an overall improvement over the theatrical release, but since it's too early in the game for such a thing, I've no choice but to conclude that World War Z, ultimately, pales in comparison to it's much superior counterparts ""28 Days Later"" ""Night of the Living Dead"" ""The Walking Dead"" and to a certain extent, even the bloody yet comedic romp ""Night of the Comet"" and other notable films of this tried-and-true genre. If a sequel is made and judging by the latest box-office numbers, I don't fail to see why. Only ardent, die-hard fans can hope for the next film that features more blood and guts, more heroism, and most importantly, more character development.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"

Still waiting for my World War.,"Haven not read the book World War Z was entirely new territory for me and so the unfaithfulness to the book, like the majority of the audience for this film eluded me. So, I was fully open to the story Forster had created to draw in views like me and to some extent he succeeded. I really enjoyed the tension throughout, the visual effects such as the zombies using each other to climb over wall and the story which unlike some other zombie films did not rely on gore to keep the audience entertained. However, the film felt somewhat anticlimactic which is a shame because the jump into action at the beginning of the film showed real potential and I don't think that the characters were developed enough, you knew Gerry Lane was the hero but he's charter had no complexity. They have suggested that World War Z will have a sequel is this is true this would be a film I would be very interested in seeing because maybe this film did not reach it's full potential but I feel it has set up a storey which could create a sequel which could very well live up to it's title World War Z as I really want to see a War with these zombies.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"

On the other hand, the virus spreads ultra quickly. This was not a good idea from my point of view. A whole city gets sick in a few seconds. Acting was not that great I am afraid. A lot of characters just pop up and than turn into a zombie. The directing and story telling was not that great either. I believe the biggest success of the movie was the good advertising.

Not as bad as people say,"This movie is not as bad as people say it is, it's only that people were expecting another thing completely. The movie is way different from the book, where the book is more of a thriller filled with suspense and investigative work, the movie is an action film with some scares here and there. But that was very clear from the trailers.However, the movie tries to explain the reason behind the pandemic, which most zombie movies won't even bother to do, and you get to root for humanity, whereas movies such as Resident Evil makes you root for the main character only.So maybe I won't go watch it again, but as far as 2013 goes, this is one of the best blockbusters of the year.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"

Great Zombie Flick!,"If are a fan of the zombie genre, please ignore all the negative reviews for this film. World War Z had me on the edge of my seat from start to finish and I thought it was quite a different take on the genre. Although the film does steer away from the book of the same title, I found myself thoroughly entertained. Contrary to other opinion, I thought Brad Pitt played a terrific role and being a big fan of ""The Killing"" series, I enjoyed watching Mireille Enos as Brad's wife. She is a brilliant actress and I'm sure we'll be seeing more of her in future film and TV roles.Simply put, if you want heart-thumping, fast-paced zombie action then give this a go and I'm certain you won't be disappointed.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
A Race Against Time; an intriguing action movie,"This movie is about Gerry, a former UN investigator who was sent to investigate the origin of a deadly virus and its cure against time. The movie covers the crisis all over the world caused by the virus, Gerry and his family's survival, and his journey all over the world.The storyline is promising, as the protagonist needs to race against time to solve the world crisis. The movie starts with Gerry and his family trying to survive the zombie outbreak for 30 minutes, and he gets the opportunity to save his family by working back for the UN. The movie is thrilling as the whole civilization collapses in a day.The story gets intriguing as Gerry investigates the origin of the virus and gets led to the next place, where he finds where he can make a cure. The emotions were written enough for Gerry to find the cure and save his family and people alive in the world. The realisation of Gerry with the information he got also sets the third act well. In the climax, Gerry risking his life is a logical mistake because the answer is in the previous scene. To prove Gerry's theory on cure, they could have done better.The screenplay was written well to make a good action thriller movie. Brad Pitt did justice to his character. The chase scene and the flight wreck scene were also made good. The VFX was also good at animating the zombies climbing on the wall as a herd. The music played a vital role in this movie as it elevated the rush in scenes.In conclusion, I loved this movie. It has enough story to make an action-genre movie. I suggest this movie to fellow action genre lovers.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
"Great book, but the movie didn't cam close to it. But it was still good","I thought that the team will be able to feel and recognize the essence of this great work and offer us a different, but yet equally exciting and frightening story. In this segment, the story of the movie is very predictable. We know already exactly in advance that wherever Pitt lands there will be in a few seconds' a thousand billion zombies and explosions. What I found unbelievable in the film is that Forster decided to take out a few key moments. I recommend ""World War Z"" to all those who have not read the novel, and to the book lovers I suggest that they should skip the movie. Even Though, this is an exciting and dynamic movie and actually has several moments that raise a lot of adrenaline in the blood.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Good Movie for Action,"World War Z is an entertaining action movie that's well worth a watch. It's highly engaging, with a straightforward story that makes it clear why characters are making certain choices-or avoiding others. However, some of the characters' decisions feel frustratingly dumb, seemingly added just to create tension.While their mistakes mostly feel human, there are moments where it stretches believability. That said, I found the explanation of immunity to the zombie virus particularly interesting-it's a unique take compared to other films in the genre. The hopeful ending is also a nice touch, setting it apart from the usual bleak tone of zombie movies. It's nothing like the book, but in this case, that's not necessarily a bad thing.Overall: A good action flick

World War Z - A good thriller that satisfies,"I went to watch World War Z with quite some interest and obviously, its not like you get zombie apocalypse movies every now and then... The movie was frankly.. an excellent one. The movie wastes no time in bringing up the main plot of the story and right from the first minute, each and everything is part of it. The thing I liked most about this film is that it delivered everything that it was supposed to, beside a few flaws, the plot was a good one accompanied by a cast that were extremely efficient. Brad Pitt alone took the movie to a greater height with his superb acting. The Zombies were quite well-designed and along with their ideal casualness earned their silly antics laughter from the audience and at the same time, some horror. The story revolves around the idea of a plague spreading 'round the globe which infects people and makes the infected people zombie-like. Also, anyone getting bitten by them were likely to turn like them as well. Gerry(Pitt) and his family narrowly escapes the infected denizens of the New York before getting rescued, now Gerry out of his duty and love for his family, agrees to go on a wild trip to find out more about the disease and whether it has a cure. The plot as I said was a good one, the soundtrack's accompanying the movie well, cast superb, graphics fantastic, It sure did have a few flaws though namely not naming the cause of the disease or about how it actually began, but it can be easily looked over if you look on the positive sides. Though there are some other good movies out there such as Man of Steel, World War Z belongs to a completely different category and along with it's elegance singles out the others, so even if you have no idea how zombies look, you would still love the suspense of this film. All in all, World War Z is a great movie and you would definitely enjoy seeing it even if you are not much of a fan of Zombies, the 3-D effects are good in this one, But 2-D went just fine enough for me. So, in case you were wondering to watch it or not, Do so, you will not regret it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Pandemic film features the latest in zombie evolution,"Zombies have shown remarkable evolution since the 1940's, when they had to be dead, buried and then summoned by a voodoo priest. In the 1970's they evolved the bite, a faster way to spread whatever it is that makes the victims turn to zombies as well. By 2000's zombies were getting faster than they used to be. And in World War Z, dead zombies easily outrun most people who are alive, underlining the inherent absurdity of the living dead concept. Many reviewers here were disappointed, because they expected to see ""real zombies"" and what they saw was the wrong kind. I really don't know what to say to that kind of logic or lack of one. But what I saw was a pandemic film with humans acting as zombie-like delivery systems for the unknown pathogen. The concept is familiar from 28 Days. In Z, the creatures do not bother to actually die, turning from healthy humans to zombies instantly. World War Z turns out to be a pandemic action film seen from the viewpoint of one individual who never hesitates and never gives up. Brad Pitt just keeps on going, just like his adversaries the zombies do. As an actor he pulls it off well. I really felt for his character, going from one losing situation to the next, although many obviously did not. The single hero viewpoint chosen means that the film has little to do with the novel of the same name. If you want the book, go ahead and read it. One has to accept some plot holes in a fantasy film of this kind to keep the action and suspense going. For me, the combination in this respect was just right. The solution in the end is believable in the framework of the film, based on the supposition that it is the pathogen that controls the zombie and uses it's senses. It took me by surprise however. This is an industrial film and as such uses a lot of safe and proved solutions but there are enough new twists to warrant seven stars. Lack of gore was for me a definitely positive factor, since in terms of the plot there was no need for any.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
The Zombie version of Contagion,"""Life as we know it is coming to an end in 90 days. It's on us to change that.""Marc Foster is a very versatile director. I loved his work in Finding Neverland, an imaginative drama. He's also directed The Kite Runner, Monster's Ball, Quantum of Solace, and Machine Gun Preacher. He has worked with very different genres and for the most part I have really enjoyed his films. World War Z was no exception, and he proves now that he can make a great suspenseful thriller. I was at the edge of my seat for the most part of the film and there were several heart pumping moments. I hadn't had so much fun in the movies for a while. Of course the film has its flaws, but I was highly entertained with this Summer blockbuster starring Brad Pitt who once again single handedly carries the film. The film reminded me in some ways of Soderbergh's Contagion although this film is more linear and straightforward focusing on one character. It isn't your typical horror zombie film where you have a lot of blood and gore everywhere. In this film most of the frightening scenes take place without showing much. I thinks this is much more effective in a movie than focusing the attention on the gore. O was really pleased with the film. I have to admit I had never heard about the novel which was written by Max Brooks, but I have heard this film is only loosely based on it and has taken several screenplay liberties. The screenwriters did a decent job with the story, but the real fun was watching the fast paced zombies chasing after Brad Pitt.The film centers on Brad Pitt's character, Gerry Lane, a former UN investigator who has decided to retire and spend the rest of his life serving pancakes for his wife, Karin (Mireille Enos), and two daughters back home. Everything changes when a strange viral epidemic begins to spread very quickly affecting every human being and turning them into zombies in question of seconds. These zombies aren't your typical slow paced zombies, they actually move pretty fast and aren't so dumb. Thierry Umutoni (Fana Mokoena), Gerry's former boss at the UN, calls him back for duty considering the urgency of the situation. Apparently Gerry was one of their best investigators and so they ask him to try to locate where the virus may have initiated in order to find some sort of vaccine to treat the disease and stop it from spreading before it is too late. This investigation takes Gerry across the globe, beginning at South Korea, then Israel, and finally ending up in Nova Scotia. Along the way he encounters several secondary characters that give him insight as to where the disease might have begun. A former Israel military officer named Segen (Daniella Kertesz) joins Gerry in his pursuit.The film is packed with suspense and thrills and will have you at the edge of your seat from the very beginning. It probably begins stronger than how it ends, but it still is a great experience. I loved every second of this film and was completely entertained despite the lack of character development and the lack of any explanation whatsoever as to how the disease may have begun. Marc Foster succeeds in creating a suspenseful and gripping movie and despite all the production problems they seemed to be experiencing during filming, the film still ended up looking great and surpassed my expectations tremendously. Don't expect it to be a gory zombie film and you will be very pleased with this exhilarating film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
The Ben-Hur of zombie movies,"There is a lot of info, and complaints, about the ending of this film being different than the book, gentler than the book, etc., etc. Well, I didn't read the book and have nothing to compare it to, but I do think the ending is the worst part of this. It's just, so, um, lazy, schmaltzy or something. The first half hour or so of this zombie movie is really terrific and there is tons of action after that including a really terrific sequence on a plane, but it gets a teeny bit tiresome after a while with a tad too much family drama, though surely the majority won't bore you. There are some talented people in this, but none of them really stand out in any special way. The best, thankfully, is the lead, Brad Pitt with an awful hairdo, but even he is not all that interesting.

"Mindless Action and PG-13 Zombies; Weak, but Serviceable","WORLD WAR Z was everything I expected from director Marc Forster, the man behind QUANTUM OF SOLACE. It's an action-centric PG-13 zombie film with a major actor in the foreground to draw in mainstream audiences for a guaranteed box office success. I've heard nothing but awesome buzz about the novel from Max Brooks that loans the movie its title (and apparently not much else) but I've not had a chance to read it before seeing the movie. I suppose this might've helped me keep a more unbiased perspective when watching it, since I wouldn't spend the movie grumbling about all the wasted potential in the source material. Nope, instead I had my own series of gripes with the film. Primarily, I hated that the movie seemed more interested in crafting major action sequence after major action sequence than actually creating an engaging plot. I wouldn't go so far as to call WORLD WAR Z a bad movie, but it's certainly the epitome of mindless summer entertainment. The movie follows former U.N. investigator Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt) as he and his family struggle to survive once the zombie apocalypse erupts across the world. Once his family is secured on a naval vessel, Lane is roped into joining an investigation into the origins of the zombie epidemic. Lane jets off to start his investigation in South Korea and will follow the trail around the globe in hopes of finding the source and, maybe, a cure or vaccine to save the planet from collapsing under the scourge of the undead.Let's start with a minor quibble. What sort of fun can you expect from a PG-13 zombie film? Seriously. Zombies are rotting, shambling undead with a hunger for human flesh. But WORLD WAR Z spares us any real violence or gore associated with the zombie genre, instead giving us swarms of indistinguishable zombies and bursts of mostly bloodless gunfire. The zombies in the film are (mostly) your typical fast-sprinting, growling beasts. Some discoloration of the skin and a bit of blood around the mouth, with the occasional bit of facial deterioration when you're lucky enough to see one up close. No disembowelments or half- mangled zombies with their insides out. It's all toned down to fit into its more audience friendly PG-13 rating. The zombies are treated as more of a global virus, swarming and climbing over obstacles in tidal waves of faceless monsters. Their shot and blown up without any payoff and the victims are never more than tackled and vaguely munched on, convulsing on the ground before jumping up to join the masses. I don't know. Maybe I'm just old- fashioned but I miss when zombies weren't yowling athletes who run down their prey at super speeds. This leads into my next major problem with WORLD WAR ZThis movie is all about the massive action sequences. Plot takes a back seat to elaborate action scenes on a global scale. As if to make sure you know what you're in for, the movie gives you little to no time to introduce its characters. We get five minutes of a family pancake breakfast with Gerry, his wife, and their two daughters before we're thrown right in to the first major action scene: the fall of Philadelphia. From then on, we get bits of character development to fill the quiet moments between explosive action scenes as Gerry begins his globetrotting mission. The scenes themselves are pretty impressive. I'm not going to deny that. When the zombies invade Jerusalem, it's a pretty awesome sight; and the initial chaos in Philadelphia sets the tone for the film pretty effectively. My problem isn't with the action or its execution; it's that it's the main focus of the movie. Just as with QUANTUM OF SOLACE, the plot here is nothing but filler for when people aren't running from zombies or slaughtering them by the dozen. The best part of the whole movie (for me) was the final act when Lane arrives at a World Health Organization center in Wales where the bombastic action steps aside and allows for some quiet suspense. The Wales portion of the film is exactly the sort of stuff I love in a zombie movie. Taut and thrilling with our main character stalking through a facility trying to avoid confrontation as opposed to just running in, guns blazing. I thought the final resolution was a nice touch. Lane's major discovery that is meant to turn the tide of the war against the zombies is an interesting development, but I wonder how it took so long for someone to formulate that theory. Someone had to have noticed it before Lane had his realization so late into the zombie war. Whatever. Thoughtful storytelling isn't exactly this movie's strongest point.WORLD WAR Z is a perfect example of mindless summer action. Leave your brain at the door when you settle in for this one and try to find fun in all the gunfire and zombie hordes. You won't want to try and think about this one too hard. Kudos to Brad Pitt for his role in the film. Pitt's a great actor and he brings some gravitas to a genre that doesn't often see big name stars in the cast. He does the best he can with pretty weak material, but he's mostly just running from Point A to Point B while avoiding becoming some zombie's next meal. The visual effects are great and the final act attempts to redeem the movie's otherwise shallow, lazy nature. WORLD WAR Z is far from memorable and I suppose its greatest success was provoking me into reading the novel to see what I've missed.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Generic Bite,"As the title said, World War Z is a zombie apocalyptic blockbuster that travels across the globe. It sounds like an epic turn to the genre, bringing a larger scale which a terrifying apocalypse movie should be. The film is basically based on a book that serves a couple of interesting ideas. Disappointingly, it lacks enough ambition to the concept and enough exploration to its world's condition which results into a somehow smaller and generic Hollywood blockbuster. What remains is a sort of ridiculous experience as typical blockbusters go. But it's ought to tell a better survival story and the film couldn't apply all that.The plot calls for a different take to the genre. It features some smart innovations about the viruses, but the execution is more like the opposite. The film isn't quite concern on what's going on around the world other than the risks of the protagonist. Instead of an engaging adventure, it's an expanded version of a cliché zombie thriller. A band of random survivors fighting off and running away from the monsters until they decided to look for a cure. To that point, it instantly becomes a totally generic survival movie. The film can still work for its scale if the journey is well developed, but the storytelling is painfully straightforward and isn't interested for decent characterization and exposition.It's more focused on the action and suspense which are the only great parts of the film. It becomes more and more crazy, from usual running zombies until they climb to ridiculous heights by forming a swarm and throwing their own bodies together. The special effects look fine enough to give these creeps some ridiculous movements. The performances at least made the non-action scenes quite entertaining.World War Z is somewhat gripping, but it's really cluttered with generic zombie movie plot points. It's basically like 28 Weeks Later then ends becoming a less ludicrous Resident Evil. It could have been bigger than what the film has shown, but I guess they don't have anymore stories to tell. People might find it a little fun by the visuals, camp, and the performances. In the end, it's going to be difficult to remember all of that. It's amazing how a great source material became a film that is so uninspired. Now it's just plainly about zombies invading the whole world. And just like most blockbusters today, World War Z is fond for explosions and thrills, and nothing else.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
"Not that bad, but a perfect example of hollywoods horrible film standards.","I'm not going to start talking about ""the old days"", mainly because I am not nearly old enough to be around back then, but Hollywood can't get anything right nowadays. First off, I actually saw this before I read the book, and now I have read the book and realized they left out all the book's key elements: While the book was shockingly graphic and very violent, with thousands of people being killed, this film has practically no blood, even the unrated version could have passed as PG-13 like 15 years ago! I'm not just mad because it's bloodless, but because a movie about most of the world being wiped out and murdered, probably would have some blood, but no- none during attacks and none on the streets. The best blood we get is on a few of the zombies. The book had details on battles, fake cures, safe houses, effective weapons, and global impact. The film features the global impact, and nothing else. It's very frustrating because the book is a recipe for the perfect zombie film- just remove the interview style and you've got the base for one of the best zombie films ever made. I'm not trying to tell you that you will not be entertained or scared, because you will, but that this is not for someone expecting a zombie flick. This is much more a fast-paced action movie (like every film now that's not a comedy or a romance/drama). It's just a great example of Hollywood's way of using the same plot and same watered down rating for every movie until they get lucky and actually make something successful or decent. On the bright side, World war Z does include some breathtaking scenes of the zombie takeover, and an old school ending, but just don't expect The walking dead or Dawn of the dead, or any other real zombie film/show, or you will be disappointed. Just enjoy the ride.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Zombie movie with a difference... But still a zombie movie,"In general, I am not much into science fiction where villains are not aware of their cruelty, but the names related to the movie (Forster, Brooks, Carnahan, Pitt) let me believe that I would see not a trivial zombie movie focusing on blood, shootings and related smutty shouts... To a large extent, I was right: zombies are not prevailing and often not even visible, there are versatile places of action, and the protagonist's activities are supported by high-minded goals (sometimes the latter is stressed too much, however).Brad Pitt (as Garry Lane) is pleasant as usual, but the whole movie is too focused around his character, and there are only a few memorable supporting actors - e.g. David Morse and Peter Capaldi. Proceeding from the logic of events, the presence of Lane's family is superfluous; so are some story lines.Nevertheless, skillful directing and big budget (different locations, mass scenes, digital effects) have helped to create a smoothly running script, with some unexpected twists and expected ending.

'World War Z' is a thrilling zombie epic that provides plenty of adventure despite suffering from a simplistic episodic structure and zero character development.,"Zombies have become the 'it' monster of our generation. Forget the vampire and werewolf antics of the 'Twilight' films and its imitators; they don't have squat on a cultural phenomenon that echoes societies contemporary concerns regarding social unrest, anarchy and the complete loss of social order. Sound like I am thinking too much into it? Think again. Since George Romero single handedly invented the whole genre with the release of 'The Night of the Living Dead' in 1968, this is a genre, like a sharp sci-fi film, that can provide a fabulous basis for social commentary. 'Night of the Living Dead' was concerning race relations in the 60's, 'Dawn of the Dead'; a scathing remark on consumerism and 'Land of the Dead'; an examination of Bush era politics and class divide. You would be surprised how the mindless consumption of human remains by the undead is such an effective method of philosophical observation.George Romero knew this with those aforementioned films and so does Max Brooks. This is a name that has become synonymous with zombie enthusiasts, having written the well-received zombie novels 'Zombie Survival Guide' and 'World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War'. This is where the movie review starts to come in. The makers of this film adaptation did not seem to agree with what Romero and Brooks knew. They have removed the political and social elements present in the book and made it more of a straightforward action thriller.'Quantum of Solace' director Marc Forster gets the job of managing the chaos. Not just on screen, but behind the cameras as well. Or so the rumour goes. Even so, rumours or not, 'World War Z' never feels like a film which had a turbulent production; despite an episodic structure that lacked a certain sophistication in the writing department. If you had your cynical hat on, you could very easily see it as Brad Pitt rather unimaginatively going from A to B to C while evading the hungry dead. Forster directs 'World War Z' in a much more comprehensible style than the dire 'Quantum of Solace' and he never allows the film to slow down for a second. Within 10 minutes, zombies are swarming cities and Brad Pitt has no choice but to travel the globe in search for the origin of the virus; with the hopes of finding a cure. We go on an exotic world tour to many exciting locations such as Philadelphia, New York, Jerusalem andCardiff? Yep, unusually but quite entertainingly un-climatic, the finale of the film does in fact take place in no other than Wales; where Peter Capaldi, in a piece of poetic coincidence, plays a character credited as W.H.O Doctor.Horror enthusiasts and B-movie genre geeks were the only people who ever saw zombie movies and anyone who appreciates the films of Romero will understand how far the genre has come. It's taken as long as one of the undead for the genre to be picked up by the mainstream; but here we are. It has become so popular and mainstream that Brad Pitt stars in one! – one of the biggest stars in the world.This induction into the mainstream ethos has not rendered the genre unchanged. The most significant modification has been the introduction of what can be only known as ""running zombies"". There are Romero zombies and the sprinting 'Dawn of the Dead' remake zombies. 'World War Z' takes the running zombie craze onto a whole new level. It would be a mistake to think these things were dead. They move faster than anything that has a heartbeat and have a prolific predisposition to rugby tackle anything in sight. Including walls. They're unlike any zombies seen on your screen before and may actually have you soiling yourself in their sheer ruthlessness.With the film trying to appeal to a wide audience, there is a deplorably limited use of blood. This does not work in the context of a zombie film. Gore goes with the territory. 'World War Z' is essentially zombies for dummies and anyone who knows the genre will feel that. Nevertheless, this is not for us sad fans, it is for the younger generation and the people who are going the cinema to watch 'Avengers Assemble'.Therefore, inevitably, with modern technological developments and current cinemagoer tastes, we get CGI zombie hordes. The CGI is perceptible more than it should be but the effect of seeing an ant like colony of zombies invade a walled city makes you appreciate the tools in which it was made possible. There is some genuine shock factor and unique surprises in store. The invasion of Jerusalem being at the forefront of my mind. Us zombie fanboys have always dreamed of seeing a sequence like this.The film is a missed opportunity for something with real bite, instead of a project that has a bit of chomp and limited flesh. At it's core, this is the American hero saving the world story again, but if you can get past that cliché sentiment; 'World War Z' can provide you with the perfect mix of thrills and excitement.

Decent,"Review By Kamal KThis movie is far from decent and i enjoyed it. Its not really different from any other zombie films. This movie is very fasted paced and the zombie outbreak starts in the first 5 minutes, so i wished i got to know a little bit more about the character before the zombie outbreak. A problem i have is that the zombie dont really feel like zombies. They needed to act more like them and needed more blood on them and that leads to another problem. If your gonna make a zombie movie you need to make it rated r. The was some moments with intense blood splatter which i thought was cool but there wasn't enough. Most of the zombies die off screen and we dont get to see the blood and the aftermath of the kills. Brad Pitt was a good choice and did a good job. The movie wasn't scary yet it relied on action more than blood and scares. Definitely one of if not the best zombie movies ive seen so far and i would see it again in the future if i would like to.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Solid summer blockbuster,"Like most people, I heard all the horror stories about the PG-13 rating, the script, the bloated budget, and the last minute re-edit of the third act. Then I read a couple of the scathing reviews from people who saw the movie before it's US release. All I can say is people need to take themselves a little less seriously. All the things that people were complaining about just seemed like nitpicky hater-talk. I feel like a lot of people pre-judged this movie based on the budget and showed up just to pick it apart. Spoiler alert: it ain't Citizen Kane. It's a summer action movie, and a pretty good one at that. No more, no less.

"Such a pity, could have been great","It's a good movie, but there was so much potential to exploit!
The action is amazing, I can't deny it. The scene of Jerusalem's wall is incredible. Visually it's great and the CGI is pretty good.
However the rest of the film is completely uneven. Dialogs can be either very interesting and thoughtful or completely dumb when Brad Pitt is with his family.
Brad's not in it for this movie. He acts more like a slug than a soldier in my opinion. One of his worst performances (does not make it awful, we are talking about Brad Pitt).
There is also no character arc or development in the movie. Brad is just a retired dude working his ass off to save his family but you don't learn anything deeper about it, except something about his previous job. Characterization almost as weak as the zombies...
The plot is what it is: a mixed bag of both good and bad ideas with a strong intro and ending but quite a mess in the middle since you follow a character with no particularity whatsoever.
Entertaining, yes! Enjoyable, yes! A wasted potential, yes again. This movie however shows some unique scenes in a movie of the genre and I personally do not regret watching it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
What was even the point of buying the rights to the book???,"If they had just acted out the book with sock puppets made by 5-year- olds and filmed it on a 6 year old camera phone, it would have at least had the redeeming quality of having a solid plot.Now, I have seen some terrible book to movie adaptations. In some cases it was because the scope of the book just couldn't translate to film. For most others, it was because the producers wanted to do their own thing and didn't care about honoring the story they were deriving their movie from.This is the second case, only a thousand times worse. The movie has so little to do with the book there is literally ZERO justification in using the same title or Paramount owning the rights. And then even besides that, the story they pulled out of their asses is terrible on its own!I could tell the movie was going to diverge from the book from the trailers, but I didn't expect it to be so offensively full of plot holes and unjustified character choices. All of the action, conflict, and tension was derived from idiotic mistakes on the parts of the humans rather than peril from the zombies. The resolution was not only ridiculous and silly conceptually, but also totally unnecessary. You know what is guaranteed to ruin an apocalypse movie? A RESOLUTION. Granted, even without that, there was really no saving this film. The action sequences are sudden and unjustified, the CGI looks like it's from a 2003 video game, and the ""zombie"" concept was trying so hard to be original that it ended up being a total joke.Seriously. They are basically dolphin/chipmunk zombies. It would have been laughable if it hadn't been so annoying.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Ineffectual big budget zombie movie,"World War Z begins with a titles sequence which makes one think the apocalypse can't come soon enough. The references to confirmed cases and the non expertise of various commentators, overheard as we watch images of teeming humanity, carry a certain poignancy in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic. Then again, what happened in our real world pandemic doesn't even approximate what's gonna happen in this movie.Whenever there's several people responsible for a screenplay plus the story, even when it's an adaptation of a novel, my alarm bell starts ringing. And yet, despite being no fan of caves in Yorkshire, I find myself rooting for this Brad Pitt movie, for no accountable reason. Unconvincing family dialogue in the first scene but they're so sweet. And then everything goes berserk, within the first handful of minutes. We don't know why or what, so the movie is coasting on genre recognition and advance publicity. All we know is that the Pitt family is a family who enjoy pancakes, and then there's chaos. Pitt is Gerry and some guy on the phone will 'move mountains' to help him, but we still don't know exactly why? Audience is playing catch up from the get go. The apartment block sequence does smack of 28 Days Later. The dialogue becomes weirdly fragmented. ""I'm scared."" ""How do we know they're coming?"" ""Just a walk in the park."" ""Be ninja quiet."" WWZ begins to feel like a videogame with different zones: street zone, mall zone, apartments block, rooftop, etc. The dialogue has the character of those inbetween levels sequences in videogames. ""These guys are hammers."" ""Mother Nature is a serial killer."" They don't put nothing in for nothing, as dad used to say. The cocky British wunderkind tells crucial info to Pitt's character. Guess what happens to wunderkind in the very next scene? Yup. This is blueprint, by-the-numbers storytelling. The rest of the movie is just we-must-save-Brad-so-he-can-save-us.Some exciting moments, but moments are not enough to make a story.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
"Enough excitement, ample suspense and dashes of lighter moments","A movie at times works as an eye opener to us all in speckled ways. Humans although are assumed to be survivors we don't seem to have our heads screwed on proper in the jaws of adversity. Whilst some of us have what it takes to survive another some will need support to get through a night when the unthinkable happens. Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt) an ex investigator of the United Nations is tested on his survival genes when Marc Fosters zombie pandemic explodes all over Manhattan. Lane and his family are saved a spot on a US battle ship 100 miles off shore on terms that Lane agrees to work once again in co-op with the US Military to find the source of the Contagion. Now that's WORLD WAR Z in a nutshell.WWZ arrives at the zombie party a tad bit behind schedule. DAWN OF THE DEAD, SHAUN OF THE DEAD and WARM BODIES are three titles at the top of my head which makes WWZ just another zombie movie. Clearly WWZ exploded in the box office but why? Was it Brad Pitt or Marc Foster? Obviously Brad Pitt's presence was the lubricant in the well oiled moneymaker WWZ but Foster is The Man if I may say so. Foster changed the game and baffled the audience. The myth of Quality over Quantity is proved wrong. WWZ is all about quantity. The zombies don't walk they bolt. There are lots and lots of them. They don't jump you instead the tackle the spines out of you. They don't eat you whole; they bite you and dash to the next victim turning you in 12 seconds, there is so much happening with CG that the last time I was this impressed was with GLADIATOR. One of favorites of the movie is how Foster creates the fall of Israel this just may get a nod at the awards early next year. While all this takes place there is a subtle question too sent through this Zombie Apocalypse. See if you can pick this up when you watch the movie since it's sidelined with all the action that takes place. Who has a better chance of survival if SARS was not contained back then? A closed society or an open Society?Wrapping up this piece I will admit that WWZ lacked closure to this 116 minute adrenaline rush. It feels a bit like PROMETHEUS. You will look to the left and then to your right and then shrug your shoulders and say ""that's it? What happens next?"" Well there is a silver lining to that since Paramount pictures has confirmed a sequel on the studio drawing boards already with a hopeful return of Brad Pitt.Until such time, this explosion of lots and lots of zombies will have to do for summer 2013. There is enough excitement, ample suspense and dashes of lighter moments that concoct a good movie.TITLE: WORLD WAR Z DIRECTED BY: MARC FOSTER STARRING: BRAD PITT RATED: PG13 RATING: 07/10 RUNTIME: 116 MINUTES",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
World War Z,"""World War Z"" gives plenty of bang for its buck insofar as the already well-crafted scenario reveals some good, rather impressive moments of realism! Because in reality, the success of the film is largely based on these remarkable crowd movements which make this general panic very palpable and therefore at the same time very credible!Of course, Brad Pitt, quite sober for the moment, is also the pillar of the film since he understood and analyzed everything before anyone else thanks to his very specific abilities as a former UN investigator who preferred to be close to his family, but that's what we expect from such a blockbuster!As for the zombies, we manage not to be too frightened because the full horror of the situations is not shown in the smallest details, the director having rather focused on the psychological impact made on men and populations and that is as well so...Some scenes are particularly astonishing like Jerusalem protected by this wall which will prove powerless in the face of the limitless relentlessness of hungry predators or even amusing like the one in the lab where Brad Pitt finds himself facing a researcher who has become a zombie and chattering teeth, a single window separating them!We will not be surprised by the progress of the plot, which is very well written in advance, and even less so by its outcome, which, of course, we could not escape... A recurring theme, but here treated with a minimum of realism to ultimately and paradoxically worry us even more! 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Brad versus zombies,"Since Shaun of the Dead the zombie sub genre has been done to death, in particular ones featuring an apocalypse. Most are cheap crap but here we have Hollywood A lister, Curt Kobain lookalike Brad Pitt saving the human race from the undead. His quest takes him around the globe, which adds some interest, and there is plenty of action. In fact this is as much, if not more, of an action movie as it is a horror. Lots of CGI with mixed results. Pitt delivers a good performance, though his survival abilities must be super human. World War Z is a good enough movie for the masses, but it is very far fetched and too sentimental for my liking. Give me the zombies of Romero or Fulci any day!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Better Than Expected (Haven't Read The Book),"Directed by Marc Foster, who is a very talented director and I always enjoyed his films; Monster's Ball, Finding Neverland, Stranger Than Fiction (so underrated), The Kite Runner, and even Quantum of Solace. So I was automatically looking forward to watch this, especially the fact Brad Pitt was the lead role, however the re-writings worried me, but I'm glad I wasn't disappointed at the end.So the story is zombie apocalypse and Brad Pit as a UN agent is trying to find the source to be able to create the cure. I think the rhythm of is fast, and it shouldn't leave you bored, in fact at some points the intensity of it keeps you on the edge of your sit – I didn't expect that. The performances are fine, Brad Pit never disappoints me, and for me it's interesting to keep seeing James Badge in movies as small roles acting with big stars (Ironman, Flight, and Shame). In my opinion, Foster has done a fine job in directing the movie, first he's made sure his visual effect team has done a proper job, then he's created very interesting events throughout the movie, and then he's made sure the tone is realistic; for example, I hate seeing in movies someone drives with one hand and looks at a different direction and nothing happens, but this doesn't apply here. I believe Foster wants to create the atmosphere of the story as believable as possible for the audience, and I can say he's succeeded. I've seen some reviews saying the ending is not proper, why the hell not? What doesn't make sense to you? I don't understand why some people want everything to be shown and told to them and not use their imagination or their brain to complete the story when every element is given to them. I know they reshoot and recreated the third act, which it hurts a scene, but it is still satisfying to me (I'm also curious about the differences since the author, Max Brooks, liked the first draft of the screenplay). Also the soundtrack is done very well, it's very effective both in the opening montage (which I love it) and in the third act – I'm glad this year composers are doing wonderful jobs for scoring movies.Overall, I recommend this movie and try to enjoy it in theaters, if not definitely buy it; I give it 7.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"

Review: World War Z,"Story: I like the story of this movie, it was suspenseful and you can really feel the tension that they are trying to give the audience. My only problem with the story of this movie is that it was like a ""rinse and repeat"" at each scene or at each country the lead character goes to. It plays out like this, they went to this country, it was a dead-end then a new clue arise then they go after that next country, same sh*t happened and it goes on over and over again, it's like listening to an 8 track album on repeat.Having said my problem with the story, I however finds some positives on that negative and that is in each scene in each country, they are upping the ante and they upping the stakes. Each scene just gets better and better and each scene just gets more tense than the previous one whether it'll be in an open space or a remote closely tight space. It was engaging and fun to watch. I also love that they called the undead zombies and they are not referred to as 'walkers' or 'undead' or even 'biters'. Just plain 'ol zombies.Acting: Solid performances from the cast especially Brad Pitt, unfortunately though, the film suffers from minimum character development as it just focused more on Pitt's character. Brad Pitt's character is family man in this movie and his performance can really convince you, his family is his drive and his inspiration towards the success of his mission although if the family had died earlier on in the movie, it will not affect the movie overall, they are just a way for the character to show that he still retains an attachment to this world and someone to call to if he's doing fine or not.As I said, the cast turns in a solid performance despite short screen time and development but what really caught my eye in this movie is the performance of the zombies. It was very convincing and honestly very scary. The twitches when they are transforming and the way they make the bite sounds just makes it much more effective and clearly shows that they are hungry and targeting you. This is the performance for a zombie that I haven't seen in any other form of media.Action/Violence: This film was action-packed on the second half which gives the film a nice shift in tone. As for the violence, it wasn't brutal per se because most of the zombie bitings or eatings happened off-screen or it was shown from a distance. If it was shown though, there was almost no blood present. This is my minor complaint for the violence in this movie, it was a zombie flick, we need some zombie violence, but we didn't get it. I just hope that we'd get an ""Extende/Unrated Cut"" I will definitely check that out.Music: Marco Beltrami was the one responsible for the score in this movie and as I looked at his track record, it's mostly composed of action films and horror films. His score in this movie is no different except for the fact that it is a mixture of both of these and the outcome is really good. It worked really with the movie and the way it plays in the narrative of the movie was good too because it kept up on the tone of the movie.Cinematography: I loved it. It was able to show the grand spectacle of this movie and was able to show how this epidemic had happened globally. But there are three shots that really stood out for me, the first is the transformation of the zombie, it was scary and only glimpses of those shots were shown but it was effective. Second is the pile of zombies just climbing the big wall it was incredible to look at. Lastly is the hallway scene, it was full of tension and one pulse pounding moment.Direction: I'm not a fan of Marc Foster because I've only seen few of his films. I think his best work 'Stranger Than Fiction'. His direction of this movie really surprised me, I like the tone he went for the slow start and the fast-paced tone of the second half. The mixture of drama, action and horror was also good and it worked really well. I also liked how he directed the zombies because like I said before it wasn't like any other and he made them scary again.Overall: I had a good time watching this movie, it completely surpassed my expectations. It was a fun thrill ride that will make you bite on your nails 'cause of all the tension happening on screen. However the film does suffer from repetitive content but each scene gets better and better. This is a great zombie film that i both refreshing and entertaining, I give this one a 4/5.Favorite Line: Andrew Fassbach: Mother Nature is a serial killer. She wants to get caught, she leaves bread crumbs, she leaves clues... Mother nature knows how to disguise her weakness as strength. ----------------------------- Gerry Lane: If you can fight, fight.

Surprised by high reviews. I thought the movie uneven and not very scary,"Brad Pitt's performance was fine and I loved certain scenes and concepts (like the episode in South Korea) but overall I felt the movie was uneven and could have used a better edit. The biggest problem I had was the inclusion of some highly improbably events.The cutbacks to Gerry's family slowed the movie down like speed bumps on a straightaway. I would have been fine with leaving them on the ship and not seeing them again until the end. Their subplot did nothing to progress the film and stopped the action at least twice. His wife's main contribution was to place an ill timed phone call that gets two men killed.At one point Gerry drags a Israeli solider along with him for no apparent reason. Just kind of brings her along where she plays no role in the plot that couldn't be filled by an anonymous extra.His miraculous survival of a plane crash is where my suspension of disbelief gave out. And the fact the crash occurs within wounded- walking distance of their destination didn't help.I'm split on the ""cure"" for the zombie attack. It was unique and clever but Gerry's execution and test of the solution was telegraphed thirty minutes before it happened.I did not jump once in this movie. I was never scared or on the edge of my seat. Some of the action was hard to see in 3D and one of the crucial zombies in the lab was supposed to be scary but ended up being comical, if not stupid.I am shocked to see so many people giving this more than a C.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
"By no means a terrible movie, but nothing really special either","World War Z is slightly above average and that is all there is to it. The movie even plays itself like a slightly above average movie. You can tell a little bit more work went into the camera work, the set designs, and the ideas, however, the movie never does anything bold. You don't see any real character development, any real character interaction, or any emotion from the characters other than ""Oh crap, zooombies (because they are fast)"".The Zombie designs in this movie have some nice make-up and always has standard special effects when up close and personal. Fortunately the movie only relies on CGI when the zombies are doing something a human can't. Other than that, the zombies are mostly just quickly edited to appear moving faster. While this is a personal gripe, I never really liked this type of zombie because it didn't make sense. If the movie is pretending to be realistic, then if your arm or body is blown to bits you will not be moving. It doesn't matter if you are a zombie, if you don't have the muscles or the blood then you will not move. For a movie that is trying to make zombies realistic, they are pretty unrealistic.Probably the greatest thing about this movie is that it actually reuses The 2nd Law: Isolated System multiple times. I almost feel like some of the shots in this movie were made just to fit that tune because the shots literally fit the tune exactly.All in all, there is some decent action and moderately interesting moments here and there, but it isn't anything people will remember as being ""revolutionary"" to how zombies films were made. I Am Legend did a better job with a similar premise.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Zoombies!!!!!!!,"By now, we're all familiar with Zoombies. They're the type of Zombie that runs after you with ferocious fury, as seen in films like 28 Days Later, the Dawn of the Dead remake and most recently, World War Z.Pitt plays a family man and doctor who is handpicked to help save the world from retro rigor morts gone rabid. He joins a team of smart guys on a save-the-world world tour that takes him from the States, to Asia, the Middle East and finally to Europe. The first stop is the East. They arrive in a South Korean airport on a dark stormy night where the only survivors appear to be American. The actors playing the Marines sound like they just played Call of Duty to get a sense of the grunt dialect. Each soldier is endowed with a s***t-happens attitude for good measure. ""God damn it! I'm a Zombie!"" Things take a turn for the worse when the genius doctor accompanying Pitt trips, falls and shoots himself with his own gun. Don't laugh! It's not funny! It's tragic! Can you imagine the phone call to that man's wife? ""Ma'am, I'm sorry to say that your husband is dead."" ""Oh no, did he get killed by Zoombies?"" ""Umm, no.... he kinda tripped and shot himself.""Then it's a visit to the Holy Land only to find that Zoombies are seriously intolerant of religion. However, the whole undead apocalypse event is convenient for Israelis and Palestinians as they can take a break from killing each other and team up to kill anything that goes zoom in the night. Unfortunately, ethnic harmony makes Zoombies more bloodthirsty than ever. When folks start singing, the harmonious levity attracts the horrible herd and they begin climbing over each other just to make it stop.World War Z is a wonderland of wow-inducing action. You'll find yourself jumping, wincing and possibly even vomiting as limbs are lost and corpses get carnivorous. You may even scratch your head as you watch Matthew Fox provide the most painfully obvious example of a performance lost in editing. Whatever the case, you will love the smell of necronoids in the morning and rejoice in the glorious gore as you enter the Zoombie zone.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Thank goodness they didn't follow the book,"The book is pretty entertaining, but because of the style, that being short stories, it is still pretty weak.

I've read about what they originally had and it just sounded like a mess. I also am grateful for the lack of gore in this movie as gore wouldn't make any sense at all for this type of story. Besides massive amounts of gore is over-used and is just a bore now. I am glad the director actually had an imaginative mind and could tell a story using words rather than shock effects.

Book (it),"I haven't read the book, so I can't say how it compares to that (book obviously must have more fleshed out characters and such). I can only say that I was surprised that I liked the movie. And from what I heard it was the most successful movie Brad Pitt has done so far (Box Office wise that is).So while it was only PG-13 in the cinemas (there will be an extended cut available on Disc soon), it still had a few punches to deliver. Mostly emotional but also action wise. While the director wouldn't have been associated with Horror prior to this, he did a really good job conveying the terror and the tension that builds up in a situation that is depicted in the movie. It is pretty straight forward and therefor somewhat predictable I guess. But I thought they would be aiming at another ending.And if you have heard about the history of the movie you know that they actually re-shot 30 minutes. The last 30 minutes of the movie.

"Down in the hole, World War Z hits a double off the wall, just shy of a home run","Despite problems surrounding the film previous to it's release, World War Z, lead by Brad Pitt, became a box office hit and was met with positive reviews from critics. This film definitely deserved them. This film had very good action, a good plot, and very good cast. Brad Pitt returns to stellar form after the mediocre Killing Them Softly. Also David Morse and the rest of the main cast provided good performances. The CGI was pretty good, but there has been better CGI done in other films without a doubt. The score by Marco Beltrami was very good as it had the same feeling as Hans Zimmer's did in Inception. All of the characters had very good chemistry with one another and felt very realistic. Even with all the good in the film, there were also negatives I took away from it. At times the plot feels slightly predictable as I pretty much predicted the entire last 10 minuets of the movie. Also, even though most of the characters were very realistic, they are not given much of a background or much substance except for a few of the characters which obviously involves Brad Pitt's. in the end, I feel that World War Z was a very good movie that fell just short of being great.

A run-of-the-mill but effective zombie/pandemic thriller,"Heading into ""World War Z,"" all expectations need to be tossed and burned. Once you read the book and watch any trailer, it's clear that the Paramount wanted to make a large-scale zombie film and felt more comfortable basing it on established source material than an original story. Hard to blame them, for as well as Max Brooks creates a portrait of war through documentary- like post-war accounts, very little of his novel could be characterized as cinematic.For a total reinterpretation, however, ""World War Z"" manages to be a welcome addition to the worldwide pandemic/zombie genre. The script speaks to the power of many minds being better than one, with Matthew Michael Carnahan (""State of Play""), ""Lost"" writers Drew Goddard (""The Cabin in the Woods"") and Damon Lindelof (""Prometheus"") and a story by J. Michael Straczynski (""Thor""). Director Marc Forster, as well, shows he's a more capable action director than ""Quantum of Solace"" gave him credit for. ""World War Z"" manages to create suspense and intrigue despite being far from the first film about society breaking down at the hands of rabid flesh-eating zombies.Zombies all too often go hand-in-hand with the horror genre, but ""World War Z"" plays out as more of a thriller and a survival film. Brad Pitt's Gerry Lane must work with the government to uncover clues toward a possible cure, and he also must run for his life when things take a quick turn and his or his family's safety is compromised. His quest takes him to South Korea, Jerusalem and Wales.There's little to ""World War Z"" that doesn't meet the eye. It works primarily as an exercise in tension and thrives on its ability to lend a certain freshness to the genre. Although nothing about the film is unfamiliar to any fan of zombie flicks, Forster gives us the sense that we're experiencing it all for the first time, playing off any prior knowledge of zombies we might feel we have, in a sense, in order to keep us on our toes.Although mostly just a gore-less version of ""28 Weeks Later,"" ""World War Z"" manages not to do anything too stupid to insult the genre or draw negative attention to itself. Considering how far it veers from the popular source material, ""World War Z"" was ripe for derision from fans and critics, but its ability to work as a suspenseful thriller manages to save its value as a blockbuster.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Pretty Good,"The Zombies are invading just about everywhere. Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt) a top-notch UN investigator is called out of retirement to stop the invasion.Yeah, I know another Zombie movie as if we don't get enough of them including those on TV too. The only other Zombie movie IMHO that was any good was ZOMBIELAND with Woody Harrelson. But, let's be clear: Zombies do not exist. Right?Actually, this one is pretty good. Yeah, I was surprised too. Hey, Brad Pitt is in it and he doesn't do bad movies. There is a lot of CGI going on for vehicle crashes and hoards of Zombies attacking everything in sight. Gerry's job is to find out what can stop this invasion and he goes to S. Korea where it is believed it all started, to Israel and then to Belarus to the World Health Organization Research Center there.When Zombies are not on screen, the acting by all is very good as is the suspense and tension. Okay, okay, the Zombies were good toofor Zombies. I wouldn't call this scary, but I wouldn't let little children watch.There was one scene where I must have jumped back about 20-feet. No, I can't tell you what scene that was. I want you to jump too. I shouldn't be the only one. See?You don't see any gore except in one scene where a hand is chopped off so that person -who was just bitten - wouldn't turn. Okay, I did cringe some. See, when you watch a movie you have to believe what you see is real (It's only a movie, Bob).How would you end an invasion of Zombies (they don't exist, remember)? Think about it for a minute or even while watching. Gerry Lane comes up with the answer, short term though it is. But, it is very clever. Oh, there are clues along the way and later Gerry puts it all together. Will you see the clues? Huh? (7/10)All in all pretty good for ""another"" Zombie movie.Violence: Yes.

Former United Nations Secretary-General Jerry Lane is seeking help to identify the source of the disease and develop a vaccine.World War Z is Jerry's struggle to overcome all adversity.
This movie was released on 2013 directed by Mark Forster. This is also one of the best zombie movie ever. Around the world, the disease is spreading from infected people to zombies that attack others. It is a threat to nations and to humanity. Jerry Lane, a former UN official who lives with his family, has been asked to join the team to find the source of the disease and ways to prevent it. But Jerry rejects this demand at first, but has to take on the job of relocating his family safely from the infected area. By the time Jerry arrived, the situation had changed in Korea and in Israel, where the disease had been contained. The answer to whether Jerry and the UN team can successfully complete their mission and save the world?!, is presented in two hours by director. Brad Pitt, who plays the central character Jerry Lane.
It was a box office hit.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Decent addition to the genre - go in without expectations,"World War Z is an exciting zombie film that, while it doesn't break new ground in the genre like 28 Days Later, still fares well in terms of entertaining the audience with action sequences and smooth zombie movement.The acting, however, is what makes the film. Brad Pitt gives an understated performance and the supporting cast is excellent, especially Mireille Enos as his wife and Daniella Kertesz as an Israeli soldier.I've read a good number of reviews from people who read the book and found the film disappointing. I have not read the book and did not have expectations as high as that - perhaps that is why I wasn't disappointed. Yes, there were a few weak points in the plot, but on the other hand I found action sequences very well put together, and given the logic of what the Pitt character was thinking, I found the scenes in Wales well designed and quite exciting.So, no, it wasn't up to the level of 28 Days Later, but I thought it was at least as good as 28 Weeks Later, a film that lost its way halfway through.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"

The excellent Zombie-Black-Comedy we've been needing.,"Yeah, I get it, ""This isn't a comedy! Blah-blah-blah!""Well, The thing about it is, This is how it feels by the end. With Brad Pitt spazzing out on a hospital bed screaming ""WHAT DOES IT MEAN?!"" sounding like Nic Cage and a hilarious scene where his wife calls him in the middle of him trying to get past zombies by being quiet. That's not very quiet, huh?There's a lot of unexpected hilarious moments also, like a cop screaming at Brad Pitt's family in a car before he's RAMMED INTO BY A SEMI-TRUCK. WTF? It's excellently darkly comedic in the acting too. There's a lot of over-the-top acting here too. Not as good as Nic Cage, but I mean, Did anyone expect it to be? No, The answer is no.
If we get to the fine details of the acting (what did that mean?), Well, OH BOY. The wife's actress Mireille Enos seems like she's here for fun (she's constantly smiling and sounding happy-go-lucky-go), She doesn't seem like a bad person, It just doesn't work. Maybe we should've got someone else, I dunno, Maybe Jenna Fischer? Sandra Bullock (wait, no)? Julia Roberts (maybe not)? I kinda could see Lena Heady in the role too actually. Any other actress may have been able to pull off the role better, It's just that the direction that Enos decides to go into (her character is pretty stupid too) doesn't really fit the tone, but it certainly fits the character (what I'm saying is, the tone of her acting isn't very great and that fits her character).Brad Pitt is obviously not that bad, but at the same time it kinda makes me wonder, If it wasn't for his company getting the rights for the film, Would he of been in the film? I kinda wish someone else would've been cast. However, Brad Pitt does indeed fit into the film well.If we talk about the comedy again, IT'S EVERYWHERE. A girl gets her hand chopped off and there's no blood! Even with blood, with how random the chop is, it's still hilarious! The soldier characters constantly spout out one-liners that are either so dumb/bad that you can't help but laugh out loud, or so cringe that it makes you chuckle inside.The zombies are so over-the-top that if you don't laugh, I'll question you. The characters, while seeming to be cliche, I don't mind. The cliches kinda work and make the film feel even more like a black-comedy. I can't praise this film enough, It's hilarious. Plus, The whole zombie-twist, Oh boy, It's so dumb that it's hilarious!While this film isn't a so bad it's good film at all and it's just a overall great Dark Comedy, You will either love or hate this film.Maybe you'll freaking hate it, Maybe you'll freaking love it, Whatever you think of it, It's hilarious.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
A Fantastic Opening precedes a thoroughly average film,"World War Z is a fantastic action film. The tension built up during this film is unbelievable, and it kept me on the edge of my seat for the entire film. The direction only adds to the intensity, and the use of shaky cam works really well here. The story is kept to the minimum and the panic and chaos of the apocalypse is pushed to the forefront. It's energetic, it's entertaining - but more than that it's just a thrilling experience. Overall, World War Z is one of the best action films of the last ten years...is what I'd be saying if the film ended after the first thirty minutes.Don't get me wrong, the rest of the film is entertaining, but the story is very weak, with a lot of conveniences and annoying moments. The action definitely would have benefited from being R/15 rated, as there are a lot of moments where the action is really choppy. Brad Pitt is good throughout, and some of the emotional moments do land, but honestly the film became quite tiresome by the end. So whilst the opening is fantastic and I would still recommend the film on the whole, the opening set up what could have been an amazing film, when it's ended up just being decent.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
Tsunami zombies,Based on a novel world war z is a zombie movie. I haven't read it but from my sources it's weak.

Action movie,"This is an interesting zombie movie in which state-of-the-art filming techniques are used. Brad Pitt plays someone named Gerry Lane, whose job is never mentioned in the movie. He just says he quit his job to be with his family. According to the storyline description, he was a former UN investigator. After a zombie outbreak he gets to a UN ship with his family. There, he is assigned to take a scientist to Korea to search for a cure. But the scientist is killed as soon as they land on Korean airport, and afterwards, instead of returning to the UN ship, he assumes the scientist's role and tries to find the cure himself. This came to me weird because he plays both a soldier and a scientist. I think for this reason his job is never mentioned.Technically, there are almost no gore scenes in the movie. Camera moves away each time someone is attacking another. Instead of that, swarms of zombies attack the cities. According to me, this is an action movie rather than an horror.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"

Anti-Climactic,"World War Z is a fun ride. There was enough tension to keep me on my toes and the jump scares got me more than once. At times, it felt like Brad Pitt was on a wild goose chase, following one lead after another to Korea, Israel and beyond. I wasn't entirely sure why Gerry was ""the guy"", as he didn't show anything truly remarkable other than being Brad Pitt.I wanted the stakes raised. In the first 20 minutes, I kept holding my breath, scared that a family member would get bitten. Once he is separated from his family, I didn't feel that same anxiety, which is a shame. There were countless (mostly mute) side characters introduced, all of which didn't add much to the final story. I wanted more from Tommy, Segen, Captain Speke, the ex-CIA agent and others.There are some truly memorable scenes, like the zombies climbing the wall in Israel, the infected on the airplane and the fantastic ""like a river around a rock"" moment. Unfortunately, the third act seems incomplete and like the writers didn't know how to end it. The best word I could use to explain it is ""anti-climax"". The movie isn't perfect, but exactly what you would expect from a zombie flick.Best Character: Gerry
Best Quote: ""Movement is life."" - Gerry
Best Scene: ""Like a River Around a Rock""
Best Piece of Score: ""Like a River Around a Rock""Note: I was fully expecting the paper he holds up to say, ""Ring the phone if YES"" or something useful.

Seems like a preview of the Director's Cut,"There is so much off-screen violence, so many plot holes, so many places in this film where something starts and then ends without any sense of a middle to it that it feels almost like the version I saw (the PG-13, single-disc DVD version, in case later re-releases muddle the issue) was the edited-for-TV version or the cut they put together just so they could later release a Director's Cut with all the sense put back in.Giving the hero of an action film a family to worry about is a choice filmmakers rarely go for, but it is effective here in establishing his motive for survival. Unfortunately, all the teasing about ""what I used to do"" from Brad Pitt never pays off. We never learn that he used to be a sniper assassin or an accountant or anything back when he did whatever it did that was so disturbing in his past. That's just one disappointment the film features. Revealing more would venture into spoiler territory.6 out of 10: Worth seeing, not worth recommending.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
saving the world again,"Sometimes you see a film which has great premises and it disappoints. Some other times however a film which according to the subject and taking into account previous experiences in the genre is doomed for failure succeeds to surprise in a good way. This is exactly the case with World War Z directed by Marc Forster starring The Brad Pitt.The human race is in danger and the enemy is inside. It is actually us and our neglect to the environment that causes a destructive virus to take over and spread by means of the global airlines network. In a few days or weeks, the danger cannot be hidden, as the virus turns almost on the spot human beings into zombies with enhanced powers and infinite hunger to bite and infect other human beings, and cities and countries fall one after the other into Z dementia. Only tiny Israel (one of a few movies my country comes with some kind of a positive face) succeeds to delay the fate by isolating itself and building a wall separating healthy people from the world-wide infection, but no wall is high enough to stop such an invasion (hear! hear!).The resulting film is pretty entertaining, although the story is not much different that the one told at least ten if not one hundred times. Director Marc Forster seems to try something else with each of the films he makes, and here his rehabilitation of a genre compromised by too may bad B-series movies succeeds, as he can tell a story and creates a few memorable images like the one of the hysterical zombies pyramids, beings that may have lost humanity but gained social grouping instincts, which had a 'Lord of the Rings' quality. Brad Pitt may seem to be a little bit regressing in his acting career, but as he approaches the mid-age roles time he must have felt happy to act again as the sexy savior of mankind, blessed with both muscles and brains.The word is saved again. The only bad news may be that WWZ 2 is in preparation :-)",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"

World War Z. Long story short.,"I recently saw the film World War Z. Long story short, this film at the beginning is a bit boring, detailing for several minutes events of how it was and as it happened the pandemic. When action happens, everything is total expectation to keep seeing and to understand why these zombies are different from others seen in other films.This film has amazing actors that really make the film interesting. First, Bratt Pitt, gives rise to a father and husband, strong willed when it comes to defending what belongs to him, his performance makes you not lose the vision in detail what you want to display. The casting of this movie is really good, and the actors didn't disappoint.The story focuses around which goes through the world in a race against time to stop a pandemic that is tearing down armies and the government, and threatening to decimate humanity. The problems faced in the fight to find a cure. It does at times, fall into boredom for wanting to see some action. In addition, you will be on the edge of your seat waiting to see what will happen at the end.A peculiar detail about this film is that it is very easy to identify with the main character (Brad Pitt). We all have moments of fear for our lives that make us cringe.Finally, the way this film is and just when everything seems clarified eventually fall into the sad situation of wanting to see more and especially leaves the viewer with factions in the face of ""It's over"" And suddenly jump in the words ""BUT"" ""WHY"" Overall, this film covers little to how much they have to cover.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"

"A great premise, somewhat squandered on choosing to be histrionic over smart","I'm a big fan of the apocalyptic genre, and if done right, it can be a welcome mixture of a lot of genres. World War Z is an interesting rendition of a zombie apocalypse that engulfs the whole world. Implausible? Nope. It's meant to be that way. The premise is interesting, the epiphany too is unique in a good way. Brad Pitt is great as usual, and the supporting cast just about got the job done. The suspense and thrill is there and the frames tick along at a rapid pace, leaving little time for reflection.What I didn't like was the makers going for flashy over smart and sensible. I refrain from giving spoilers which would elucidate my point but there's more than a couple of scenes where you go : ""Why would you do that?"". Also, for a story like this, character development is very important. It helps the audience develop a sense of attachment with the actors and have a better understanding of what they are going through.

Enjoyable Zombie Romp,"Brad Pitt stars as Gerry Lane, a former UN investigator who has been recruited by the government to try and find the source of a deadly virus which has been infecting mankind, turning them into vicious zombies.The way this movie starts is excellent as it doesn't take long at all for all hell to start breaking loose. From that moment on it definitely keeps your attention. Sometimes the downside to movies starting off so well is that it set's a precedent for the rest of the movie to be as exciting, which is hard to do. Thankfully World War Z manages to keep a really good pace throughout, mixing a good amount of action and suspense, and while I understand it cannot be relentless for the entire movie duration, it does get a wee bit slow in places. Fortunately, these moments don't last too long though, and they are usually a build up to some good tense scenes.A lot of the visuals are really superb, especially when you see the big wide shots of the zombie attacks in New York, New Jersey and Israel from the ground and from above. The tension that these scenes build are excellent as well, even moreso when the zombies actually start climbing over themselves to get over the walls in Israel.Watching it all in action you can understand why the movie cost around $190m to make. Nothing is really original about the zombies in this movie in the way they act and the way they move - as 28 Days Later was the first movie to portray zombies/infected as fast, vicious killers - but they are still done really well with suspense being the main focus for them to scare people rather than a Dawn of the Dead type of zombie where it's mainly gore.I had been looking forward to seeing this movie for a while and while overall I wasn't disappointed, it lacked a wee bit of something. Maybe it's because it's really all been done - PLENTY of times - before. Who knows, but what I do know is that World War Z is definitely a good film to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"

It's fascinating, poignant and hugely imaginative.The film is a pretty run of the mill zombie flick with a pretty sloppy plot line in parts.

Everyone loves to hate Zombies...,"Zombies, everyone loves to hate them and Brad Pitt and director Marc Foster have moved them front and centre, from niche market into the Multiplex.Instead of shuffling, small groups of the undead, this story imagines a Zombie pandemic with zombies running at breakneck speeds and swarming like ants around a jar of honey.Commencing with arguably the most effective sequence, we meet every man Gerry (Pitt), playing eye spy with his wife Karin (Mireille Enos) and two young kids, in his safe suburban Volvo on the traffic blocked streets of Philadelphia.After losing a car wing mirror, it quickly becomes evident that Gerry and family have a lot more to lose if they do not move quickly. Once bitten the victim becomes part of the horde within twelve seconds, not long for those you previously loved to get far enough away, as they become your next prey.The early sequence where Gerry attempts to protect his and another family within an apartment block is very effective and ramps up the tension as they all struggle to survive. The depiction of the inevitable break down in law and order, rapidly moving into ""every man for himself"", is both highly believable and highlights the thin veneer of civility we all accept and rely upon in our daily life.Of course Pitt is not just a normal Joe, in a previous life he moved through the hot spots of the world as a UN investigator and remains a key resource, worthy of saving to help the greater good, assuming of course he agrees to join the forces fighting back.The film is not so much about killing zombies, although the largely bloodless body count is high, the story instead focusing upon finding a cure to prevent a further spread of the disease. This is made clear as Gerry is tasked with assisting a young top virologist Dr Fassbach (Gabel) as he is sent to what is estimated to be ""ground zero"" to investigate.The film moves around the world, with a notable second act set in Jerusalem before reaching a climax in, rather bizarrely Cardiff, Wales UK. Rather than a welcome in the hill sides, just zombies, lots of zombies in white coats.The film is loosely based upon the book from Max Brooks and the film production was beset by rumours of cost overruns, re-shoots and ""creative differences"". In the Internet age, these terms are liberally attached to most big productions and despite initial reservations, the film has been successful with an ending leaving room for more, if audiences desire a re-match.The film deliberately shy's away from any outright gore, hard core horror fans should look elsewhere but this allows a much broader audience to enjoy a highly enjoyable thriller, that just happens to have Zombies as the main protagonist. There are ""jump"" scares a plenty but nothing your average 13 year old will not have seen before.Pitt plays the family man called to action with ease, equally at home with an axe in his had for making kindling or neutralising zombies as the situation demands. Enos (from the ""The Killing"" fame) makes a sympathetic ""stay at home mom, whilst husband is killing zombie hordes"" but arguably does not get enough to do. However, a note to self to always be careful when calling your partner during a zombie pandemic, as timing can be crucial.The effects and make up are state of the art, as you would expect on a production of this size. The final chapter works well but does appear to be spliced onto the action earlier, as if from a different film all together. This represents a much quieter and intimate man versus zombie, which could be due to the mentioned re-shoot, it does not harm the film but is a noticeable change of pace and setting.SummaryZombies lite, suitable for most family viewings with a good story, action sequences and effects.Highly enjoyable thriller with mild horror sequences that confounded pre-release critics, who clearly forgot the power of Zombie films to get up and keep going, even after being left for dead by their early reviews.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"
"Good Zombie Adventure, Decent Action Flick, Mediocre Thriller","The zombie genre is dangerously overexposed at the moment. For the last ten years filmmakers have churned them out, in what is mostly motivated by the basest of financial considerations. Luckily World War Z takes the zombie concept in a slightly different direction than traditional films. In the same vein as 28 Days Later, only on a global scale, WWZ is arguably the culmination and most fitting depiction of the concept of the ""Zombie Apocalypse,"" and one hopes its final reiteration. While it is too deeply flawed to really recommend to anyone outside zombie and action fans, the zombie genre couldn't hope for a better send off.The film is reminiscent of Steven Soderbergh's Contagion only much less dull. Though Contagion had the advantage of having an interesting antagonist, it also got bogged down telling one too many personal stories. In the end, Brad Pitt's central character, as unrealistic and epically significant he is in WWZ, is compelling enough to hold our attention. This movie doesn't really necessitate a bad guy, though a little more characterization might have helped. There are some good cameos I must say, but Pitt is what holds together this shambolic travelogue of a story. And considering the situation, his blunt exposition never seems forced. His character's simple mantra and guiding survival tactic (always keep moving) defines the attitude of the film. No one could accuse this reworked script of being too talky, that's for certain. As action sequences goes, it is quite striking.But the film's problems are evident in its generic clichés and predictability. Brad Pitt's character is essentially a superhero, which in any other movie wouldn't be a problem however in a movie that stresses gritty realism and a foundation in hard science it just seems awkward. One scene in particular will test your suspension of disbelief, and maybe even ruin the film for you. As I mentioned before, the film was adapted from the book of the same title, and its ending reworked at the last moment. Whether the new ending played better than the original we may never know, but the tonal shift from bombastic to more subdued climax makes sense. The film would have been well served to provide us the opportunity to absorb and process what we seeing more often.My only real complaint is that it never differentiates itself from the rest of the genre in any meaningful way, content to rely upon established zombie mythos and imagery found in any video game or B-horror. Though initially shocking in their animalistic disregard for their own bodies much like some swarming insect, the film none the less makes use of countless stock grayish, growling zombies, last-second escapes, and flickering fluorescent lights. In the decade since the masterpiece that was 28 Days Later, nothing in the zombie formula has really changed; good enough proof that the zombie phenomenon should probably cut its losses while it's still ahead.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Horror"

The action and camera work was decent. Other things were iffy for me too. But! They totally try to set this film up for a franchise, and if they do they can make a much better WWZ film. They can completely expand on what they've started. And make this a worthwhile franchise. One episode of The Walking Dead is much more violent, bloody, and more of a textbook zombie story. A story witch I Prefer! But all and all this was still an entertaining summer film! Once again the 3D was done in post conversion and was pretty pointless to see it in 3D.

New Unrated Cut,"I watched the New Unrated Cut version of this movie and it was really good. I was shocked at how many negative reviews it got, which was simply because most people watched the regular version.

Although I was kind of lost to how you could get infected by a bite (normal), but if it gets into your mouth, you're fine. I mean, I know it was rabies, but still. Right? Also, I didn't understand how there was already a lot of noise being made in the inner city: Buses coming in and out, helicopters flying around, police cars etc... But it was the singing that made the zombies go even crazier an build a ladder like wall to cross over?It was a good movie, don't get me wrong, I just think that it could've been thought about more carefully and re-edited.
