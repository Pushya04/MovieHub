It broke my heart,"Not saying this isn't an excellent film, it is just bluntly honest. I remember in English class in high school, we were learning about racism in the 60's, and how horrible it was. The worst part was that I am from a very racist town, unfortunately, and watching the beginning of the film terrified me because I felt like this world hadn't changed since I felt like I was living that film. Being one voice sometimes can either be helpful or get you into a lot of trouble.I didn't want to see this film again because of the awful situations I saw or heard of. Now, I am out on my own, and I had the chance to see the movie once again, and felt that I could see it. It's a terrific and very powerful movie that can get anyone to cry unbearably. It's not just the actors, but Gene and William's characters, I wanted to be just like them, they were able to stand up even though the many times of being knocked down and caring so much just to try to in some way save that town.I honestly feel that everyone should see this movie, it can change your life or make you look around and want to change things. I know this comment feels more like a lecture than a comment, but that's how much this movie got to me. I think we all can do something right in this world, it's just a matter or standing up. Even if this film isn't historically accurate, it's accurate enough to see how people treat other people. Hopefully, we will have a better future for generations to come.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,History

Good but hard to watch,"On June 21, 1964 three young men drove a CORE (Congress of Racial Equality) station wagon from Meridian to Longview, Mississippi. On the return trip to Neshoba County Deputy Sheriff Cecil Price arrested them for speeding. He jailed them in Philadelphia, MS. Then finally released them a little after 10 p.m. And told them to leave town. A few miles outside of Philadelphia the deputy stopped their car again--this time after a wild chase--and turned them over to a group of Neshoba County Klansmen. Their bodies wouldn't be found until over a month later by FBI agents.That's the real story. ""Mississippi Burning"" is a close dramatization of it.I watched in both disgust and surprise. I was disgusted by the actions of the proud citizens of Mississippi and I was surprised to see actors that I knew nothing about when the movie came out in 1989--the likes of Willem Dafoe, Frances McDormand (Three Billboards...), R. Lee Ermey (Full Metal Jacket), Michael Rooker (Merle from The Walking Dead), Frankie Faison (commissioner on The Wire), and Darius McCrary (Eddie Winslow on Family Matters). I was surprised, not in a bad way, but in a ""Whoa! He's in this?!"" way. Sure these names aren't A-listers but they are all familiar faces to me that I never knew culminated on a 1989 project.As for the movie itself, there was some creative license taken but it was very close to the real events. In fact, the FBI knew so much about the murders because one of their informants was with the guilty party. The movie does evoke strong feelings and it is unavoidable. How do you depict 1960's deep south without raising the hairs on the back of someone's neck? Because this movie wasn't a through-and-through tragedy there was a modicum of justice served. I thought all the actors did a good job (too good in fact in some cases) and the script was well written. I still file this movie under ""hard to watch"".",7.0,Anonymous,History
The Best Film of 1988,"Great movies are ones that invoke a strong emotional response that lingers long after the movie is over. Mississippi Burning is that kind of film. You may love it, you  may hate it. You may think that it is an accurate depiction of the south in 1964, you may think its pure fiction. No matter what you will respond strongly.Director Alan Parker has been down this road before with Midnight Express, another crushing, gut-wrenching tale based on a true story. In both cases, a great deal of liberty is taken with the facts, but that doesn't matter. Mississippi Burning is not a docudrama or an A & E special, it is at its heart, a police drama, and a near perfect one at that.It is criticized by some for its depiction of southerners of the time as a group of brain-dead racists with no moral fiber whatsoever. I don't believe that is the movie's intention, but it spends time showing this side of society to make us understand how hate breeds itself, and how it becomes a way of life and an accepted standard. As one character states, ""When we were seven years old, they told us that segregation was in the bible. You hear that long enough, you start to believe it"".Mississippi Burning won a (well-deserved) Oscar for cinematography, but sat and watched Rain Main take home the majors. It was clearly the best film of 1988 and stands as one of the great works of American cinema of the 80's. Hackman and Dafoe are at their best, and Frances McDormand delivers a beautifully understated, powerful performance as the deputy's wife - a woman at war with her sense of right and wrong, struggling with fear and loyalty. Her character is the centerpiece of the movie.This is not a preachy or melodramatic movie. You won't get a lecture on why racism is wrong. You will get an rich, engaging crime drama depicting a pivotal time in American History, and you will never forget it.**** out of ****.",,Anonymous,History
Where does hatred come from?,"Where?  Where does racism come from?  How can one race feel superior to another?  Are we born with it?  No.  Do we become it on our own?  Maybe?  Or is it perhaps that we are taught it?  There is a small scene in Mississippi Burning that is just as powerful as any Gene Hackman speech or any violent montage to gospel music that is in this film.  There is a rally at a park with the head of the KKK ( without his hood ) telling thousands of people that have gathered that he loves being white.  He loves the fact that Mississippi is segregated.  And in the crowd the camera pans across and shows three year old kids smiling and cheering as gleefully and loudly as their parent's are.  It is haunting.This film is bit like JFK in a way.  It is not an absolute recreation of the events that took place in 1964, but it is a film that tells a true story and then adds a bit of fiction to make it more interesting for a mass audience. For example, the case was not cracked by Mr. Anderson fooling around with Pell's wife.  But that is besides the point, the point being that this film is mesmerizing.  Everything from its direction, cinematography, acting, writing and music, it is the best film of 1988.  And having Rain Man take most of the major awards is really quite sad.  Because Mississippi Burning is much more ambitious, important and well done.  Rain Man is a very good film and I will even go as far as to say that Hoffman is the only one that deserved to win best actor just as much as Hackman did.  But 1988 was a bad year for the rest of the Oscars.  Anyway...I have been edgy before.  Boyz and the Hood did that to me, but this film makes me angry.  It makes me want to jump back into 1964 and try to do something to stop this.  The film is that strong at showing us how terrible and pointless racism is.  And in order to make this film work, there has to be strong elements in all areas.  But for me, what really made me feel the things that I did is the actors that played their roles.Hackman is brilliant.  He gives the performance of a lifetime and it is his anger that gives him his edge.  He sees things differently than Mr. Ward does and that sometimes makes them bump heads with each other.  But they ultimately have the same goal in mind.  Just different ways of achieving that goal.  Dafoe is great as well, but it is the supporting cast that really makes this film.  From Dourif to R. Lee Ermey to Stephen Tobolwolski, these characters are richly portrayed by the actors that play them.  There is however one actor in particular that I wanted to touch on and that is Michael Rooker.  He plays Frank, the nastiest, meanest, no conscience, negro hating person that I think I have ever seen on film.  I don't know where his anger comes from, but he is the kind of character that you can imagine had a violent father that drank too much and always told stories about how bad the black man was.  When Rooker is on screen you listen.  You pay attention to what he is saying and doing.  And my hatred of him was one of my favourite parts of the film.Mississippi Burning shows us how strange people are when it comes to racism. The characters in this film don't know why they hate the way they do, they just know that they do.  And they are powerless to stop themselves.  What happened to the three civil rights workers was a disgrace and a tragedy. But not just because three boys were murdered, but because no one knows why they were murdered,besides racism that is.  Why did they have to die? Because they were a different colour of skin?  Because they were Jewish?  It really doesn't make any sense.Mississippi Burning is one of the best films I have ever seen.  It is important and it is entertaining.  If you haven't seen it, do so just for the scene with Mr. Anderson and Deputy Pell at the barber shop.  That is worth the price of the rental alone.  But for a really important film that has something to say, this is one of the best.",10.0,Anonymous,History

1964 - The year America was at war with itself!,"1964 - The year America was at war with itself! Thats a pretty good tag-line. The promotion for this film seemed to pitch it as a thriller or a buddy movie. It is neither. This is a very mature investigation of a racist Mississippi town where the brutal murder of three civil rights activists took place in 1964. The film is inspired by real-life events.Dafoe and Hackman play the two FBI agents sent to investigate. Their differing styles of pursuing the case and Dafoe's belated admiration for Hackman's ""method's"" is an interesting layer of flesh added to the structure of the film.You will see some really nasty racist characters played by familiar faces like Brad Dourif, Lee Ermey and an especially violent Michael Rooker. All are excellent. Frances McDormand really steals the movie as the wife of racist Dourif.This film is far more intelligent than some of the Stanley Kramer movies of the 60's which dealt with racism. It does not shy away from showing the seriousness (and sickness) of the racial mindset without being excessively preachy. It is in fact very watchable - largely due to a colorful and humorous Hackman whose character was himself a Mississippi small-town Sheriff at one time and understands the pitfalls of the Hoover boys going in all guns blazing.Highly recommended!",10.0,Anonymous,History
Great acting and directing ...but a severely compromised script.,"THE FILM: The third of Parker's 80's heyday films following Birdy and Angel Heart,Mississippi Burning is an acting masterclass.From Hackman and Defoe in the leads to all the supporting cast. As per usual it looks great and has some strong images. For all this it gets 7 out 10.THE STORY: Is based on the real events of the murder of 3 civil rights activists in 1964 Mississippi and the subsequent FBI investigation into their deaths. The problem is not with the ongoing story of how the Fed's crack the case.This is fiction based on fact and as a police story it works fine.THE COMPROMISE: 1, the FBI. J.Edger Hoover in 1964 was possibly the most powerful man in the country, with a file on everyone of importance or power.The FBI was his private fiefdom. Mr.Hoover believed Martin Luther King was a Communist and had no sympathy for the Civil Rights Movement.This is mentioned in one small line of script.The Bureau would have to go after murderers but was certainly on no crusade. Mr.Hoover detested the Kennedys and only kept his job because he had enough info to destroy them.So how the Defoe character, as a Kennedy man , got beyond a filing job is hard to say. Mr.Hoover used Hollywood to create the myth of the G-man ,this myth is still alive and kicking in this film.The Gene Hackman character had been a Mississippi sheriff and obviously part of a Bureau dirty tricks squad and we are expected to believe he has a bleeding heart under his badge. What would have made it interesting if his character was more truthful.The FBI was an all white agency and it certainly was not politically correct.Mr Hoover's views were no secret so rascism would certainly not effect anybody'career.Again this is hinted at in his speech about his father. 2,the KKK, It seems the whole white community in the South is a member which oversimplifies the situation a lot. Also, it does not show the main cause of the hatred was the Southern establishment,the wealthy landowners who encouraged the politicians,the police and judiciary to preach segregation as a classic measure of divide and rule of the poor- whites and African-Americans. It also ignores the fact that segregation had been twisted into the very fabric of the Southern states post- Confederacy identity. 3,the African-Americans, The docile passivity,gospel singing over ashes of churches and the lack of anger is patronising in the extreme.The Civil rights movement was born in South and the churches were its most vocal advocates.Maybe if this film had been made in the 70's rather than the 80's these major background issues would not have been ignored.",7.0,Anonymous,History
It helps to be wise in the ways and mores of Dixie,"It's now a well documented fact that FBI director J. Edgar Hoover was convinced that the Civil Rights movement was somehow being directed from Moscow as part of the Communist conspiracy. As if anyone's struggle for equality needed outside direction. Hoover's bugging of Martin Luther King is legendary both for its lack of useful information to prove that thesis and for the titillation that King's indiscretions provided for certain people in power courtesy of J. Edgar.But when the murders of those two outside civil rights workers from New York City Michael Schwerner and Andrew Goodman happened the nation was shocked. First it was a missing persons case, then a homicide when the bodies were discovered. Public opinion forced the FBI and its director to take this seriously. And I have to say that when they did, the job was done.The names of the civil rights workers were not mentioned nor was the name of the young black kid who here was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. In real life James Morton was a voter registrar working with Goodman and Schwerner. That gave some dramatic license to the producers of Mississippi Burning to spin their own version of events. Given the redneck wall of silence that federal investigators had to deal with I'm not sure the spinning was too far from the truth.Willem Dafoe's portrayal of a button down FBI agent of the Hoover era rings real true. Hoover's own standards regarding appearance and behavior of his agents somewhat hampered law enforcement in certain fields. He had other foibles that have come down to us since his death in 1972, some real, some speculative. Dafoe just isn't getting the job done.Which brings us to Gene Hackman who is a former Mississippi sheriff and wise in the ways and mores of Dixie. When Dafoe gives him a free hand Hackman gets results even though like in real life these Ku Klux Klansmen could only be tried in federal court as no Mississippi state jury would have convicted these creatures. Hackman got a well deserved Oscar nomination for his performance. And it's a good thing that the ACLU wasn't looking to hard at Hackman's methods. It was like what Sean Connery taught Kevin Costner about bringing down Al Capone in The Untouchables. It probably did take the FBI bending Hoover's precious rules to get justice in real life.Frances McDormand plays a truly sad role as the wife of one of the sheriff's deputies who was in on the killing. She's a caring and compassionate woman and indiscreet about her husband's activities. She pays for that. It is restrained, understated, but very powerful performance that netted her a Best Supporting Actress nomination.Mississippi Burning won for Best Cinematography and got a number of other nominations including Best Picture. Sad to say it was up against Rain Man that year and I'd hate to split the difference between what Hackman and what Dustin Hoffman did in his classic.It's ironic that I saw this film and between seeing it and writing about it I attended one of many marriage equality rallies throughout the nation as the Supreme Court hears arguments about same sex marriage. The same people who could not comprehend the mixing of races are in the forefront of a fight against marriage equality because their minds can't comprehend that either. A seismic cultural shift against racial segregation took place just as a seismic cultural shift is occurring now toward the acceptance of the LGBT lives and lifestyles. It's been a privilege to live in these interesting times.Mississippi Burning with a bit of literary license remains a fine dramatic film and should be required viewing for those who want to study those times and get an idea what the civil rights struggle was about. Books will not give you as good an idea as Mississippi Burning will.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"""The Worst I've Seen""","In 1966, Martin Luther King visited Philadelphia, Mississippi, seat of Neshoba County and the town where three young civil rights workers disappeared two years before. Leading a procession of 300 people, he was confronted by a mob of angry white men brandishing hoes, broomsticks, and ax handles. One even turned a hose on King's group, which fought their way to the courthouse.There King confronted the deputy sheriff, Ray Price, who he knew had arrested the civil rights workers on the night they disappeared. He turned and told the crowd that there were people among them who had participated in the murder. ""You're damn right,"" Price muttered. ""They're right behind you.""King was moved to write later: ""This is a terrible town. The worst I've seen. There is a complete reign of terror here.""""Mississippi Burning"" aims to give a taste for how bad it was, and just how superhuman the efforts to stop it had to be in order to succeed. It's flawed because it's not terribly functional as a crime drama or nuanced enough as a civil rights story, but its heart is in the right place, its grasp of the situation solid, and its detractors mostly attack it for all the wrong reasons.Like why does ""Mississippi Burning"" give all the credit to breaking the murder case to the FBI? Didn't director Alan Parker and writer Chris Gerolmo know FBI director J. Edgar Hoover was a racist? Yes, and he hated vigilante groups with a passion, particularly the Ku Klux Klan. Plus he was acting under orders of President Johnson, who was very disturbed about the disappearances, enough to place a phone call to a Mississippi senator asking for help finding the kids (and being told by the senator it was all probably just a hoax). WhiteHouseTapes.org has the phone calls on record, while Doug Linder's Famous Trials website has the full story. The FBI did send hundreds of agents to Neshoba County, they rankled the local authorities big time, they found the murdered workers, and they arrested several people for the crime, including the sheriff and the deputy sheriff, getting relatively light convictions for most, but convictions all the same, a first involving the murder of a black by whites.Did the black population of Neshoba County contribute much to solving the case? I don't know, but King's experience there is telling. There simply was no regard for the rights of non-whites. Blacks were completely powerless there, dealing with a white power structure that was nakedly aggressive about keeping them down. In many Southern jurisdictions, white authorities looked the other way when the Klan did their work. As the FBI investigation in Neshoba County revealed, the sheriff's office and the Klan worked hand in glove.""Mississippi Burning"" has great acting, sumptuous period detail, an unflinching desire to show the terrible toll of racism on a society, not only with lynchings but most powerfully, in the story Gene Hackman tells about how his father dealt with a black neighbor's mule. Just the way he uses his eyes as he tells the story, without the slightest attempt at drama, draws you into the terrible dehumanization that racism brings not to its targets but those who buy into it.The truth of the story was more shaded than Parker presents here. He's not a racist, or an FBI apologist. He's a filmmaker who wants to entertain his audience. He unrealistically overamps the Klan violence, to the point where they seem to be burning some black person's building once a week even though the FBI is making little progress through most of the movie. There's an early scene where Willem Dafoe's character (based not on an FBI agent but a Justice Department official named John Michael Doar) sits down next to a black man and starts asking him questions about the murder, in full view of a hundred or so people. No criminal investigator works like that, especially in the FBI.The story of the Mississippi Burning case is so compelling, why fictionalize it at all? The liberties they take, with the exception of the deputy sheriff and his wife, don't really help the plot out much. There's an attempt to make Hackman and Dafoe into fractious partners, but the scenes are ridiculous, especially when Dafoe pulls a gun on his partner after teasing him about his relationship with the deputy's wife.Frankly, the most interesting place this case was fought was in the courtroom, but we see little of that, or of Judge Cox, the bigoted federal justice who passed down the final sentences after heavy prodding from Washington.The movie does go for fireworks more often than it should. Hackman's two big confrontation scenes with the bad guys, at the speakeasy and in the barber shop, serve no apparent criminal investigation purpose and are meant to just make the audience feel good. He doesn't even get a word out of the deputy (played excellently by Brad Dourif) in between punches. But damn it works like hell.After the case was successfully prosecuted, Martin Luther King was moved to say the following: ""I must commend the Federal Bureau of Investigation for the work they have done in uncovering the perpetrators of this dastardly act. It renews my faith in democracy.""Manipulated or not, I feel the same way after watching ""Mississippi Burning.""",6.0,Anonymous,History
Dynamite in Celluloid Form.,"A highly charged box of fireworks is the best way to describe ""Mississippi Burning"". It is 1964 and the Civil Rights Movement is tearing apart many areas in the deep south. Mississippi is definitely the hottest spot of all as the entire state seems to be split between whites and African Americans. After some white Civil Rights activists disappear, the FBI is called in to investigate (Oscar-nominee Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe). Naturally the sheriff's department is difficult to say the least and it appears that it may have even had a part in the apparent murders. Frances McDormand (Oscar-nominated) proved that she was a truly gifted actress as the wife of one of the local deputies (an evil Brad Dourif). Alan Parker's smart Oscar-nominated direction and the Oscar-winning cinematography give the film a tense feel that leaves its audience visibly shaken during and after its running time. A great achievement. Easily one of the finest films of the 1980s. 5 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,History
"Strong, provoking and beautifully directed","This film takes place in the 60s, in the state of Mississipi, known for its ruthless discrimination suffered by the black people.

Hatred in the Deep South,"Inspired by real events this film opens with the murder of three civil rights activists, two white one black, in Mississippi in 1964. When they are reported missing two very different FBI agents are sent to investigate. Rupert Anderson, is a former Mississippi sheriff who doesn't always play by the rules and Alan Ward is a by-the-book high-flier but both are determined to bring those responsible to justice. They won't get much help locally; the police are indifferent at best, complicit at worst and nobody is going to talk because they know what will happen if they are even suspected of talking to the FBI. Soon Ward calls in more personnel and tensions rise even further as local racists try to intimidate the black population. It soon becomes obvious that if the FBI are to get anywhere they will have to break a few rules.Some may have problems by the fact that this is inspired by real murders but then gives a fictionalised investigation... that wasn't a problem for me though. The story presented shines a light on sinister events and attitudes that are far from being ancient history. The overt racism portrayed is disturbing; it isn't just the killers and Klansman who have such attitudes. While the identity of the killers isn't in doubt just how they will be brought to justice is. Gene Hackman gives a great performance as Agent Rupert Anderson; Willem Dafoe is solid as Agent Alan Ward and Frances McDormand impresses as Mrs Pell, wife of a deputy involved in the case. The rest of the cast impress too; they make some very unpleasant characters believable.

"Great Acting, But Overdone Stereotypes & Bias","This was a very intense story about three missing civil rights workers in 1964 and the U.S. government looking into that disappearance (and murder) in Mississippi, where it happened.On first viewing, I really enjoyed this because of the top-rated performance by the lead actors Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe and the fact that the story was interesting. However, on subsequent viewings, the ultra-Liberal bias of the people making this movie became more and more evident. Typical of Liberal elitists, they make every Southerner in this film (but one) look like very stupid, extremely racist hicks - the kind of people who want to strangle yourself.Hey, no one argues that racism is bad, bad thing but this goes to ridiculous extremes while giving cheap shots to Christians, as well. That's another typical feature of liberal bias. They have no problem showing us those slimeballs who are anti-Semitic, as also portrayed here, but at the same time the people who make the films can't hide their own anti-Christian bias.Too bad because Hackman and Dafoe are superb and the story moves very well.

"Excellent Film, Harsh viewer criticisms.","With some certainty, Mississippi Burning was the best film of 1988. I watched it recently, as I do from time to time, and in reading other viewer comments, I was dismayed to read such unwarranted and unintelligent criticism of a film that has done so much to expose the realities of the Black experience in the Deep South during the 1960's. On more than one occasion, a viewer (usually anonymous) has pinpointed the film as racist, in that it offers a view of the Civil Rights movement involving whites and government agents as key instigators of change. They feel that it portrays blacks in a negative light, downplaying the roles blacks played in the acquisition of their own equality. These people are either unaware, or just plain ignorant. There is a reason that this film focuses on the efforts of White FBI agents to locate the three missing boys. To begin with, this film focuses on a true story (slightly fictionalized for cinematic effect). During Freedom Summer of 1964, many white college students and black students as well worked under the guidance of groups like the Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee, in an effort to set up voter registration drives for blacks that had been historically disenfranchised. The three missing boys (two white, one black) received much attention during that summer from a Federal standpoint. This is a fact. Yet the reason for governmental interest in the murder of these boys exemplifies the attitudes of the era. Historically, murdered civil rights workers did not garner much attention. Yet because this case involved two northern whites, suddenly The FBI took interest. This is the reason for FBI involvement in the story. The fact that blacks are shown quite often as scared and unwilling to cause a stir in this film also is historically accurate. While there were many blacks that made great inroads and took huge risks to their personal well-being, the citizenry of blacks in this film is an accurate portrayal of the times. How many of us today would be willing to talk, inform, and be seen attempting to use our constitutional rights if we knew that such actions might get us killed? The seeming disinterest of blacks in this film is a result of years of Jim Crow legislation, of lynch law, and of outright terror tactics brought upon the black population by racist whites.It is a picture of a population that wants to stand up and scream, but is reluctant for very justifiable reasons. To stay alive often meant keeping your mouth shut. To make a film in which all black citizens of Philadelphia, Mississippi stood collectively against the perpetrators of these murders would be historically incongruent. Try to look past the overriding white involvement in this film and understand that this is the way the events unfurled. Perhaps it is a sad commentary on white involvement in Civil rights that was too little, too late. It took the death of two whites to spark interest in the events in Phil. Mississippi. This much is obvious. But as the search for these boys made headlines daily, just remember that many blacks were pulled from rivers that summer, in the search for the three civil rights workers. Unfortunately, these discoveries never made the headlines. A murdered white was cause for alarm. But a lynched black pulled from a swamp was merely accepted. Take this film as a lesson, and be glad that many things have changed since 1964.",,Anonymous,History
Both Black and  White can live together peacefully.,"Last year,I was appalled to read in an issue of Film Comment magazine that ""Mississippi Burning"" had been judged as the worst American film based on real life events.This is not only shocking but highly unbelievable too.What dismays is the fact that how can anyone categorize such a brilliant film as one of the worst political films.I am of the opinion that this is a big error on the part of a respectable film magazine.""Mississippi Burning"" is a superb rendition of the events which took lives of civil rights workers.Apart from the actors'efforts,the real credit of its success must go to Alan Parker's taut,skillful direction.With this film he has proved that he is at his creative best when he makes films based on real life events.No doubt people do remember ""Midnight Express"" and also the fact that hardly a week passes without the television screening of this film.William Defoe is a kind soul in this film.It was after this film that he decided to play various kind of bad guy roles.Gene Hackman is good too and his anger,frustration and obstinacy are a joy to watch.Frances McDormand is nice as the helpless soul trying to wriggle out of an unhappy marriage.Message of the film :nothing can be achieved through violence.PS: Live and let others live happily.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Versatile depiction of reality - with evenly strong cast,"This drama-thriller is loosely based on the FBI investigation into the real-life murders of three civil rights workers in Mississippi in 1964, providing an additional value to anyway skillful plot (by Chris Gerolmo) and direction (by Alan Pakula). In comparison to other states, Mississippi was (and largely is) behind the times in many ways, and many crimes were launched or not disclosed due to overall mentality and indifference -- thus, community solidarity can have both good and bad elements. The movie shows how difficult is to investigate if people are at bay, and when certain activities are not perceived as felonies. The events are logical and catchy to follow, largely thanks to character actors like Gene Hackman, Willem Dafoe, Frances McDormand, and Brad Dourif who make a difference even while being briefly on screen -- no cute faces or politically correct solutions, but harsh and effective methods for solving a severe crime.It is neither family movie not entertainment, but depiction of black spot in the US history after WWII.

it didn't really happen like this,"The recent belated conviction of Edgar Ray Killen (wouldn't you say that it's appropriate that he has ""kill"" in his last name?) brings to mind the story that inspired ""Mississippi Burning"". It's the story of how a group of Ku Klux Klan members murdered civil rights activists James Chaney, Michael Schwerner and Andrew Goodman in Philadelphia, Mississippi, in the summer of 1964. The movie portrays the murders, but FBI agents Rupert Anderson (Gene Hackman) and Alan Ward (Willem Dafoe) are made up. It turns out that the FBI bribed one of the murderers to rat on the other two, and all the while the FBI was tapping Schwerner's father's phone to see if he was a Communist.So, they played with the facts. Hollywood often does that. Either way, ""Mississippi Burning"" still is a good movie, reminding us of a time in our country's history when we were about to explode.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Fantastic film,"This is a superb film and one of the first that I acquired when I got a DVD player.

Truly Tellling,"MIssissippi Burning is an incredibly made thriller based on the murders of three civil rights workers in 1964. It follows two main detectives, with an interesting dynamic as they find the evidence leading to the killers. The whole theme of the film is shocking, very graphic and a deeply telling story of the poison of what prejudice did to weaken the nation at the time. A large portion of the film is simply KKK members going around burning down black communities, henceforth the name, 'Mississippi Burning.'The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous. The acting performances, particularly from Gene Hackman, are top class. The story is very gruesome and intense. All this adds up to why Mississippi Burning is my favorite thriller of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Not the powerful movie I expected it to be but it remains a well made movie.,"Even though ""Mississippi Burning"" is far from a failure, the movie still give me the feeling as if it could had been much better and far more effective with its subject, had it picked a bit of a different approach at times.""Mississippi Burning"" is a pure film-makers movie, that relies heavily on the skills of its cast & crew. Due to this however the movie looses its focus at times, when its story starts to more rely on some biased stereotypes and clichés, which makes the story at times rather unlikely, instead of powerful and effective. Perhaps the story should had put more its emphasis on its two main characters, played by Willem Dafoe and Gene Hackman and their relationship as FBI-partners, who both have different ideas and styles of approaches.The whole racial theme serves as the basis for the movie its story. It's however not really a story that grabs me and draws me into it, even though the subject itself is to me always interesting and potentially gripping and extremely powerful. ""A Time to Kill"" is for instance a movie who tackled this subject much better, in my opinion.It's not like the cast & crew didn't gave their very best though. Alan Paker provided the movie with his experienced directing abilities, though its a bit uneven at times with its themes and approaches, like often is the case with most of his movies. He doesn't always seem to be able to put its emphasis on one main thing.The movie knows to capture the right atmosphere for a movie with such a theme like this one has. It means that the movie has some effective cinematography and picked some good settings.The movie has a bit of a surprising cast, with for instance Willem Dafoe in a quite big role opposite Gene Hackman. Perhaps Dafoe gives away one of his best performances in this movie and he allowed himself to go through a metamorphose, physically and acting-wise. Giving Gene Hackman a cop-role is always a good idea. It always sort of reminds you of his ""The French Connection"" performance. The movie also stars a well cast R. Lee Ermey, who had just won an Oscar for his ""Full Metal Jacket"" role and Michael Rooker. It also stars some good actors, who were still quite unknown at the time of this movie, such as Frances McDormand, Brad Dourif, Pruitt Taylor Vince and Tobin Bell.It's a good and well made movie that could had been a more powerful one if it had put its emphasis at different things at times. The movie now sometimes looses its focus, not making this the movie that it potentially could had become.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Vile, but not for the reasons its detractors advance","Well, ""Mississippi Burning"" can be acquitted on one charge, at least - it doesn't glorify the FBI, which, as an organisation, did all it could to hamper the civil rights movement.  The heroes are two agents assigned to cover a particular case.  They may or may not be in sympathy with the organisation to which they belong; my guess is that they aren't.  There's certainly something curious about making the heroes of this particular story white FBI agents, but this isn't in itself objectionable - at least, not under the circumstances.But the film is still morally repulsive, for reasons that it worries me that no-one has pointed out.  When Anderson and Ward travel to Mississippi to investigate the murder of civil rights activists, they run into a stone wall.  Whites are too bigoted to talk to them and blacks are too terrified of reprisals.  If they charge a white man with a crime of violence they know that no local jury will convict and no local judge will sentence.  What can they do?They try for prosecution in a federal court, obviously - so far, so good. And to make absolutely certain that their charges stick they play dirty: they recruit thugs and extract information under torture and the threat of extreme violence.  If there's a single character whose actions we're meant to approve of, it's Anderson (invested with all the charm Gene Hackman has to offer) - and we see him wielding a razor blade, threatening to slash someone's throat.  He's not, in this scene, seriously attempting to find anything out, or even trying to coerce his victim into cooperating.  It's a mere display of strength and will.  When I first saw ""Mississippi Burning"" I was so infuriated by the racism that I managed to persuade myself (reluctantly, I hope) to cheer him on.  I was nearly sixteen.  I'm glad I don't have to admit to having been any older.  Looking at the movie today, the fascist nastiness which I had talked myself into overlooking turns out to be the dominant element.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Excellent insight into race relations in the deep south,"This film involves the investigation of the disappearance of three civil rights workers in Mississippi in 1967.Dafoe plays the straight man from the FBI, He does everything by the book. But he doesn't get far. His investigation is blocked every step of the way by the locals, including law enforcement and the KKK. Clearly these Southern boys don't appreciate these 'bleeding heart liberals' coming down from the North and telling them how to 'treat their coloured folk'...The Gene Hackman comes along. He's another lawman, but with a more radical approach to investigation...Hackman's character is quite happy to do whatever it takes to achieve the desired objective including beating, threatening and intimidating witnesses and suspects.This approach is more successful...But will it prevail, in the face of opposition from (almost) the entire town?As usual, Dafoe is brilliant, and Hackman, of course never puts a foot wrong. He must have a really good agent, because I have never seen him act badly or be in a bad film. In fact his only mistake in his entire career seems to have been dental in nature...surely someone should tell these guys that 70 year olds do not have perfect, straight white teeth...",9.0,Anonymous,History

"Excellent, incredibly enthralling","I watched this film because of it's relevance to my GCSE course, in which we are doing the book ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" which is very similar to this film and my teacher thought it would help to see this. The acting was incredible, I can't think of any weaknesses, both lead roles were performed brilliantly throughout.The violence was graphic to say the least, and may be a bit harsh for some, but it all added to the effect the film had in that the audience was involved with the storyline emotionally. The parts of the film which showed violence towards the negroes were well acted and realistic, the ""interrogation"" of one of the white actors was superb.The ending was abrupt, almost disappointing, the film seemed to lead to a climax which surely should have been deeply emotional and active but it seemed the director had given up and couldn't be bothered.

Maybe a bit too much of a film but still enjoyable,"When three young civil rights workers (two white and one black) going missing in the deep south of America, the FBI send two agents in to investigate.  Liberal young agent Ward and cynical local agent Anderson both approach the case in different ways, however both come up against a wall of silence and racism which seems to go all the way through the community, making their task near impossible.What do I mean when I say this is a bit too much of a film?  Well, the issues, history and settings here are all semi-factual and therefore should be quite an interesting film that attacks the heart.  Instead however, it is a thriller type film  and this becomes more and more evident as it goes on. The final 30 minutes set aside themes and discussion and go right for a thriller climax with enjoyable touches.  However it does lose sight of the issues, although, in fairness, it didn't have too good a grasp on them in the first place.The film never really sets out to do much more than paint the community as racist  and it does it rather too easily.  All the white racists are painted as inbred and monstrous (I'm not complaining!) while the black characters are all pretty much a silent group of extras.  I understand why the film did it this way, as to allow development of characters on both sides would have caused the thriller side of it to become baggier and less effective.  As it is, the broad strokes still work because I don't think many of us need to really be convinced that such racism is tolerable: it's easier just to cut out the debate in a thriller.The plot is pretty good and does paint the black situation pretty well.  It works best as a thriller though and early attempts to show the divide and so on are slowly moved to the back burner in favour of thriller touches.  Aside from a total lack of black characters and a tendency just to pigeon hole the white characters, the cast do a reasonable job, with plenty of well known faces.  Dafoe is good in the lead, despite being a little too wide-eyed for a FBI agent in charge of a major case.  Also, watching it now, it's funny at times because he sounds very like Agent Smith when he says `Mr Anderson'. Hackman overplays to good effect and he steals almost every scene he is in, although his romancing of McDormand is a little drawn out.  The support cast includes some reasonable turns from well-known faces including Dourif, Ermey and Tobolowsky.Overall this film has a reputation for being a quite powerful issue film. However it reality it is more a thriller which uses this setting of racial hatred as it's background and driver, rather than looking into it as a debate.  In fairness, it doesn't suffer for this and is actually an enjoyable film, which also serves as a reminder of a very common situation only a few short years ago.",,Anonymous,History
Powerful and necessary telling of a tale most of us already know,"Mississippi Burning (1988)A powerful movie with a handful of first rate actors and a story of injustice that gets worse and worse. Gene Hackman leads the stellar performances-he's phenomenal-with Willem Dafoe and a young Frances McDormand supporting him beautifully.
I don't think the plot is exactly what moves this story along, but rather the overall theme. In fact, the brutal, ignorant racism that underlies the motives of the Mississippi men in the movie is a kind of given for the 1960s (and unfortunately, in some quarters, to this day). The FBI swooping down on this town is not quite the admirable sight it should be, and that's to the credit of the moviemakers. Large institutional law enforcement was necessary to break the local politics (and morality) there, but it comes off as heavy handed and insensitive.
And that's where Hackman thrives, being the loner amidst the crowd, doing the dirty work necessary and that ends up being heroic in the end.
The filming (and all the fires suggested by the title) make for a vigorous movie to watch. It's a good, classic telling of a well known tale. And I hint at what makes the movie a little limited-it is telling a story we all kind of know, that there were a lot of truly hateful white people inflicting harm and violence onf black people in the deep South. I wish it had found a way to make it more distinctive. Maybe for those who don't really know all this happened, it's a big bang way to find out, but if you already have the gist of it in your head, this will travel some familiar ground.
It tells its story so well, however, it's still a great watch. So watch.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Harrowing account of America's racial history,"An excellent exploration of the civil rights problems affecting America during the 1960s. The reason MISSISSIPPI BURNING is so profound is that it takes a matter of fact, middle of the road approach, refusing to judge its cast of diverse characters and instead portraying the events as is, without bias. The film presents two actors at the top of their game – Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe – playing a couple of FBI agents who visit a small town to investigate some racist murders.Alan Parker fills this film with a slow burning intensity and anger in much the same way he did in ANGEL HEART. The script is literate and affecting, seeking to get into the minds of men we dismiss as racist and learning what makes them tick. The conspiracy angle is by far the most interesting part of the film and I can't imagine anybody not moved come the events of the climax. Of the supporting cast, there's a stand-out turn from a ruthless Michael Rooker, a very good Brad Dourif as the sly deputy, and an excellent Frances McDormand as a would-be love interest. R. Lee Ermey, Pruitt Taylor Vince and Stephen Tobolowsky all put in compelling turns as various sinister characters and the film's story never flags for a second, making this film the final word regarding its subject matter.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Southern Cross Burning,"With the breaking of the news of his sad, if at this stage, still unexplained death, I wanted to watch one of Gene Hackman's movies in tribute to one of Hollywood's finest actors.He's certainly the best thing in this 1988 Alan Parker recreation in microcosm of the bitter racial strife in the deep south of America in the early 60's, to wit, Mississippi, well-described by Hackman's improbably named Rupert Anderson as having four ""eyes"" that see nothing. Anderson is the junior FBI agent partner to Willem Dafoe's younger and recently appointed Agent Ward, who are both assigned the case of three ""disappeared"" young men, two of them white, associated with the peace movement and their black passenger. We already know their fate from the gripping opening, but in a segregation state like Mississippi with many of its high-ranking community active members of the Ku Klux Klan, solving the case will be extremely difficult. They certainly can't look for help from the ordinary white townsfolk. Raised from birth in racial prejudice, they look the other way and even condone the terrible crimes committed on the local blacks ranging from the burning down of their houses, more typically shacks and churches, to ritual beatings all the way to cold-blooded murder, lynching and hanging. The black community too seems too fearful to assist the detectives either and those that dare to are brutally punished if they're seen even talking to the G-Men.Right from the start the Dafoe-Hackman relationship is a testy one, Dafoe is a northerner, appalled by the actions of the Southern W. A. S. P.'s, especially as they contravene LBJ's recently passed Civil Rights Act. Hackman, by contrast, is a Mississippian himself, who not only bristles at Dafoe's by-the-book methods, but who is quite happy for the ends to justify the means. With Dafoe's methods taking the investigation nowhere and the attacks on blacks increasing, Hackman is finally given his head to do things his way, by any means necessary, to coin a contemporary phrase, which includes getting close to the suspected deputy sheriff's wife, a young Frances McDormand, to explode his alibi on the night of the killings as well as employing some catch-as-catch-can intimidation on other prime suspects to flush out the perpetrators.It's all very tense and gritty, aided by Parker's sure direction and the acting of the ensemble, but particularly Hackman and Dafoe. It can't be coincidence that they look like slightly younger versions of LBJ and JFK, matching their differing outlooks to the old South.The film has been criticised for not offering a loud enough voice to its too-passive black characters and certainly would be made differently today. Nevertheless, director Parker certainly nails the vile actions they suffer at the hands and feet of the whites, eliciting a mixture of horror, loathing and amazement that the perpetrators could do such things and get away with them. This only makes one savour the later payback scenes when Rupert bears down on the racists, particularly his barber-shop encounter with the deputy,Even if Parker ends up rushing to a slightly over-dramatic round-up ending, overdoes the accompanying Gospel music which is a too-constant feature in the narrative and too obviously punctuates the moments of deepest distress, nevertheless, inspired by actual events, this is a compelling, truth-telling movie with Gene central to the action and in most of the best scenes. Love that little wink he throws now and again, even when he's in the lion's den.R. I. P. Mr Hackman.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Magical Black People, OH MY!","I appreciate the comments of the other users who have seen this film. But this film should make you angry for one reason and one reason only, that the FBI, the most volatile opponent of Civil Rights Workers, actually turn out the good guys. Mississippi Burning started the disturbing mini- genre of mainstream films exploring the atrocities of racism through the eyes of people who were the least offset by it., the white male. To cite prime examples of this genre where the plight of the African -American is used as a tool for the White character's growth or change. The Green Mile, The Legend of Bagger Vance, Places in the Heart, And most heinously, Ghosts of Mississippi,(where a great opportunity to tell the story of the amazing leader Medgar Evers is wasted to tell the story of the White lawyer who brought his murderer to justice. Is that why he died? Is that why he did all that work to free his people from oppression? Is that why he sacrificed his life to make sure that the white lawyer get's his props in a Hollywood movie?) are part of this legacy of having Black character's be the catalyst for the growth of the white people they come into contact. As if they don't bleed blood, but magical pixie-dust to enlighten the white masses.It's this UN-focused liberalism that taints Mississsippi Burning. The argument of the writer's taking creative license with the historical facts to make a more compelling mystery is pointed, but the callousness of the Producer's hyping it as a socially- responsible, ""important "" film is just flat-out ridiculous. The film works as well as it can as a hard-boiled mystery, and is masterfully acted by Hackman, MacDormand, and Defoe, but Alan Parker is not known for his subtlety, and the villains of the piece are just so inherently evil, rather than being portrayed as just the sad, scary,ignorant, tragic hicks they were.",5.0,Anonymous,History

"Excellent movie, if very disturbing at times.","Mississippi Burning is a very good movie, with its focus of racism, a very sensitive subject, in the Civil Rights Movement cleverly handled. I will say, some scenes because the violence was very intense to the maximum, were rather upsetting to watch, like any scene when someone was attacked, the nature of the violence was very upsetting. The gunshot at the beginning was unbelievably loud, and made me jump quite violently. However, it is a very powerful and tense film, helped by a well-written script and an atmospheric music score. The dark brooding cinematography helped considerably to the film's proceedings, and the performances were excellent, with Gene Hackman mesmerising in the lead, and Willem Dafoe perfectly matching him.

1964. When America was at war with itself.,"I was never aware of how big an effect such a movement like the KKK' had on America, even the world. But thanks to a movie brought to us by director Alan Parker, called Mississippi Burning', I was not only able to learn about such big events in one of America's big town' histories, I was also able to appreciate how bad it turned' some people in this world. While Mississippi Burning' might have some aspects that will disturb some people, it is a gritty police drama' that I feel cannot and should not be missed.1964: Three young civil rights workers - two white, one black - disappear on a dark Mississippi back road, sparking off one of the largest FBI manhunts in history. Two FBI agents, with very different backgrounds, join forces to solve this seemingly impossible case, a case that ignited a controversy so bloody, it shocked the world.Mississippi burning' is a wonderful movie that recreates a time in America's history, a history I am sure that the country would rather forget. Yet I feel it is important that we learn about such historical events, as we can learn from the old times and how they have changed our life. MB's' story was extremely well written by Chris Gerolmo. What I liked most about it, was how game it was in showing the really confronting issues that I am sure were part of Mississippi in 1964'. At no stage does it shrug away from any disturbing issues, including such ideals as the KKK, the media hype in Mississippi and the important investigation that both Anderson and Ward want to solve.But director Alan Parker, brought out the stories great tension particularly well. I also feel it is Parker's unique directing style that allows us, as the audience, to see what is going on in Mississippi burning. Such tensions as the racist's ideals of the KKK, the way the media are consumed by the investigation of the missing civil rights workers and even the different ways both Ward and Anderson do their job, are all very memorable points from the film and this is the good work of Parker. The start and end of the film I feel are Parker's delicate touch as director, beautifully done and will be sketched in my memory for a longtime to come.Yet the acting talent in the film is also of a great highlight here. The main performers are agents Anderson (Gene Hackman) and Ward (Willem Defoe). Both are great in the roles that they played, but both are very different personalities, which cause them problems on the job. This only adds to the movies great tension.I mean it is easy to tell that both officers want to get to the bottom of this important case, but do it in such different ways. One goes by the book, getting in many hundreds of men to crack the case, while the other wants a smaller investigation, walking the town of Mississippi upsetting town folk, all in the aid of justice. I love the chemistry that Hackman and Defoe shared onscreen considering that both are playing opposite characters, as their relationship is vital to the final makeup of the film. Hackman's true acting talents come out here, however before seeing Defoe in MB', I felt that he was an ordinary sort of actor, but in this film he has proved to me he has some acting ability.Yet the supporting cast was also of the highest quality. Mrs. Pell (Frances McDormand) is great in her role. She is a person that is cared for by Agent Anderson, which is another great part of the movie's story, and is a pivotal character in the investigation. With Mrs. Pell, you get the feeling that she hates not only her life, but what is going on in Mississippi, with her quote that she sobs to Anderson about hatred, just captivating.She is married to corrupt cop, Deputy Clinton Pell (Brad Dourif), who has a smug smile and is not the greatest of policeman. Dourif's character is involved in one of the more tense scenes of the movie, when Anderson threatens him while being in the barber shop, a favourite of mine. Other good members of the supporting cast include Clayton Townley (Stephen Tobolowsky), Frank Bailey (Michael Rooker), who is brought to his knees by Anderson and Mayor Tilman (R. Lee Ermey).Other interesting scenes in Mississippi Burning' include the events that show the three civil rights boys being harassed by the cops, you have all the media hype created by the FBI investigation which was great, and the racial tension created by the KKK and their hatred towards the black people of Mississippi, with the burning of one black family's home, quite disturbing. The motel scene is very dramatic, and shows that these two agents are in a very dangerous situation. The diner scene is another truly remarkable scene to see being played out. It is hard to believe that white and coloured people had such big divisions, like this movie shows.Look Mississippi Burning' is a repugnant sort of movie at time, and could make you feel rather sick, considering that this movie's story is based on true events, making it difficult watch. However, this film makes me happy, considering that I live in a country that has democracy, an important ingredient in these times of multiculturalism. The music of MB is really thrilling, chilling and dramatic, and makes the movie's story even better. I feel that MB deserves all the praise that it gets, and it is no wonder that it had so many nominations for academy awards, winning one (for its cinematography by Peter Biziou). If you are looking for a really dramatic and entertaining movie then Mississippi Burning' is the movie that I highly recommend for you.CMRS gives Mississippi Burning': 5 (Brilliant Film)",,Anonymous,History

Not as great as the other reviews would have you believe...,"Based on a real life case (But given the old Hollywood Action makeover) Mississippi Burning is a hectic film, with beatings, prejudice and (as the title would suggest) arson galore. You get a real sense of how difficult life in a segregated state must have been in those unenlightened times, and this combined with powerful performances by Hackman and Defoe means this isn't want you'll want to stop till the end.As fun as it is seeing a bunch of racist yahoos get their just desserts though, I can't help but feel something is missing here. Like the bigots in question... Wouldn't it be better if they were a tad more fleshed-out, rather than simply hate-spewing caricatures of humanity? Also, the by-the-books cop vs the maverick officer thing is a tad unoriginal. Still fun to watch, but definitely a little laboured.There is also a distinct lack of a Black voice in the film... most of the African American cast just hang about in the background with the odd line which adds little to the plot. Speaking of which... the 'cunning plan' Hackman concocts to jail the secretive rednecks at the end is both far-fetched and highly unethical. You'd NEVER get a conviction in these circumstances from a British court...Hmm... Maybe that's our problem now... 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,History
What is wrong with these people?,"James Chaney, Andy Goodman and Mickey Schwener were murdered by members of the Ku Klux Klan in Neshoba County, Mississippi 1964. Their disappearance and subsequent murder sparked off one of the biggest FBI manhunts in history, and led to the conviction of several high profile Klan members.This is an interpretation of those events...Make no bones about it, Mississippi Burning is an emotionally sapping piece of film, the vile and despicable theme at its core should sicken anyone with an ounce of decency in their respective make up. What stops the film being the masterpiece of importance it should have been, is that director Alan Parker gives way to over fictionalising the already harsh facts of the case. In the process, choosing to stereotype both parties and sidestepping equality issues in favour of an FBI uneasy alliance, and a god forsaken romantic sub-plot! It's such a shame that Parker and his backers obviously lost sight of the reason they picked the project to film in the first place.So what are we left with? Well it's still one hell of a film for sure. The harshness and emotional impact is evident as the story unfolds, the troubled South vividly brought to life in a sea of burning crosses and segregated restaurants, with Peter Biziou's Academy Award winning cinematography an essential extra character in the piece. The cast is almost to die for, Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe take the lead roles as our feuding, at odds, FBI investigators, Popeye Doyle meets Sgt Elias anyone? But its with the supporting cast that Mississippi Burning becomes an essential watch for fans of actors. Rolling off the tongue like a who's who of weasel character actors is Michael Rooker, Brad Douriff, R. Lee Ermey, Stephen Tobolowsky, and Pruitt Taylor Vince, with FBI support coming from Tobin Bell and Kevin Dunn. Frances McDormand does fine with a caricature written part, whilst fans of Biloxi Blues {me} will delight in seeing the wonderfully named Park Overall laying on her hussy act in the beauty salon.At times shattering, at others frustrating, Mississippi Burning sadly only scratches the surface of the topic to hand, but for sure the movie world is all the more better for films like this, so in that it becomes an essential watch, so see it if you haven't already. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,History
Drama that gets a little too over the top,"Set in mississippi during the tumultous civil rights era, 1964, Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe play FBI agents sent to uncover the whereabouts of some missing civil rights movement supporters.

Great performances in great movie,"It's 1964 Mississippi. Three young civil rights workers are murdered. The FBI has sent two men to investigate. Agent Alan Ward (Willem Dafoe) is straight laced, idealist, 3 years in the bureau, and put in charge of this investigation. Agent Rupert Anderson (Gene Hackman) is the easy going, jovial veteran with a better sense of the world they're getting into. He used to be a small town sheriff near Memphis. None of the locals are willing to help. Anderson befriends deputy Pell (Brad Dourif)'s wife (Frances McDormand).This is a great historical drama. It's definitely fictionalized which probably irked many people for different reasons. I don't mind the differences in the minutia of history as long as the feeling of realism is maintained. That is well achieved in this movie. The best have to be the two great performances of two great actors. They are perfection.",9.0,Anonymous,History
A Few Remarks,"Gripping account of 1964 murder of three civil rights workers. In retrospect, it's ironic how the executions and burials backfired on the segregationists. The missing workers got a lot of publicity, extending over months, not just days, thereby focusing national attention on the segregationist South. Had the bodies been discovered sooner, I expect the impact would have been less. How ironic for the KKK.Hackman's sly ex-sheriff turned FBI man dominates the film. Charming one minute, resolute the next, he's a good foil for DaFoe's by-the-book chief investigator. I'm in no position to evaluate the movie's details, but the dramatic values more than compensate for a lengthy run-time. I'm so glad the producers used a plain Frances McDormand in the feminine lead rather than some glamor-puss. Plus, she really delivers in a poignant role. Filming on location also provides real color and authenticity to impoverished conditions. Can't help noticing, in passing, that Blacks don't smile when they see adversity strike the KKK. After decades of oppression, that seems odd. I wonder if that was an authentic response or the movie makers' idea.My only reservation is with the brief interviews. How did the interviewees decide what to say since all appear to young to have been mature in 1964. Oh well, that's a minor point in what amounts to a splendidly produced historical drama that should not be passed up.",,Anonymous,History
Revisiting an Old Fave - A Modern Classic,"A stirring and gripping semi-fictional account of the murder of three civil rights activists in Mississippi during the 1960s, ""Mississippi Burning"" unflinchingly shows the nightmare of race relations in the American South in riveting manner. Two FBI agents are sent down south to investigate the murders and a hellish hornets nest is disturbed with far-reaching consequences. Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe convincingly play the contrasting lawmen as they constantly butt heads on how to conduct the investigation - one a by the book worker the other a no holds barred enforcer. The scenes of beatings, lynchings, tears, arson, explosions, violence and murder move and disturb making one face the raw naked face of human nature and questioning one's own. While the film may leave a bitter taste with the current climate of ubiquitous political correctness there's no denying the film's moral and artistic impact. Moving and unforgettable, this is one of the few films where the medium elevates history to enduring importance and relevance.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Outstanding film and a great effort in dealing with difficult themes.,"First of all, let me say that ""Mississippi Burning"" is one of my favorite films of all time, I've seen it several times, on several different occasions and periods of time, and it's a movie that always manages to change my view on things. It's funny, it's the same movie but looks like there's something new to be discovered there every time I see it. But what attracted me to write something about it now is the fact of watching it for the first time after seeing the award winning film ""The Help"", whose themes are a little similar but the approach given is completely different. Comes as a sad fact that people are running away to see ""The Help"" (which is good considering how long Hollywood hasn't dealt with a heavy subject that racism is), taking it too seriously believing it's all truth but they probably never watched Alan Parker's classic.Based on a real case that happened in 1964 ""Mississippi Burning"" starts with the brutal murder of three young Human Rights activists who were helping the black communities of Mississippi. Later on, the FBI comes to town led by the young and idealist Agent Ward (Willem Dafoe) followed by the veteran Agent Rupert Anderson (Gene Hackman) to search for the boys in what most people thought to be a simple case of missing person. So, it was the 1960's, lines were divided and racism, lynchings were a common thing back there in the South and here's two agents and part of the Hoover boys trying to change things down there, having a lot of trouble in getting answers about what happened with those activists. While Ward wants to do the investigation by the book, following right procedures and all, the more experienced Anderson is quite the opposite, preferring to beat up suspects or use more unethical methods but always getting what he needs. He's a man that lived in a similar place and knows how things work so he understands he can't smile and be nice to people in order to get what he wants. Different men, clashing at each other from time to time but working on the same goal.In ""Mississppi Burning"" we feel outraged, angry, sad with all the hatred whites had for blacks in those days. Prejudice and its roots are difficult to understand, it's something we can't accept and we can't tolerate but the movie manages to give an inexcusable but quite real argument on why it happens. A key moment from the film is when Hackman's character tells to Dafoe a story that happened when he was a child, when his father killed the mule of a black man he knew, after getting sick of hearing his friends teasing him saying that the black guy was more important than he because he had a mule. Hackman concludes with this: ""My old man was just so full of hate that he didn't know that being poor was what was killing him."" Therefore, what we get here is that racism, in most cases, comes from a paranoia that one race must be better than the other, otherwise it'll take advantage of everything that exists. Absurd.Returning to ""The Help"" issue, (and I do like that film), I don't agree with that distorted, colorful and very humored presentation of how African Americans were treated in the South, the excess of comic reliefs were too much. The ones featured in ""MB"" are quite good and always followed by some tension in the middle e.g. when Rupert quotes to the Mayor Tillman about why he loves baseball as being the only thing where a black man can wave a stick without causing a riot. Sure, we're not getting a truthful full account of what really happened in 1964, there's plenty of fictionalized moments in Parker's film but it's easier to believe in this film than seeing all the humored moments of Tate Taylor's film.On its own, this is a really must-see film even though it's not much of a comfortable watching, it's a true challenge to many of us. Even today I get disturbed with some of the painful moments of it. It's haunting (in a good way). At the same time, there's more cheerful moments that are a great pleasure to see over and over (Deputy Pell getting his beard made by Anderson, best scene ever!). It's an impressive work in its technical aspects, the Oscar winning cinematography of Peter Biziou (an arguable work for many viewers since it's too dark but it reflects the serious subject); editing and sound, the music by Trevor Jones, the words by Chris Gerolmo who made a terrific script. The casting couldn't be better with Hackman in one of his greatest roles, Dafoe, Frances McDormand and the big team of villains played by Brad Dourif, Stephen Tobolowsky, Michael Rooker, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Gailard Sartain and R. Lee Ermey, all spectacular performances.Alan Parker's most impactant film of the 1980's and certainly one of the greatest films of all time, ""Mississippi Burning"" might not be 100% real and not being all so truth to the facts but still works to present a dark period of American history. It's a gripping film that should be used in schools and in colleges. A nice suggestion to watch along with ""MB"" is the TV film ""Murder on Mississippi"" (starring Tom Hulce and Blair Underwood) that recreates the trajectory of the murdered activists. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,History
"A Gripping, Tense Story!","Mississippi Burning takes place during a harrowing time for the United States and more specifically, the black people. In 1964, America was in the midst of the civil rights movement and in the South, racism was prevalent and tensions between both the whites and blacks were through the roof. This film does an excellent job on telling a story that depicts this and as a result, we get a film that's moving, touching, and even courageous.Alan Parker's film is about how two radically different FBI agents team together to solve the case of the three missing civil rights workers whom the authorities believe the Ku Klux Klan have a part in the disappearance.The acting is excellent thanks to the lead performances by Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe. Hackman, good as always, delivers an excellent ""deceptively calm"" performance. On the other hand, Dafoe plays by the book and does a great job. Frances McDormand delivers a powerhouse as well as she is the clue to exactly what happened to these three men.Overall, Mississippi Burning is an excellent, but very moving film as it tells a harrowing story. The white Southerners are depicted as evil in the film, but in reality they may have well been evil. They refused the blacks their natural rights and as a result, these sort of things happened. This is a great thriller and it's one that should keep you on your toes. I rate this film 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"A sad story, A great Movie","Mississippi burning shows Gene Hackman at his best and at his side is Willem Dafoe who also plays very strong. Mississippi Burning is a dramatic movie made in 1988 directed by the talented Alan Parker (who has also directed Fame and Midnight Express). The lead roles are played by Gene Hackman, Willem Dafoe and Frances McDorman is at her best playing a supporting role. The movie is based on the true story of the murder of three civil rights workers in 1964, so the movie is set in 1964 Mississippi.The movie begins with the three civil rights workers who are brutally murdered; the viewer now already knows that the police are involved. Allan Ward and Rupert Anderson (Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe) are sent to Mississippi to shed some light on the case. The two agents have very different personalities, Rupert Anderson used to be a sheriff in a small Mississippi town, just like the town where they are investigating missing civil right workers, he does not like to do everything by the book, in contrary to Allan Ward, he is a hard working FBI agent who likes to do everything by the book. Not long after they enter the town they see that it will not be easy, the townspeople are very hostile towards them and the KKK is involved, Mr. Ward soon ask for more FBI agents, even when Mr. Anderson thinks it is a bad idea. Soon there are an enormous amount of FBI agents in the small town, but that only makes the townspeople angrier. The KKK set a church for black people on fire to scare the black people into not talking to the FBI, when Ward and Anderson walk into a restaurant and try talking to a black person he says: ''I have nothing to say to you'' but still the townspeople beat him up for talking to people from the FBI. The FBI agents search trough the endless swamps and find the car of the civil rights workers, but they still find no bodies. Agent Anderson feels a connection with the wife of the deputy sheriff and feels that she knows something but she won't tell anything. When Ward lets Anderson do it his way they finally see what really happened.The acting in Mississippi Burning is close to brilliant, Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe are both good actors, but together they are brilliant. Gene Hackman is born for the role of an old Mississippi sheriff who knows how it all works. Gene plays very dominant and the scene in the bar where he threatens the townspeople is one of the best moments in the movie, because you don't expect it from him but still it fits him very well. Frances McDorman plays the cop who does everything by the book excellent, even his appearance, the glasses and his pale skin. Especially the scene where Anderson beats someone up in the barber shop you see that this goes against his principles.The music in Mississippi Burnin is phenomenal; there are a lot of gospel songs for example the song by Vesta Williams '' Try Jesus ''. The soundtrack is by Lannie Spann McBride, she made the very powerful song ''Walk On By Faith''. There is also a tune in the film when something bad is about to happen, when you hear it for the first time in the movie recognize the tune immediately, when you hear it you feel uncomfortable and are at the tip of your seat. Also Kitty Wells and Mahalia Jackson have made songs for the movie which are all beautiful.This movie is a beautiful movie with a perfectly cast. The music is very well made and used. Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe are a perfect duo and should do more movies together, they fit the term '' good cop bad cop '' perfectly as Gene Hackman really does look as a hardened, bad cop and Dafoe as good cop. What they shouldn't have done was basing it on a real story, because clearly the director didn't want to be restrained, because a lot was different in the movie than what really happened, only a couple of things are historically correct, asides from that it's a must watch, I give this movie an 8 or 9 out of 10, so a small 9 out of ten.",9.0,Anonymous,History

"""What has four eyes but still can't see?""","Sledgehammer-styled redemption over racial injustice and bigotry. Alan Parker directs this fictionalization of a true-life chapter in which determined F.B.I. men took on the Ku Klux Klan in 1964 after three Civil Rights workers disappeared while driving through a small redneck town in Mississippi. Parker puts the squeeze on us right from the start, omitting few horrors, eventually equating a quest for truth and justice to a violent surge of tables-turning vigilantism (as if there was no other way to succeed here). Since the lawmen in Jessup County have blood on their hands, and the black folks are too scared to speak for fear of retaliation by the whites, the F.B.I. choose to play hardball (impersonating hooded Klansman and taking on the sect's weakest members--even threatening to castrate the mayor!). This third-act revolution certainly gets the audience's blood pumping, while Trevor Jones' score sees to it that we're pounded over the head with suspenseful anticipation. But what happened to the Civil Rights Movement within the movie's time-frame? Surely it didn't disintegrate while this investigation went on? Parker scuttles it for the sake of good old melodrama. In the end, his film is just a well-made racial potboiler, though Gene Hackman's work as underling to Special Agent Willem Dafoe is top-notch (it is perhaps one of Hackman's best performances). Supporting cast also strong, and technically the picture is a superior piece of goods, but it won't be anyone's favorite movie. The spectrum here is narrow, and the statistics at the finale, rushed along, have no dramatic impact whatsoever. **1/2 from ****",6.0,Anonymous,History
Mississippi Burning-We're On Forever Fire With this One ****,"Outstanding film dealing with the murder of 3 civil rights workers during the fiery civil rights struggle of the 1960s.Gene Hackman is absolutely marvelous as a southern FBI agent attempting to track down the cowardly killers in this absolute thriller of a motion picture. He receives fine support from Willem Dafoe. The latter plays a northern FBI agent in conflict with Hackman as no matter what the FBI attempts to do, they are thwarted every step of the way by a bigoted, disgusting town and local law enforcement officers up to their necks in corruption and murder.As the wife of a deputy sheriff, Frances McDormand is fabulous as an abused woman with a conscience.The film is terrific as it shows how the bigots attempt to justify their ways as appropriate to their religion.

tabloid movie-making at its worst,"Alan Parker's volatile attack on good ol' fashioned Southern racism is meant to be a controversial film, and it is, but for all the wrong reasons. The idea (one hopes) was to make a powerful, topical docudrama, but the result is an ugly, artificial, irresponsible exploitation of an actual civil rights crisis, condescending to blacks (condemning their treatment at their expense) and elevated out of all proportion by a false sense of prestige. This is true tabloid cinema, not far removed from one of Chuck Bronson's 'Death Wish' scenarios, with enough burnings, beatings and lynchings to satisfy even the most unrepentant redneck, and with the gall to suggest that the most effective answer to bigotry is to adopt attitudes and methods even more violent than those of the Klan. A first-rate cast is totally wasted by Chris Gerolmo's one-dimensional screenplay (and not for the first time: see 'Miles From Home'). If a film insists on asking questions like, ""where does it come from, all this hatred?"" the least it can do is attempt to provide a legitimate answer.",1.0,Anonymous,History

Awesome,"I can't believe this film isn't in the Top 250 of all time. Apart from being brilliant, it's exactly the sort of powerful, full metal jacket type film that people love.As great as it was there were some sickening scenes. I lost count of the amount of times I thought to myself either 'thank god we don't live in a world like this anymore' or 'we're fortunate if the racists were based on real characters, that they'd probably be dead by now, or if not then not too far off it'.Every aspect of the segregation & bigotry was pathetic. I'm ashamed that this was as recent as one generation ago. I know racists are still in this world, but I can only see watching this film as being positive as having a positive bearing on the issue. It asks the question everyone has pondered on. Where does the hatred come from?Children will play and talk to anyone. Black, white, chinese, Jews, anyone. Unless they're manipulated, generally by adults (parents) or some form of media.The best thing with this film is that the public of Mississippi were shown to be absolute morons. The scene where the reporters questioned them, to which their replies were ""well they're different to us & don't wash"" or anything that came out of the judges' gob, was so laughable, it wasn't worth taking seriously. So I can't see how anyone can question that the non FBI whites came out positively in this film.Great acting too from Dafoe, Hackman & McDormand.One previous commenter here, claimed that if you enjoyed this film you're a closet racist & as bad as the people in the film & the ones that made it. That's exactly the sort of imbecillic extremist comment & reason why the problem of racism will probably never be completely eradicated in our lifetimes.Fair enough, the FBI may have been seen as the heroes & problem solvers and not the black townfolk. I don't know US / Mississippi history well enough to comment on how accurate or factual that is, but I would guess that the truth was bent considerably and the negroes did far more for racial problems than this film suggests, but to label people racist for enjoying this film, is ignorant & childish.So people who enjoy films about drugs are all crack addicts eh? People who enjoy a film about drink driving or joyriding are as bad as them in the story? No. Hopefully they'd never consider doing any of the above after watching it & they'd have the brains to form their own opinions. OK, there'll always be one or two of the braindead who'd slip through the net, but most people would be ok.Just because you enjoy a film doesn't mean you're sitting there nodding your head in agreement & chuckling away throughout as if it's Airplane. There were scenes in this you could barely watch & made you ashamed & embarassed, but it kept your attention for over 2 hours, and that's what all great films do.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,History

Thought-provoking and powerful...,"Although based on real events, the filmmakers go to great lengths to make it clear that this is a work of fiction. As such it works very well; it is a very powerful drama that puts the fight for civil rights to the fore. I must say I found it quite thought provoking, very well made and really well shot. The performances were all excellent with (for me), Gene Hackman standing out; although I thought Willem Dafoe was very good and Brad Dourif was excellent as the loathsome Deputy Pell. I also have to mention a couple of small roles; it was nice to see both Stephen Tobolowsky as Clayton Townley and R. Lee Ermey as Mayor Tilman; I know they didn't have an awful lot to do, but they were both quality.

"Yeah, Where Does Hated Come From?","""1964.  When America was at war with itself.""What a tagline.  It signifies perfectly what was going on in the south during the 1960's.The story to Mississippi Burning is simple.  Three civil rights workers are killed.  An investigation is launched to find the culprits.  Two FBI agents(Gene Hackman in an Oscar-nominated role and Willem Dafoe) are put on the case.  They encounter the hatred and violence that was associated with the investigation which included the usual burning crosses, lynchings, and Klan rallies.I enjoyed this movie very much and just so you know, an African-American is writing this review.  I'm not going to go get all preachy now, but I will say this, racism SUCKS!  In my opinion, some people just can't grasp the concept that people will always be different and that's why some people feel more superior over another race.  It's just sickening to know that this stuff still goes on in America today, in 2001.The acting here is great.  Gene Hackman is great as usual, and so is Willem Dafoe.  Frances McDormand is good too in an Oscar-nominated supporting role. I think two of the most over-looked performances ,however, come from Brad Dourif as Deputy Pell(who by the way is secretly a Klansman) and Michael Rooker who plays Frank Bailey, another Klansman.  Rooker's Bailey is definitely the nastiest, racist person ever brought to screen.  The scene where a group of Klansmen burn down a Black church is just terrifying.  When I saw him kick that young boy in the face, I saw just how hateful Bailey really is.  I felt like screaming to that boy to fight back even if it did mean certain death for him.Like the author of the review ""Where Does Hatred Come From?"", I think that the rally scene in the park was a very haunting scene especially with the little 3-year old kids smiling and cheering along with there parents.Lastly, I would just like to say that this movie reminds me a lot of Norman Jewison's film ""In The Heat Of The Night"" because both films have similar issues regarding racism in America.Mississippi Burning is a great film that shouldn't be missed.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,History
Still on going process,"And that is not just the theme of the movie but me trying to get a review for this movie out. Now I did not really change much in my previous efforts to get my review actually published/approved, I did change my summary line but left most of the review itself like it was. As you can tell this has changed with this incarnation, inlcuding another ""Summary line"" that sums things up (I know ""duh"").Having said all that, the movie touches on a very sensitive subject matter and I reckon February being Black History month is as good as any other month to watch this and realize certain issues America had and is still facing for a multiple of reasons. It also shows that even when you know a culprit, someone who is likely to do something again if he gets the chance, no matter how wrong it is what he did and is still likely to do .. there has to be checks and balances. And while you may think (rightfully?) that I'm talking abot current events, I do (also) mean the happenings in this movie.The pairing of Gene Hackman (more in tune of what is going because he lived certain things, flawed in his approaches as much as his partner here though) and Willem Dafoe is an amazing one. They both fight for what is right ... but as you may know, being right does not always result in you ... being right ... I don't think I have to explain that and sorry for the pun.I thin a few things are predictable here to say the least, but with great actors, like the ones already mentioned and Frances McDormand who might have her very first appearance on Film here (I didn't check, but someone suggested exactly that) to name one more ... a tough but essential viewing not just for those who are into Dramas ... might make a great double bill with In the Heat of the Night, which I also have to rewatch asap",9.0,Anonymous,History

This was a movie. It was based on an actual incident, but in the end, it was a movie. As a movie, it portrays the South and the issue of racism better than any movie before it. Director Parker creates excellent characters that embody the different perspectives of those that were involved in the civil rights crisis. Whether it is the idealist FBI agent portrayed by DeFoe or the Southern FBIrealist so brilliantly portrayed by Hackman. This movie shows us why peopletried to change the South and why other people tried to preserve that South. The result is a violent and disturbing film, which both educates and entertains.

Powerful and beautifully-made piece,"The main question looming over the head of Alan Parker's Mississippi Burning is whether or not the film has a moral responsibility to tell its true-life tale of racial hatred and murder in Civil Rights Act- era Mississippi exactly how it happened, or if artistic license grants the creators of the film the right to tell an entertaining story that maintains a powerful message of social injustice and equal rights. I am of the opinion that any film can change events for the sake of a digestible narrative, as long as the facts aren't muddied for the sake of fitting a films own agenda. Like countless old World War II movies that softened the horrors of war or fabricated tales of heroism, a film isn't required to be a moving Wikipedia page as long as its heart is in the right place.Mississippi Burning opens with the brutal slaying of three Civil Rights activists - two white men and one black - by members of the Ku Klux Klan, in an event that would capture the attention of the entire nation back in 1964. Two federal agents are sent in to investigate, Agent Rupert Anderson (Gene Hackman), a former Mississippi sheriff well accustomed to the attitudes of the small- town police forces in the state, and determined liberal Alan Ward (Willem Dafoe). Upon arrival, it doesn't take long for the agents to suspect widespread corruption within the police ranks and a possible cover-up. Anderson takes a hands-on approach of mingling with the locals and delivering thinly-veiled threats, while Ward respects rules and rank, bringing in over a hundred new agents to tackle the ever-increasing conspiracy.The idea to tell this story, which is one of the key events that led to the signing of the Civil Rights Act, through the eyes of two white men would be instantly scoffed at nowadays throughout social media, and perhaps rightly so. It is most importantly a story of the suffering of African-Americans, and of their bravery and spirit in taking a stand against it. Yet while Mississippi Burning takes a procedural, buddy- cop movie approach, it highlights how ultimately powerless the agents investigating the case are. Anyone familiar with the story will know that the men responsible for the murders were eventually brought to justice, but this is only one case in a country brimming with racial tension as social integration is introduced. It would take people such as the activists murdered in the film and the many Civil Rights demonstrations carried out in defiance that would ultimately lead to changes.At its best, the film is successful in making you feel extremely angry. As various African-Americans are lynched or attacked leaving a church by gangs carrying weapons, you, along with the bemused Agent Ward, question how such hate for another race can manifest itself within such a large portion of a community. With the FBI becoming increasingly frustrated at the lack of co-operation from the residents of the town, the film somewhat indulgently gives us a scene of Anderson having an off-the-record word with suspected Klan members, particularly Deputy Pell (Brad Dourif) and hot-head redneck Frank (Michael Rooker). It's a punch-the-air moment of badassery, and one of many such scenes that allow the film to be entertaining as well as thought-provoking. It's far from perfect of course, with a shoe-horned romance between Anderson and Pell's suffering wife (Frances McDormand) in particular feeling wholly unnecessary, but this is a powerful and beautifully-made piece featuring one of Hackman's best performances.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Um, no, it's still racist . . .","Great production values overall, but this film is still racist.The previous poster doesn't have all the facts.In reality, the FBI showed very little interest in this case.  They didn't care that two whites were killed.  It is a fact that civil rights organizers, both whites and blacks, begged and pleaded with the federal government to step in.  From watching this film you'd think that the FBI came in and had to talk people into getting involved!  It was the other way around!  This film paints the US government as giving a damn when in fact it didn't.  It does belittle blacks and it certainly belittles the work of all civil rights activists from that period, both black and white.",5.0,Anonymous,History
When the sixties didn't swing,"Mississipi Burning is a movie which succeeds on two levels.On the one hand you have a taut, edgy thriller. On the other, a powerful, and unflinching portrayal of the horrors of racial bigotry in America's Deep South.Just one criticism though, why does Hollywood always depict white supremasists as dungaree clad, banjo strumming, inbred illiterates? Racism, as we all know, has many insidious guises - this is a rather oversimplistic interpretation.That said (and historical inaccuracies aside), Mississipi Burning is a courageous and challenging film.

Now this is how you make a movie.,"Wow what a picture. This movie sets precedents for bringing to the limelight of how society was just 44 years ago (26 years ago when this movie was made). It's amazing to see how tolerant we have become in just a short period of time. This movie really speaks it's mind and holds nothing back. The acting is superb and the plot is one that can keep me interested up until the end. They don't make many movies like Mississippi Burning. Some part in this film are just so utterly powerful, it's hard to find any bad things about it. Willem Dafoe gives it his all, and he's a great actor. Of course Gene Hackman is very convincing as the tough agent whos morals outweigh his dedication to the FBI. If you are going to make some sort of statement in a movie, this is the best way I can think to do it. By simply making it a high powered, entertaining motion picture, your message can be widely accepted by its viewer and therefore making your statement known and clear.

Living Among Hatred,"Alan Parker's 'Mississippi Burning' is a hard-hitting 'how to prove they did it' (rather than a whodunnit) thriller. watching this isn't easy and at times it instigates a chill because this is still happening. People like that, communities like that still exist. 'Mississippi Burning' raises the question of where it started and how it happens. Is racism taught/learned? In a dialogue between McDormand's Mrs. Pell and Hackman's Anderson, she pretty much sums up what living among hatred can do. Even though she's good-hearted and not a racist, she married one. Furthermore, even the law, takes the side of such people and how many years did it take for it to support and protect equal rights? Meanwhile those who fight, continue to be victims of hate.Parker's direction and Gerolmo's writing are first rate. 'Mississippi Burning' has a very earthy look. The sets, props and costumes look authentic. Gene Hackman is superb as the man who's seen a lot and is yet determined to get to the end. Willem Defoe is great as the idealist copper. Frances McDormand is excellently restrained. The rest of the cast does well too.There have been numerous films made on similar themes but there's something about 'Mississippi Burning's rawness that draws you in.",,Anonymous,History
Does what Selma failed to do,"Although the subject matter of this film doesn't particularly interest me I do have to say that it does more effectively convey what last years Selma couldn't about negro rights. I saw this because Alan Parker made one of my favorite movies ever (Angel Heart - but Parker also made a lot of lesser films) and because Gene Hackman -one of the most natural and effortless actors of all time- plays in it (and I rarely see a movie for the actor). Hackman plays the lead with a very young Dafoe and both do an excellent job as well as the rest of the A-level cast (R Lee Ermey, Brad Dourif, Stephen Tobolowsky, Frances McDormand & Michael Rooker). I found the movie very entertaining and it never fails to keep your attention. It's not a classic for me personally but watching these fine actors work their craft makes this a product worthy of your time if you appreciate the fine art of cinema.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Mississippi Burning,"A great film from start to finish.This movie is as brutally realistic as it could've possibly been, sometimes the truth is nothing but harsh and cruel, this movie captures that brilliantly. Sometimes fighting for justice is more try an just a fight, it's a war between opinions, between groups of people which petiole themselves created. This movie shows how people create groups, they categorise everything they possibly can in order to a hive the ultimate goal of organisation and create that harsh line between races. The acting in this film is superbly realistic, making this into an even more vivid and compelling story. A great movie about a cause that caused the death of many innocent people.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Great stirring movie on a strong subject,"The movie opens strongly although the sequence is a bit too long in duration hence making it feel a bit too slow. Then the main characters are introduced straightly with clear hints on their characteristics and values right on their first scene. The rest of the movie runs quite slow until about two thirds of the duration, then it goes faster in pace with shorter duration on scenes and sequences. The finale is a predictable inevitability yet it serves greatly in how things turn out to be. The compromise between the two main characters sure makes the unpredictability looks better. The acting is very nice in overall. Gene Hackman sure knows how to handle a hard character like this one. He even can build enough level of ambiguity at the starting points. Willem Dafoe sure can also handle his calm character well. His calm speaking manner is kind of his signature thing of his acting, although that will work even far more better if only he plays the antagonist.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Mississippi Apartheid should be the title,"Interesting film about a real tragedy, which took place in Mississippi in 1964. Three young guys, including a black man, were killed by KKK. Two FBI came to the village, where this happened and investigated the case It was just an example of what was going on there. The best of the film is the acting of the whole group of actors and actresses led by Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe, the latter as a generous FBI detective instead of being a villain as usual. The film left no doubt that KKK is (or was) a terrorist organization with a complete lack of human feelings, only with the obsession to kill black people, to reduce its population and denigrate it any way.

Stereotypical portrayal of the southern whites.,"I hated this movie. It is not that I don't think what some did in the South wasn't a horrible crime, but this film stereotypes the South. Senator Julian Bond, a black senator, rightly said that the 'FBI really did nothing for blacks in the South'. I can't disagree with this. I love Hackmann, but his character is an insult. He is shown as trying to be Robin Hood, but that wasn't the truth.I also am tired of movies that stereotype poor southern whites. In this movie, all white and poor southern males are portrayed as ""monsters"". That's bigotry just as bad as any bigotry. Worse than that, it is false history. Just like how Gone Like The Wind glorifies the Northerners and the wealthy plantation owners, it was the Northerners and the wealthy plantation owners who ruined the South - pitting poor whites against poor blacks. So, where is the ""evil"" rich white character in this movie? Nowhere. In other words, all poor whites are ""evil"", but you can't possibly indict rich northerners and rich southerners, who kept poor people of both races enslaved and against one another. This movie is so wrong.",1.0,Anonymous,History

There is a reason that movies usually show the south as a scary place, because it is. For starters it produced the Bush family.I can't believe that Miss it didn't win more awards in 88' it should of bested Rain Man in some aspects.Amazing how Hackman can just change in and out of roles so easily, Dafoe is good as well, both actors are very believable and convey their characters well.

Southern Schizophrenia at its Down and Dirtiest,"An Alabamian and a civil rights worker who wrote my high school thesis on ""Segregation: The Damage to Whites, Psychologically, Emotionally and Economically"" ...got an A++ in Birmingham, Al in 1955.  Even though my English teacher was a Sunday School teacher, that tells you nothing in the Bible Belt when we are taught to love everyone as Jesus did, and in actions, ignore black people as though they didn't exist. So, this tale of Mississippi white trash, including the higher political officials, didn't include the class of folks most responsible for the evil done to our former slaves' children: the educated white middle-class.  Even Mississippi has some of those folks (e.g., William Faulkner).  We see the injustice spread from the mayor to the sheriff to the judges, just as we are seeing it today at the federal level with a Supreme Court that justifies handcuffs arrest for little or no reason, and puts a thief into the president's office.""Mississippi Burning"" features Gene Hackman, doing his thing, including seducing psychologically the deputy's wife for the good of the service.  And it doesn't back off from the fact that it was the residents of those towns in Mississippi that got hurt when the FBI came visiting, almost as much hurt as the 3 civil rights workers received.  At Inauguration Day 2001, as a protester facing the police cordons, I got a taste of how quickly a peaceful protest can result in violence and jail-time.  But once you understand that jail itself is not shameful when the jailers are criminals, being arrested doesn't seem so bad.  You'll see, however, what happens when the innocent jailed are released into the night with full complicity of the law enforcement people in that small Mississippi town.Great movie, and I wish it weren't so truthful about my part of the country. The look on those ignorant Mississippi people, and the sweet looks of the children there showed just how hatred is taught.  There are great lessons to be learned, and every schoolchild should be shown this.",,Anonymous,History
Gailard Sartain,"Am I the only one who thought that Gailard Sartain's performance in this movie was outstanding? I'm not particularly a fan of his; in fact, I'm hard-pressed to remember any other role he's played. Sure, Gene Hackman was great, but you pretty much expect that from him, and Frances McDormand deserved her Oscar Nomination; but Sartain really stood out as the sheriff. He managed to be compelling and charismatic and scary as hell all at the same time. Actually, so did Gene Hackman, which I think was intentional--the filmmakers wanted us to notice the very thin line between Hackman's ex-sheriff character and Sartain's Sheriff Stuckey.I thought the movie was a little heavy-handed, and its obvious attempts to be powerful and moving made me wince at times. But maybe that was necessary to portray just how dangerous and vicious racism can be when it ingrains itself into a culture. Overall, I would highly recommend this film.",7.0,Anonymous,History

"A Bit Over The Top By Today's Standards, But General Themes & Hackman Keep It Watchable","When mentally compiling a list of greatest actors of all time (Stewart, Hanks, Cruise, Hopkins, etc.), Gene Hackman isn't one who often immediately springs to mind. Yet, I cannot recall ever see him give a truly bad performance. That streak continues with ""Mississippi Burning"", a film in which his character interactions go a long way towards keeping the overall experience relevant.For a very basic overview, ""Mississippi Burning"" tells the story of a 1960s Mississippi town that is being torn apart by racial tensions after three young civil rights activists go missing. FBI agents Anderson (Hackman) and Ward (Willem Dafoe) are sent to investigate the case, each bringing a different personality and style to the proceedings.By more modern (30+ years after its release) standards, this is a movie that can come off a bit ""over the top"". Nearly all the town residents are backwoods country hicks and no person of color is really given any agency within the story (only looked at as objects of pity). While the overall themes are as relevant today (if not more so) than they were at release date, the execution seems dated.Fortunately, the acting very much carries the load in ""Mississippi Burning"". This is especially true with Hackman, who brings an electricity with him to every piece of film he occupies. The chemistry he builds with Dafoe is also solid, as the two butt heads (but ultimately learn from each other) in trying to work together to prevent a major conflict. Also turning in solid character performances are Frances McDormand and Brad Dourif.Overall, I enjoyed ""Mississippi Burning"", if not to any ""best of"" capacities. While lacking the nuance that such issues are normally given now, it largely makes up for it in earnestness and just overall acting talent. Another example of an acting gem in Hackman's underrated career.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Surprisingly bad.,"Make no mistake- this is a story that should be told, and retold, and told again. But Alan Parker dropped a major ball on this one.How could the combo of Parker, Gene Hackman, Frances McDormand etc fail so badly? I had to keep reminding myself- ""this is the man who made 'Midnight Express'"". It was easy to forget in the bad writing, the ham-handed smashing-together of facts, the cartoonish depictions.Something like this should never be fictionalized, because it could easily be written off as sensationalism. But o, how real it was. ANd how poorly it was rendered in a master's hands. Everyone's performances were not up to par, though Gene Hackman pretty much owns it as usual. Willem Dafoe was strangely incompetent. Frances McDormand's bad accent (as a southerner I really take umbrage at poor southern accents) left much to be desired.Everyone was drawn in (forgive the pun) black and white, and it just all felt so sophomoric. I feel like the heavy subject matter blinds people to its poor craftsmanship. I would like to see these events depicted again, but properly, and with all the facts. Because the truth was far uglier than this fictionalized brew could impart.",5.0,Anonymous,History

Searching for the boys leads to them finding more corruption and hatred that could have ever been imagined.Mississippi Burning is one of the few films that actually capture the brutality of some events that took place during this sad era in history. The audience is shocked and thrown around through a series of emotions, helping bring across the meaningless of hatred and the realism of that time period. The visual images portrayed are very hard to watch, making the film quite successful in its attempt to bring a point across.Willem Dafoe and Gene Hackman play ""the good cop, bad cop"" partnership perfectly, helping create an almost flawless film. The chemistry they held was almost so obscure and confusing, it was realistic and some how gives the audience a feel of a real-life partnership.

"An important film, but fails to connect with its characters","Mississippi Burning is probably the most important film to come out in 1988. It is a fictionalized account of the murder of three civil rights activists by the Ku Klux Klan in 1965, a tragic, yet important, period in American history.I only wish the film itself were better.The key problem with this film is the character connections. I just didn't feel connected to any of the characters, they all seemed fairly shallow. Gene Hackman's bad cop, William Defoe's good cop, Francis McDormand's bullied housewife, even Brad Dourif's treacherous deputy sheriff, none of them really had bit of magic required to make the viewer connect with the character. I don't think it's the acting, they all tried to do the best with what they had. I think the fault lies with the writing.I think the writer made a mistake by including too much interaction between the two FBI agents (Hackman & Defoe) and not enough into the interactions between them and the locals, and between the locals themselves. Frankly, the film relies so much on stereotype to create these characters, it's hard to get into them.I also feel they shortchanged the black cast members. They're basically relegated to being beaten around, and singing at church. There's only one important scene involving blacks, the lynching of a father who's only trying to save his cows. Otherwise, they're simply window dressing.I would love to see this film remade by a talented writer/director. Perhaps Spike Lee would love to exchange his New York City backdrop for a deeply Southern one. Now THAT would be a film.8 out of 10. It's still an important story, and a risk for Hollywood, and it deserves props for that. But it could have been better.Barky",8.0,Anonymous,History
Mississippi Burning,"When three men go missing from their small-town Mississippi home, the FBI sends a team to investigate. ""Anderson"" (Gene Hackman) is very much the more hands-on of the pair leading the team, with ""Ward"" (Willem Dafoe) more inclined to play by the book. Their arrival exposes them to an open culture of racial hatred that's not only tolerated by the local sheriff ""Stuckey"" (Gailard Sartain) but enthusiastically supported by his deputy ""Pell"" (Brad Dourif). Their arrival only seems to empower the bigots as more Negro property is trashed or razed to the ground and the people themselves subjected to increasingly dangerous violence. The audience watching this know the local dynamic and who is pulling the strings, so the thrust of this rather potent look at the ghastliness going on here comes as we follow the differing styles of policing these men use to get to the bottom of things - and in a way that will make the equally complicit judicial system sit up and take note. With a media carnival only fanning the flames and tempers flying on both sides, the agents put into place a complex sting operation to turn the weapons of these intimidators into the very things that will hopefully entrap them. Hackman and Dafoe make for a formidable coupling in this well written and presented thriller that shines an unashamed light on the toxic attitudes of the white population whose concern for the missing men amounted to little more than ""they got whet they deserved"". Dourif is also on good form as his truly odious character emerges - not just against his black neighbours, but against his own wife (Frances McDormand) too. Alan Parker and Chris Gerolmo have created a palpably criminal scenario here and the ensemble deliver well that sense of fear, loathing and superiority. The photography captures well this increasingly menacing, dark and swamp-infested environment and by the denouement I did feel that this was all a perfectly plausible train of events in the mid-1960s USA.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Symbolic Burning Crosses and Simplistic Storytelling,"Three civil rights activists (2 blacks, 1 white) go missing & presumed murdered by white racists (the Klu Klux Klan) in some small town in the heart of Mississippi during the race protests of 1964 .Enter two FBI men from the North - Hackman (the bad cop, who used to be a town sherrif in the area many years ago but now  hunts bigger fish whether it be within the law or otherwise ) and Willem Defoe (the good cop trying to set the world to rights with the belief that even racists can't be all that evil to want to kill).They investigate the case using the rules laid out by the pragmatic and by-the-book Defoe. But the townsfolk aren't quite so co-operative or helpful and the two agents seem to spend more time arguing with each other over tactics or visiting burnt out homes, farms & churches belonging to the oppressed blacks in the area than getting any nearer to solving the crime.Even with a hundred other FBI agents brought in to help out both Defoe & Hackman find it hard to get witnesses to speak up and offer any leads regarding the three young missing persons.Eventually Hackman befriends the wife of one of the town's police officers (and suspected KKK member), wonderfully played by the ever-dependable Frances McDormand (of Fargo and Blood Simple fame). Through her Hackman learns that most of the police officers and leading townsfolk are KKK members and that the 3 activists were murdered & buried in a nearby quarry pit.With the bodies exhumed all Hackman & Defoe need to close the case are the murderers, but to get what they want they have to play by Hackman's rules this time.....A highly controversial film for its day (1988). Initially it was a certainty to win a host of Academy Awards for its virtuous storytelling. But various black groups protested that the film was flawed,uneven and possibly even racist. They also argued that the film portrayed the black townsfolk as defenceless, ignorant & backward, having to rely on two white FBI agents from out of town to help them win them justice.It is fair to say that they have a point. It struck me that for most of the time the blacks portrayed in the film were blatantly stereotyped as either churchgoers, gospel singers, cotton-pickers or ignorant illiterates.This major complaint coupled with protests from white Southerners angry at being seeing as just a bunch of hick rednecks, ended any realistic chance the film had of winning any award at all.British director, Alan Parker took a very simplistic view of some true events the film is supposedly based on. It is true to say that the acting from both Defoe and especially Hackman is top notch, the photography and film score excellent coupled with the overall pace of the film makes for a very entertaining viewing. However, it is to the content of the film that counts most and this is where Parker's limited knowledge of the civil rights protests in the Deep South during the early 60s is painfully obvious.I would guess that if the film was remade today one of the leads would go to a black actor of the quality of Morgan Freeman (replacing Hackman's character) or Denzel Washington (replacing Defoe's preachy, peace-loving act). At least this would've added far more balance & realism to the film without making it too overtly politically correct. Afterall why should cynical black townsfolk ever want to co-operate with white FBI agents. In their eyes all whites are just the same and to be mistrusted in equal measure.This film could have been better perhaps from an American director rather than from an ""outsider"" looking in. Parker is very much like Ridley Scott at times: all style over content without really understanding what it is he is trying to portray, which is a great shame.If one can forgive these flaws Mississippi Burning is a very good drama. Special mention has to go to the ever-dependable Gene Hackman who returns to form as the no-nonsense former sherrif who knows how the locals tick and isn't about to be fobbed off in the same way as the rather naive & clean-cut Defoe.Overall then, Mississippi Burning, fails to get its message across but entertains us nonetheless. The acting is good, the screenplay stilted and the characterizations are pigeon-holed. But for all that this film is worth a look because even though it is very uneven the main theme of apartheid, oppression & racism between black & white Americans is a good lesson for us all to think about and realise that over the last 30 years nothing much has changed.***/*****",8.0,Anonymous,History

Great Drama,"Mississippi Burning (1988)**** (out of 4)Alan Parker's film about two FBI agents (Gene Hackman, Willem Dafoe) who travel to Mississippi to try and see what happened to three missing Civil Rights workers. I'm really not sure how to rate this film because on one hand it's an incredibly entertaining police drama that gets your blood boiling at the opening shot and it just gets hotter and hotter as the film moves along. I was having a great time watching this film and then something entered my mind that made me rather nervous. Should I be enjoying a film with this subject matter? I'm really not sure if the film is proper entertainment because even though it's based on a true story the director made no secret that events were changed up for entertainment value. The images in this film are rather harrowing and at times incredibly hard to watch but the viewer, or at least I wanted to see the racist killed. In that sense this entertainment is more like a Death Wish film when I'm not sure if should be. The images of blacks being beaten, raped and hung got me angry and my blood boiling but was it because of great film-making or because seeing these images would make any human angry? I'm really not sure how great the storytelling was but again, on one hand, it kept me entertained all the way through.What does work are the performances by the rather amazing cast. Dafoe has always been an underrated actor and his calm approach in the film is perfectly done and Frances McDormand comes off very good as well. Brad Dourif, R. Lee Ermey, Gailard Sartain, Michael Rooker and Pruitt Taylor Vince play just some of the racist and all of them are bone chilling in their performances. The group of men, on an entertainment level, make for some great movie villains. The real standout here is Hackman who delivers another brilliant performance and really has the toughest job in the film. At one point of the film he's laughing about the racist subject matter and even telling joke but in a blink of an eye Hackman changes his character to show the anger than any human would. The way Hackman juggles his character through so many emotions is a real treat to watch and in my opinion this is one of the best performances from the actor.Once again, I'm torn on the entertainment value a film like this should deliver but after thinking about it for a while I guess this is a perfect film. From what I've read, a lot of controversy surrounded this film as many people felt too many facts were changed to make the FBI look good or whatever. As I write this I'm just going to say that it might be entertainment but it doesn't coward away from showing the horrors of the South at the time.",,Anonymous,History

Interesting to watch,"Director: Alan Parker / Starring: Gene Hackman, Willem Dafoe / Release Date: 9th December 1988The movie MISSISSIPPI BURNING is a True Story resp. is based on a True Story. It is set in the year 1964. It's about the KKK (Ku Klux Klan), black people, white people, a little town, agents and a lot of crime. There are the two FBI-agents Anderson and Ward. These two characters are played by the fabulous actors Gene Hackman (Anderson) and Willem Dafoe (Ward). They are the Hoover-Boys. Anderson is the older one and has rougher methods to solve a/this case and a long time ago he was a sheriff in Mississippi. Ward is the younger agent and he has the responsibility for this whole case, because it is his one. He only takes decisions which are in agreement with (the) law and the rules. The two have to find out who is the murderer of two whites and one black man. First they try this with Ward's methods. He demands a lot of agents. Ward looks for proof, asking questions and always obeying the law. When Ward realizes that his methods fail he needs Anderson's help. He tries to solve this case with rather unconventional methods. It works! After some time they catch the members of the Ku Klux Klan.MISSISSIPPI BURNING is a good film. Maybe not the newest one but good. It is a True Story resp. is based on a true story. Therefore it is a documentation too. It is an interesting film because after watching it you know (a bit) more about the Klu Klux Klan, differences between black and white at this time and so on. First of all, for people who like such movies it is certainly very interesting. Secondly, for everyone who likes Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe this film is an absolute must.

miss burning,"Nothing wrong with this film that telling the right story wouldn't cure. In other words, imagine if you will a movie about a grape pickers strike where the heroes are two guys from the National Labor Relations Board. Or a cinematic account of an airline disaster that features the work of two guys from the NTSB. Same deal here. When I watch a movie about African Americans in Mississippi getting their rights violated then I expect the main characters to be African Americans in Mississippi getting their rights violated and not two white guys from the FBI and a white beautician! Maybe this woulda cut it back in 1963 with ""Mockingbird"" being about Atticus more than Tom Robinson. But this friggin thing was made in 1988, at least five years after its white savior sell by date had passed, when Spike Lee had finally come on the scene and shown Hollywood that black folks should be at the center of their own stories.When presented with the above complaint director Alan Parker professed to be baffled by the criticism.

Attack On Terror Made For TV 1975 Was Better.,"This movie was based on the murders of the three civil rights workers in 1964. Attack On Teror really gave a better view in story line, than Mississippi Burning. These three workers were jailed by the Deputy Sheriff on a speeding ticket. After they were released, they were on their way South out of town. Later they were followed by the Deputy Sheriff along with Ku Klux Klan members. On a country road they were pulled over shot and killed. The blue station wagon was burn't. The three were found buried in a Dam yard. This was world attention, in the news. It was all about hate not just against blacks, but also a Jew. Personally I hate the Confederate Flag. It's a symbol of hate, white supremacy and of course the KU Klux Klan. I like only the American Flag and the Christain Flag. There was no excuse for the murder of these three men. They came to investigate a church fire. No matter whether it's a white church or a black church, burning down the Lord's house is wrong. I likewise didn't like Gene Hackman's brutal tactics in this movie. Where he took the razor, from the Barber gave the Deputy Sheriff a shave, cutting his face, then dunking his head in a sink full of water. That's not how law enforcement officers should act. I would encourage you all to get the real facts and watch Attack On Terror. You will get a better story, than this low budget movie.",4.0,Anonymous,History

Powerful but not as moving as it should be,"Based on a true story. In 1964 Mississippi three civil right workers (2 whites, 1 black) disappear without a trace. FBI agents come to investigate--southern Rupert Anderson (Gene Hackman) and straight-laced by the book Alan Ward (Willem Dafoe). Anderson knows the south and the racism and believes in fighting dirty. Ward wants to go by the book and is a calm influence. They soon realize that the workers may be dead--and the town is covering it up.This received tons of negative publicity when it came out. It was based on a real life case and people said this movie distorted the facts or told outright lies. People don't seem to realize this is a FICTIONAL movie! It's not a documentary and doesn't pretend to be. It just uses the case as a starting point to show the ugly racism and hatred back then in Mississippi. It's VERY well made but somewhat disturbing to watch. There's plenty of swearing and a certain ""n"" word is used constantly.It's an important movie...but it never connected with me emotionally. I WAS horrified to see what went on then and LOVED seeing the white guys getting it at the end...but I found it simplistic. All the white guys (save FBI agents) are ignorant vicious southerners who HATE blacks. All the black people just sit back and take all the violence directed at them without even attempting to fight back. How about all those freedom marches that happened back then? The clashes between black and white? They never happened? Turning the whites into monsters and all the blacks into victims was not the way to go. It distorts what the civil rights movement was like. I was always kept at a distance. The violence was strong and horrific (as it should be) but it never moved me. Still this is worth catching. Hackman is outstanding in his role (and was nominated for an Academy Award) and Frances McDormand is great in her too few scenes. Dafoe is a disappointment. He plays his character TOO straight-laced and unemotional. I got annoyed with him rather than cheering him on. Everybody else does great. This is far from a perfect film but it shows us a somewhat accurate portrayal of 1964. I'm glad this is being shown in high schools and colleges. I give it an 8.",8.0,Anonymous,History

decent film but Oscar worthy?,"The film has been nominated in 1989 for 7 Oscars and it won the Oscar for best cinematography. It also won 13 other awards and was nominated for 10.!! I don't understand that it was nominated for best film and Die Hard, a 1988 blockbuster wasn't - now that we're talking cop hero movies. !!Anyway, the only other movie from the hand of director Alan Parker that I remember watching was ""The Life of David Gale"" and to those out there who haven't seen it yet I strongly recommend not to witness this one and only Spacey nightmare because you will be sorry!Now let's focus on the good aspects.

Frances McDormand looks really hot as usual (cfr. the major's secretary in Miller's Crossing - aaauwwwww aaauw aauw aaaaaaauuuuww babyyyyy !!!!).Another Ku Klux Klan tale seemed to me rather unoriginal at the beginning but there were some nice twists in the film which made it well worthy to be keeping track of what would happen next.

Chilling Expose of the Damage Caused by Racial Hatred and Violence,"In a barber shop, one of the locals in Meridian, Mississippi, declares, ""Our nigras were happy till those beatnik college kids came down here stirrin' things up."" This seemingly simple statement sums up much of the conflict of ""Mississippi Burning"": the clash between the ruling powers of white racial segregationists to maintain their status quo and leaders of the Civil Rights Movement bent on weakening and ultimately destroying Jim Crow laws in the south. Although the film at the outset comes off as rather ""black and white"", the white southern males portrayed as pure devils and the African-Americans as meek victims, the brutality and violence of what occurred during the Civil Rights Movements during the 1950's and 1960's is not exaggerated. The church-burnings and lynchings had been going on since the early 20th century and climaxed under Eisenhauer, Kennedy and Johnson. The happy ending was the signing of civil rights legislation by President Johnson, although many people paid a high price for this goal, some with their lives.""Mississippi Burning"" is loosely based on the investigation of three civil rights workers who disappeared while attempting to cross the Nebraska-Mississippi border in June of 1964. (Their bodies were eventually found in a hay stack, and their car was retrieved from a swamp.) Their crime: attempting to register Black and ethnic voters in the state of Mississippi. Most of the events, save for aspects of the investigation, have been largely fictionalized. However, the events as portrayed do well to paint a landscape of distrust and violence stemming from racial hatred and intolerance that was still prevalent in the deep south at that time. Federal agents, played by Willem Dafoe and Gene Hackman in tour-de-four Oscar-caliber performances, enter into what appears to be a mini-civil war. Members of the KKK and other supremacist groups run the town and surrounding area like a demilitarized zone in which white males hold all political power and keep blacks in living conditions that would give Auschwitz a run for its money. Whenever a black or ethnic minority challenges this status quo, either they are lynched or their house is burned down. And they burn down a black church for good measure. (Of course the arsonists also regarded themselves as Christians, but that's a whole other subject.) Law enforcement turns a blind eye to these heinous acts since they are in cahoots with the segregationists.Much of the film chronicles the federal investigation which reveals that the disappearance of the young men is just a tip-of-the-iceberg of racially-motivated brutality and violence maintained by a complex infrastructure designed to keep blacks and other ethnic minorities ""in their place"". ""Happiness"" as defined by the quote at the beginning of this review basically means living in squalor and fear with no hope of improvement. Simultaneously, the black community refuses to speak to the investigators fearing anything they say will have dire consequences at the hands of either local law enforcement or the supremacist groups. The African-Americans are in a no-win situation. Swift violence is inflicted upon them if they protest, but it also occurs without provocation. The racists literally get away with murder largely because they can.The film implies that these white supremacists burned several churches and homes during the course of about 2 weeks in the rural town of Meridian, Mississippi, probably excessive even by KKK standards. However, I think the point was to compress much of the violent and brutal behavior against African-Americans and other ethnic groups that reached a fervent pitch from about 1955 to 1965 into a single cinematic experience. ""Mississippi Burning"" is an attempt to demonstrate the nature of the destructiveness of the forces fighting to maintain racial inequality that had persisted since the end of the American Civil War 100 years earlier with the maintenance of Jim Crow laws.""Mississippi Burning"" is largely about how the southern white community feared the Civil Rights Movement--fear that manifested itself as crime and violence. You have to wonder what were they fearing? That a black man might find a cure for cancer, eradicate poverty, or, become President of the United States and enact a health-care bill? Fear is a very powerful force. Fear can be used to keep other people down but it can also be used to compel otherwise good people into the most heinous of acts through distorted rationalizations and fabrications. I don't believe all white southerners who fought against civil rights were pure evil. But I do think many of their minds were poisoned by fear and hatred. Maybe this film can help cure them.",10.0,Anonymous,History

A great MOVIE. (but just a movie),"1n 1964 three civil rights activists disappeared in Mississippi and the FBI was called in to investigate the disappearances. Up until this point I could be describing both actual events and the plot of Mississippi Burning but that is really about all of the similarities that there are between the two. Mississippi Burning is a great movie all in itself. The acting is superb from the two lead actors, especially on Willem Dafoe's part. (Though Gene Hackman was the one nominated for an Oscar) The movie tells a powerful story about racism and hatred in the south during the sixties. The story is engaging and the characters are convincing. However this movie cannot be considered in any way to be historically accurate. Many things were thrown into the story to make it a better movie despite their lacking in accuracy. For example the two FBI agents are portrayed as one being a by the book agent and the other being a down and dirty street smart kind of guy. An excellent selling point for a buddy cop formula but unrealistic. There is also an added character that never existed but was a black character that helped the FBI in the interrogations so that the heroes of this anti-racist movie would not all be white. This is not to say that Mississippi is anything short of excellent. But watch it for it's entertainment value, not it's historical accuracy.",,Anonymous,History
Chilling,"Why had I not heard of this before? I purchased a copy of this on sale on a hunch, and boy am I glad I did. This deals with the issue of racism in a respectful and honest way, not shying away from the disgusting and awful things done in the name of ""keeping white men pure"", and yet without ever preaching. When three Civil Rights activists disappear in Mississippi, two FBI agents are sent in to solve the case. But how can they do so, when the bigotry is so rampant? This was based upon real events, though the facts were changed... some say ""too much"", and that has led to controversy surrounding the release. The portrayal of the deep South is deeply unpleasant, and one can only hope that they are nothing like the way they were in the 60's anymore. This is gripping from start to finish, exciting and also funny. The humor doesn't try hard, and all feels very natural. This is well-paced. The characters are well-written, credible and consistent. All roles are well-cast, and Hackman, Dafoe and Tobolowsky, among others, shine. The dialog is impeccably written and delivered, with countless memorable and quote-worthy lines. This is well-produced, with great editing and cinematography. Parker is known to be a dependable director, and he does not disappoint. The DVD has an interesting commentary by him, as well as a trailer. There is brutal violence, relatively frequent moderate to strong language and disturbing content in this. I recommend this to everyone who can handle it. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,History
Murder in Mississippi,"This film essentially begins on a dark night in Mississippi with three civil rights workers traveling on a rural road when they notice that they are being followed by several cars driving much too closely behind them. After being rear ended a number of times by one of the cars, a high-speed chase ensues but ends when the civil rights workers take a dirt road and are forced to stop. It's then that a police officer steps up to the car and kills all three while several other men look on approvingly. The scene then shifts to two FBI agents, ""Rupert Anderson"" (Gene Hackman) and ""Alan Ward"" (Willem Dafoe) traveling down to Mississippi to investigate the disappearance of these three men. Within no time they become aware of the fact that there is widespread support for the violence by the white community there and that the local police department is at the center of it all. What they don't realize, however, is just how difficult their investigation will become due to the hatred and racism that has festered so long in this part of the country. Now, rather than reveal any more, I will just say that this turned out to be a pretty good film due in large part to the excellent performances of both Gene Hackman and Frances McDormand (as ""Mrs. Pell""). It does, however, suffer from the fact that a number of scenes were embellished beyond historical accuracy. But that's Hollywood for you. It should also be noted that several prominent voices within the Black community have also voiced their disagreement with the way this film portrayed certain events as well. Be that as it may, from a strictly non-historical perspective, I found this movie to be quite riveting and I have rated it accordingly. Above average.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Great Deep South drama,"Based on the 1964 civil rights workers' murders in Neshoba County, Mississippi, the film details the investigation of two FBI agents who travel down there to solve the case. One of them (Willem Dafoe) does everything by the book while the other (Gene Hackman) mingles with the people to sniff out the culprits. Their vastly different approaches create tension, but they both have their strengths and weaknesses.This is just a great film about the injustice of one group of smallminded people wanting to suppress another and those who seek a more perfect world.Hackman stands out as the main protagonist, but Dafoe is good as well. Brad Dourif and Frances McDormand play the couple that the Hackman character zeroes in on. He knows the husband is guilty and his wife is the weak link because (1.) she's also oppressed and unhappy, (2.) she sees the injustice going on and doesn't like it, but knows there's realistically little she can do to stop it without incurring the wrath of her husband & his colleagues, and (3.) she enjoys the agent's flirtations and he senses it.The film runs 128 minutes and was shot in the heart of Mississippi.GRADE: A+",10.0,Anonymous,History

"""When America was at war with itself..."" - a gripping & engaging experience !!","One year after his misunderstood masterpiece, ""Angel Heart"", the English director Alan Parker returns to the South for filming ""Mississippi Burning"", a crime / thriller drama about 2 F.B.I. agents sent to Jessup County, Mississippi in 1964 to investigate the disappearance of 3 civil rights activists.Led by the younger agent, Alan Ward (Willem Dafoe), a yankee 'crusader' and a symbol of Kennedy's administration, who follow the Bureau's rules by the book & his older and savvy partner, Rupert Anderson (Gene Hackman), a former Mississippi Sheriff, who knows the behavior, mentality, traditions & way of life of his fellow countrymen. When they suspect that the Ku Klux Klan may be operating there and responsible for the disappearance of the 3 activists with the support of the local law, Ward & Anderson start a war against the ""phantom' killers in searching for the truth, clashing with the town people that don't want them there...Superbly directed motion picture from an engaging screenplay penned by Chris Gerolmo, based on actual facts and visually stunning, shot by the cinematographer Peter Biziou, who won a well deserved Academy Award, ""Mississippi Burning"" is a gritty, realistic & sweaty movie experience, filmed on location near where the actual murders took place with even some scenes shot in a documentary style which enhanced the straight tone of the film.It moves at a thrilling pace, involving the viewer in the sordid ways of racism at his worst, stereotyping that (almost) all of the white southern characters are evil and preaches the audience about the innocent victims of the intolerance and the deserved punishment of their executioners, guided by the eyes of two different lawmen, the liberal moralist - Willem Dafoe and the conservative 'vigilante' , Gene Hackman.Hackman delivers maybe his best performance since his brilliant turn in Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Conversation"" ('74), he's determined, reckless & sarcastic, showy, but commanding the screen with gravitas proving why he's one of the best (still sadly, underrated) north American actors ever. Willem Dafoe, fresh from his Academy Award nomination for ""Platoon"", co-stars in a less prominent role, but equal effective, especially in his ""boy scout"" antagonism with the Hackman character. Frances McDormand, who scored a nomination for Best Supporting Actress, is the stand-out / revelation as the disgruntled & fragile wife of the local Deputy. She shines in a role that could have been underplayed if performed by a less capable actress. The supporting players are top notch (kudos to the casting department & Parker's skillful direction of actors) from the always remarkable as the hateful 'usual suspects"": Brad Dourif & Michael Rooker to R. Lee Ermey; Gailard Sartain; Badja Djola in an intense cameo appearance; Tobin Bell, making here his feature film debut, years before his breakthrough role in the ""Saw"" franchise and Stephen Tobolowsky, among others.In short, ""Mississippi Burning"" was one of the best films of 1988, nominated for 7 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director & Best Leading Actor for Hackman, winning 1 and perhaps only lost the Best Picture Oscar, due to the Academy's emotional vote in favor of Barry Levinson's sympathetic drama, ""Rain Man"".Highly recommended !!",9.0,Anonymous,History

An important movie to see,"I was thirteen years old when the three civil rights workers were murdered in Mississippi, so my knowledge of what had really happened was scant to my memory. Had I known more about it, I'm sure I would have enjoyed the movie more. Currently, there several YouTube videos available for anyone who's interested in learning more about the background of the film, and you can read transcripts of the trials on the internet, even the confession of the informer. While the movie may not be perfectly aligned with how events actually played out, it does provide an vivid portrait of what it was like to live in Mississippi at that time: the absolute hegemony of white people over black people, perpetuated by violence and terror, along with social and economic inequality, not to mention the policies of segregation. It's certainly an important movie for us to see so that we can really understand how difficult the civil rights movement was for those that wanted to bring about change, and it can even help us to see how remnants of that period persist to this day. All this being said, I wish Mississippi Burning had been a better movie. Very little attention is given to how the KKK planned and executed these murders. And even though the focus of the story in the film was between the two FBI investigators, we are given only scant information how they were able to uncover the evidence that led to the trial, nor were we able to see the long term efforts of the government to convict these thugs, which led to sentences of only six years for only five or six of them. In other words, there's a lot more to the real life story than the film portrays, and given the rich amount of information that we now have, perhaps this could be better served as a Netflix mini series.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Unsettling but excellently performed,"When a film is based on a true story, it can amplify its emotional effect significantly - think of classics like Attenborough's 'Gandhi', Spielberg's 'Schindler's List' and Lean's 'Lawrence of Arabia'. The tragic history behind Alan Parker's film makes an already dark tale into a deeply unsettling one. Parker has a great ability to evoke a sense of despair, having done so to great effect in the earlier films 'Midnight Express' and 'Angel Heart'. The credit isn't all Parker's, though: he had to have people convey his vision; the people he chose did so very effectively. The two leading actors, Willem Defoe and Gene Hackman, both have a knack for playing villains and menacing characters, and have played the antagonist in a superhero film. But that's pretty much where the similarities end for me. They come from different generations and play their best roles very differently, but if you first saw them in 'Mississippi Burning', you'd be forgiven for thinking that they were a long-standing film duo, like Lemmon and Matthau. Hackman and Defoe are accompanied by a range of highly talented actors, including Oscar winner Frances McDormand, the always enjoyable R. Lee Ermey, and two of the men we'd later find stirring trouble in 'The Walking Dead' – Pruitt Taylor Vince and Michael Rooker. Everyone involved in 'Mississippi Burning' plays their strengths effectively, ensuring that Alan Parker's dark historical drama isn't a film you're likely to forget.",8.0,Anonymous,History
This movie has not aged well,"It's set in 1964 Mississippi, and the story is inspired by the murders of the three Civil Rights workers--James Chaney, Andrew Goodman, and Michael Schwerner.The movie opens with us seeing the murder of the three men, but we don't see the disposal of the bodies. The FBI sends two agents to help in the search. ""Mississippi Burning"" has four primary characters. Rupert Anderson (Gene Hackman) is a good-old-boy FBI agent who was formally sheriff in a Mississippi town. He knows the culture. His boss is Agent Alan Ward (Willem Dafoe), who is younger, follows the rules completely, and is identifiable as an agent the minute he steps out of the car. The locals include a racist deputy, Clinton Pell (Brad Dourif), and his local beautician wife, Mrs. Pell (Frances McDormand). We also meet the mayor, the sheriff, a local businessman who heads the KKK, etc.Ward and Anderson have great difficulty getting anyone to talk to them amidst a spate of church and house burnings and the beating and lynching of African Americans who are willing to protest. Finally, after information provided by Mrs. Pell allows the bodies to be found> An FBI enhanced interrogator enables convictions to be obtained for civil rights violations.This movie has not aged well. On many levels, it's a ""white savior"" movie in which most African Americans are passive or helpless. Willem Defoe's character is supposed to have had experience with James Meredith earlier but consistently comes across as blind to culture and nuance. There are too many crazy scenes of FBI agents in suits and ties wading through swamps and pigpens. And Hackman's character deliberately puts Mrs. Pell in harm's way in a manner that makes no sense. Too many stereotypes are simply checked off. The conclusion is ridiculous, as convictions appear to be achieved within weeks.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Another Human Story by Alan Parker!,"Mississippi Burning is one of the best American films of 1988. It is a harrowing police drama inspired by the Ku Klux Klan murders of three civil right activists: James Chaney, Andrew Goodman, and Michael Schwerner. Alan Parker, as you might recall in his excellent 1978 drama Midnight Express, is fantastic at telling stories about the human condition as influenced by big bullies. Of course, the racist Southern Klan members are the big bullies here. In 1988, there was big controversy surrounding the film as people accused the film of being one of those ""white savior"" films. I get the justifications, but this is no documentary. This is a work of fiction that takes liberties with the truth to create a movie that not only entertains, but also scares you and make you laugh. Still, Parker does give his audience an idea what living in rural 1964 Mississippi can be like. And as for everything going on in the world today, this film holds a sense of relevance.Parker's magna opus, as some people have described the film, was a huge awards player come Oscar time. In addition to the amazing performances, I will never forget the striking images thanks to Peter Biziou's camera direction. The searing, flaming crosses, how the audience views the murder of the three men, etc. Are images that will be implanted in your brain. The 1960's is an altering year for the United States because of the Civil Rights Movement. Biziou's cinematography reflects the changing attitude and the resistance to this change. Between the cinematography, the thoughtful and well-researched screenplay from Chris Gerolmo, and the competent direction from Parker, this is a must-see film about an important time in our history.The movie came to be in 1985 when Gerolmo got his hands on a book about the FBI's investigation into the actual case. He wrote a draft of the script and later sold it to Orion. There were some interesting initial director choices such as Milos Forman and John Schlesinger, but Parker was the one who landed the role. As someone who knows all about the human spirit in extreme situations, he was a good choice to helm the project. Lots of research was put forth into the role. In the 2000's, we learn who the real Mr. X (the case's whistleblower if you will) was. But Gerolmo used Hollywood creativity to come up with who he thought Mr. X was, which allowed him to use Frances McDormand's character as film's moral character.It is 1964. Three Civil Right Activists from the North have disappeared after trying to help change voter laws. The FBI is sent to investigate. Agent Alan Ward (Willem Dafoe) does everything by the book. His partner, Agent Rupert Anderson (Gene Hackman) does not. Anderson is a former sheriff, and he understands the way of living down here. They keep their focus on Deputy Pell (Brad Dourif) and his wife (Frances McDormand). As the investigation continues, the local KKK outfit attack the African-American community. With no one on any side talking, Anderson is allowed to proceed with the investigation in any matter he sees fit.Great performances are abound here. Dafoe shows his range very easily as one movie he plays Jesus Christ and the next movie he plays a completely different role to great results. Even better were Gene Hackman (a legend) and Frances McDormand (the film's moral center). These two have fantastic chemistry with one another. Hackman's performance is more subtle, but you realize that he is growing fond of her and wants to take her away from the big, bad man that is her husband. In terms of the bad guys, Michael Rooker and Brad Dourif have made careers playing these types. Very effective!Overall, Mississippi Burning is a movie that should be seen. It is one of my favorite films of 1988 as it tells an incredibly important, relevant story. I would ignore these ""white-washing"" comments because it is a story of fiction. I would be very concerned otherwise. The intense, dramatic moments and images have been seared in my brain and they will be hard to forget. I became emotionally invested into the movie, and I am sure you will too. If you like Alan Parker's previous movies like Midnight Express or Angel Heart, you are going to like this one.My Grade: A.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Sometimes It Makes You Mad; Sometimes You Just Want To Cry,"It's rare that you find a movie with so many sobering moments that stay with you when the movie's finished, but Mississippi Burning is full of those moments. Some are just sobering - like the shot of the two water fountains, one brand spanking new, marked ""Whites"" and one old and run down, marked ""Coloreds."" Some scenes are unsettling, with overly racist and obnoxious things being said - ""niggers don't even take baths and they stink!"" Some scenes are frightening - little children laughing and applauding along with their parents at Ku Klux Klan rallies. Then there's the violence - lynchings and beatings and murders of local blacks. This isn't a movie for the feint of heart. It isn't a ""pleasant"" movie at all, but it's certainly a powerful one.It's loosely based on the murders of three civil rights workers in Mississippi in 1964, and it revolves around the two FBI agents leading the investigation - Ward (Willem Dafoe) and Andersen (Gene Hackman). This was a powerful performance from both men. Hackman I expected that from, because I consistently like Gene Hackman's work, and he was nominated for an Oscar for this role. Dafoe I have had mixed reactions to over the years, but he was very good in this. Ward and Andersen are both FBI agents, but very different in their approach. Ward is a Northerner, and wants to do things by the book. Andersen is a southerner who knows that ""by the book"" won't cut it when dealing with racists and the Klan. Watching them work out their relationship is interesting.There's a large number of secondary characters, all of whom have significant roles to play in the unfolding of the story. The most important of them is probably ""Mrs. Pell"" (played by Frances McDormand, who was nominated for the Best Supporting Actress Oscar) - the wife of one of the sheriff's deputies implicated in the murders. Her Oscar nomination aside, I admit that I wasn't really taken with the character of Mrs. Pell and the implication of some type of friendship or relationship brewing with Andersen, although the scene in which her husband deals with his ""problem at home"" (as one of his good ole boy buddies called her) is brutal, and another of those scenes that stays with you.The name of the movie refers to the name of the FBI investigation, although it's put to good use as there are repeated scenes throughout the movie of the burning of black churches and homes, with a few burning crosses thrown in as well. It is unsettling and at times unpleasant to watch, but it's also very good. (8/10)",8.0,Anonymous,History
"A searing, extremely powerful, poignant and deeply unsettling film - One of the greatest examples in American film-making in the past 30 years.","Mississippi Burning (1988)Number 1 - 1988Top 15 - 1980sTop 100 - All Time1964. When America was at war with itself.Few other films are as powerful, meaningful and profoundly unsettling yet simultaneously intense and action packed as Alan Parker's Mississippi Burning. To say that this film is good would be an understatement. There are two ways this film can be seen - Firstly this is a first rate police thriller, superbly shot, it delivers maximum impact.Secondly, and most importantly in my opinion, this film is a sumptuous documentation of extreme racism in the Deep South in the 1960s. The Declaration of Independence states that ""All men are created equal"". This ain't true in Mississippi. This film is harrowing, it is not easy to watch and at times it is simply emotionally overwhelming. This is one piece of cinema which displays the mindless and infinite callousness and savagery that is possessed by humanity. What makes us so hateful? This film does not investigate such complex issues,it rather shows its devastating effects.The murder of 3 civil rights activists in Mississippi in 1964, attracts external police forces (mainly the FBI) to investigate the disappearance of these 3 young people (2 white, 1 black). Head of operation is Mr. Ward, played with a commanding and controlled brilliance by Willem Dafoe and accompanied by Gene Hackman. Now here is the thing with Hackman, he is one of the greatest screen actors of our time. His presence transcends beyond the screen, whenever he is on the screen he steals the show. Few other actors are as magnetic as Hackman, especially when we see him get angry.This is an excellent achievement, with an outstanding cast, including Frances McDormand in a superb performance.When you see this film, ask yourself one question.

Terrifying,"This has to be one of the scariest films I've seen. Scary because so much of it was real. Gene Hackman plays an FBI agent, a hard southerner originally from Mississippi. He's a good man but world weary and tough. He's as hard as nails and everyone knows it. He's also a realist who knows what's what. His partner brilliantly played by William Defoe, is very straight-laced and by the book, a fish out of water in the corrupt Mississippi town he finds himself in. The formula for the two investigators sounds cliched but they nicely switch things up by making Defoe the one in charge. He's a slick up right forward thinking person.The film has a dark look, a lot of it takes place at night, the colours look natural, at times it takes advantage of neon lights, other scenes are lit by fire. The film isn't afraid to show real poverty, sweaty faces and dirty homes. The film opens in 1964 where 3 young men are pursued and then murdered one night in KKK territory. The film is almost like a civil war, showing the extreme violence and division in the country at the time. This is a brutal adult film about bigotry and violence, it's not the kind of thing you're going to have all your friends over and watch together. I'm glad though that it's a powerful film and not frivolous light entertainment. It's a shame when more people would prefer to watch the latest King Kong V Godzilla than this. The film is set in a small racist town where everyone knows everyone and society is still segregated, the sheriffs word is also final on matters, if he says that's the way something happened then that's the way it happened. The film is pretty black and white in terms of depicting the majority of whites in the town as a bunch of intolerant, crude, drunken violent bullies. The black people on the other hand are meek, cowed, peaceful and decent. The film is though honest about the level of hate on display at the time, this was real. Gene Hackman in particular is amazing in this film, he's got so much screen presence, you really believe when he walks into a bar and the room goes silent. Character is amazing. So much screen presence. Love seeing him play a good man. William Defoe is given a role where he's not able to express as much emotion but he too does a superb job with what he's been given and makes that character his own. There's want riveting chase sequence at night with pounding music. The ending equally I found satisfying, you get so invested in this story. The film does also step back and ask the question - Was it the death of 2 white people which generated so much anger and attention from the authorities? The film also nicely captures the media frenzy which develops in the little town, things feel tense throughout.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Yet the most outstanding performances are given by two of the finest chameleon actors around; Frances McDormand (who garnered an Oscar for this film) and Brad Dourif (Oscar nominee for One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest), both of whom are so complete in their work that it actually takes a moment to recognize them--you forget they are actors.

The most horrifying part is that this actually happened,"After watching 'Mississippi Burning', I was disgusted with the South. Sure, not all southern people are racist b***ards, but it does have its share. When I found out that this was a true story, I was sickened, but overall, not surprised. It is clear that the South doesn't have a very good record, but the fact is, this crap still happens, although not as much.This was a great movie. I thought Gene Hackman did a terrific job, and so did Willem Defoe. This was a very compelling story,and not a very easy one to watch. There were certain parts where I wanted to yell ""Stop! What is the matter with you!"" Human nature can be a sickening thing, and this movie did a great job of showing this.The KKK basically ran that town, and Mississippi, and a good deal of the south in the 20's through the 60's, and showing this very clearly made this movie very haunting. The way that town treated their black community is horrific. This is an outstanding film, and should be watched. I think that if you enjoy realistic movies, and can stomach some very disturbing parts, than watch this, because this is the best movie of its kind I have ever seen.

Powerful and insightful,"Mississippi Burning concerns the story of three civil rights activists that disappear one night without a trace in Mississippi. Two detectives are assigned to the case, amidst a backdrop of racial hatred and deceit. No one is willing to talk about what really happened that night on the lonely stretch of road.This movie is a must see, It portrays the south as it was in 1964 with great accuracy and honesty. Films like this need to be made, warts and all, that depict the racial ugliness of the time. Some people argue that stories like this should be sanitized, because they are too politically incorrect. I disagree, for this is how history was, and it needs to be shown in an accurate light, no matter how hard it is to watch.The two leads are great, particularly Willem Dafoe, as detective Ward who is determined that justice will be served, whether the crime victim is white or black.I found this movie to be honest and insightful, telling history as it really was.

4 stars,"**** out of ****: I wouldn't  classify this as the definitive Civil Rights movie because it's more specific to this one case and doesn't really shed light on the whole picture of Southern racial abuse along with all its horrors. The most graphic part of the film is at the beginning, when a car driving down a barren road is pulled over by a couple of police officers. Rather then write a ticket for speeding they taunt them and shoot them. We don't really know exactly what happened, we have some idea that these officers are a little more than just consciencous of fast drivers, and that's what hooks us in. Two officers, Gene Hackman and William Dafoe, are sent into investigate, and once we know what they're investigating, there's the irony of the audience now knowing what's going on but the characters don't. Hackman and Dafoe have an interesting chemistry, I won't say good, because they start off in such distant alignments from each other, that there's no real partnering/interaction at first. Dafoe is a by-the-book guy who's young and inexperienced and Hackman is a somewhat more playful guy who's from the area and tries to act like he's ""one of the guys"" when they interact with locals. There's an interesting power relationship between them, because despite Dafoe's inexperience and lack of street smarts, he's the senior officer on the case, but regardless of who really has more power between them, they don't really get anywhere  for a long time with this town. The drama is in a curious deadlock of the FBI officials saying, ""what happened to these missing people? where are the bodies?"" and the locals in the town saying, ""we don't know, we didn't do anything? why don't you just go back and forget about the case?"", and the two parties here start acting like my senile grandparents who ask the same question over and over thinking that they'll get a different response. This would get kind of boring, except for the changes happening within Hackman's character who starts to become more passionate about what's happening as he befriends the deputy's wife, Frances McDormand, and just gets more and more p***ed about stuff. Hackman really was at the heart of this movie and McDormand's character really added a lot to the movie, as a more innocent and foolishly youthful woman than the roles she normally gets. I wouldn't describe the film as jump-out-of-your-seat exciting, but the drama and quality is there underneath all the grittiness.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Hackman and Dafoe shine alongside McDormand,"""Hatred isn't something you're born with. It gets taught... At 7 years of age, you get told it enough times, you believe it. You believe the hatred. You live it... you breathe it. You marry it.""Alan Parker's 1988 film which was nominated for seven Academy Awards is another reminder of what a great career Gene Hackman had, although this time he got to share the spotlight with a pair of other wonderful performances from Willem Dafoe and Frances McDormand. The fact that Mississippi Burning isn't even considered one of Hackman's top ten most popular films just proves how many great films he's made over the span of five decades (he retired from acting in 2004). Since the film was loosely based on a real incident surrounding the disappearance of some civil rights workers in the south during the 60's many people complained that the film wasn't faithful to the story, but Parker never made such a claim and always said his film was a fictional tale of events that could've taken place during the time so I don't see any need to complain about it. Some similarities can be found with the classic film directed by Norman Jewison, In the Heat of the Night, which handles a similar theme about racism. Films like this are important reminders of how dangerous humans can be when they let hate and racism govern their hearts. It is so easy at times to forget those dark moments in our history and act like they never happened, but once in a while we get films like Mississippi Burning that remind us of the horrors of humanity and the sacrifice people made to end them. These are films with important messages which also happen to be well made and count with a stellar cast. Its only Oscar win was for Peter Biziou's wonderful cinematography, but there is so much more worth recommending about this classic from the 80's.The film introduces us to three civil rights workers as they are detained by a police vehicle while they were about to exit a small Mississippi town. The officers begin making all sorts of hateful remarks towards these men and violently shoot them for trying to stir up their quiet and organized segregated town. A few days later, two FBI agents show up in town looking for these disappeared citizens, who they fear have been murdered. Agent Alan Ward (Willem Dafoe) is in charge of the operation despite his young age. His partner, Agent Rupert Anderson (Gene Hackman), is more experienced and is not afraid to speak his mind about him as someone he believes to be well educated but lacking more field work. Ward likes to do things by the books, but Anderson who was a former Sheriff in a similar Mississippi town knows the mentality of these places and believes his methods won't get them anywhere in a place like this. The Mayor (R. Lee Ermey) isn't pleased with the agents visit because he believes his segregation methods work and that things are run differently here than in the south. The agents learn it quickly while they're trying to collaborate with the local officers. Sheriff Ray Stuckey (Gaylord Sartain) is very protective of his boys, especially of Deputy Clinton (Brad Dourif) and officer Frank (Michael Rooker) who were the officers involved in the murder. It doesn't take the agents too long to realize what happened, but they can't find anyone in town who will speak to them since the victims have been threatened by the KKK. Every time someone seems to be interested in speaking up, they are immediately intimidated by the gang through violent acts. Ward's tactics don't seem to have an effect, but Anderson may have found the perfect ally in Mrs. Pell (Frances McDormand), the Deputy's wife who rejects his actions.The script handles the civil rights case with care and avoids falling into melodramatic territory by remaining gripping and suspenseful. There are plenty of thrills along the way and some violent scenes that are actually less horrifying than the hateful things these men say. It's true that the civil right theme is told through a white's man point of view, but I think it still remains compelling and well intentioned. In the end it becomes entirely a revenge action film, but it's handled in a convincing and realistic way. Hackman, Dafoe, and McDormand are in the center of the movie and they all deliver gripping performances playing off each other extremely well. Brad Dourif and Michael Rooker are given the stereotypical racist characters who are very easy to hate. Rooker seems to be playing the same character from The Walking Dead series only this time he actually acts upon his remarks more than simply being a loud mouth. Hackman and Dafoe are on the same side despite having very different approaches and that difference helps build the tension and relationships in the film. Parker's sensitive direction works in a film with such a controversial subject matter that could be easily manipulated. Mississippi Burning is a classic that shouldn't be missed by fans of Gene Hackman and his impressive career.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,History

This film tells the story of the follow-up investigation by two FBI guys named Anderson (Gene Hackman) and Ward (Willem Dafoe). Although the triple murder is based on a real-life case, script plot points are mostly fictional.The Anderson and Ward characters are fictional. And it's unfortunate that the writers here portray the FBI as the good guys, which is a distortion of the historical reality. The Mrs. Pell character (Frances McDormand), also is fictional and distracts from the case. While the inclusion of some fiction can be acceptable in real-life stories, since such films are not intended as documentaries, ""Mississippi Burning"" deviates too much from the historical truth, and that's my main criticism of the film.Some have argued that the film is biased because it presents a stereotyped view that all Mississippi Blacks were victims and all Mississippi Whites were villainous. But that's pretty much the way it was back then. Even now, I'm not sure a lot has changed since 1964, though villainy may be more subtle now. Because of the heavy political overtones, some viewers will necessarily be put off by the film's overall message.The visuals are the real strength of the film. Detailed prod design, period costumes, and the casting of local, non-professional actors make the film come alive with a sense of realism. Much of the plot takes place at night, thematically appropriate given that evil redneck thugs terrorized an entire race of people and caused untold suffering.Casting is appropriate, with the possible exception of Willem Dafoe, an actor with an annoying voice. Cinematography is quite good. Colors are highly muted; lighting is fairly low, with night scenes quite dark.""Where does it come from, all this hatred (toward Blacks)"", asks one character. It comes from the reality that the South never recovered from the Civil War. And all that resentment expressed in 1964 to some extent still exists, some 25 years after ""Mississippi Burning"" was made, and a half-century after the event upon which the film is based. Many Southern Whites just cannot let go of the past. Perhaps they never will ...",8.0,Anonymous,History
Great movie,"Burning Mississippi is a very motivational and inspiring movie about the civil rights movement in the south. This movie displays a very negative image of the Ku Klux Clan (KKK) and it shows the brutality of their actions in the 1950's and 60's. In the beginning the movie demonstrated how the mindset was in the state of Mississippi. The movie introduces this mindset through FBI agent Anderson. Anderson has no respect for the black people in the south and believes that the state has just concerns in the segregation of Negroes. Anderson's boss Allen Ward disagrees with his philosophy and he sees everyone equal. The two Agents are sent to Mississippi to uncover what happened to three boys earlier in the month, two of the boys where white and one was black, which made the case very interesting. Agent Anderson saw the case as a simple ""missing persons"" case where as Allen Ward sees it as a full-investigation and a big case. At first in the movie the Depute and the County Sheriff see the two FBI agents as idiots and showed them no respect. All they told the agents is that they where released from the police department at nine o'clock and they did not hear from them since.",10.0,Anonymous,History
This happened in the South nearly a century after the end of the civil war,"The oeuvre of Alan Parker can be divided into music related films of a more entertaining character (for example ""Fame"" (1980) and ""The Commitments"" (1991)) and more heavy films having political and social themes. Examples of the latter category are ""Birdy"" (1984, Vietnam war) and ""Angela's ashes"" (1999, poverty).""Mississippi burning"" is definitely of the second category, being about racism in the deep South of the United States. The film is about the murder on three civil rights activists making the black people aware of their voting rights. It is based on actual murders committed in 1964.This year 1964 is, when you think about it, real shocking. The American civil war was from 1861 to 1865 and was meant to end slavery. Ending slavery didn't however mean ending discrimination and racism. The Ku Klux Klan and later the ""seperate but equal"" policy replaced in the South slavery, last mentioned policy being more seperate than equal.The fact that racism was so virulent nearly a century after the end of the civil war is not the only shocking thing in ""Mississippi burning"". Shocking also is the level of violence it gives rise to. There is much violence in ""Mississippi burning"", often symbolized by the burning cross of the Ku Klux Klan.Take for example a car chase. In an urban area such a chase is more spectacular than threatening (""The French connection"" (1971, William Friedkin)) and sometimes even funny (""The Blues brothers"" (1980, John Landis)). In ""Mississippi burning"" the chase is however in a swamp area and is done with pick up trucks slowly approaching their target. Really threatening indeed!In a film with so much violence a comic relief is not an unnecessary luxury. This relief is provided by the two FBI agents Rupert Anderson (Gene Hackman) and Alan Ward (Willem Dafoe). Their relationship is characterized by the old hand (Anderson) versus smart and academic rookie (Ward) division of roles. One of their most revealing dialogues is the following:Ward: ""Some things are worth dying for.""
Anderson: ""Down here, things are different; here, they believe that some things are worth killing for.""""Mississippi burning"" has much in common with ""In the heat of the night"" (1967, Norman Jewison). This film is also situated in Mississippi, is also about racism and contains also the old hand - academic rookie dynamics. Only in this film a black man is not the victim but the suspect of a murder case, the suspicion based on nothing more than racism. On top of that in ""In the heat of the night"" racism is also intertwined in a complicated way in the old hand - rookie dynamics.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Mississippi Burning is too fictionalized, but a great and compelling drama with phenomenal acting performances","Mississippi Burning is directed by Alan Parker and written by Chris Gerolmo. It's loosely based on the 1964 murder investigation of Chaney, Goodman and Schwerner in Mississippi. It's a fictionalized but still a powerful and compelling drama that is really hard-hitting. It's worthy of all the nominations at the Academy Awards, and truly worthy for the Best Cinematography.The film stars Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe in the roles as the two FBI agents that gets assigned to investigate the disappearance of three civil rights workers. These FBI agents are widely different from each other and I would say that it makes for some interesting and great character interactions between the two, plus that they get to show a completely different acting performance and both of them did a very good and compelling job.Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe isn't the only actors that gives terrific and amazing performances, Frances McDormand also does a phenomenal job. There's a lot of great performances in this film, almost everyone of the supporting cast. Rightfully cast.I have never been to Mississippi so I can't say for sure that the characterization or the representations is right, but I have done some reading and I believe it's actually pretty good.Mississippi Burning was criticized by activists involved in the civil rights movement and the families of Chaney, Goodman and Schwerner for its fictionalization of events when it was released and I understand why. I don't really get why they went in this fictionalized route as there's so much things that are pure fiction, some are minor and and big. But honestly the film is incredible and worthy of its nominations. I wouldn't say I enjoyed the movie as it's depressing because the things we see in the movie happened and honestly continues to happen but in smaller ways. But it's a great movie and a must watch, for everyone.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Powerful, thought-provoking even 16 years later","I have just viewed this film again, 16 years after it was released. Its power, not just in how the FBI eventually gets its men, but also how any human beings can treat another group the way they did, still has a place in 2004. It is a sad commentary on western society that even during the 'swinging sixties' this kind of behaviour was tolerated.The courage of Mrs. Pell, the sheer bloody-mindedness of Anderson to achieve a conviction, and the weary acceptance of Ward that to achieve conviction some corners had to be cut, is still as pertinent today as it was when the film was set. Hackman's performance was, as always, brilliant and Dafoe is a much underrated actor.Undoubtedly one of my favourite films, not just for the acting and the thought-provoking storyline, but also because whenever we watch it, it teaches us something important.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Still Thrilling,"Thrilling and strong movie - like In the Heat of the Night a classic with Willem Dafoe and Gene Hackman delivering strong performances.

Great!  B.S. but great!!!,"This film is spectacular. Too bad it's glorified nonsense. The FBI did not want to be in Mississippi in 1964. J. Edgar Hoover was a devout racist homophobe...ah hell he was a complete bigot. He was extremely reluctant to send agents down south to investigate 3 people he couldn't have cared less about. It was only under intense pressure that he finally caved.Furthermore, the agents are depicted in this as heroic & defenders of the peace & justice as if they were Jedi's or something. Southerners were not & still are not easily intimidated by outsiders. It is true that they respect authority, perhaps a little too much, but that's local & state authority not federal. It was actually the other way around. And if you don't believe that, then remember this, Southerners ran out the mafia during prohibition with their ultimate ways of dispatching one creatively. Southerners take great pride in running out Capone & his ilk by using such measures as sticking a guy to a post & stuffing his testicles in his mouth that were bitten off by a calf. Hence the reason the mafia shifted to Canada for their bootlegging.In spite of all that, I know how Hollywood likes to distort things for the purposes of entertainment & emotional interests. (i.e. KKK in ""A Time To Kill,"" ""Top Gun,"" etc.) So, taking that into consideration, this film was awesome! Willem Dafoe is pretty good but the highlight is Gene Hackman as he delivers yet again in a role reminiscent of his ""Popeye Doyle"" role! Even though it was pure hogwash, there are vital facts still in the story & to watch Hackman go to work on the guy from ""Cuckoo's Nest"" is classic & probably the inspiration for Russell Crowe's character in ""L.A. Confidential!"" Bottom line, my historical anal retentiveness put aside...9/10",9.0,Anonymous,History
Exposing America's Ugly Underbelly,"Oof, finally got around to viewing this Oscar-nominated Best Picture from 1988 and what a tough watch. This sweaty tale of the FBI taking on the Ku Klux Klan in Civil Rights-era Mississippi has taken on renewed relevance in today's world, given the ugly, hateful faction of Americans who our current President has encouraged to crawl out from beneath their slimy rocks. This is no liberal feel-good version of the fight against racism and bigotry, in which a call for mutual understanding wins the day. No, in this film, the only way to beat ugliness is to be yet uglier.

Imperfect but nonetheless powerful and even essential viewing,"Mississippi Burning has cultivated a well-deserved reputation as a powerful but nonetheless imperfect film. It is powerful not only because of the emotionally charged topic (civil rights and racism) but also due to some effective acting, strong characterisations and also a shudder of drama and tension throughout. However, it is imperfect because it is slightly overlong, somewhat historically inaccurate (the FBI's role in promoting civil rights was far more ambiguous than portrayed here) and even clichéd at times. Luckily, the film does neither abuses those clichés nor plays them entirely straight, allowing the film to retain its impact after many years.The film's power and tension is conveyed even during the very first scenes. The car chase is unnerving and the murders themselves are even moreso, with the merest splatter of blood hinting at the violence which occurred. Not a single moment is wasted on unnecessary blood and gore, which would otherwise have been unfitting for a historical drama like Mississippi Burning.Tension in the film is built even more effectively by intertwining the more sedate scenes with conflict and even outright violence. For example, Agent Anderson's quiet dialogues with the deputy sheriff's wife are punctuated by churches blowing up and arguments between Agent Anderson and Agent Ward.Speaking of Agent Anderson and Agent Ward, their characterisations are quite strong, in that the film provides a substantial backstory explaining their involvement and motivations (particularly Anderson) but also somewhat clichéd. This is because they both represent the perennial conflict between the renegade hero (Anderson) and the by- the-book, obstructive police chief (Ward). These roles are subverted though because Anderson sometimes does call Ward out for not properly following procedure, while unlike most police chiefs Ward knows exactly who the enemy is and does not resort to dramatics as readily as your average police chief type.The characterisations of the supporting cast are predictably less substantial. Much insight is provided into the wife's reasons for sticking with an obviously unpleasant husband, but the villains are broadly painted as hateful racists. The reason is likely to make it easier for the audience to oppose them and on that level such broad, simplistic characterisations work well.In addition, such characterisations do not necessarily prevent the actors from providing good performances. Brad Dourif does well representing your average bully; able to beat up on weaker people but impotent against a powerful adversary. Michael Rooker is even better; his Frank Bailey is comfortably the nastiest, most menacing character in the film, with none of the blustering of Stephen Tobolowsky's character. Tobolowsky's character is suitably provincial but was he really meant to be that blustering? R. Lee Ermey, Gailard Sartain and Pruitt Taylor Vince basically play good ol' Southern boys, with Ermey infusing a little Sergeant Hartman into his performance when he argues with Ward.On the other side of the coin, Willem Dafoe is cool, clinical and professional, while Frances McDormand plays the beleaguered housewife very well. However, it is really Gene Hackman who steals the show. Jocular one moment to physically violent the next, every scene with him is essential viewing because he raises the tension and drama. Badja Djola also warrants a mention, for his character veritably oozes hatred and menace.The dialogue is suitably provincial, with some rather zany lines (""cornhole ******?""). The plot plays much like a standard cop drama, with police being required to solve a mystery. Luckily, such a premise is exploited for maximum value, not only because of the tension and drama, but also because of the high stakes (freedom for a hitherto oppressed people).Ultimately, Mississippi Burning has its clichés and historical distortions, but ultimately the acting, characterisations, drama and tension make for a potent film and essential viewing.4.5/5 stars",9.0,Anonymous,History
Something's burning in Mississippi  and I think it's hatred!,"Recently, with my wife, I watched the 2011 film ""The Help"" which is a truly brilliant movie that I can only recommend wholeheartedly. That same movie also sparked my desire to dig up some other terrific films about civil rights, and then it doesn't take too long before you end up at Alan Parker's ""Mississippi Burning"". Although nearly 30 years old now, this is still an immensely powerful and often shocking tale inspired by the real-life murders of 3 young activists by members of the Ku Klux Klan in a small Mississippian county in the spring of 1964. I'm European and there isn't too much known around here regarding the facts of this case, but I can easily imagine that turning this true crime case into a fairly large-scaled film production much have caused quite a bit of amok and controversy even 24 years later. Still, even though the references towards the so-called 'Mississippi civil right workers' murders' case are unmistakable, director Alan Parker primarily approaches the events from a more objective viewpoint by focusing on the FBI investigation. As the sudden disappearance of the 3 youngsters in rural Mississippi is considered alarming (perhaps because 2 of them are Caucasian), the FBI sends two agents over to the Magnolia State. Alan Ward is a young graduate and ambitious city agent who strictly follows the protocol, whereas Rupert Anderson is a former Mississippi small county sheriff himself and uses more unorthodox methods to find out the things he want. Needless to say their styles and personalities often clash, but it's Anderson who makes the most progress in the case, especially when he develops a tender – almost poetic, in fact – relationship with the wife of the sadist deputy (and KKK-member) Clinton Pell. Admittedly, you could blame director Alan Parker and scriptwriter Chris Gerolmo their excessive overuse of stereotypes All the FBI folks (except for Anderson) are uptight desk clerks with fancy suits, all the black people are mute victims, the women are docile and petrified wives and all the racist rednecks are ignorant and violent scumbags. Of course, just because the stereotypes are such opposites, the confrontations between them are extremely intense and atmospheric. The suspense literally mounts when the rednecks are relentlessly chasing an innocent black guy, or when Agent Anderson nonchalantly walks into the unofficial KKK clubhouse. Another reason why I personally don't mind the use of stereotypes is because it gives the fantastic cast the opportunity to showcase their talents. Awesomely talented guys like Michael Rooker, Brad Dourif and Pruit Taylor Vince are truly brilliant in depicting their vile and loathsome Southern redneck characters. But the greatest performance undeniably comes from Gene Hackman, as he almost naturally shapeshifts between hard-boiled law enforcer and tenderly comprehensive gentleman during his sequences with Frances McDormand. Another umpteenth brilliant performance from one of the greatest actors of the 70s, 80s and 90s.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Blind Hatred,"A little after the half way point in this film a main character is describing how how hatred is taught and that the after hearing something numerous times you stop questioning it.This film is one of the best films I have ever seen. I first watched it in my 8th grade history class which is almost 10 years ago now. The thing that struck me the most was how no one person was actually ""evil"" but when a group of people get together it's a different story.The atmosphere is genius, the layout of the town looks vivid and alive. Unlike some movies with only two or three dedicated sets this one literally is the town. The people of the town seem pitch perfect for their roles, from the F.B.I. agents to the town Sheriff to everyone else. While I'm on the topic of characters I want to say how much I appreciated the fact that they, in one way or another, developed most of the people you meet by showing where they work, live, and give them personality.Now to discuss a little bit of the tone of the film. First off I never completely understood racism. The hatred of a group of people for any reason never made sense to me. As I said in the start of this review when something is taught to you, you don't think to question it. The only conclusion I can come to is that it's relying on blind hatred of some offense you think happened or were told happened. If that little bit didn't make sense racism doesn't make sense to me.The little things that are present here is what makes it a great film especially since none of the character development is done for the sake of the plot but for the sake of the character.Both Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe are great actors and are amazing in there roles but between the two Hackman has a more subtle way about the way he investigates a case unlike Dafoe who always thinks more agents and equipment is better then Hackman's method of talking pleasantly to people to get the truth without the town turning on him.I could go on and on about this movie and the more I want to write the more I know the longer this is the less it'll be read. So I'll leave you with this, there are very few movies that leave you with a lasting impression and this is one that'll I'll be watching again and again.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Excellent thriller with a profound message,"Alan Parker's Mississippi Burning is a surprisingly good police thriller that mixes the intrigue and mystery of a police investigation with a commentary on American culture in the 1960's, and said people's attitudes towards racism. It's rare for a film to combine these elements properly, and many have failed at it, but through it's efficient pace and competent piecing together, Mississippi Burning achieves it's aim admirably. Mississippi Burning is a very professionally handled film and credit for that has to go to the director, who has a habit of putting together very professionally made films. The influence that this film has had on later crime investigation films such as the magnificent 'LA Confidential' is evident throughout, and that adds yet more credibility to the proceedings. In spite of it's turbulent plot, Alan Parker never sets out directly to shock the audience, and despite several scenes of violence, it's always the film's plot that takes centre stage and Alan Parker doesn't stray from that as many other directors have done. This film doesn't need to shock and offend to get it's message across.The plot follows the disappearance of three men - two of them white Jews and the other a young black man. We then follow the fortunes of two FBI men that come into town to investigate the disappearance. The acting in the movie is strong throughout, with William Dafoe and Gene Hackman heading a strong cast. The two stars do a great job of drawing the audience into the movie, and the two shine throughout. They are joined by a host of lesser-known stars, such as Frances McDormand, Brad Dourif, Stephen Tobolowsky and a great little turn from Michael Rooker as a racist KKK member. The themes that are implemented into the plot are impressively portrayed, with the social study being the most prominent of them. Mississippi Burning adequately denounces hatred, and does a great job of getting across the stupidity and pointlessness of it. The film is also notable for a great atmosphere throughout, which is matched by a great soundtrack that creates a very foreboding and tension filled feeling. My only real criticism of the movie is due to it's ending, which goes on a bit and kills the atmosphere that the film has done such a good job of creating. Still, this is a very good movie and one I don't hesitate to recommend!",8.0,Anonymous,History

This movie is thus exceptional as it tells the truth a bit forgotten now that a few decades ago, America was just a second Apartheid: « Equal but separated » wasn't the motto of KKK but was indeed the law of this country ! Sure, KKK was the most visible racist but discrimination was endorsed by every one else : police, justice, white citizens In a way, this movie kicks where it hurts as i'm sure that this past threatens our amnesia ! To wake us, we have a great cop duo : for one time, the buddy team isn't called for fun but to be serious. It's cool to see Dafoe playing a good character for once and as an FBI agent, his uncompromising will for truth should lead him to the « X-files ».

"""Mississippi Burning"" is a tense and realistic film. ""Mississippi Burning"" may reflect the 60s, but it is certainly a reflection of society nowadays","""Mississippi Burning"" premiered on December 2, 1988, in the United States. It clearly portrayed the hidden side of a violent and segregationist society that used terror as its most powerful weapon. Under the direction of Alan Parker and with the participation of actors Gene Hackman and William Defoe, this film, based on a true story, tells a story not so far from today. The feature film introduces two FBI agents who arrive in the state of Mississippi to investigate the disappearance of civil rights activists. As this narrative is wrapped up in the critical and violent period of the 1960s in the United States, the title ends up making more sense.Tense, the film tells the story of three young people who fought for Civil Rights, but disappeared while returning from an event that sought to encourage black people in the fight for the right to vote. Intercepted by members of the Klu Klux Klan, an organization permeated by power, by bringing into its structure, members of the police and local politics, the young people are reported missing, which sets precedents for the arrival of Rupert Anderson (Gene Hackman) and Alan Ward (William Dafoe), FBI agents responsible for solving the case that took on international dimensions. Immersed in the suffocating climate of the southern and segregated white population, the characters watch the ""racist horror spectacle"" that brings in ""its numbers"", coercions, murders and other irregular manifestations of character and humanity.Thus, Alan Parker does a good job of managing the three critical points of the narrative: Anderson's interest in Mrs. Pell (Frances McDormand), a white wife who will give clues to the whereabouts of the missing young people; the clash between Anderson and Ward, police officers with different temperaments, as well as antagonistic stances; and the main one, the disappearance of the militants, two young white people and one black man, a situation that raises the following question: is the FBI there because of the young white people who disappeared or because of the three missing people? What makes ""Mississippi Burning"" a great achievement is its powerful, tense and fact-based story, which addresses a crucial and always current topic. But it's also the way it was told. The excellent script written by Chris Gerolmo takes much of the credit. The first treatment was written after the author found an article about the case of the dead activists, based on a book about FBI cases. Based on it, he created strong and consistent characters, stitching together a linear story, told objectively. And as with every film script, changes were made as the project gained consistency. Alan Parker made substantial changes, imposing his vision of the story. And even Gene Hackman made suggestions, which were accepted by the director.Anderson is the old school agent. We have the impression that solving the case is more important to him than following the rules. He himself has lived in a city like that and knows how things work. He discreetly interrogates the locals as if he were one of them. Including flirting with a police officer's wife (Frances McDormand). Of course, this is no coincidence, as the woman is the only one the police officer has as an alibi for the time of her disappearance. Ward, on the other hand, does everything according to the FBI bureaucracy. Instead of a description, he rents a movie theater and summons hundreds of FBI agents to work on the case and search for the missing bodies. Not to mention that he has no idea how to deal with the local population, that is, he tries to impose himself as a state authority in a southern state.Despite working well in its critical approach to Civil Rights, some activists point out problems in the film, some coherent, others that perhaps require consideration. The first point is very important to highlight: the acceleration in solving problems when the white woman is hospitalized after providing clues about the case investigated. Gene Hackman's character, interested and emotionally involved with the character, allows himself to be carried away by anger and begins an almost personal hunt to catch the culprits. Another issue is the passivity of black people, supposedly treated by the film as an amorphous, passive, quiet mass.Another criticism here is that in a context where we talk about the struggle for black rights within society, the film, which portrays this, leaves out the main element. The black one. Of course, we have interaction between black characters, like at the beginning of the film, where the three militants are on their way to Philadelphia in the middle of the night and are approached by the police. Among the three young men, one is black and is silenced by his friend so as not to create more problems with the officers who make him pull over the car and, during the approach, kill everyone in cold blood. In the real story, these three activists were on their way to a peaceful march to protest the ban on voting for people of color. They were approached and taken to the Philadelphia police station, spent the night in prison and left in the morning, but were followed by the killers, who later turned out to be the same police officers who carried out the approach at the entrance to the city. The phrase ""Be quiet, let me talk and everything will be fine"" said by a white person to a black person is as if white people understand the suffering of black people, their struggles or pains and we want to have their victories, or take the credit for them.The fact that there is no black protagonist or supporting character can also be seen as a form of protest. In the film, everyone had different personalities, distinct and striking archetypes, but the black man was a unit. Regardless of the number of extras who appeared on stage, black people acted as a people who fight, in addition to the right to vote, to have their own archetypes and unique personalities. Even Martin Luther King's name is said by a white mouth, treating him as the person responsible for all these demonstrations and protests. Despite being said in a critical tone and villainizing the activist's name and ideals, the subject is still right, without realizing that a white person is helping to proliferate the owner of a black voice. It is necessary to understand, however, that unlike the forks of urban centers, those people's lives function as a kind of aquarium. Any statement or sign of approaching FBI officers was seen as a threat by the white population, which resulted in subsequent persecution. Faced with this panorama, how can we not feel afraid and become cornered, less reactive? It's something to think about. The character of the pastor's son, with his cunning and intelligent words, partially represents this ""resistance"".Controversies aside, Alan Parker does not use melodrama to show how terrified the local blacks are about reprisals; he uses realism. We see what can happen to people who are not considered ""good black people"". Dafoe's character approaches a black man in a segregated lunch counter and asks him questions. The black man refuses to talk to him - and is still beaten by the Klan. Sometimes keeping your mouth shut can be good sense. Parker has dealt with menacing bullies before in his work, most notably in 'Midnight Express,' but what makes this film so special is the way he underplays the evil in it. There are no great villains or sadistic torturers in this film, just banal racists with a malicious streak.At the end of the film, the bodies were found, the killers were identified and the wheels of justice began to turn. We knew the outcome of this case when we entered the cinema. What we may have forgotten, or never known, is exactly what kinds of currents were in the air in 1964. The civil rights movement of the early 1960s was the finest hour in modern American history, because it was the painful hour in that we determine to improve ourselves rather than others. We grew up. The South grew, the entire nation grew, more comfortable with the radical idea that all men were created equal and endowed with certain inalienable rights, among them life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.What ""Mississippi Burning"" evokes more clearly than anything else is how recently in our past these rights were routinely and legally denied to black people, especially in the South. In a time so recent that their cars are still on the roads and its newspapers didn't start to turn yellow, large parts of America were a police state in which the crime was being black. Things aren't great for black people today, but at least official racism is no longer on the law books anywhere. And no other film so powerfully captures the look, the feel, the very smell of racism. We can feel how exciting the hatred for racists is in this film, how it replaces other forms of entertainment, how it compensates for their feeling of worthlessness. And we can feel something breaking free, fresh air coming in, as the backbone of this racism is broken.Beyond its pure entertainment value - this is the best American crime film in years - it is an important statement about a time and a condition that should not be forgotten. Perhaps the phrase from the mayor of Mississippi sums up the social and political character of Mississippi on Fire: ""The rest of America is of no importance whatsoever. You are in Mississippi now."" The feature film can be considered a portrait of a backward Southern America immersed in a deep hatred that never recovered from the Civil War. And certainly, this file does not appear as a coincidence. Nearly 70 years have passed since one of the darkest periods in American history. We are here, decades later, and American society remains divided as we have seen before. ""Mississippi Burning"" may reflect the 60s, but it is certainly a reflection of today, which has certainly evolved in this aspect, but which still presents deplorable cases of racism.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Racism In Mississippi,"Back in the Twenties, thirties, forties, fifties and sixties, black people have always voted in elections, here in Arkansas. It wasn't right, for the three civil right workers, to be murdered. They were helping the black people, to exercise their right to vote. The U.S. Constitution, should guarantee freedom, for all. Nobody no matter, what race, creed or ethnic group, should be told not to vote, because they're different. I'm shocked that the Sheriff's department, were part of the Klan.

ALAN PARKER'S POWERFUL CLASSIC FILM WITH GENE HACKMAN'S BRILLIANT CAREER BEST PERFORMANCE,"Alan Parker's thought-provoking cinematic masterpiece about the deep racism and blind hatred in a small Southern town in the summer of 1964 where three young civil rights workers are brutality murdered in their car on a lonely road. Two mismatched FBI agents have been dispatched to investigate the disappearances of the workers, one is Agent Anderson, brilliantly played by Gene Hackman in an Oscar nominated turn that is one of the finest performances of his career, he is an experience ex-Southern lawman who knows how to handle people from this area, the other is Agent Ward, terrifically played by Willem Dafoe, who is in charge and is a by-the-book type of man who is way over his head, but is ready to bring down the full force of the FBI upon this town to get results. Masterful direction by Parker, with extraordinary Oscar winning cinematography by Peter Biziou, and a haunting score by Trevor Jones. Sensational supporting performances by Frances McDormand, Brad Dourif, R. Lee Ermey, Gailard Sartain, Stephen Tobolowsky, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Badja Djoia, Frankie Faison, and Kevin Dunn. Special kudos must go to Michael Rooker for his unforgettably frighting performance as the murderous white racist Frank. Vivid period detail that is absolutely flawless.

Dafoe and Hackman are an excellent duo,"This movie deals with the question if it is okay to use non-ethical methods of working by cops to fight outrageous injustice. Its setting is an American village in which the black population is systematically being abused by white supremacists. A young FBI-agent from New York ( Willem Dafoe ) and his cynical partner ( Gene Hackman ) discover that the racism is broad amongst the population and that even authority figures are involved in it. Every time they find a way to deal with the problem, they stumble upon fear, and therefore unwillingness to cooperate , from the blacks. At a certain point the agents find themselves using pure intimidation and violence to fight back against the injustice.I like it how the relationship between Dafoe and Hackman is slowly evolving throughout the story. At first there is some unwillingness to work together, but slowly they start to accept each other and their different methods of working. ''Good cop'' Dafoe is the honest one never straying from the law; Hackman is the bad cop who will use intimidation to get to the core of things. Both characters aren't necessarily heroes. They are flawed, emotional beings that stand seemingly powerless against something that is so much bigger than they realize at first. At a certain point both their methods of working mingle together in the sake of solving things.It's also nice that Hackman's character becomes involved with the case when he's experiencing the brutality of the situation; from a clearly apathetic person he turns into someone who is bend on fighting the injustice.I find this one of the best movies made about the recent '' Apartheid '' in American history. It is realistic, gritty and has no false sentimentality in it. It tells a brutal tale without creating heroes and villains.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Forgotten classic from the 1980s,"This film is a fictional re telling of the FBI investigation into the disappearance of three civil rights workers during the 1964 voter registration drive in Mississippi.Directed by British director Alan Parker(Birdy,Angel Heart) it focuses on two contrasting FBI agents. One is Alan Ward(Willem Dafoe), you and idealistic, and the other Rupert Anderson(Gene Hackman) is older and shrewder. Both men want to solve the case,but their different styles mean that they keep butting heads.Anderson, a Southerner,understands the people.He may not be a racist himself, but he knows what motivates people. The story he tells Ward about an incident in his childhood is very telling. He is fully aware about what is right and wrong. Ward on the other hand, is confused by the actions of Southerners.He actually says""What is wrong with these people?"" which highlights his anger and frustration.In many ways, this is Hackman's film. He fully deserved his Oscar nomination for Best Actor.Parker does not skimp on the violence, he shows you just how cruel the Ku Klax Klan can be in their use of terror. Churches are burnt down and people are beaten. Unlike the recent film Selma, the violence is not watered down.We also have a sub plot of Anderson getting close to one of the local women by played by future Oscar winner Frances McDormand. Her husband Brad Dourif's Deputy Pell may actually be part of the Ku Klux Klan. Look out for small parts from Tobin Bell, Frankie Faison,Michael Rooker and Park Overall.If I have one complaint about this film, it is that it does not have a proper black character. Most of the black actors portray victims of violence or passive bystanders.Great film from the 1980s that hardly gets shown on TV anymore.",8.0,Anonymous,History

An Incredible Film....,"loosely based on the FBI investigation into the real-life murders of three civil rights workers in the U.S. state of Mississippi in 1964 , 'Mississippi Burning' is one of those rare films that leave a lasting impression on you.Alan Parker, who made the controversial cult-classic 'Midnight Express', is at his best over-here. Parker made magnificent cinema in 'Midnight Express', which is his best work ever! 'Mississippi Burning' is his second best, hands down. He takes us back to the age where America was in war with itself. The violent, gory and disturbing time, where each picture had blood on it has been executed with power.Some films leave a lasting impression, 'Mississippi Burning' in quite an-era is a haunting film. Alan Parker's direction is the life of the show. Chris Gerolmo & Frederick Zollo's writing is brilliant. Peter Biziou's camera-work won him the Academy-Award, and rightly so! Gerry Hambling's editing is razor sharp.'Mississippi Burning' has 3 Cinema Giants, Gene Hackman, Willem Dafoe and Frances McDormand, who are at their best. Hackman is incredible from start to end. Dafoe is superb, he wonderfully speaks out his anger within, without making morbid faces. McDormand is fantastic. This is her finest performance to date!

the truth was far worse,"my summary line is actually what another reviewer who lived in Mississippi( during depicted time) and gave this movie i believe only 3 stars wrote in his review. this reviewer i believe is white and the only reason he gave this movie 3 stars was because he...and i also feel this way, felt that "" the truth was far worse "" and the depictions of the movie didn't do the Evil justice. in other words it was a lot worse then the movie depicted.evil is not spread by the idiots that commit the hate crimes but by the people who hold the power and want to hold on to that power. the strong will always bully the weak and only in rare occasions does it not happen, which just goes to show that "" man doesn't learn from history( as much as hes studying it )and is doomed to keep on repeating mistakes made thru-out history. it make not be crystal clear today but i know for a fact that there is a lot of racism in southern America, its just hushed up that's all! hey look at it this way to prove my point of "" the strong bullying the weak...its not even about the color of the skin"" take for example certain parts of Africa where there's no whites around...its black on black and what about north Korea, where its yellow on yellow.OK, i'm rambling a little now but the movie although it wasn't the truth-fullest depiction was still very very good and will stand the test of time as a classic. just movie-wise how can you not like a movie with ( hackman, dafoe and mcdormand in it. the movie gets a 8 because it had great acting, directing and was brave enough to touch upon a touchy matter.",8.0,Anonymous,History

The Federal Bureau of Investigation certainly did not gather in masses in Mississippi to fight for blacks; it instead blackmailed leaders such as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to stop Civil Rights marches.

The nature of hate...,"I just finishing watching the movie...wasn't able to see it in it's entirety. But nonetheless the movie was incredibly moving. I found myself compelled from time to time screaming at the TV. As an African-American I also found a brief but poignant hatred of ""white people"" take over me. But I came to my senses and reflected on the fact that good and evil exist in every human being...that every white person wasn't a racist and that some whites had the courage to find against injustice. Just as every black person isn't a saint and can be complicit in wrong doing. I questioned whether or not I would be a racist had I been born white in the South. I thought about the role of courage and the need to stand up for what's right even when the status quo is different. I have always been fascinated by the nature of hate...and how it can lead people to do such horrendous things (whoever they are). I think about slavery and the Holocaust as cliché but important examples. I'm sorry this review is less about the movie and more about the thoughts it provoked in me.

The movie is about two FBI agents on a hunt for members of the racist KKK group that may be among them,"Great movies are ones that give you a strong emotional response whether you can relate to the movie or not. From little things such as camera angles to costume to using lighting on someone's face in just the right way. However this movie is very violent and some people might not want to watch the harsh and brutal reality. This is what makes the movie come to life and for you to know what people went through, if they kept the violence out they wouldn't have got their point across as well as they did. I very much enjoyed this film and is one of the best I've seen The acting in this film was amazing and I think they made a good decision on picking the actors they did. They picked actors that somewhat look like the men from the real life story. They also picked actors by just looking at them they had a strong presence of hatred. I really liked the good cop bad cop aspect and having two FBI agents that have totally different styles. For example Anderson is very charming, easy to talk to and relaxed. You can even tell this by his costume, loose tie non ironed shirt and he does not often wear a suit jacket. On the other hand Ward is very serious and isn't friendly with his witnesses. His costume is very stiff, clean cut and always wears a part in his hair and a full suit jacket at all times. The only thing I think the makers of the film could have made better was the structure or the outcome of the story line. Right from the beginning you know what is going to happen by the end of the film. However it is an ending that can sit right with everyone. I think they took the safe route by not switching up the storyline just to make the viewers happy. If they were to make a not so predictable ending that would make the media talk more about the film. The best part of the film is the cinematography and lighting. For example using lighting from the bottom of the actors faces to make people look more evil and sinister. The director also did a lot of making certain characters more superior by filming the actor they want to have power in the scene up higher so they look in charge. Lastly they made the lighting darker for the very brutal parts such as killing to give it a creepy evil vibe while still keeping it appropriate to put in a film.Mississippi burning had its own type of music like building up (i.e. car chase) music that continues to get louder and more intense the more it goes on. Once something brutal and awful is happening there is soulful gospel music. Even when nothing is happening or no actor is saying there lines, if you listen close you can always here the noise of crickets in the background.In conclusion I would give this film 4 stars out of 5. The cinematography and lighting was amazing, same with the music and actors. However the storyline's outcome was to predicable and they could have made the outcome more shocking.",8.0,Anonymous,History

A powerful indictment of Democratic Party's past sins,"This film reminds us of the horrors that the Southern Democrats inflicted upon African Americans. As Wayne Perryman reminds us in his book, ""Unfounded Loyalties"",""One party and their abolitionist supporters believed the Bible instructed them to lay down their lives for the slaves, the other party and their supporters believed the Bible gave them the right to take the lives of blacks if they rebelled against being slaves.""On the issue of slavery, one party and its supporters gave their lives to expand it (to Northern states) and the other party and their supporters gave their lives to ban it.""One party was heavily influenced by the Abolitionists and the radical wing of their party  and the other party was influenced by the Ku Klux Klan and other terrorist groups.""One party and its supporters started the Freedman's Bureau and other programs to help build communities for blacks, the other party and their supporters engaged in practices to hinder those efforts and to destroy those communities (Wilmington, North Carolina).""One party and its supporters established quality schools and colleges for blacks, the other party and their supporters engaged in practices that attempted to close some of those schools or diminish their quality.""One party passed laws and Constitutional Amendments (13th , 14th , 15th) to include blacks as part of mainstream society, the other party passed laws to exclude them from the mainstream (Jim Crow Laws and Black Codes)....""Sadly, many do not know that that ""one party"" was the Republican Party, while the ""other party"" was the Democratic Party. I myself didn't know at the time I watched this stirring film. I suppose burning crosses make us assume the bad guys are aligned with the religious right. Unfortunately, the ""other party"" used a nonsensical interpretation of the ""curse of Ham"" to justify slavery; fortunately, ""one party"" saw through it.This film is also a great example of how history is being rewritten or dumbed down. While many films have shown lynchings and other abuse of African Americans, they usually leave you with the impression that the bigots were ""Bible bashers"" ... as you can see, this is only half the truth. Very rarely are we reminded that it was Republicans who laid their lives on the line to defend blacks, based on their Christian faith.Willem Dafoe is, as always, fascinating to watch. His gesture of futility during Hackman's interrogation of a suspect is priceless. Perhaps the shameful past that the Democrats are trying to forget - indeed, most youngsters today do not need to forget, they haven't even been taught - will spur them onto greater deeds that may even outshine the ""one party"".",,Anonymous,History
"""...maybe in the gutter is where we should be""","There has been, throughout cinema history, some difficult, ugly subject matter committed to celluloid. Some subjects have been exploited for entertainment purposes, some of which have been grossly distorted to cheaply enhance the story. Mississippi Burning falls into neither camp, to question this movies subject, is to blindly deny that these atrocities ever took place. Alan Parker's engaging story is both respectful and non-judgemental.Gene Hackman takes centre stage during a time where he found quality roles difficult to come by, his Rupert Anderson a dogged, experienced veteran Mississippian whose instincts and social skills are essential to the task in hand. Willem Dafoe's young G-man, brash and over-confident brings the authority in an interesting role reversal. McDormand is the heart and humanity, while Brad Dourif looks suitably gleeful despite being the devil (McDormand and Dourif later played husband & wife again in 1991's Hidden Agenda). The rest of the supporting cast are excellent including Gailard Sartain, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Tobin (Jigsaw) Bell and Michael Rooker playing an even more sadistic SOB than Henry Lee Lucas.The story which does take dramatic licence but never loses it's nerve, held together expertly by Englishman Alan Parker.

A rattlesnake of a civil rights movie. If cornered the rattlesnake will bite itself. Go watch it.,"Whilst the film does not teach any new information on the appalling racism that went on in some southern United States in the 1960's it does have fantastic performances from the leads Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe as two FBI agents sent from their Washington centre to the state of Mississippi to investigate the disappearance of three Human Rights activists.As the film progresses we see that the two agents have contrasting styles of work. Hackman's character (Rupert Anderson) was actually an ex-Sheriff in Mississipi and understands if not necessarily agreeing with the ways of some of the locals back then (including some police officers in the film).Dafoe's (Alan Ward) character is more by the book and prefers to bring in ever more reinforcements to help the investigation which only seems to enrage some members of the local population even more.Ultimately Anderson's methods are used as the pair are hitting a brick wall in the investigation as witnesses are to scared to come forward.The film is fictional but based on true events, some shocking events involving the investigation, the activities of the Ku Klux Klan and some local residents and police officers. Director Alan Parker was well known for some of his raw films and this is no exception. Definitely also one of Gene Hackman's finest performances.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Mississippi Burning (1988),"Directed by Alan Parker. Starring Gene Hackman, Willem Dafoe, Brad Dourif, Frances McDormand, Gailard Sartain, R. Lee Ermey, Michael Rooker, Stephen Tobolowsky, Kevin Dunn, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Badja Djola, Park Overall. (R)Searing, racially-charged drama loosely based on fact, with a pair of FBI agents--a former southern sheriff (Hackman) and a square-jawed Justice Department transfer (Dafoe)--traveling into Mississippi to investigate the disappearance of three civil rights workers in 1964. Manipulative and heavy-handed at times, to be sure, and pretty poor as a history lesson, but the filmmakers clearly intended this to be a gripping thriller, not a docudrama; choosing a real life case and tilting the perspective may not have been the wisest choice, but the film does exactly what it sets out to do, and delivers a dramatic powerhouse in terms of incendiary entertainment. Terrific performances (especially from Hackman, McDormand and Dourif) and Parker's forceful but composed direction make up for weaknesses in the script; vivid, Oscar-winning photography from Peter Biziou. A more true-to-life TV-movie, ""Murder in Mississippi,"" was produced a couple years later depicting the events leading up to the murder of the civil rights workers.81/100",8.0,Anonymous,History
Nothing to lp lay with,"A film based on a true story, and portrays how cruel & unjust the events of the ""Mississippi Burning"" was, along with how brutal it was. A film portrayed very well & memorable, with a perfect cast, soundtracks that honestly shows how intense it was, while also making you super focused on what's happening, what's gonna happen next, and how messed up this time was. Like Gene Hackman really nailed his role, as always with all of his films and thankfully he won best actor for it which was truly deserved since he embraced it completely, as if he was the actual real-life agent who helped in the case along with William Dafoe, who also nailed his role & the actual agent he was playing. Even though it wasn't word for word, nor the complete real-life event & case, Director Alan Parker really did a good job in making as close to it as possible, despite having to shorten it a bit for film standard, nonetheless it wasn't easy either especially how controversial the film was going to be, and how most films don't surpass 2 hours, which obviously this investigation took many months & years so obviously he was going to have to cut a lot of it, and pretty much summarize and cut it into the major parts. Nowadays, you don't find films like these where it's based on true stories, investigations, events, and cases because of how controversial it may be, but truly this is such a masterpiece, one that really shows, tells & portrays, how cruel & unjust the events of the ""Mississippi Burning"" was, along with how brutal it was with a strong message as well that pierces your heart and reminds all of us how much cruel, evil, and dark the world was way back than. Thankfully, we came a long way from that. Also very sad to see the condition Gene Hackman is in now, as he's 93, but he'll always be a legend forever. Not only that but, he really did deserve that award for best actor, for this film, and the amount of recognition for this role, A film that is truly worth watching, even if you are not American, or familiar with its history, it really embarks you, shows how major this was & how it should never happen again, nor should it, how intense it was, and how it should never be forgotten either.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Mesmerising Gene,"I found Mississippi Burning an amazing film mainly because of the performances of its two leads, but mainly because of the mesmerising performance of Gene Hackman. I have never known an actor so adept at acting with his eyes in a way that makes his performances so watchable and call for repeated viewing. In a similar way I thought his performance in ""The Chamber"", whilst being only an average film, was amazing.All that being said, I felt that criticisms of the film itself are totally justified. Mississippi Burning portrays the blacks as weak camera-fodder victims seemingly without any involvement in any fight for civil liberties, and the portrayal of white FBI as Liberation fighters for the Black cause, who themselves instigated the end of American 'apartheid'! A little less naivety and more honest reality would have improved this film to the classic it could have so easily been.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Fabulous,"Mississippi Burning is one of my favorite Gene Hackman movies.  I remember watching it when I was young, it was one of the few rated R movies my parents would allow me to watch.  Such a powerful story about the disappearance of three civil rights workers down in rural Mississippi. When the Feds are called in to investigate the disappearance, the action really heats up.  Dafoe is perfect in playing the FBI agent opposite Hackman. Hackman is the charming, funny, and very smart to whats happening around him.  Not that he doesnt care what he's down there for, but he's taking in the surroundings, he knows how these people operate.  Dafoe is quite the opposite.  Strict, by the book agent who seems to take it more seriously. Dafoe's character seems to be in shock of what's going on around him, but Hackman seems to know exactly whats wrong.  Great suspense, and a great depiction of this time in history, when being black in the South might get you killed.  Based on a true story.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"""Chilling Expose of the Damage Caused by Racial Hatred and Violence""","""Mississippi Burning"" deals with the quest of two FBI agents with wildly different styles that arrives in Mississippi to investigate the disappearance of some civil rights activists at a time when apartheid is at its plethora and America is in war with itself.Cast wise, No complaining. Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe do make a formidable lead cast. A special mention of Gene Hackman, who steals every scene with chilling perfection and agility. Willem Dafoe does well for a procedure following agent, who inevitably learnt that Justice isn't always through procedures. Frances McDormand is intense in her tough yet small role. Rest like Brad Dourif, Stephen Tobolowsky does very well. A special mention for then-unknown Tobin Bell who has a small role.""Mississippi Burning"" strength lies in its accurate and natural portrayal of racism in 1960s era in most of America, Mississippi in the movie. The characters in this film don't know why they hate the way they do, they just know that they do. The sincerity with which Director Alan Parker depicts the events is amazing, with appropriate mix of gore, violence and torture. But having said that, this movie deals with a very sensitive issue and it largely enclose itself in the racism context.Overall, ""Mississippi Burning"" achieves what it sets out for. It was never about sending a message for equality or peace amongst races. It showcases the difficult times of 1960s and how a few good men delivers justice, unbeknownst of consequences.My Verdict: 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,History

Disgraceful,"Hollywood has produced some idiotic films about racism, and Mississippi Burning is just about the worst of them.  This movie is a disgraceful revision of the 1960s South that glorifies the FBI (yeah, right) as the saviors of Black people (who apparently had nothing to do with their own salvation).  Additionally, Mississippi Burning follows in the shameful Hollywood tradition of turning the story of racism into the story of white people.  Avoid this movie at all costs!",,Anonymous,History
Racism In Mississippi,"Back in the Twenties, thirties, forties, fifties and sixties, black people have always voted in elections. It wasn't right, for the three civil right workers, to be murdered. They were helping the black people, to exercise their right to vote. The U.S. Constitution, should guarantee freedom, for all. Nobody no matter, what race, creed or ethnic group, should be told not to vote, because they're different. I'm shocked that the Sheriff's department, were part of the Klan. They're hired to serve and protect law abiding citizens. Apparently these lawmen, were outlaws and had no business wearing a badge.",,Anonymous,History
Good movie fiction based on historical fact,"During a racial stressful time in our country a tragic occurrence happened in east-central Mississippi that still stands as an unsolved mystery. This movie is very loosely based on those events. A lot of literary license was taken for dramatic effect.I was in the middle of this time frame. The highway between the two counties passes by my house. I was 12 years old at the time & watched the newspaper stories and national news coverage try to untangle this web of deceit & mistrust.Good people were intimidated. Good people were named as intimidators. The people of Mississippi are trying to heal this wound, but it seems certain peoples wish for it to fester again.Yesterday, I drove down that road in which they were murdered. There are few houses on that road even now, although it paved. No markers, no indications whatsoever, give a hint of that awful tragedy in our nation's history. People drive down that road from all over the area weekly & probably don't even know its history.I only hope that whomever watches this movie keeps in mind of the effect that HOLLYWOOD was trying to display. There are numerous books written about the events, please research before accepting this movie as is for actual facts about the incidences concerning racial strife in east-central Mississippi in the summer of 1964.",,Anonymous,History
A inspiring true story,"Mississippi Burning is a magnificent, harrowing true story about three young civil rights workers who disappear in the racial segregated 1960's Mississippi. Two FBI agents played by veteran actors Gene Hackman, in a Oscar-nominated performance and Willem Dafoe are sent to Mississippi to investigate the disappearances.  They are soon grappling with the local,racist people and Sheriff's office who does not want them there. Beautiful Oscar-winning cinematography amazingly brings this fast-paced story to realization. Every student of life should watch this movie about one of the most troubling times in American history.",,Anonymous,History
Not as self-righteously p.c. as I thought it would be,still not that great of a movie. The judge was the best actor and had the best lines. Who are the biggest victims? The blacks or working class white straight Southern males as portrayed by Hollywood? I say say the center of hate in this country is in Hollywood.,,Anonymous,History
A great movie!,"I was never interested in seeing this film before.  For some reason, it just didn't appeal to me.  But I rented it a few weeks ago...and now I'm really glad I did that.  ""Mississippi Burning"" turned out to be a GREAT film! It's a powerful film.  It's a film about the effects of racism in a town during the 60s.  It shows how the conflicting viewpoints of some of the characters lead to devastating consequences.  Yet, in a town that practiced a code of silence, the ""rules"" were bound to be broken.  Among the highlights of this film are an absorbing story, noteworthy cinematography, and very good performances.  In all, it's an extremely good movie.  Surely, it's the best movie of 1988.",,Anonymous,History
Controversial Subject Matter+Alan Parker= Probably the one of the most powerful films ever made,"When three civil rights activists disappear in 60s America's Deep South, the FBI  are sent in to investigate a small town in Mississipi and it's corrupt Sheriff's office.  Facing a wall of silence and unwittingly sparking off a chain of tragic events instigated by the Klu Klux Klan, the FBI have to bend the rulebook to get to the truth. Alan Parker's most moving and powerful film since Midnight Express, is an adrenalin emotion rush from start to finish.  Gene Hackman (easily his best performance since the French Connection) and Willem Dafoe are the perfect mismatch of partners.  Mr Ward (Dafoe)the FBI agent that plays everything by the book and Mr Anderson(Hackman),old school FBI who is the complete opposite.  The two men are an absolute joy to watch.  With Hackman you see every piece of Masterclass acting, from facial expressions, his laughing, every little detail. While Dafoe couples with Hackman to make them both light up the screen and bring their characters to life. Support from Brad Dourif (Deputy Pell) as the Sheriff's deputy and Michael Rooker as the unashamedly racist Frank, add to the masterclass and all help a fantastic script with some amazing dialogue move along at the perfect pace which if you can keep up with, the rewards from this film are of the highest and most thought provoking ever felt on celluloid.",,Anonymous,History
astounding,"This film is such an eye opener to those who live in a nation of freedom, equality and peace.  Agent Anderson (Gene Hackman) and Agent Ward (Willem Dafoe) are FBI agents who have visible professional differences but set them aside to fulfill their duties.Alan Parker has strongly portrayed the truly distraught images of what African Americans had to face on a daily basis.  Some things are worth life if they can promote change in the future.  I was greatly moved by how Aaron Williams (Darius McCrary) had the courage as a young boy to talk to the anglo-saxon agents despite his fear and encouraged other African Americans to step forward.Mrs. Pell (Frances McDormand) was a strong woman in such a time because she was one of the very few who stood up for what she truly believed in.  Her strength played a big role in proving that you can still remain anonymous while you make your voice heard.  Though she eventually faced great pain, she stuck with her conscience and helped made a difference.  This film is one example that proves the power of voice plays a major role in bringing about change.  I rate this film *****.",,Anonymous,History
