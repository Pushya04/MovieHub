Jack is back. This time they did it right.,"Nice addition to the saga but still not as good as the old ones...I m a 30+ old big fan of the Pirates of Caribbean movies and absolutely love what Gore Verbinski did with the first 3. I was utterly disappointed with the previous potc movie (#4). I went to watch this new one with a lot of prejudice.
But luckily it was an epic and fun movie to watch! Extremely entertaining and connected with Verbinski's style and work. Lots of beautiful action scenes, nice landscapes, humour and never ever, at any point boring. Jack Sparrow is definitely back in great form.

"A decent, fun enough ride, could have been so much more however","The best film in the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' franchise will always be the first, which is still a terrific film fourteen years later (has it really been that long, feels like only yesterday when first seeing it when it first came out).Its sequels are not on the same level, and while they are a long way from flawless none of them are awful films either. They have their flaws, 'Dead Man's Chest' did get too frenetic sometimes, 'At World's End' was overlong, bloated and needlessly bloated and 'On Stranger Tides' (which has been dumped upon by many here but to me it was a very enjoyable film, one of the better sequels, and much better than given credit for, which is not going to be a popular opinion) had an underdeveloped and forced romantic subplot and too much filler that could have been trimmed in some places. They all have great merits, namely great visuals, exciting action, Hans Zimmer's music, Johnny Depp, Geoffrey Rush and Bill Nighy.'Pirates of the Caribbean: Salazar's Revenge' has its defenders but has also been met with underwhelmed disappointment by critics and most fans. Personally am on the fence with 'Salazar's Revenge' and consider it one of the weaker entries generally of the series, with only 'At World's End' being weaker. It is a decent and fun enough ride, but it could have been so much more and has some glaring flaws.It is easy to say forget the story, however this is a strong case of being very hard to do so when there is so little to it. It takes a while to get going and there are some real pacing problems in the final act, which has its good points but generally is very tedious. It is very thin for the running time and feels overstretched and bloated, giving the impression the film is too long. The script has some droll and witty quips every now and again, but mostly it is very weak with far too much of a rambling, improvisatory and random feel, it just doesn't feel that well structured. There is also a very bizarre exchange with Depp and Paul McCartney (whose presence is rather jarring).Brenton Thwaites and Kaya Scodelario are vastly inferior to Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley, they lack presence and come over as bland and dare one say deadweight. The music score is rousing enough and creates some nostalgia, but can be overly bombastic and is too much of a retread from the music of the previous films. There is an overload of CGI effects, which standard-wise are mostly splendid though with some artificial ones too.With all this being said, there are obvious merits here. Once again, the production values are impeccable, the cinematography is skillful and full of beauty and atmosphere, the costumes, sets and period recreation is authentic and sumptuous and the effects are superb. As aforementioned the special effects are splendid quality-wise.'Salazar's Revenge's' action is a lot of fun too, being coherent and exciting, especially the very scary one with the undead shark and the ending, which also does a good job clearing up loose ends. There are some great and suitably light-hearted comedy set pieces, like Jack being dragged by a building and clinging onto the guillotine.Jack not being the central focus but still being essential to the plot proved to be a good move. 'Salazar's Revenge' succeeds in bringing a sense of nostalgia. Loved Barbossa's story arc, inarguably the film's most interesting which allows Geoffrey Rush to really sink his teeth and give a fun and moving performance. His revelation and his farewell was heart-breaking in its emotion.Contrary to what some have said, apart from the newcomers to the franchise Thwaites and Scodelario as well as McCartney, the acting was fine. Although Johnny Depp's performance has been criticised, to me he still has the enthusiasm, sense of fun and swagger. Geoffrey Rush does a great job as always, while an unrecognisable Javier Bardem (very impressively made-up) is simply brilliant and clearly having a whale of a time as perhaps the franchise's most sinister villain (if not the best, that title still belongs to Bill Nighy's Davy Jones).Summing up, decent and fun enough ride that could have been so much more. 6/10 Bethany Cox",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
totally forgettable movie,"With poor plotting, inconsistent pacing and a rushed sense of chemistry amongst the new cast Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales exposes the swashbuckling sequel as nothing more than a cash-grab that's as hollow as the ships they occupy.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Franchise Is Still Working Very Well,"After watching with very low expectations to ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales"", it is hard to understand the legion of haters that write in IMDb. The film is not a masterpiece but is funny, entertaining, with great cast, special effects, screenplay and story. Johnny Depp performs the wolf, drunken and smart Captain Jack Sparrow in the usual funny way. Cinema lovers of fantasy-adventure genre must ignore the bad reviews and question what this kind of people that writes that the movie is not good like to see or if they have difficulties to understand a story with many characters. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Piratas do Caribe: A Vingança de Salazar"" (""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Revenge of Salazar"")",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"If you liked the first three and want more of the same, here it is","A few of the reviews I read before going to see this fifth (and supposedly final) Pirates movie basically boiled down to ""well, at least it's better than the last one"". I don't know, am I the only one who liked ""On Stranger Tides"" because it at least tried to do something different with the franchise? This new entry just tosses the soundtrack and best bits of the first three films in a blender, adds a new zombie bad guy and a couple youthful new romantic leads and hits the puree button. They even re-use the ""bad guys can walk through the bars of a prison cell"" effect from one of the earlier movies.Yeah, some of the special effects are spectacular, there are battles at sea, lots of stuff blows up, the villains are creepy and some of the comic relief is funny (and some is painfully unfunny), but watching this movie it was hard to shake the feeling that I'd seen it all before. It's pretty much paint-by-numbers, even down to Javier Bardem's bad guy reciting the film's title line just before it appears on screen. Even Depp's Captain Jack seemed largely uninspired.On the positive side, many of the characters you've come to know from the first four films return for this one. Orlando Bloom's Will Turner shows up to help set up and resolve the plot, and even Keira Knightley makes a very brief appearance. At over two hours long I was afraid the film would drag in spots, but it moved along so quickly that I was actually a little surprised when they reached the big finale.The plot, without getting into spoilers, revolves around Will's son Henry who is determined to break the curse on his father and rescue him from the Flying Dutchman. In order to do so, he has to retrieve a powerful, magical item that is also being sought by a brilliant young woman with a mysterious map that her unknown father left to her. It soon turns out that they need Jack Sparrow's help, and of course that drags Captain Barbossa into the fray. Opposing them all is the undead Captain Salazar, who bears a grudge against Sparrow and will not rest until he's dead.There's a very short and unnecessary cameo by Paul McCartney as Jack's uncle Jack. He tells a lame joke, there's a single off-screen laugh as if even the filmmakers realized how pointless the scene was, and then the plot moves on.One bit where the film really went off the rails was a flashback scene in which we learn why Salazar hates Sparrow so intensely. Instead of hiring a younger actor to play Jack, they digitally de-aged Depp and raised his voice about an octave. The result is just...creepy. And entirely unconvincing.I don't know if it was just the theater where I saw the movie, but the picture was really dark for a lot of the film and the sound mix was terrible. The explosions and music were super-loud and often drowned out the dialog. I'm glad I didn't see the 3D version because I've heard that's even murkier-looking. At the rate movies are going, in a couple decades the theater experience will be staring at a black screen for two hours while being deafened by a continuous roar.At any rate, if you loved the earlier films in the Pirates franchise and want another dose, or if you're just looking for a big, mindless spectacle with some bits of humor, this movie fits the bill. I can't say I really disliked it, but it also didn't make me sad that it's supposed to be the last one. Or is it? Stick around for a final scene after the credits that hints at an unlikely sequel. Or maybe it's just meant as some weird sort of joke. I heard people discussing it in the lobby and no one quite knew what to make of it.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Jack Sparrow Returns!,"Finally a Pirates of the Caribbean movie that I felt quite at par with the original one. I felt in this movie, the elements of entertainment were quite abundant. Unlike in the 4th installment, I think this one is funnier, more thrilling and gave the sense of happiness at the end. This time,, the movie was not solely telling the story of Jack Sparrow. Instead the other characters, especially Henry and Carina were given quite a lot screen time. It was nice to see Jack Sparrow's charm and wit plus his insistence of helping other people.This movie provided some background story of Jack while he was young, which was very interesting to see. The movie was filled with lots of fun and laughter but also few brief touching moments. The story was good and there were some surprises too. As a high budget movie, the movie was filled with very good special effects (some done by the Industrial Light Magic). I totally loved the effects of the deads (Salazar's crews), his ship and of course the very cool special effects at the end.I also felt that the movie did not have any dull moment. From beginning till the end, there were always something interesting to see. My wife and I were entertained throughout the whole movie which was having a duration of a little over 2 hours. Amazingly, due to the sense of excitement, my wife was able to hold going to the bathroom till finished. I guess she forgotten about it while watching.Actually, even though I looked forward to see this movie, I was a bit skeptical at first about whether this one would be good enough. I felt that the 4th one was a little bit dull, and also a bit forced. The story for that one did not feel strong enough and certainly did not give a lot of impression. But this one really felt it was worthy of giving another sequel after this. Especially if you wait till the very end, after the end-credit scene, where we were given something interesting to ponder. Might be the potential story for the sequel? Perhaps if this one is successful enough.I believe this one really worth to see. I am happy to see Johnny Depp in this movie which I hope would be a commercial success for him. Since his past few movies were unfortunately not really successful ones. Maybe people grew tired of his acting as unusual characters. So if you are looking for something fun, light, interesting movie with funny charming pirate and treasure hunt story, you should definitely watch this one. I am confident you would be entertained like my wife and I were.For my complete review, pls have a look in michaelnontonmulu.blogspot.co.id",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

And There Will Be a 6th Film...,"I wasn't expecting a masterpiece, but I certainly wasn't expecting it to not be entertaining. At least the previous films had great swashbuckling fun and wit. They told bizarre stories that had strange characters, all of which had something to offer to the film. The adventures were full of surprises, making them worth at least checking out, and Jack Sparrow was a character that was actually worth waiting for. This film had no personality. No heart. No passion. It was nothing more than a ""bottom of the barrel"" film with cheap sex jokes and physical gags, most of which were served by Jack Sparrow. He was drained of the spirit that he had in the previous films, and wasn't even worth the time he was on screen. Nobody cared, nobody tried, and the full theater was nearly emptied halfway through the film. What once was a film series known for their cinematic experiences, is now nothing more than a dried up corpse, a result of Disney's relentless need to milk their products to death.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Seriously... Another One?,"After the dreadful predecessor that was 'On Stranger Tides', I entered the cinema with rather poor expectations... how I left with even lower enjoyment is beyond me.Perhaps it's the fact that a theme park ride can't sustain a story for an entire film franchise? Maybe it's the fact that I've seen this story before in four other films? Perhaps the lack of character development and me not giving a damn about any of the new characters? Or maybe it's just because it's an orgy of CGI madness? Who knows? Either way, this film is a complete over-the-top mess. Watchable? Yes. Enjoyable? Hell no!I admit that 'Dead Man's Chest' and 'At World's End' weren't ""fantastic"" movies, but they rounded off a rather enjoyable trilogy, especially following the ultimately brilliant first film. But the two sequels' success should not have been an excuse for a fourth and now a fifth film, with each film the reception lowers and the standards and eagerness for the next further lowers. However, Disney as the opportunistic blighters they are, take their box office success with stride and look to creating the next underwhelming, money-making sequel. This time it's in the form of 'Dead Men Tell No Tales'.The overuse of jokes we've heard on several previous occasions, the fact that the beloved Jack Sparrow is now becoming a character we look at in contempt because he's worn out, much like the franchise. Scraping the bottom of the barrel, milking upon its previous success... both terms that can be applied suitably to this movie (if that's what I can call it). And do you know what the worst part is? This film will make its money back, it'll double, triple, quadruple its budget in box office returns, thus giving the producers a reason to create yet-another dull sequel.All-in-all, I actually think I had an aneurysm whilst watching this film...",,Anonymous,Fantasy
A fun ride,"This is a step in the right direction for the franchise after the letdown of Pirates 4. Johnny Depp doesn't bring his A game here but the other characters get some decent screen time so it doesn't take too much of the shine from the movie.There are a few laughs and the usual bevy of action you'd expect. The plot is as farcical as ever, so don't expect a deep thinker - just enjoy the fun. Geoffrey Rush as Hector Barbosa never disappoints and Javier Bardem delivers a decent villain in the form of Captain Salazar.Don't take it too serious, switch off your brain and just enjoy it for what it is: an action packed swashbuckling adventure.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not a very inspiring plot along with weak sub characters,"Entertaining, yes but i'm afraid the original magic we got from the first three films are truely lost.Johnny Depp gives next to no original heart to his character anymore, maybe it's age or maybe it's Dick Cook getting fired which i read it was Cook that helped Depp give commitment for the original trilogy in the first place.The plot was straight forward, CGI villain needs revenge. It seems very bland when you think about it, but they added a load of subplots to pass extra time but this didn't justify. They even added in Jack's past to make it look more authentic.Disney seem to have looked at the advance in visual effects and budget from the profit they started making from Marvel movies and used it to make another shot at a Pirates of the Carribean installment. Was this necessary? It could have been if made better.It just, didn't look like much heart was given into this movie. It looked more like the pursue for better visual effects to gain more box office money.Like ""On Stranger Tides"" i welcome this movie to the franchise but it's grasp for originality is still sloping down to the bottom of the sea.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Pirate's Life for me,"Let me start off by stating, I nodded off during Stranger Tides. The movie was a complete waste of my time and it besmirched a very good franchise. I refused to complete the movie till date. If something takes that much of effort to watch, I'd really rather go put my efforts into anything else.But with this movie? They hit their usual stride again. Fast paced, good action scenes. I think I subconsciously knew that if they managed to incorporate Hans Zimmer phenomenal score from the trilogy into this movie, in a way that satisfied me, I would give it 8 on 10 ( I keep my promises). But the movie did more than deliver and stay true to the original trilogy. It brought back the feelings of old. I wont give away spoilers but I was very happy to see old faces return to the screen. They have also laid down good groundwork for the new generation of characters. I wouldn't mind sticking about to see how this soft reboot gets along with out the original characters.Do watch, you will be pleasantly surprised.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

You have no other option but to take your kids to this one, you will not be sorry.I especially liked Mr. Bardem as Captain Salazar, his acting is a little bit better then the rest but every actor gave hundred percent for this film and it shows!Since this is my review 400 for IMDb.com I have to take an opportunity to thank staff at the Multiplex Cinema City Sarajevo for being generally kind and professional.

Very disappointed with the direction they went for this one,"The writing is very minimalistic, character's are all former shadows of themselves. The young character leads are forgettable and character development feels almost non-existent. The lead female is an advocate for woman's rights it seems..instead of just being a really cool protagonist who 'happens' to be female. The whole cast pretty much runs around doing nothing. Jack's crew (Gibbs in particular) have been reduced to mediocre comedy relief. Quite a few plot holes as well as being historically inaccurate in parts. I did enjoy a few scenes, not enough to warrant a rave review though. :PI've enjoyed all of the Pirates films but I think it's about time they wrap things up.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Definitely not as bad as many critics said it to be (In fact, I don't consider it as 'bad' at all).","Expectations is everything with these movies. While the previous Pirates of the Caribbean (PotC) movie feels more like a spin-off than a direct sequel to the original trilogy, ""Dead Men Tell No Tales/Salazar's Revenge"" continues the lore of the first 3 movies. While continuity errors are somewhat blatant, you can't say this movie is the worst of the 5 PotC movies. The actions are more grounded than the previous movies, and they managed to salvage themselves after the less-than-mediocre ""On Stranger Tides"". The humor's there, and just enough. The amount of screen time of Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley probably means that there'll be more of these movies in the future. There's also a familiar feels to the first movie in this one. Perhaps this familiarity is what makes critics hate it. But seriously, if you despised ""On Stranger Tides"", this one you'll probably like. I'd say this is the best PotC movie since the first one back in early 2000's.Oh, and Javier Bardem, as always, is menacing as the latest baddie ""Capitan Salazar"".",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Oh My God I Am So Effing Disappointed I Cannot Believe What I Have Just Seen,"(Gonna try not to cuss) I will start by saying I was/am fanatical about all three of the first ones. Yes the original is still the best, but the second is almost every damn bit as good. The plot was creative enough that it felt necessary, the writing was on par with the first, and Davy Jones is SO freaking good oh my god he is literally my favorite villain of all time (save for Agent Smith). The third one has its flaws (though I really can't think of any besides Keira Knightley's acting being occasionally over the top), but as a whole it's a WONDERFUL movie. Like sweet Jesus, Hans Zimmer's freaking score for that movie alone is goddamn legendary. And as a result I totally bought into the romance between Will & Elizabeth and really just felt an emotional connection to the whole series because of it (much like the emotion Howard Shore's music invokes for LotR). But what makes the third one so impressive is how well it handles ALL of that crazy plot while still introducing great new sh*t like the Brethren Court.But I'm not here to talk about how great the original trilogy was. Odds are, most of you liked them too. What I want to talk about briefly before I tear Dead Men Tell No Tales to shreds, is On Stranger Tides. From what I gather, the fourth installment was/is NOT very popular. I like it. And I'll tell you why. While it didn't have the same epic sense of scale and adventure and romance and everything that made the first three so great, IT STILL HAD GOOD WRITING. It was clever, and witty, and funny as ever. And this is because Ted & Terry were still writing them, not FRICKING Jeff Nathanson. OMFG I'll get to him later. I would urge you though to go back and give On Stranger Tides another chance, especially if you've now seen the fifth installment. I think you'll find that even though it doesn't quite hold up against the first three it still FEELS like a Pirates of the Caribbean, and for all the reasons that Dead Men Tell No Tales did not, and here they are:1) Johnny Depp has completely lost it. It's like he forgot how to play Jack Sparrow. There were seriously times watching him when I thought he was more Mad Hatter than he was Jack Sparrow. And it's so sad to watch. The old Jack was an idiot sure, but he was always clever, he was always suave, always cool. In this he's just silly. It's embarrassing. I'm serious when I say he acts like the Mad Hatter, you'll see what I mean. In the fourth one he at least still felt like Jack Sparrow.2) Zimmer's so called ""protege"" Geoff Zanelli is so forgettable. I was actually trying to listen for his music but the only times the music stood out was when he was rehashing Zimmer's themes. And some of you may be like *sissy voice ""oh that's all Zimmer did was rehash Badelt's themes"". BISH PLEASE. Not only did he make Badelt's original theme sound even better, he introduced so many new ones (Jack's theme, Davy Jones' theme, Will & Elizabeth's theme). Even On Stranger Tides added a fun new Spanish twist to the old stuff.3) Salazar, Henry, & Carina are also all completely forgettable. They're worse than Blackbeard (who I actually quite liked), Philip, and Syrena. There is hardly ANY character development for them and what little there was felt SO forced. I feel terrible for them (especially Thwaites and Bardem) because they're not bad actors (Bardem is actually a fantastic actor) but they just got saddled with one of the WORST freaking scripts of all time, which brings me to my final and primary complaint with the fifth installment.4) JEFF NATHANSON IS CANCER. I mean my biggest (only) concerns from the start (because let's be honest the trailer's gave NO hint that the movie would be this bad) were the fact that Zimmer wasn't composing and that JEFF NATHANSON, the idiot who ruined Indiana Jones, was writing it, but I NEVER thought he could have F'd up this movie, not as badly as he did. Like, the movie had SO much going for it. Salazar could have been another great villain to put alongside Jones and Barbossa, but he was totally wasted with minimal and poor dialogue. Carina Smith, a female astronomer, could have been a GREAT female character! And her romance with Henry could have been done BEAUTIFULLY! Instead, what did we get? Well, I won't spoil it for you but I will say there is one of the most forced, predictable, and painstakingly banal twists I've ever seen in a movie regarding her character.So, as I said, I absolutely LOVED the first three, and I really did like the fourth one. Enough that I was very excited about what they could do with the next one (the fifth one). All my friends said the franchise was dead but I maintained that the fifth installment had the potential to be amazing (which it did). And I waited SIX GODDAMNED YEARS for this fifth one. And it, was just, god, awful. So bad that I actually now don't want to see another installment, and I will honestly probably never watch it again because it's so bad that it almost taints my love for the first four.I tried to think of reasons to give it more than the lowest possible rating, any reason. And ALL I could think of was the visual quality that the two Norwegian directors brought to it, so good for them, I give the fifth Pirates of the Caribbean a whopping two stars.Thank you. This has been my angrily hastened unedited review of Dead Men Tell No Tales.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
a retread of its origins,"Five winters after On Stranger Tides, some of the same key characters (and a few new ones) return for this latest high seas adventure. Callow sailor Henry Turner is on a personal mission to retrieve the Trident of Poseidon, a powerful artifact thought by many to be a myth. In the course of his journey he crosses paths—and eventually aligns himself with—wanted pirate Captain Jack Sparrow, and ambitious astronomer Carina Smyth. The mission is further complicated when they run afoul of Sparrow's 'frenemy' Captain Barbossa, and learn that a gang of undead sailors are coming their way. Follows essentially the same formula as The Curse of the Black Pearl, but the characters lack charisma (even Depp seems curiously subdued), the story is never really engaging, and all the rip-roaring action scenes and special effects can only carry this uninspired journey so far. Bardem effectively sneers and snarls as Captain Salazar, but he's one of the few highlights in an otherwise forgettable entry. **",,Anonymous,Fantasy

"A flawed but refreshing – and, hopefully, final – return to the high seas.","For the past decade or so, the Pirates Of The Caribbean franchise has been living, lumbering proof of Hollywood at its most excessive and profit-oriented. It's hard not to look at the three films following the sublime Curse Of The Black Pearl as shameless money- making opportunities – the budgets grew bigger and the action sequences more extravagant, sure, but the plots also became more convoluted and forgettable.One would be forgiven for assuming that Salazar's Revenge (or: Dead Men Tell No Tales), the fifth and purportedly final Pirates installment, is every bit as bloated, clunky and (largely) free of artistic merit. Surprisingly, that's not the case. While Salazar's Revenge does suffer from some of the franchise's most pervasive problems, it's a fun, perfectly decent blockbuster that remembers to add some very welcome heart and soul back into its story and characters.The film opens on Henry Turner (Thwaites), now a young man determined to free his dad Will (Bloom) from his cursed servitude as the ghost captain of The Flying Dutchman. Henry's quest prompts him to seek the help of Captain Jack Sparrow (Depp) as he hunts for the Trident of Poseidon, the magical MacGuffin that can undo the many nautical curses plaguing the high seas. Along the way, Henry's fate becomes entangled with that of astronomer extraordinaire Carina Smyth (Scodelario), who is the key to deciphering the map that points the true way to the Trident.Matters are complicated, of course, by the film's top-billed, Oscar- winning antagonists. Salazar (Bardem), a ghostly menace trapped in the moment of his grisly death, rises from the depths to exact his titular vengeance upon Captain Jack. He is helped (and occasionally hindered) by Hector Barbossa (Rush), whose complicated relationship with Jack – teetering as it always does on the knife-edge between friend and foe – has been the unmitigated highlight of even the worst films in the franchise.That's a lot of plot and character to work with, and Salazar's Revenge doesn't always succeed in tying all the threads together. Setting all the characters on an inevitable collision course takes ages. The sprawling action sequences too often seem to forget when to call it quits. Jeff Nathanson's script, while sharper and more coherent than its predecessors, tends to get mired in laddish moments and gags that aren't even that funny the first time around: from the pirates' amusement with Carina declaring herself a 'horologist', to an awkward beachside wedding that's as uncomfortable for audiences to watch as it must have been for the actors to shoot.What the film gets right is its decision to return Captain Jack to supporting-character status. That's not to say he doesn't have plenty of screen-time. As he has done since 2003, the perennially half- drunk Jack shambles throughout the film, oozing his trademark insouciant charm as he tries to make his crew pay for the privilege of serving and saving him. But Jack is not called upon to carry the emotional weight of the film here, as he has been for the past few films – especially Stranger Tides, a peculiar misfire on almost all counts. Instead, he's allowed to do what he does best: steal most of the scenes he sashays through.As a result, the film makes a real effort to focus on its newcomers, and is all the better for it. Carina, in particular, is an intriguing creation. While clearly set up as a love interest for Henry, that's not all she is: her hunt for the Trident is entirely her own, tied to a storyline that isn't romantic in the least. Smart and determined (more so than all of the pirates she encounters), she fights or thinks her way out of tough spots and never lingers in the background, damsel-in-distressing. Her relationships with everyone she meets – from Henry to Jack and Barbossa – form the film's emotional core, anchored by Scodelario's fun, feisty performance.That said, it's Rush who remains the franchise's ace in the hole. From dastardly villain to reluctant ally, Barbossa has enjoyed a character trajectory that can only be pulled off by an actor of Rush's calibre. Thankfully, he's given excellent material to work with in Salazar's Revenge. There's a surprising amount of heartbreak in Barbossa's share of the story, and Rush sells it all beautifully. In just a look or a twist of his gnarled features, Rush communicates the soul of the man long ago buried beneath the swish and swagger of the pirate Barbossa became.There's no denying that the Pirates franchise has lost its way over the past decade. It tried desperately to expand the mythology of a one-and-done nautical escapade, and missed the mark more often than not. Salazar's Revenge should have been the final nail in the coffin. And yet, it's defied the odds (and myriad delays) to be the most enjoyable Pirates outing since the very first. On top of lush seascapes and jaw-dropping oceanic rescues (including one that stretches to the very bottom of the sea), the film's emotional stakes have been raised – successfully. If this is truly the last we'll see of the characters we first met 14 years ago, it's a good way to go out.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"With low expectations, 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales' is amusing","Dead Men Tell No Tales doesn't rewrite the rulebook for the franchise or the genre as a whole, and is wholly predictable from start to finish, but the likable characters—Thwaites and Scodelario have more natural presence and mutual chemistry than Bloom and Knightley— creative action set pieces, and Depp finally being put in his place in the franchise creates a fun ride that's instantly unforgettable. It works well enough as a stand-alone, swashbuckling comedic spectacle, thanks to the terrific performances, some ingenious practical effects, impressive CGI and a steady diet of PG-13 dialogue. There were couple of Scenes which were unnecessary (like where Keira comes out of nowhere in the final scene). Otherwise, the movie was overall good but can't match the goodness of the First 2 Installments of the franchiseMy Rating : 3.5/5",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I miss the old Jack.,"The fifth installment of the Pirates-series is by all means a step up from the fourth. In all film-series, when a sequel is released it's mandatory to compare it to the best one - which in this case arguably everyone agrees is the first one. That may be unfair, but it's the reality. Now.Pirates of the Caribbean: Salazar's Revenge does give us some spectacular moments. The visual effects really is astonishing, and some of the scenes is beyond anything I have ever seen before. That's impressing. But that's not why I like Pirates of the Caribbean. What I expect (hope) from a Pirates-film is elegant and witty dialog, compelling sea- battles and Jack Sparrow on fire. And this last bit I think is the biggest reason why this one fails to deliver.In my opinion, Johnny Depp has lost his way as captain Jack. And I think that's natural, after all, it's been 13 years since he first portrait the character. He's gotten older and that really shows. This, combined with a really poor script, regarding Jack at least, makes it all fall apart. Half the time he's completely drunk (really drunk, not just usual Jack-tipsy) and half the time he tells bad jokes which really is beneath a genius character like Jack Sparrow.The film starts on a positive note. I had good hopes that it could go somewhere, but mid- way through the story starts to split up and it didn't really have a good rhythm to it. In addition I think there are a lot of characters that just don't do anything to the story or adds humor or dynamic.The decision to bring back Orlando Bloom to play Will Turner is fundamentally a good one, but I'm so disappointed with he's involvement in the film. It seems Disney only took him back to promote the film and lure old fans back for more. If he's to be involved, he should have a major role.Javier Bardem does a good job as villain, but nothing I will remember him by.All in all, I would say that I am disappointed. I didn't have huge expectations to begin with, but where I thought the film would deliver, it just didn't. Basically it's a film for the technical wizards to show how much they can do in terms of visual effects , and they can do a lot. It's just not what I want.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A film that proves it's time to abandon ship on this franchise.,"Part of me wishes that the title of this film were true. What I wouldn't give to have these dead men not tell their tale of revenge. That being said, I had some hopes that this movie would help redeem the franchise after the lackluster On Stranger Tides (2011). After all, Javier Bardem has proven to be an effective villain in such films as No Country for Old Men (2007) and Skyfall (2012), so I thought he could help carry this movie as a solid antagonist. Unfortunately, even he could not save this sinking ship of a franchise.The main problem with Dead Men Tell No Tales is that it feels rote and uninspired. Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow feels more lucky than actually talented at pirating. Granted, that was some of his charm in the previous films, but not all of it. Add to this a loose connection to the original trilogy as a vain attempt to remind the audience how great those films were, and it just highlights how bad this movie was. In fact, I felt the many overt double entendres were more groan-worthy than clever, merely pandering to the lowest common denominator. I can only assume that was why the doe-eyed and tightly bosomed Carina (Kaya Scodelario) featured into the plot so much.In a franchise that stakes itself on wild swashbuckling action sequences, this film had maybe two of note, and even they were uninteresting at best. This movie might have been better if it picked its battles more carefully, as the plot seemed like a stone skipping along the sea: never going very deep into any single character's arc, thus making them all seem insignificant when compiled together. If it was merely about Salazar's (Javier Bardem) revenge, Henry's (Brenton Thwaites) desire to break his father's curse, or Carina's search for treasure; then it might have been interesting. Unfortunately, it is all of these things and none of these things at the same time.A film that proves it's time to abandon ship on this franchise, I give Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales 2.0 stars out of 5.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Pirates of the Caribbean 5 Is Truly ""Lost At Sea""","Ever since the Pirates of the Caribbean Ride opened in Disneyland, the producers pitched the idea of adapting the ride into a fantastic action-packed movie entitled Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, and four sequels following the significant characters. The characters include the witty pirate Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), his friends, and crew members on The Black Pearl; the ship based on the original film. The movie will not fulfill anyone's expectation of a great movie because it entirely changes Captain Jack Sparrow's character. Besides, the plot lines are similar to the other sequels of the franchise. Either way, Dead Men Tell No Tales, is a merchandising film and will neither entertain fans nor everyday moviegoers.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

Have fun with the pirates and Johny Depp is still the soul,"Dear readers, Pirates of the Caribbean is a movie that I have been watching since my high school. Now I am already in the working life, but the spirit of that movie series is still on my heart, so that yesterday I watched it. Since last year, I know that there will be a continuity of that movie, but I never knew that the movie is about Revenge, well yes, finally about Revenge. Before I am telling to you my review, it is important to remember that each movie of Pirates of Caribbean movie, includes an unique plot within it, for example the last adventure is about Family, and then the others are about Love, Friendship, Father-Son relation, and Captain-Crew honesty. In this latest movie of Pirates of the Caribbean, it is about Revenge, but do not hesitate to watch it, because the plot is designed not to show up about the Revenge itself, but there are legend, myth, Science, Witch, fantasy, history of Bank, ethical Law of pirates, and of course ridiculous adventure are around the plot, from the beginning to the end. I can guarantee you that you will be laughing of many funny actions or languages, and sometimes you do not care about the end, what you really care is that the safety of the soul of this movie: That is Captain Jack Sparrow. Yes, Johny Depp is still the soul of the movie. He is leading all characters and he is the one who is making this adventure happens. Besides of its perfect, this movie has some illogical scenes and some missing plots, so that for those who are not really fan of Pirates of the Caribbean movies, will not really understand who is the real enemy and what pirates stake of life in that kind of level to protect Captain Jack Sparrow. Well, there must be a betrayal, but this movie never betray you to give a lot of have fun!!",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A mediocre film from a dying series of great films.,"Sadly, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales was just a mediocre film from a dying series of great films, and this film honestly brings nothing new to the table for this series. In a time full of cinematic universes, and unnecessary reboots, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales doesn't do anything special to wow audiences like it originally did almost 15 years ago. The film was full of mediocre acting, writing, visuals, and music, and is a film that will honestly just end up being forgotten like the film that came before it. In the end I decided to give Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales an ""Alright"" on theVade Review Bar or a 5 out of 10. It's heartbreaking to say, but I have to agree with what Mark Kennedy from the Associated Press said about this film. ""After this fifth episode, you'll wish Disney would just declare the franchise dead and tell no more tales.""Read more at theVade.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Funny and entertaining,"This film tells the story of Captain Jack Sparrow, and his hunt for the trident of Poseidon. He is met with many violent attacks by ghosts, and persecution by the government. However, that does not deter him and his crew to accomplish his mission.""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales"" is probably an unnecessary sequel, but I watched it anyway for completeness sake. To my surprise, I enjoyed the film and found it very funny. Jack Sparrow's lines are funny as in previous films, and got the cinema giggling in many occasions. The guillotine scene is really good, it is funny and thrilling at the same time.The story itself is just alright. It is unusual in that the story improves progressively, culminating in a touching and thrilling ending. I think it does the job of entertaining people for 2 hours.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
A quick review,"I liked this movie. So many critical comments are being shown, saying it's missing adventure, miss the old sparrow, lack of this and that. This movie has adventures left and right, it's beautiful made, it's even heart warming and funny, it's great and everytime I watch it i wanna watch the whole franchise one more time (except the last one) let's forget about that movie and actually praise this fun, family adventure movie about our favorite pirate.

Another Fun Installment,"I will lead off this review stating that I am fan of the Pirates of the Caribbean films. It is interesting that this all stemmed from a ride at Disney that has spawned into this series of films. One thing that does help is that there is a lot of lore involving the ocean and seas out there. The synopsis for this film is Captain Jack Sparrow searches for the trident of Poseidon while being pursued by an undead sea captain and his crew.This film introduces the son of Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley). He is a young boy named Henry Turner and trying to find his father. He ends up performing a ritual that allows him to see Will. He is told that he needs to move on and that there is nothing he can do to help him. He is stuck on the Flying Dutchman for all of eternity.Henry grows up to Brenton Thwaites and he is working on a British ship. They are chasing after some pirates and this takes them into a cove. Henry is branded as a mutineer by having his sleeves ripped. They don't listen to him though. We do find the villain of this film, Javier Bardem as Captain Salazar. I really enjoyed this character's back-story. He was a Spanish navy captain who was hunting down pirates. He had scourged most of the waters, but was foiled by a young Jack Sparrow. He has been sealed in the cove since, waiting to be free.Reprising his role as Jack is Johnny Depp. We see that he is still a bumbling pirate and goes right back into this role as if he had never been away. His crew abandons him and he is penniless. He gives away his famous compass that directs him to where he needs to go. In giving it away, he frees Salazar. Also on this same island is Carina Smyth (Kaya Scodelario). She is being tried as a witch for studying astronomy. She does free herself from her cell. Also washing up on the island is Henry. The three of these meet up to try to find Poseidon's Trident. Henry needs it thinking it will free his father from his curse.The story of this film does do some good things for me. I love the concept of Salazar. He is a pirate hunter who is now a ghost that now he is freed is back to eliminating all pirates. His hatred for them is even more. He even wants to find the trident as he believes he could use it as a weapon. These films are geared down a teenage or a younger adult audience, but I like that it took a bit darker ton. There is quite a bit of bloodshed. To get around this, we don't see a lot of the blood though. This is also a CGI fest with Salazar and his men. I've come to expect with these films though. I will give it credit as it does look real enough. It's enjoyable in seeing him and his men attack other ships as well. They do some creative things with it.We do get Captain Hector Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) back in this film as well. He is a solid actor and really becomes this role. I even like that they tie his story into everything. It doesn't feel forced to have him back as the back-story involving him works. It is also fun to see him as he is that character who constantly is just out for himself, much like a meaner version of Jack.The two younger stars, Henry and Carina do give the film a fresh feel. They are both good looking and breathe some life into franchise. It also affords them the opportunity to continue it on if they want to as well. I really like the concept of Carina being into astronomy which gets her persecuted as a witch, much like the scientists of the time. Using stars is the best way to navigate while being on the ocean from what I've learned since there's no real landmarks aside from land. It is great though for this film as it incorporates mythology. The beings from these stories are also in constellations in the stars which I thought is a solid touch.The rest of the supporting cast is really good as well. We get Kevin McNally back who is Gibbs. He has become a somewhat faithful partner to Jack and fun to see. Martin Klebba, Marty, is also back in this film. I did like to see the inclusion of David Wenham. He is Scarfield who is a British soldier. I think he is a solid supporting actor and his performance is good in this film.Now the editing of the film itself is fine. We get the different groups where we can learn about them and then it works amongst them until the climax when everyone converges on each other. I think that is important when you are working with a film like this. An issue I have with all of these films is that they run a little bit long in my opinion, but it is hard to really see where to cut things to shorten it.The score of the film was pretty solid. Geoff Zanelli composed this film and this is the first of the series he has worked on. I do feel that followed what the previous films did so I can't give him too much credit. The theme was the same as the previous ones. He did go with the grand, classic style music that just fits. A lot of that is keeping up with the time period that the film was released, but also being on the open sea this is the type of music I'd associate with it as well.I am adding this to the horror film research that I am conducting due to having horror film creatures like ghosts and zombies. It also has a lot of killing, which is kind of rare for a Disney based film. You don't get to see a lot of it, but we still know that it is happening. This one especially as it seems to have a darker tone that many of the others.And with that said, I would recommend seeing this film if you like the series. The actors that you've seen in the past reprise their roles and it seems like they never left. Bardem joining as Salazar was good. His character is quite dark and menacing. I liked the story as well as the mythology. This film doesn't really violate anything that happened in past films, so that is good. The only thing is that the compass that Jack has is important again. I do have question in regards to that I need to check back on the previous films. The editing itself is fine, but it does run a little long. The score of the film is grand like the other films. It fits what the film is going for. Now this is a popcorn film with some horror elements to it. I enjoyed it, but do not come in expecting too much. I think this film is above average.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
My favorite Pirates sequel,"My boyfriend and I recently rewatched all POTC films, and it was a pretty fun and interesting experience. I've watched some of them several times, but haven't for a long time. I remember loving the first and fourth one because they were great action/adventure/fantasy movies with a simple enough premise. The second and third (especially) started to take themselves way too serious for me, and they became boring and extremely convoluted. Obviously good movies, but not anything I'd bother rewatching over and over. The fifth entry we only saw once in theaters and I remember thinking it was OK, but loved the Knightley and Bloom cameo at the end.Rewatching it, some of my opinons change. The first is still the best. The second and third entry are still good movies, but way too long and convoluted. The fourth however is a lot weaker than I used to think. It had a good plot with the fountain of youth story, but no new characters were good, which it needed after losing Knithley and Bloom. The writing isn't as good as before, and the comedy surrounding Jack became stale and silly for me. The story left some loose ends, and overall it was a lazy attempt compared to the other films. My favorite part however are the mermaids, that was very interesting I thought.Now rewatching the last sequel I highly enjoyed it. The new characters were better, the main pirate villain was pretty scare, the story was easy to follow and I was always entertained. The negatives here too is that Jack becomes too silly sometimes, and every action sequence with him becomes cartoonish when he literally survive everything, and every convenient thing for him to walk out of a situation unharmed and unscaled is utterly ridiculous, but besides that I really enjoyed the final entry",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
*A High-Seas Adventure Redeemed*,"In the latest installment of the beloved Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, *Dead Men Tell No Tales* sails into uncharted waters, blending nostalgia with fresh energy to deliver a thrilling experience for both die-hard fans and newcomers alike. The story follows Captain Jack Sparrow, played masterfully once more by Johnny Depp, as he confronts his past while being pursued by a vengeful ghost pirate, Captain Salazar, portrayed with chilling intensity by Javier Bardem.What stands out in this chapter is the film's ability to blend humor with action, all while exploring themes of legacy, redemption, and the relentless pursuit of freedom. The visual spectacle is undeniably stunning; vibrant CGI brings fantastical sea creatures and breathtaking ship battles to life, reminiscent of the franchise's earlier highs while forging its own identity. The cinematography is a treasure in itself, with sweeping shots of lush landscapes and exhilarating chase sequences that keep viewers on the edge of their seats.Introducing new characters, particularly Henry Turner (Brenton Thwaites) and Carina Smyth (Kaya Scodelario), the film breathes new life into the series, offering a bridge between the past and future. Their chemistry carries a sense of youthful exuberance that is infectious, allowing for a fresh dynamic without overshadowing the iconic Jack Sparrow.While some may argue that the film treads familiar ground, it also offers moments of poignancy-exploring the cost of obsession and the bonds that tie families together. The ambitious narrative threads are supported by an engaging script, with moments of wit and a healthy dose of pirate lore that fans have come to love.*Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales* is a delightful swashbuckling saga that reminds us why we fell in love with the franchise in the first place. With a perfect blend of humor, heart, and high-seas adventure, it's a worthy addition to the series-one that proves old pirates never truly fade away, and that every tale, no matter how twisted, still holds the promise of a new adventure. Set sail, and enjoy the ride!",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""Dead Men Tell No Tales"" has a lot of action and some good jokes, but everything is very mechanical, not surprising, adding nothing to the franchise","Fifth film in the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, ""Dead Men Tell No Tales"" is directed by Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg, with the script by Jeff Nathanson. Jerry Bruckheimer returned as a producer, while Johnny Depp, Javier Bardem, Geoffrey Rush, Brenton Thwaites, Kaya Scodelario and Orlando Bloom star in the film. The duo of directors cited the first feature of the series, ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"", as inspiration for the script and tone of the film.This time, Captain Salazar (Javier Bardem) is the new stone in the shoes of Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp). He leads an army of murderous ghost pirates and is willing to kill all the pirates on the face of the Earth. To escape, Sparrow must find Poseidon's Trident, which gives its owner the power to control the sea.After a more episodic adventure seen in ""On Stranger Tides"", presenting us with other tales from the seven seas as mermaids and the Fountain of Youth, this time Jeff Nathanson's script focuses on other aspects, such as witchcraft, mysticism and science, in addition to put the famous Trident of Poseidon in the middle of everything. In fact, what we see here is an adventure that can be compared to ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"" - many parallels can be drawn (more scenes at sea, battles between ships, cursed crew, revenge etc.), although the tone does not present any newness and innovation. Now there is very little left of the novelty that one long day caused. Much of this was lost in the wear and tear of a formula that was never rethought, ""The Revenge of Salazar"" is the synthesis of this reduction, something that had been demonstrated since the third film in the saga. After a six-year rest, the series returns with Dead Men Tell No Tales without the dramatic weight of the last two films and with a visibly tired Jack Sparrow. The fatigue of the character and Johnny Depp is wide open on the screen, but it does not detract from the uncompromised afternoon session proposed by the studio. With an episodic air, this fifth feature has a simple script, full of predictable twists, but with honest execution.One of the aspects that guarantee the identity of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, is how the old sea legends are used in order to compose this universe that mixes fantasy with reality. We saw this with Davy Jones, the Fountain of Youth, the Kraken, among many other elements. Dead Men Tell No Tales, however, sounds like the chapter that adds the least in this sense, even though it offers a look at Jack's past and resolves the future of others. Poseidon's Trident is something that is never truly worked on and we just have to accept what it does, similar to the Blackbeard's magical ship in the previous film.What the script proposes here is a return to the central characters of that story at the beginning of the franchise, the first scene already shows the return of Will Turner, a famous figure played by Orlando Bloom, and even if the narrative is not focused on him, but on his son, Henry Turner (Brenton Thwaites), there is a first attempt to co-opt the audience by remembering his first and best titles. The decision to tell a story from Jack Sparrow's past gives the impression that the pirate will be the center of attention. This doesn 't happen. Despite guiding the narrative, he shares the screen well with Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), the villain Salazar (Javier Bardem) and mainly with the new protagonist couple, Carina (Kaya Scodelario) and Henry (Brenton Thwaites). The plot mixes the revenge of the Spanish officer, with a search for identity and redemption by the two youngest in the cast. One is the rebellious son of Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and the other is a young scientist who tries to give a feminine look to the pirates' journey. In addition to the predictability of the script, the biggest mistake of this new Pirates is to force a connection with the predecessors. Bringing the sense of an even larger universe (as if the other films had not done enough) does not add or increase interest in that world, but makes any subject that escapes the main core an unnecessary prop. This happens with Barbossa's plot and the English Navy's always futile goals. While focusing on resolving Salazar's rematch and Sparrow's ""messes"", Vengeance approaches the first Pirates and works.
It is true that in the opening minutes the film brings and articulates everything that was once interesting in the series, there is adventure from this young protagonist, there is humor, there are even good visual insights. The first part of ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales"" refers to a classic matinee tone, something very present in that first film in the series. The scene of the bank robbery by Jack and his troupe is sensational. However, this new feature is a constant chronicle of the wear and tear of the series, the narrative of the fifth title itself is getting lost. Everything sounds extremely conniving with the characters of the work, everything seems to happen magically in the feature, without giving the viewer the slightest explanation. Even the encounter between Henry and Carina is completely played, the character just appears in the other's bed for no reason. The feature is a succession of these inexplicable encounters that only facilitate this narrative. The characters meet, appear or know something without it being shown to the viewer. And the worst thing, when something comes to light, is through the worst and least functional narrative crutches, such as the use of a flashback to explain the relationship between Salazar and Sparrow, something that, until this point, its importance for the narrative is not understood.The number of unnecessary sequences and focuses is too much for immersion in the story. To begin with, the whole relationship between Henry and Carina fails to convince us at all and it is clear that they are there just to repeat Will and Elizabeth's dynamics, something that never happens, of course. Other than that, we have a completely expendable focus that does not affect the narrative at all in a crown officer, played by David Wenham, who is certainly wasted in this film. It gets ridiculous as the whole issue surrounding this character is resolved in an instant, just like that. The story always follows the same formula: Sparrow is always about to be executed when his crew comes to save him and, from there, set out on a new adventure. The whole world always wants the head of the pirate: The English Navy, other pirates, sorcerers, sea monsters and, in the case of the new film, ghosts. Each story has its object of desire. It can be a treasure chest, a magic compass, a mythological trident, things like that, which are passed from hand to hand during the plot. In search of the artifact, the group ends up finding themselves in several unusual situations, with pirates ally and betraying themselves all the time, unexpected solutions and many jokes and puns, some that work, but most do not. Another repeat play: after Keith Richards acted as Sparrow's father in the previous two films, it is now Paul McCartney who makes a cameo as the pirate's uncle.For the first time in the series since The Curse of the Black Pearl (which he composed in association), Hans Zimmer did not compose the music for the film, but one of his colleagues, Geoff Zanelli, who had worked on all previous films in the franchise, now as the main composer. The composer maintains the classic themes of the series and knows how to amplify the emotion and tone of adventure when necessary. At least Nigel Phelps' production design maintains the level of the series, along with excellent visual effects, especially bold to build Salazar and his crew, which perfectly symbolize death itself. However, alongside cinematographer Paul Cameron, the directors end up delivering confusing action scenes that are hampered by excessive effects and very dark moments. Regarding the effects, the facial rejuvenation performed by Disney deserves to be highlighted, which hits the spot on young Jack Sparrow, who, ironically, is better than the old man in this film.Depp, just like in the previous film, just repeats more of the same, without the same inspiration as before. If before everything revolved around Captain Jack Sparrow and his iconic figure, now he looks just like a prop, whose function is to repeat dribbles and mannerisms, without this developing the narrative seen. Like Depp, Hector Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) used to be charismatic. Both characters are more uninteresting than ever, with both actors playing automatically. The villain Salazar is a little better, both for the performance of Javier Bardem and for the beautiful visual effects that accompany the character, keeping the Spanish captain in an eternal state of death and drowning. Bardem is fine, but does not receive a script that allows him to create a really threatening villain.""Pirates of the Caribbean - Dead Men Tell No Tales"" has a lot of action and some good jokes, but everything is very mechanical, not surprising. It is more of the same. For those who just want fun, that's fine, but lack a minimum of creativity. The final climax in the quest for Poseidon's Trident is excellent. The film certainly just repeats the same formula as the first film, adding virtually nothing to the franchise. With a Jack Sparrow more exaggerated than usual, a plot full of unnecessary elements and characters that do not convince us, this work shows, once and for all, that Jack should have already hung his hat, burying the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, which already gave what he had to offer.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It's Just Too Much,"We still remember the pleasant cinematic surprise from Pirates of the Caribbean, which took us on a fun adventure fit for the young at heart. When the sequel came out, we started to grow a little sick of it. By the third, it had overstayed its welcome. By the fourth, crap, I keep forgetting that a fourth one exists! Anyway, now we're on fifth, where a few good qualities, to our amazement, remained consistent these past fourteen years. It still sustains the same atmosphere, like watching a product of the 2000's. Depp has still got it with his iconic performance, Geoffrey Rush still graces the screen, and best of all, Hans Zimmer's famous score sounds fresher than ever.Whew, got the good stuff out of the way. Now let us talk about the atrocities of Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales.Basically, the main hero has to find the Ark of the Covenant before the Nazis do to harness its power to control life and death. Oops, wrong movie. Well, just replace the ark with the trident of Poseidon, and the Nazis with a pirate ghost army, and the plot stays pretty much the same. Yeah, the youth of the previous decade were into ancient mythology, but now they moved on to obsessing over the future. Why not let a dated concept sit to collect shelf dust?The whole Indiana Jones rip-off of a plot may intrigue the parents after overcoming the opening prologue: A boy goes out rowing, ties his ankle to a rope, then tosses into the ocean a pile of rocks tied to the other end of the rope. It looks less like Will Turner's son going down to see him in the Flying Dutchman and more like Suicide 101. This honestly could have all landed on the cutting room floor; everything is retold anyway.The teens may feel rather dissatisfied too. No pretty imagery parades through to please their senses, particularly by the dull darkly lit stage combat. That also goes for the ""fun"" action scenes shot in broad daylight, such as the first one, where a bunch of horses pull a house through the village streets. Then later, zombie sharks attack for three minutes' tops, a CGI-infested made-for-3D visual which looks like patty cake compared to what Zack Snyder can orchestrate.As for the kids, keep them far away. After all, the rating says PG-13. Inappropriate content gladly makes its way in for nothing besides a few cheap laughs, from the sexual (gawking at a woman's bare ankles) to the tasteless (offending every Spaniard in the world). However, the children are most likely to be traumatized by some of the imagery, including a basket of severed heads at the foot of a guillotine.Although the greater portion of audiences will groan over the production's excessive desperation to curse you with a giggle fit. At the screening I went to, the audience laughed plenty throughout, even I chuckled a few times. Yet the dialogue still lacks any point as the cast goes tirelessly in search for a punchline. For instance, one of the many pointless moments puts Jack Sparrow inside a whale skeleton to wed a boogery ogress of a woman.These tiresome jokes are blaring enough to make you believe the plot doesn't even exist, or that the jokes came from the mouths of human beings with fears and opinions. The characters keep contradicting their own desires; especially Jack Sparrow's Black Pearl crew, who right at the beginning abandons him for no reason, then later comes back for him for no reason. A predictable romantic subplot further bombards the key plot, as played between two actors with no chemistry; the female half of the equation, played by the unenthusiastic Kaya Scodelario (The Maze Runner) makes it worse by relying on the eyes on her chest other than the eyes on her face to stir up emotions. You could potentially forgive the writers for their lack of care in developing believable relationships, until the ending closes every story arc with pure hogwash.Oh, believe me, it gets worse. This motion picture also brings up the fact that Galileo Galilei actually built his telescope to search for the trident of Poseidon, as a map to its location is found within the stars. Apparently, all these historians overlooked that important detail. Well, considering this alternate reality features a ghost army who pass through matter yet still kill people with their swords, that historical ""fact"" is the closest to believable Dead Men Tell No Tales gets.Okay, enough already. Did we seriously forget that Pirates of the Caribbean was once only a freaking animatronic show breathed on by Walt himself?",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Somehow this Tale was Told Anyway,"I sound like a broken record in my reviews of the Pirates series, complaining again and again about the sloppy, incoherent plot lines. But I think what is important in these movies, and the reason why my kids, and I as well, enjoy watching them so much, is the action and sense of adventure, enhanced through the amazing special effects (though let's come back to those in 15 years time!). It is hard to top Davy Jones and the Flying Dutchman, but Salazar, his ship and his pets manage to be more terrifying, if a bit less interesting. Also the roguishness and charisma of Captain Jack, which simultaneously angers and attracts the other characters, and the audience as well, at least the ones who keep coming back to the series. OK, so the idea seems to have run its course, but as I pointed out to my kiddos after the movie, if Sinbad had seven voyages, why not Jack?",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

An average Sci-Fi Flick,"When an old enemy of Jack's arises from the dead to kill him, the famous pirate's only hope lies in a famous but unknown trident which he pursues with two youngsters who seek the artefact for their own reasons.It's a pretty simplistic plot which presents another episode of Jack's adventures, while he is chased by the undead. The characters are not very well developed in terms of complexity but manage to keep up with the plot. There is also a reckless disregard of logic and physics, which is to be expected from this type of movie but it really seems too exaggerated at times. All these aside, you're going to watch it for the special effects which look spectacular in 3D and create a wonderful science fiction atmosphere. Oh, and for Jack Sparrow of course, who keeps you entertained with his jokes and typical attitude.I have to say that it is quite an average movie, which doesn't excel in any aspect, apart from the visual part.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Bring back that horizon,"I don't like it better or worse than Part IV but just like ""On Stranger Tides"" it is not on par with the original three movies ( and yes I loved the first and really liked the second and third) but it did have its moments and it did have some cool ideas and scenes. I particularly liked the ending which had some nostalgic and emotional vibes. But yes the franchise is more or less over, and I say that although I liked it. The screenplay and especially dialogues were really not good and rather dry - or try hard? Johnny Depp proves that he obviously only does it for the pay cheque (while i really was motivated in part 1 - 3 ) his character falls more and more flat. Javier Bardem was not good here either. I really did not like his character nor his performance. Glad that the great Geoffrey Rush was back and he was the only one who really seemed to have enjoyed being there. And I was happy to see Orlando Bloom back (never thought I would say that) because that brought back some tiny little dynamic the former films had. The two new youngsters Brenton Thwaits and especially Kaya Scodalario were fine and had decent enough characters and motivations. Why I still liked the film? The action scenes were great. Many fantastic stunts and action value which constantly kept me entertained. There were some really nice twists. Oh and they finally put more emphasize on the great score again. Cinematography and visual effects were also good. But if there is ever be a sixth one I hope they bring back Bloom and Keira Knightley in main roles again for nostalgic reasons and to bring back the old dynamic of the trio which is one of the reasons the first three films worked so well. Oh and Gore Verbinski probably wouldn't hurt either.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"It's very entertaining, very funny and visually impressive, but not much beyond that","Pirates of the Caribbean:Dead Men Tell No Tales is a fifth movie in Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean series with Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush returning, but also some new stars Brenton Thwaites (The Giver, Maleficent) and Kaya Scodelario (The Maze Runner) and the great Javier Bardem as a lead villain Salazar.Just like every Pirates of the Caribbean movie, it's a good time guaranteed once again. It's a visual spectacle and it's full of witty dialogues and fun action sequences. The actors are clearly having a great time in their roles and it's a joy to watch them (even though Jack Sparrow is turning into a parody of himself), but all that put together didn't make for a memorable enough experience. It was fun, but not captivating enough. It's not one of those movies you will remember much when you get out of the theater. It's a good time while it lasts, but it won't stick with you. At least it wasn't as uninteresting as On Stranger Tides. And by the way, don't get too hyped up about that Paul McCartney role. He's in the movie for less than a minute and feels awfully shoehorned in. But maybe he will have a bigger role in the future. Still, I don't think he was necessary here, as much as I appreciate him.Yes, you will have fun, but you will forget about it eventually. It's still not as good as the first three movies in the series.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Well if it ain't broke . . .,"There's a certain recipe to these movies, and ""Dead Men Tell No Tales"" adheres faithfully to it Johnny Depp gets into one ridiculous situation after another, plays the dialogue with eccentric flair, all the while acting as a plot device for two central characters. In this case, it's Brenton Thwaites and the lovely Kaya Scodelario. There's an element here of getting the band back together as the crew and Barbossa reappear, and aside from some new curse, it's all very familiar.It's not as overblown as I'd feared (and mercifully shorted than ""At World's End), and maybe that's because of the audience. The guy in from of me was pretty pumped when the Black Pearl made her return; we're talking' fist in the air.Strictly as a vehicle for Johnny Depp to do his pirate thing, it's not bad.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

It made me nostalgic,"Six years have passed away since the last time I've seen a new Pirates of Caribbean movie, one of my favorite fantasy series, and I was so excited to watch it. I came with high expectations, not about its quality, but with hope of it bringing me back to younger ages, giving me the same excitation as it used to. However, I left the cinema disappointed. Maybe I have outgrown the movie in these six years and now I am looking for more realistic and thoughtful movies, who knows? But this movies brought me no thrills at all. They've tried to put in comedy in almost every single scene, I remember the old films to have few funny scenes and dialogues, but that was just some scenes and it was well placed throughout the movie. In this case it was just a bunch of jokes one after another, and I felt satiation even boredom. Also, I think they gave too much time to some of the unimportant scenes, while those that are crucial to plot were finished in matter of seconds. Movie seemed much more fantasized than it used to be as well. It feels like they could've invented anything they want and put it in no matter how does it fit into the movie.

There are definitely no tales to be told in this instalment that's for sure. They've just retold the FIRST movie all over again. This is just another cash cow that the producers have used to make a quick buck.There is a checklist here that seems familiar and let me see if I can get most of them:1 cursed pirates who have a beef with Jack and want revenge; 2 Jack Sparrow is constantly drunk and who of course does something really stupid to cause the supernatural pirates to come after him; 3 a governor and captain of the guards who are jerks; 4 there is an ""evil character"" who wishes to use a supernatural power to control the sea for the British Empire ""Rule Britannia""; 5 the dutiful son who wants to be reunited with his dear unjustly cursed papa; 6 a girl who is oppressed and under-appreciated by society and male figures; 7 there is a curse that only the son of someone cursed and pretty girl can break; 8 over the top action scenes that defy any reason or logic; 9 a mysterious magical artefact who we don't know who built it or for what reason can break all curses simply by destroying it; 10 Hector Barbossa dies.......... AGAIN! 11 Jack reclaims the Black Pearl ............ AGAIN!Oh well, at least Jack didn't die this time around. Now let's hope that the franchise is finally put to rest.

I didn't think they could maintain the quality!,"I was gladly surprised that the previous movie didn't suck as it looked like a basic attempt to milk a franchise, which usually results in mediocrity.

I have to give it to Disney on this one, they actually did right by the Pirates franchise and each one of the movies is tons of fun, even if they're not without faults.

The story was always kind of stupid and childish. So what? I don't care. If you go to Pirates of the Caribbean and expect to see deep complex stories and psychological elements you are at the wrong movie. Go instead watch Oscar winners with black, gay, slaves, etc being abused.The worst thing that can happen is that all this negativity can influence the box office and we might not see another one.

The death of a franchise,It says something about your film when the best part is a cameo for Sir Paul McCartney. Johnny Depp is giving a bad performance fueled by his recent divorce making the character of Captain Jack Sparrow seem dumb and unfunny which goes against everything shown before.

Geoffrey Rush is outstanding in this film offering up some great scenes particularly towards the end. Overall just skip this and stick to the original trilogy,3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"I do not know what these people are writing, this movie is terrible","Pirates of the Caribbean, Dead men tell no tales or Salazar's revenge apparently, is a terrible fifth installment to the already declining in quality franchise that should return to its roots before it kills itself.The main character, Jack Sparrow, has been reduced to a series of cheap slapstick and sexual innuendos. What bothered me most is that he isn't clever anymore. His wits, or as they say in the movie, his ""luck"" has run out. In previous installments Jack got out of tough situations using skills and cleverly planned out (or spontaneous) methods of escape that involve his surroundings. Now it is all just random dumb slapstick luck. His ""jokes"" are cringe worthy and very hard to listen to with exceptions that are very scarce.The two new characters that are designed to replace Elisabeth and Will aren't as likable and don't really have any arcs. That's literally all I can say about them.The first out of two things that the movie has going for it is Javier Bardem's character. Not his story or his arc but his acting and appearance.The plot is full of holes relating to the previous movies and it has some really weird decisions throughout. In general it is very cheesy.The second and final thing that the movie has that is redeemable are the effects. They are spectacular in some scenes. That's it. The rest of this movie is quite bad. Maybe enjoyable for children.4.7/10",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Most probably the last POTC with Jack Sparrow,"*) K Reviews *) ( ( This is better than the last one. But this has it's own blunders. First of Jack Sparrow is the backbone of this franchise, and Disney has ruined this for him and for us as well by not differentiating work and private matter. Now as for the movie, the Spanish captain is brutal and ruthless and I liked that character, and i would love to see the more of it, and the trident back story could be interesting as well. Although we get to know theat how Jack sparrow because Captain Jack Sparrow, that was a good one actually. But overall the story looks a bit kiddish, as it could be more adult centric then it could be enjoyable by more people who has grown up with this franchise and can relate to the story in a better way.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

How am I feeling?,"just back from the opening day's last show here in Australian capital, thought why not share how i am feeling about it. I'm a die-hard Pirates of Caribbean fan so naturally i was expecting a bit too much from the movie. I can't say I hated it because for a fan like me you can put Captain Jack Sparrow on a motorcycle instead of Black Pearl, I'm still gonna like it, Savvy! But towards the end, I was feeling like if this is the end, they have wasted everyone's last ten years. When they were running the end-credits, I was literally praying for a ray of hope in the shape of another after-end-credits' scene that usually links towards the next outing :-( then i remember that i felt the same way after 'on stranger tides'. All in all, I felt story-line was a bit on the weaker side. Chemistry between characters, especially involving the new cast members, doesn't feel right for some reason. Perhaps they should try to go backwards: for example, a well presented making of Captain Jack Sparrow can be a perfect finish to the series if they can't keep up with the brand. But a finish like this one is just not doing justice to the fans. I have tried my very best not to give away any spoilers, trust me :-)",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Not Groundbreaking, but Pretty Good","Since the first Pirates film, each installment has gotten worse until Dead Men Tell No Tales. While I do not find it groundbreaking or jaw-dropping masterpiece, I was pleasantly surprised with the film. Going back to the original formula which made The Curse of the Black Pearl such a success was a smart choice. I enjoyed seeing true motivation behind each individual's actions.I wish the filmmakers would have skipped On Stranger Tides and just focused their efforts on making Dead Men Tell No Tales cleaner and crisper. If they would have done that, I believe the audience would not be so burned out on Jack Sparrow and would be excited for what the future brings for the Pirates franchise.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Having fun with it,"I am a sucker for the Pirate movies, because I just still am a big fan of the Captain Jack Sparrow character. And that is just the movies, not to mention all the charity work Johnny Depp does by visiting Hospitals and what not in costume/character. But back to this, which brings back the fun and is relatively ""normal"" when you take the story. It's not too complex, one of the things previous sequels were condemned for.We do get a bit of throwback by connections to previous movies, though generally speaking you don't have to have seen them to enjoy this. Though as every other Pirates movie this has a scene after the credits. Which generally makes you wonder if there will be more? This was supposed to be the last of them ... and it would make a good closing chapter ...",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fun.,"The main point to take away from this review: it was FUN.And possibly - for me - better than the last 2 movies or so - though admittedly it's been years since I've watched them - which is why the box office earnings seem surprising. It was somewhat easier to understand, in spite of still containing plenty of over-the-top fiction. I mean magic, curses etc are all nice and dandy but they somehow don't fit as well here as they would a film FOCUSED on magic, since there is no world-building, no real explanation of the made-up rules governing them, etc... they're just being served to us and we have to accept them. Personally I don't mind that greatly, though I understand why others might not: it leads to confusion, and even MORE difficulties in keeping up with the already convoluted plots. Either way, this installment was easier to wrap one's head around than some of the previous, at least in my opinion.And, keeping in mind that this is what it is, a comedic family film, I believe it fulfills its purpose of entertaining, and it does not claim to be anything that it's not.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Sluggish Story, But Slowly Picks Up the Pace","Johnny Depp returns to the high seas as Captain Jack Sparrow in this fifth outing of 'Pirates of the Caribbean' titled Dead Men Tell No Tales. It was definitely a movie to watch and I have to admit that it felt pleasing to see a few familiar faces return for old time's sake and a few likable new faces thrown into the mix.The plot centers around Captain Jack as he and his new companions Henry (Brenton Thwaites) and Carina (Maze Runner's Kaya Scodelario) venture out to search for the mystical Trident of Poseidon believing it would end the curse of Henry's father Will Turner (Orlando Bloom). But an old nemesis named Captain Salazar seeks the trident as well and holds a long-standing vengeance against Jack.For a running time of 129 minutes (the shortest of the previous movies), I have to say the story in this latest installment felt slightly more understandable and not as dreary or dismal as its 2011 predecessor On Stranger Tides. Javier Bardem's portrayal of the nefarious Salazar is a formidable foe, but when comparing him to other villains of the previous Pirates films, it feels too routine. Nevertheless, his menacing presence proves that he will resort to any cutthroat tactics to vanquish his enemies (much like Davy Jones).The blending of CGI with practical effects flows seamlessly well and several comedic moments balances out the swashbuckling action that made the film series well-known. To avoid spoilers, there's more to the story once the closing credits finish rolling. It's nowhere close to the ranks as the 2003 original ""The Curse of the Black Pearl,"" but it's a movie that definitely stands out on its own. Despite a few sluggish moments in some parts, it was tolerable enough to follow.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Decent one time watch,Have fun with the pirates and Johny Depp","Once again we get Johnny Depp as the ever funny and intoxicated Captain Jack Sparrow. His performance is hilariously outrageous. He is very good and funny within the film. Unlike his performance in Stranger Tides his acting a characterization of the titular captain seems to have great passion and not the feeling of a called in performance.I was going to give a 10 simply due to opening scene but then movie started to slow a little bit.Also, unnecessarily, the stone lady on the head of the ship started to jump ship to ship and try to hunt Jack with a giant stone spear,in a sudden.Nonetheless, I will surely watch this movie again. Seeing Jack moving around is always worth watching the whole movie.The film starts on a positive note. I had good hopes that it could go somewhere, but mid- way through the story starts to split up and it didn't really have a good rhythm to it.

Love the franchise,"Swashbuckling and thrilling adventure that breathes new life into the beloved pirate franchise.Johnny Depp returns as the iconic Captain Jack Sparrow, and his performance is as charismatic and entertaining as ever. Depp's portrayal of the witty and eccentric pirate captain is the heart and soul of the film, reminding us why we fell in love with the character in the first place.The addition of Javier Bardem as Captain Salazar brings a formidable and menacing presence to the story. Bardem's portrayal of the vengeful ghost pirate is chilling and adds a new layer of intrigue to the narrative.The film's visual effects are nothing short of spectacular. The action sequences, especially those involving ghostly ships and supernatural elements, are thrilling and visually stunning. The attention to detail in creating the pirate-infested world is commendable.Pirates of the Caribbean: Salazar's Revenge strikes a perfect balance between humor, action, and heartfelt moments. The witty and humorous dialogue, combined with epic sea battles, keeps the audience engaged throughout the film.The film also pays homage to the earlier installments of the franchise, with clever references and nods to fan-favorite characters and moments. It successfully weaves a tale that feels both nostalgic and fresh.The return of familiar faces, such as Orlando Bloom as Will Turner and Geoffrey Rush as Captain Hector Barbossa, adds depth and emotional resonance to the story. The reunion of these characters evokes a sense of nostalgia and reminds us of the shared history they have in the pirate world.While some may argue that the plot follows a familiar formula, Pirates of the Caribbean: Salazar's Revenge delivers an exciting and entertaining pirate adventure that captures the spirit of the original films.In conclusion, Pirates of the Caribbean: Salazar's Revenge is a thrilling and enjoyable addition to the beloved pirate franchise. With Johnny Depp's iconic performance, impressive visual effects, and a perfect blend of humor and action, it's a film that brings back the magic and excitement of the high seas.If you're a fan of the franchise this is a must watch!",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The special effects throughout are up a bit, but to be expected, though not slow enough to appreciate much of the available graphics wizardry of 2017. The austere and unsurprising plot leaves so little in imagination that someone forgot to develop characters, build something and have buy-in. This movie fails on so many levels that you ponder who thought this was a great direction??Secondly, Jack is tiresome. Nothing new from him. Boring. The hatred from the 'villain' is sincere if not the plot that seems to put Sparrow at second whistle throughout the film. There literally is ZERO flavor, no life. The boorish overall theme is like a thief that takes all the charm out of the series with this installment. My two college daughters watched it with me and after the movie, combined, we struggled to find value, humor or interest in the movie as a whole.

"Not as good as the others, but Good.","I first watched ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales"" in theaters back in 2017. I was pretty young at the time, so I barely remembered anything about it. Recently, I decided to rewatch it to see what I missed and to get a clearer picture of the movie.Overall, I found the movie to be good. The special effects were impressive, and there were plenty of action scenes that kept me entertained. The storyline was decent too, with Captain Jack Sparrow being his usual quirky self and the new characters adding some fresh energy. Javier Bardem did a great job as Captain Salazar, making him a memorable villain.However, as much as I enjoyed the movie, I felt like something was missing. It's hard to put my finger on exactly what it was, but it seemed like the film had lost some of that classic ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" spirit. Maybe it was the humor that felt a bit forced at times or the fact that the story seemed to lack the depth of the earlier films. The original trilogy had a certain charm and magic that I didn't quite get from this one.The chemistry between the characters was good, but not as strong as in the previous movies. I also missed some of the old characters who didn't make an appearance in this film. They added a lot to the original series, and their absence was definitely felt.In the end, ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales"" is a fun movie to watch, especially if you're a fan of the franchise. It has its exciting moments and the visuals are stunning. But for me, it just didn't capture the same spirit and essence that made the first few movies so special. Maybe it's just nostalgia, or maybe there was truly something off, but it didn't quite hit the mark like the originals did.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I know i saw them all, but that is because the series become very forgettable. While it lasted, ""Dead Men Tell No Tales"" wasn't at least boring - it was an OK flick to say the best when watching it on some boring evening.Special effects were pretty good, and i kinda liked the opening sequence with the bank - that were some good and pretty impressive settings. Later it become ""as usual kinda flick, where someone chases someone and they are all after something"". Performances were forgettable as is this movie - Johnny Depp is just a costume and make up in here - there isn't any signs of great performance as Captain Jack Sparrow as it was in a first movie for which he was nominated for Oscar - here is clearly just for a big paycheck.Overall, ""Dead Men Tell No Tales"" isn't bad movie, nor its good. Its somewhere in between but by the end i realized that this series needs to end or be rebooted completely. They should start with the basics and first of all make an involving story first.

Since this is the fifth film in franchise, it doesn't have to worry about developing its large cast of characters, as we have already got to know most of them in previous films. That being said, the film does give a good amount of development to its new characters. Especially Henry and Carina. They both have their own story arcs whilst also having an interesting relationship with one another. The film also has the traditional Pirates humour, making you laugh out loud. There are poorer aspects of the film though, such as the British Navy. They're poorly set up villains though thankfully they aren't in the film too much. There is also a death scene of a character, which, while sad, feels a bit unnecessary. Overall, this film was a swashbuckling, roller-coaster of an adventure that is by all means worthy of a trip to the cinema. The characters were likable and fun to watch and the humour tickles your funny bone.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fantastic film - don't believe the critics!!!,"I really enjoyed this film and I am so glad I didn't listen to any of the critics reviews. Johnny Depp and Barbossa are fantastic together and have brilliant wit and humour. Love Carina and Henry too. A great mix of adventure and humour. I normally find my mind wandering off to things I need to do, but not with this film. I enjoyed every second and would thoroughly recommend it. I took a 12 year old girl and a 73 year old lady and they both absolutely loved it. It's not deep and meaningful because it's an adventure film. Well worth a watch and I am so pleasantly surprised as I don't write reviews but felt I needed to put forward a case against the critics this time. Keep making them if they are this good.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

For the love of god stop this.,"Please for the love of god stop now. How is it possible for these to continue to get worse, and even more pertinently, why do I continue to see them. For the first time in a very long while I considered walking out of a film, and that was after about 15 minutes. I was bored stupid. They try to continually up the action set pieces in this franchise but just manage to make them more stupid, bombastic and confusing with muddied visuals, terrible pacing and stupidity from the characters. And some director really needs to get hold of Johnny Depp and get him to actually act and not merely caricature his original creation of the first pirates just upping the ticks and foibles. And as for the acting of the rest of the cast, Jesus. Even good actors seem to feel the need to Depp it up in this series, and the two new leads were so wooden they didn't need ships to cross the seas. Add to all that a god awful script full of pathetic dialogue and character motivation with a pee poor story arc and this turd may finally sink the franchise. Here's hoping.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I loved it!,"The original Pirates movie will always be the best because it was new and unexpected. I thought 2,3 and 4 were OK. Passable movies. But this one felt more like the original. First, it had a plot...always a good place to start. There was action, humor and enough violence to keep the males awake. It did a good job of wrapping up the series. To be sure, another movie at this point would be a HUGE mistake. Time to call it a good run and put it to bed. I don't know why it has gotten the bad press, and the current 29% tomato meter is much too low IMO. Just go see it and enjoy!",,Anonymous,Fantasy
If you liked 2 and 3 you'll like 5,"I had to write a review because I feel this movie is getting unfairly ripped apart by the media. Dead Men Tell No Tales might be the best Pirate movie since Dead Man's Chest. That said, the Pirates franchise is not everyone's cup of tea. Convoluted story lines and nonsensical action sequences are traditions of the franchise. It just wouldn't be a Pirate movie if it didn't go on for at least a half-hour too long. Personally I love every ridiculous minute of the franchise, and I think DMTNT is a great addition to it. It is far better than the 4th installment, On Stranger Tides, that somehow managed to make a Pirate movie boring. This time around there is a much better villain, and we are emotionally invested in the story right away because of the tie-in to the original characters. It certainly isn't a perfect movie, but it's a fun 2 hours to spend at the theater. I am certain that if you enjoyed the second and third Pirate movies, you will enjoy this one. Fans of the series will especially love the ending that was 10 years in the making. Also, there is a scene after the credits that may or may not set up a 6th movie. Only time will tell.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Fun, exciting, but not great","I think the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise was one of the first movie series together with star wars that I absolutely adored. At Worlds End was the first 'non-kidsfilm' I saw in a movie theatre. I saw Salzar's Revenge yesterday and right of the bat, the music and sets brought me back to 10 years ago. The overall movie is a fun and exciting experience. Other than the nostalgia I felt, the movie wasn't really memorable.They introduced new characters, such as Henry and Carina, but they weren't as memorable as Captain Jack Sparrow or Will Turner. The music wasn't scored by Hans Zimmer this time. That is probably the reason why the score is made up of variations of the original movies' score, but I don't really mind it.Bardem's and Rush's acting is like I was used to. They are both really committed actors and that's clear by watching the movie. It is clear that Depp just agreed to do this movie to get a fat pay check. I was pleasantly surprised when I saw Paul McCartney in a scene, but that scene could have easily been cut and it wouldn't have made a difference. Still, considering I'm a huge Beatles fan, watching McCartney perform and even singing a Beatles song (Maggie Mae) was fun and put a smile on my face.The film takes off by introducing Henry to the audience. Henry's motivations are explained in a believable way. He wants to find the Trident of Poseidon which can break any sea curse to save his father, Will Turner, from his curse that goes back to the third movie. After that, the main villain, Captain Salazar (Javier Bardem), is introduced. The scene is well shot and you can feel the tension of the characters. After that, a huge (and probably very expensive) action sequence takes place where we meet the old gang. The pirates (Jack, Gibbs, Scrum and some others) try to rob an unrobable vault on the island of Sint-Maarten. The action is way over the top, like we are used to in these movies, but it is very fun to watch. During the heist, we are greeted by another new character, Carina. Her character is a strong, female scientist in a world ruled by men. I really like the writers' idea to constantly make fun of the idea. The fact that she is a woman of science is constantly mocked by her being called a witch. It's a nod to the cinema of the past 2-3 years, where classic franchises, such as Ghostbusters, are remade with female leads, just because they are women, but they're not given anything special that differentiates them from their male counterparts. It's something I'd not expected from Disney, but I'm very pleased they made this choice. After the heist, the audience is introduced to 'A new Jack Sparrow'. Sparrow, once the most famous, successful pirate in the Caribbean, is losing the support of his crew because of his greedy lifestyle and the fact that he has become the most miserable pirate in the Caribbean, it's like Johnny Depp is playing himself. Not much is done with this subplot other than an occasional joke. To me, it's just an excuse to let Jack wonder around Sint-Maarten on his own, so that he can release Salazar by giving away his compass. When Salazar is released, he's out for revenge on Jack Sparrow. With the help of Barbossa, who finds Jack's compass, he tries to find Jack and kill him. The only hope for Jack to lift his curse is finding the Trident of Poseidon. After that, the film just consists of action scenes, silly jokes and minor character development. In other words, not much to talk about.Another aspect of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, are the groundbreaking visual effects. ILM, once again, didn't let us down and delivered some beautiful, convincing CGI mixed with some amazing practical sets. I often had to guess what was real and what was fake. The sound design by Skywalker Sound was great, like always. When it comes to visual and sound effects, there is absolutely nothing to complain.All in all, I hope they never make a POTC film again. Not because they're bad films, but in my opinion, they should've finished the franchise with the third film. The ending of the film didn't really suggest the making of a sequel, but that satisfied feeling quickly went away when the post credit scene revealed that Davy Jones might be coming back in a potential sequel. I guess we'll have to wait and see.I think the movie is entertaining and really worth a watch. It's good fun, but don't expect anything groundbreaking or revolutionary. I wouldn't say it's as good as At Worlds End, but it's definitely better than On Stranger Tides.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Better than On Stranger Tides,"Dead Men Tell No Tales is the fifth Pirates of the Caribbean movie, although really it may as well be called The Quest to Prevent Johnny Depp's bankruptcy.Whether or not you think the character of Jack Sparrow has reached his limit, and apparently everyone from Johnny Depp's kids to Depp himself has an opinion on that, Depp's personal and professional woes over the past years (Amber Heard, Lone Ranger) have tied his and Disney financial fates together apparently and made the box office for this far more interesting than the movie itself.It's gotten so bad that there are apparently plans being made for additional Pirates movies, just maybe rebooted without Depp. Which is ridiculous because that's like sex without genitals.So here's Jack 5.0, the character is now a washed up alcoholic, devoid of treasure and abandoned by his own crew. It's no surprise Depp helped out newcoming screenwriter Jeff Nathanson. This is probably his most personal piece of work in years.It's also no surprise we get as many jokes as we do in the early going. This is Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 at sea basically, although here it's for a different reason.Pirates has always been a series with pacing issues and no more did this feel more apparent to me than with ""On Stranger Tides"", where Depp just didn't seem his same witty self, and nothing else really picked up the slack either.Here it's jammed full and he's doing his best to sell them all. There's even a moment with a guillotine that's one of the best sight gags i've seen in a while. Yes there is an annoying factor to this and yes there are quite a few that don't hit and yes as it goes on the jokes seem to dry up but this is a much funnier, more enjoyable experience.It's also a more action packed one. The bank heist that starts the film keeps with these movie's wild spirit and there's a lot of over-the-top stuff that follows involving sharks and splitting the sea in half. Hey, if Fast and Furious can do an action sequence on a sheet of ice, then these Pirates can play Moses for a little while.Javier Bardem's Captain of a ship full of zombie dead men intent on revenge also helps this a long really well. Bardem not only looks hauntingly scary but he puts an inflection on the dialogue to make it seem like almost like he's choking on his own blood.But what makes him probably the best villain in the series since Barbosa is that he does have a backstory that puts him on a collision course with Captain Jack and gives us the origins of the Jack Sparrow name and legend at the same time.Other than that there's not much that's new here. There's a MacGuffin everyone is trying to find; in this case it's a Trident. And then there is the British Navy, Barbosa, and anyone else willing to chase Jack around for the over 2 hour running time.Brenton Thwaites is also in this movie. He's that kid who Hollywood is trying to turn into the next heartthrob action hero only the problem he's been given either bland characters to work with or God's of Egypt. His impression here is equally minimal.He plays Will Turner's son. Kaya Scodelario plays a scientist. Both are searching for the Trident for different reasons. However the only reason they're here is because young love, and sometimes objectifying young love for laughs and or PG-13 titillation, is what the young people want.Both super attractive in any case. Unfortunately Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom have been pushed to what amounts to cameos.So overall this is pretty familiar territory and it's hard to imagine it without Depp but it's eager to please. It will probably only please the die hard fans but it is eager to do so and I for the most part had fun with it for that reason.So I go 7 out of 10.

"Should have ended with ""At Worlds End""","The original trilogy of POC (Pirates of the Caribbean) was exactly what they needed it to be, original. Great story and character development set in a world of pirates brought this ancient genre back to the big screen. This latest installment of POC did none of those things the first 3 movies did. Like 'On Stranger Tides' this movie failed to spin a compelling story and lacked characters that I could get invested in. Jack Sparrow is Jack Sparrow, a drunker version of Jack Sparrow that is. Captain Barbosa used to be an imposing character that is now poorly used and really does a disservice to his character. The other two main characters are forgettable, I can't even remember their names. The protagonist, Captain Salazar, is all CGI and no game. As I watched his scenes I silently wished Davey Jones would make an appearance and kill this want-to-be so this movie could be saved. Instead, all we got was cool hair special effects. The only reason this movie got a 2 star and not a 1 star was because of the young Jack Sparrow scene that summed up how his character should have been presented in this movie. POC Dead Men Tell no Tales is a CGI ride that offers no back bone in the form of storytelling or character development but plenty of CGI craziness.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Pirates of the boring,"Johnny Depp returns to the big screen as the iconic Jack Sparrow in the ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales."" A cartoon like Depp and a boring plot sends this fifth ""Pirates"" to the bottom. It has a few thrilling action sequences, but it's often loud and dumb and most unfortunately, lacks the wit and fun that made the first Pirates of the Caribbean so entertaining. Oscar winners Geoffrey Rush and Javier Bardem do their best but they can't save this ship from drawing. It's fine for a bit, but then you realize that you've seen all of these things before, and they aren't getting any fresher.

The moviest movie of 2017 (so far),"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales stars Johnny Depp, Javier Bardem and Geoffrey Rush, and it tells the story of how Jack needs to find the trident of Poseidon. I watched the first pirates movie in preparation for this, and I thought it was average. Not my type of movie, but I enjoyed some parts of it. In this movie, I enjoyed little to nothing. The direction is non-existent, it does not have any type of vision or creativity at all. The script is atrocious, with no character development whatsoever and with the most obvious, painfully, cheap jokes any kids movie would have. The comedy is really bad, it really did distract me how much un-laughable jokes there were throughout the movie, and how much they tried to appeal to the mainstream audience. The main villain is laughable, and I do not think that Javier Bardem should've played him, he is too good for this movie. The main motivation for the villain is very stereotypical, I have seen the same motivation many times. The exposition throughout the movie is unnecessary and apathetic, very cliché as well. The action sequences are average, nothing special there. There was very little practical effects in the movie, with a lot of green screen and CGI. There are some logical inconsistencies that really took me out of the movie, as the movie doesn't care about small details. There are some minor positives. The acting is not bad but not great, I think the actors are giving everything they got, but the sad thing is that the characters are underwritten and just plain boring. The cinematography is good, with a lot of unique and interesting camera movements in the beginning of the movie. The ending really did not satisfy me as much as I wanted, since I just wanted to have fun with this movie. I don't think this movie is a mess, its just incredibly boring with nothing driving the characters to the story. This movie needed to have more self awareness and maybe I would've liked it. 2.5/10",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Nice to see these characters back, but it wasn't everything I hoped for","Let me tell you a tale of a film series that has inspired me over the course of 14 years. Yes, that's right. I am an admirer of the ""Pirates"" series. I've seen every one of them in the cinema and each time they've been some of my favorite movie going experiences. You go through a great adventure where you can have fun on the ride. These films always leave me feeling happy and as a good friend of mine put it: Inspired me to tell stories of my own.I wanted there to at least be one more film. Just a final good one. The ending of ""On Stranger Tides"" is perfect in my opinion. Hate me all you want. But, the way they walk on that beach talking about the actual treasure not being what's important, but rather the joy in the adventure itself. That right there is an example of how these movies can leave you with an optimistic outlook. You wanna go out and enjoy things and be happy. I love that feeling. I waited six years for this movie and it got delayed numerous times. As much as it frustrated me I tried to stay calm. With the extra time they are given they will make sure they go out with a bang. That was my hope. To be honest, I couldn't wait. I even had dreams about seeing the movie and waking up to be disappointed it wasn't real. That's how much I care for ""Pirates"". Maybe I'm the only one in the world who anticipated it that much, but so be it. Days before the release date I got this scary thought. What if my expectations aren't met? What if I've been wanting to see it so much that I get disappointed? My hands were shaking when I got the tickets. I couldn't believe the day was here. I did my best to stay calm and go in with an open mind and to forget about the anticipation for a moment.I can with full confidence say that it's not bad. It's just not as good as the rest. It's a completely fine time at the cinema. You'll laugh and get to see some well put together set pieces. My problem is the run-time and the pacing in the second act. It opens with an incredible scene. I mean, it had me. You feel the emotional connection with the character of Henry and the introduction of Salazar is fantastic. There's even a sense of mystery on what's happened to dear old Jack Sparrow. So we are with Henry on the quest to seek our Captain friend that we all have a good time with. Speaking of Jack. He has lost his touch which makes him a little different. It was sad to see him all drunk and miserable. It makes sense to give Jack some development, but he doesn't really find himself back by the end. They mention what's become of him and how he isn't the same person anymore. The drink and misfortune took the best of him. So this adventure might be what he needs to be inspired again. He longs to be at sea and for freedom. That would have been a fantastic story and a chance to give Jack Sparrow some true emotional moments. But, they don't go for it. You get hints of that. The scene where Gibbs says: ""We are on the edge of the line now"" saddened me too. It made me think that one day these characters will pass on.It should have been longer. We have many stories and characters to cover and we don't have enough time with them all. That was my fear when I saw that it was the shortest in the series. It would have needed to focus and taken its time more. I think Depp might come across like he is sleepwalking through the performance here. Many of his scenes are still fun for what they were. He is a pirate who tries to come across as tough and like he doesn't care for others. In the end we know he does and he can't help himself to be endearing and show compassion towards his friends. Geoffrey Rush's Barbossa is incredibly good once again. It's amazing how he has shape-shifted from being a villain to more of a good guy. To me it felt like Salazar was sidelined. Which is a shame because whenever he shows up he chews up the scenery. It does come together in the ending and it feels right. Everything is patched up nicely and the emotion is felt. But you will probably only feel the emotion and empathy for everyone if you are familiar with the characters. I miss Hans Zimmer. Geoff Zanelli isn't able to top the soundtrack from the other movies. There was nothing new that I can see myself humming to. He does an alright job here. The emotional connection was great at the beginning. The first half was fun, but unfortunately the second half didn't hit home run. It's with great sadness that I say that. I think that the greatest thing missing was more excitement. I should have feared for Jack's life when Salazar came after him, but I didn't. The excitement and urgency is important. We need that to really care for what's going. The same goes for time spent with characters. It goes through it all too fast.I wanted to love it, but it wasn't truly there. It's completely watchable and harmless fun. The crowds will surely be pleased. It does work as a final chapter. They tie it with the first movie and I appreciate that. I still enjoy them all, but this is definitely the one with the least steam. Lots of great ideas here, just not realized to its potential. If you want a fun lightweight movie, then this will entertain you.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Really Liked It,"Reading these reviews there's a common theme among them that bothers the heck out of me. Everyone keeps saying that Jack isn't himself anymore (his jokes aren't as funny, he's not as sharp or as witty.) Yall - he's SUPPOSED TO BE. That wasn't an accident. Didn't anyone read the plot overview prior to the movie's release? ""A down-on-his-luck Jack..."" Guys, Jack is portrayed as aging, less-skilled, less-witty and resorting to jokes that don't cut it to imply his career as a pirate is declining. It's the point. He needs the two young whipper-snappers to help restore him to his former glory; a reverse-symbolic nod to the first film where the two whipper-snappers needed him. Think about it, if Jack never had any flaws or character digressions he'd be the same person in every movie and this would cease to entertain. I liked this movie a lot and for a lot of reasons but I just wanted to settle my personal opinion on this issue.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

An Aging Franchise Overstays its welcome,"Pirates of the Caribbean, when it came out in the early 2000s, was one of the most original and unique movies to be released in recent memory. It was a great mix of comedy, adventure and action that could appeal to the whole family. Depp's boozy Captain Jack Sparrow was part ruthless pirate and part sly wink. You never knew which one you would get. The first one got it all right: a great story, a ton of adventure and a lot of fun. However, the series has dropped in quality a bit more with each subsequent release, to the point that now I find the whole thing boring, trite and overdone. Depp's Sparrow continues his act, but now it's more canned and predictable. The story seems to be written as it goes along, so you lose track of what's going on and who's doing what and why we even care. It deals with Will Turner and Elizabeth Swain's son and that he wants to join an evil pirate group and yada yada. Some explosions, sword fights, Sparrow drunk walking and some boats on the water. Ho hum. The good news was at two hours, this was one of the shorter films in the series. The bad news is this aging franchise has long overstayed its welcome.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Really bad acting,None of the characters had good chemistry together and all of the acting was poor. Jack's accent seemed new and he talked way more than in other movies so the new accent became really annoying. The two new teen characters are very bad actors and helped ruin the chemistry with everyone else. This movie has a lot more adult jokes that aren't funny and I'm not sure why everyone was so excited about the celebrity cameo. That scene was painfully unfunny and unnecessary.

I found it very unsatisfying even though it was fun to watch from time to time.As a musician myself, and as a person who LOVES Hans Zimmer and Klaus Badelt's works on the previous PotC movies, I found the music very vague and unsatisfying. There was no depth to almost any of the pieces, and there were some parts that the music didn't even fit the atmosphere. Maybe I am being judgemental because I am used to see Zimmer's name under ""Music By"", but I still think the way I do.Not a bad movie, but I've seen better.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Passable,"We know from the history of this series (and plenty of other)that there is no point in expecting the glory of the first installment again. So for me, Salazar's revenge or Dead Men Tell No Tales delivered more or less what it promised. A laid back fun ride. Jack Sparrow is as likable as always and his timely wits, once again delivers the good. Kaya Scodelario and Javier Bardem were refreshing add-ons to the series. Kaya's obstinacy and charm reminded so much of the aura Keira carried during the initial phases of the franchise. Javier Bardem may not be the menacing villain of No Country for Old Men but still qualifies as a memorable antagonist. As you can expect, the film is CG packed and for most part enjoyable.So overall, on the 2 hours and 30 minutes of its running time, I was not yawning or pulling my hairs out. That is the only kind of satisfaction I expected with this too.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The same formula as its prequels,"As for the script nothing new to say: Introduction, Jack Sparrow makes his great entrance, the British army chase him, more persecutions, comic moments, final fight. Very similar to its 4 predecessors.The performances have been good but no surprises, the only strong point was the improvement in special effects. This saga with each new movie seems to lose emotion, only entertains for a while, but they still do not exceed the first 2 and I think they will not be able to do it.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Pleasantly surprising. A step in the direction of bring back the old Jack. And a must see for the fans.,"I am quite pleased with what I saw. That might be mainly due to the fact that I did not have much expectations with this one. I only went to watch for the old times' sake. (I used to watch the trilogy in a single sitting - don't judge.) And I have to say that I was surprisingly entertained and satisfied with this entry of the series. One thing that the last one lacked was the impact of the main character i.e. Captain Jack Sparrow. It was this foolish, drunk(seemingly) and yet brave(arguably), cunning and unexpectedly lucky character whose witty puns and ingenious escapes that made this franchise what it is. And this movie takes a step towards returning the character to its former stature. And though it might not make it as good as it should be, it sure as hell is a lot better than what you would expect. The movie tries to bring back the old Jack while bringing back some old characters to go with it. You can argue their role but you cannot deny the nostalgia that you would feel - if only for a while. To me it was a very good attempt by the authors to nicely tie up the ends and a crucial comeback from their last disastrous attempt. If this movie is to be the end of the franchise I would be content with what I got.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Fun, but trying too hard,","I liked it. Thought they tried too hard for jokes and the acting/scenes didn't hit just right.. A nice little twist at the end. I thought that I had this all figure out, but they fooled me. I would bet that the end of the next one might come out with how I think it should end. There will be a next one. Wait for after the credits.The effects are good and plot were good, but the script needed to concentrate on the ""gotcha"" statements-the ones that are meant to induce excitement and heroic intent.I still recommend it, but just know it doesn't have the same as the first.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Tedious to watch,"I was really expecting another good story in the series, but this failed to deliver. The movie was very tedious to watch, and a number of times, I almost walked out, but kept thinking it had to get better. It did not. Jack, was a weaker, and not as focused on his stunts, but being drunk and unable to function in any manor. The story line was weak, and not very interesting, although it could have been better done.

"Yo Ho, Yo Ho – A Pirates Life for Me.Again","14 years ago, in 2003, the Pirates of the Caribbean Franchise, based on the attraction at both Walt Disney World in Florida and Walt Disneyland in California, came up with the idea to make a movie about a rogue pirate and the adventures he takes to defeat the deadliest of people to save the high seas of being at risk of extinction and the life of the pirate hanging in the balance of ever ceasing to exist. Gore Verbinski took that risk with The Curse of the Black Pearl and he continued to make this the swashbuckling, awesome ride of a lifetime. With Johnny Depp at the helm of these projects, this franchise has gained more and more attention than any of Depp's other films combined. With this fifth installment to the Pirate franchise, and all of these movies connect to each other tell the story of how the high seas can be a dangerous, slippery ride. Yes, you heard me correctly all 5 of these movies connect, ""How?"" you may ask, well you are going to have to learn that by yourself. Because these lips are tied shut, so to speak. But Dead Men Tell No Tales, is the beginning of the end and to be a great time to set sail on the seas again.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
A solid start to a closing chapter and a worthwhile entry in a failing franchise.,"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales (AKA Salazar's Revenge) is the fifth film in the titular franchise (and marketed as the final, but we all know it probably isn't) and is directed by Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg, with a screenplay by Jeff Nathanson. It stars Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow, Javier Bardem as Captain Salazar, Brenton Thwaites as Henry Turner, Kaya Scodelario as Carina Smyth, Kevin McNally as Joshamee Gibbs, Geoffrey Rush as Captain Barbossa, Orlando Bloom as Will Turner (father of Henry Turner), as well as cameo appearances by Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Turner and Paul McCartney as Sparrow's uncle.After At World's End, the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise was essentially put on life support. The plug was almost completely pulled considering former Pirates director Gore Verbinski envisioned At World's End as the final film in the trilogy. Then came the slightly improved On Stranger Tides, which is basically all that was. And now were here, with Dead Men Tell No Tales, the ""supposed"" final film in the franchise. It tells the tale of Captain Sparrow, who is being hunted down by a ghostly figure from his past, and through the franchise's signature character-interactive shenanigans and Macguffin-that-unites-the-characters-to-defeat-a-powerful-enemy kind of storytelling, Sparrow along with Henry Turner and Carina Smyth set out to find the Trident of Poseidon and defeat Captain Salazar.Allow me to start off positive. This series has always been renowned for it's stunning visual effects and eye-catching CGI, and this film is no exception. One particular scene was the climactic battle at the end of the film, that saw the characters battle Salazar and his men on the seafloor, while the water formed two vertical waves around them. It looked amazing. While there was CGI, there wasn't too much. It genuinely felt like I could reach out and touch the water, or pick up the sand and throw it, or rip a piece of seaweed out of it's roots. There were numerous other scenes that blew me away, but this one takes the cake. This movie's look was not perfect, however. There were some scenes that overused CGI, and it stuck out as looking fake. Most of the bad CGI emanates from the fire sequences, and the people standing in front of/behind them while the background looks like something straight out of a video game with average graphics, did no doubt take me out of the moment.Fortunately, this film is not totally style-over-substance. All of the actors involved bring their A-game, especially the always charismatic and effortless Johnny Depp as Jack Sparr- sorry, Captain Jack Sparrow. Newcomers Brenton Thwaites and Kaya Scodelario as Henry and Carina, respectively, both put on excellent performances while sharing great chemistry with one another. However, I still need to see more of them in these Pirates films before I can unapologetically call them the next Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann. Everyone else is very good or great, and I found Javier Bardem as Captain Salazar particularly intimidating. Salazar also carried most of this movie's story, as without his involvement, the movie most likely would have been less enjoyable than it was. On a similar note, this movie's plot was even and well-executed, and the character's actions that lead from one obstacle to another felt more streamlined and comprehensible than say, At World's End.I have to say that ultimately, Dead Men Tell No Tales was not a big letdown for me. It was nowhere near as great as the first film in the series, but it is slightly better than Dead Man's Chest, and far better than At World's End and On Stranger Tides. But just like every movie out there, Dead Men was not without it's flaws. The biggest disappointment of this whole film was it's predictability. Near the beginning of the film, Jack's crew walks out on him after some stuff that I won't spoil goes wrong, and you just know they're gonna come running back to him. One way or another, you know that even though they say they're finished, they will come back and assist Sparrow in his quest to find the Trident. That one scene alone made the movie less enjoyable for me, but there were one too many other scenes where you could easily plot out what's going to happen next. Another disappointment that this film possesses is the fizzled and drained humor. I can only recall two scenes where I laughed, and a few others where I chuckled. In some parts, the movie was trying too hard to be funny, and in others, the movie could have tried a lot harder to inject fresh humor into an exchange that borrowed most of the humor from the first film.But other than those and a few other nagging flaws, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales did boast an engaging enough story to keep me mostly interested throughout the film's run time. Johnny Depp is better than ever as the iconic Captain Jack Sparrow, the visuals kept me on the edge of my seat with their breathtaking cinematography, and despite the humor mainly not working, I did relish in a couple of laughs. Does this entry reinvigorate the franchise and set it on a completely new course destined for riches and success? No. Is it entertaining and worth watching? Definitely. You'll probably like this movie if you loved the first film and shared some of my opinion on the later entries. All in all, Dead Men Tell No Tales was not great, but if it's the ""beginning of the end"" like the filmmakers say it is, it's a solid start to a closing chapter and a worthwhile entry in a failing franchise.Rating - 6.9/10 stars",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fall to the bottom of Davy Johnes Locker,"After the success from the Gore Verbinski Trilogy, this pirate fails to deliver r it barely swim on the surface that is struggling to reach shore. That is how it feels. The movie is a mess; they cut down the budged so this one is not even an epic like the previous movies. I has good story to a degree then is bloated with slapstick comedy that it can be annoying at times, it is overwhelmed. Not interested for pirates buffs. It might drag the youngster's kid but adults it is just a movie as soon you leave the theater it is forgettable. Now the bad side is it doesn't look like a proper pirate adventure that needs to have the entire ingredient in order to be a masterpiece or great. The action is so boring no sword duels not even on deck nor or land. No sword fences like The Black Pear and Chest. No canon fire from ship to ship explosion in a battle field. No swinging in ropes from ship to ship. No Sword Swashing and Buckling on ships decks either. It has boring story and is similar to the Fountain of Youth. This time they are looking for the Trident of Poseidon. The special effect were good, the ghost pirates were different in comparison to the Black pearl. There is mall amount of ships, we see Cpn Barossa on Queens Anne Revenge and the Ghost ship. Jack fined his small fishing boat and the Galleon trapped in the Bottle. The Black Pearl this time was not the real from the previous movies, it was a CGI, but done right you can't even tell the difference. Only people experts in the computer wizardly can tell the difference. It is little bit better then Strangers Tide but it flat and fails to the bottom of the ocean compared to The Black Pearl. Johnny Deep is a great actor but I don't think he was doing best in his role either too much silly phrases or acting drank at all cost. Well in the black Pearl he was drank but when I come to use his wits and trick he was serious, and sober. In this move is lacking his magic from the First and 2 and 3rd movies. The Norwegian brothers as directors aren't suitable for a pirate adventure, that doesn't mean if they won an Oscar for Kon-Tiki can make a gem, not so. They should step aside and do comedy instead. Mr Bruckheimer should hire back Verbinski and if he wants in the future to create a masterpiece or something close to the Black Pearl. Otherways it will fall to the bottom of Davey Johnes locker.Pirate moves are tough to do because they have to rely on a great story, supporting cast, character driven and less fantasy, more action, sword dual, brawls, ship battles and treasure hunters. If you don't put those ingredients in the pan it will be mash potatoes.This movie it only had comedy slapstick annoying there was no need it should be controlled, less action no duels or sword fences, and no Ship Battles either. I still consider Worlds End is the best action oriented, but it fails flat in story to the Black Pearl out of the entire trilogy.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Made up for the last one,"The fourth movie was horrible and seemed to be a desperate attempt to keep the franchise going. They should have made the 5th one the 4th and ended it there. I liked this movie and it was fun. Sure, Jack Sparrow is nearing his end with regards to being funny but the other actors they inserted made up for it. I like that they brought some old characters back and introduced new ones and you didn't even notice and it all worked out. I highly recommend this latest pirates and I enjoyed it. Once again, don't listen to the critics folks. They only like movies that rock at sun dance or Cannes and have Streep in them.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
So cool,"""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales"" sails into your heart with a 7/10 rating, and it's clear you enjoyed the voyage. Johnny Depp once again embraces the iconic role of Captain Jack Sparrow with gusto, injecting humor and charm into the film. The special effects and film editing bring the ghostly pirates to life in a visually stunning manner, while the music maintains the series' adventurous spirit. However, the film's plot may be considered a bit formulaic, and the introduction of new characters doesn't quite reach the heights of the original cast. Nevertheless, the cinematography captures the essence of swashbuckling adventures on the high seas, and the underlying message of seeking redemption adds depth to the story. ""Dead Men Tell No Tales"" may not reinvent the pirate genre, but it's a worthy addition to the beloved franchise that keeps the rum-soaked spirit alive.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Of course, the makers have their own excuse 'dead men tell no tales'. So how could we blame them?",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Perfect follow up to the sequels that does not disappoint.,"With the sequels being a mix bag for me I went this movie thinking it is going to be another silly pirates movie and honestly I am shocked to say this was a thrill ride. If you are expecting a over the top Jack Sparrow performance then here you go cause Depp doesn't disappoint. i'll like to say that in order to enjoy this movie you must watch all of the movies in recent time in order to understand this film. if you are judging Pirates 5 by memories of the sequels then you'll probably hate this movie. let's face it the pirate movies has been debated as good or bad over the years but regardless of that these movies always seem fun to watch. If you are a TRUE pirates fan then you are going to enjoy this movie and it's conclusion. if you are not a pirate fan then you'll won't. again this movie is a like a special award for Pirates fans who really love the series and it's really good. the newcomers in the films are good especially Brenton who plays Henry. You can tell Javier is having fun playing Salazar and Geoffrey kills it as Barbossa again as always & Kaya is performance is awesome. so the way I can sum it all is that you'll love this movie for what it is, if you are a TRUE pirates fan of course. the soundtrack to Pirates 5 is epic. stay alert when you here the pirates theme. It's a good summer blockbuster film to watch and won't be disappointed. don't be worried if nobody else didn't like it. what matters is you the TRUE pirates fans to go in and enjoy this epic ride of Pirates 5. certainly watching it again instead of Baywatch. 9 out of 10 is my score.

"An improvement over 4, but still, not really good.","I had relatively high expectations for this one, since I love the original trilogy (but hate ""On Stranger Tides""). The trailers looked interesting, but after all it's just an ""OK"" movie for me.First the positives: This, like all the other Pirates movies, is a real fun popcorn movie and summer blockbuster. Most of the CGI was pretty great, so was most of the action,the cinematography was at points beautiful, there were many interesting ideas and the acting was fine, with the stand-out being, once again,Geoffrey Rush as Hector Barbossa and, of course,Javier Bardem as Salazar. The soundtrack is once again great.For the negatives: This movie doesn't really bring much new to the table. It has the same plot as the previous ones and the character of Jack Sparrow is getting old.The movie is also full of awful exposition and jokes that at first are kind of funny, but the movie keeps repeating them and they become really exhausting and unfunny. Plus,the character of Carina was extremely annoying. The overall script isn't that good either.If you just want a fun blockbuster to spend 2 hours on, you will love this one. But if you are a more demanding viewer, you might hate this. I was kind of disappointed.Personally, I just want an R-rated prequel about young Jack and Barbossa.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Oh my...,"Going to see this film was part of a birthday gift. (I want a birthday do-over.) When one of my nephews heard we were all going to see it he gracefully sidestepped the invitation saying he had trig homework to do. HE is the family movie buff, so that was a major red flag.When another family member asked what the movie was about as we filed in with popcorn, etc., we joked that the subplot was to help fund Depp's recovery from his latest behind-the-scenes relationship woes (not knowing yet how awful and lifeless the film actually would be).It's no secret that there's no real plot or acting involved in this (final?) part to the series. I'm amazed they were able to get any of the stellar cast members from the series back. I liked the earlier ones. This... didn't do anything for me.

"not bad, but I think the saga is already over.","I did not find Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales as bad as they were talking about, it's a very problematic movie, but it's fun and it has moments of action very well done and some moments gets to be funny, the movie has problem in the script , has a villain who even being played by the excellent Javier Bardem, but is a badly developed villain, but his motivation is not bad, and he is visually good, we have Jack Sparrow back, with Johnny Depp playing his character most famously, the new characters Henry Turner and Carina Smyth are well interpreted but the chemistry between the two has flaws, and the direction of the pair Joachim Ronning and Espen Sandberg is good in some aspects, but in developing characters is flawed, Pirates of the Caribbean : Dead Men Tell No Tales is not bad, it is a cool movie and with great moments, it is far from being the best of the saga, but it amuses even with problems of script and direction.

The ghost pirates were cool looking and the story was ok.The current me, the older, wiser, less mature...er more mature me thinks this was just an ok movie. Captain Jack seems less of a character in this one for some reason. Maybe there were too many characters?

fantastic!,"first of all, idk why all ya'll are hating on these movies, you already dang well know your a$$ is going to go see every single one that comes out because it's Pirates of the Caribbean, so shut your pie holes! * the first 3 were obviously amazing, and the 4th one...less amazing but still very good and entertaining. You can't expect it to be as good when you watched the first 3 installments with all the same beloved characters (keira,orlando, weird eyeball guy and friend) and then expect it to be as good when those characters aren't in it anymore (bc the actors chose to opt out). I feel like a lot of people aren't admitting that they didn't like it BC of this reason, and not the reason of a poor script ( bc it was not a poor script). *continuing to Dead men tell no Tales, i thought it was an excellent movie. I will admit Johnny Depp was a little out of it with his portrayal of Jack Sparrow this movie, but other characters made up for it, like Carina. She was an awesome and strong female lead, and it was also nice to see Will Turner's son in this movie as a main character as well. The movie did a fantastic job on the storyline, visual effects, cast, character's and tied it all together quite nicely. It also had humor in it (echoing pirates movies before it-nostalgia) that made for an overall fun and entertaining film. I would definitely go see a 6th installment if they decide to make one! and this time, hopefully they can talk keira knightly and Orlando Bloom to have bigger roles !",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"If this franchise is to continue, it needs a readjustment from the standard we've been given...","As far as swashbuckling adventures on the high seas go, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales – what a mouthful – is running on stagnant tides. It's amazing to think a film series based off of an amusement park ride would get to its fifth entry in the first place, a much wilder notion being that that fifth time out of the gate may actually offer up something new and inventive. That isn't to be the case, though, and this latest outing featuring the eccentric Captain Jack Sparrow, still played by Johnny Depp and all of his crazy mannerisms, offers nothing special beyond the typical excitement to which we've been privy many times before. Dead Men Tell No Tales attempts to re-energise the Pirates franchise with fresh blood and a younger cast, but, without any creativity to back it up, it all ends up treading the same blockbuster waters.It doesn't help that Depp, still channelling rock stars of old, appears bored underneath the captain's hat and pirate flair that make up the character's grungy exterior. His eyes bulge and dart around as previously seen, and he delivers on the same mannerisms that made the character so memorable in the first place (and also garnered Depp an Academy Award nomination back in 2004). There isn't enough new about the character this time around, though, and, save for a brief flashback that depicts how Captain Jack Sparrow initially made his name, it's a completely forgettable performance this time around.I don't blame Depp for wearing out his welcome as Capt. Jack - would you turn down tens of millions up front, and even more on the back end, and probably a lifetime supply of do-rags, to return to the series? He doesn't write this stuff, which is almost exactly the same old stuff we've seen four times before. I didn't actively dislike the movie, but I rarely laughed at the jokes or felt the tingle of excitement during the action sequences. It felt more than ever like a rote exercise in Disney accounting, and the adding machine will continue to whirr and click and spit out receipts - the studio has already green-lit a sixth film. I'll see you right back here in a year or three.But if this franchise is to continue, it needs a readjustment from the standard we've been given, especially when it comes to Depp's character and performance. Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales isn't a complete wash for the franchise, but it's a definite indicator this series needs to take a new, more exciting course if it is to carry on much longer.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Thrills and Chills on the High Seas,"I recently had the opportunity to watch the film ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,"" and I must say, it was quite the thrilling adventure! With an intriguing storyline and captivating characters, this movie definitely deserves a solid 8 out of 10 rating from me.One of the aspects that truly impressed me about this film was the incredible attention to detail in the visuals. The stunning cinematography and breathtaking special effects brought the pirate world to life in a way that was both visually stunning and immersive. From the epic sea battles to the eerie ghostly encounters, every scene was a visual treat.But it wasn't just the visuals that made this film stand out. The performances of the cast were also top-notch. Johnny Depp reprised his iconic role as Captain Jack Sparrow with his trademark wit and charm, delivering a performance that was both hilarious and endearing. Javier Bardem's portrayal of Captain Salazar was equally impressive, bringing a menacing presence to the screen that sent shivers down my spine.The storyline itself was filled with twists and turns, keeping me on the edge of my seat throughout the entire film. The quest for the Trident of Poseidon was not only a race against time but also a journey of self-discovery for both Jack Sparrow and Henry Turner. Their personal growth and development added depth to the story, making it more than just a typical pirate adventure.Another aspect that I appreciated about this film was the well-balanced mix of action and humor. The action sequences were intense and exhilarating, with sword fights, ship battles, and daring escapes that had my heart racing. At the same time, the humor injected into the film provided much-needed comic relief, lightening the mood and adding an extra layer of enjoyment.Overall, ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales"" is a fantastic addition to the franchise. It successfully captures the spirit of the original films while introducing new elements that keep the story fresh and exciting. With its stunning visuals, captivating performances, and thrilling storyline, this film is a must-watch for any fan of the series.While it may not be a perfect 10, I believe it deserves a solid 8 out of 10 rating. It's an entertaining and enjoyable experience that will leave you wanting more. So grab your popcorn, sit back, and prepare to set sail on an unforgettable adventure with Captain Jack Sparrow and his crew!",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great Pirates Movie,"On Stranger Tides might have taken a slight tumble down the hill for audiences and critics alike. But Dead Men Tell No Tales has brought us a refreshing throwback to the original trilogy. It's nice to see the old cast back in the same movie. Only problem about this movie was maybe Captain Jack Sparrow's charm. Captain Jack Sparrow in this movie was kind of a cartoon character that looked like he either didn't know what he was doing or he knew what he was doing. But overall, the movie provides the same magical experience that a Pirates of the Caribbean movie should provide, and I believe that's what makes this film watchable.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A Great Send-off or a Resurgence for the Series,"It seems people are either heralding this entry in the franchise as being on par with the first or the further decline of the series. I disagree with both.""Dead Men Tell No Tales"" is not quite as good as the original, but it trumps the other three sequels. It feels more coherent than ""Dead Man's Chest"" and ""At World Ends"" and feels more necessary and less hastily slapped together than ""On Stranger Tides."" While ""OST"" felt out of character for the series this new entry almost pays homage to the original. It hits many of the same beats and borrows many plot features from that first movie. And despite (or maybe in light of) that fact this one reaches the heights of the first film. Well almost.Another complaint I have heard is how stale the character of Jack Sparrow feels. Though to be honest this seems to have been a complaint since the second film. I would hazard that the character only really had a shelf life of one film. So I would think of him as a plot device at this point and I would also couple that with some good news. Every other character is enjoyable and returning supporting characters are in top form. I would not include Bloom or Knightley's characters in the latter however as they really were brought in to draw back fans.Javier Bardem's character (Captain Salazar) was creepy and the real show piece of this movie. Such a good villain. From his performance to the character's design. It all worked. Definitely the part of this movie that you'll remember.Really my only complaint is that it felt so similar to the first film. But one could say that for the Force Awakens when compared to the original Star Wars and that was a fantastic film. Perhaps the only other issue is how some of the plot points in this movie might feel pointless if this is in fact the final entry.Is it as good as the first? No. Is it damn good? Certainly. I'll be looking forward to a 6th title.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It's not terrible,"The most pleasant thing I can say about the movie - It's not terrible. It is very simple and straight, there are no suspense or plot twists. Though there are great visuals, really tired Johnny Depp and very good Javier Bardem, probably you have to watch the movie just because of him.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.,"Henry Turner (Will's Son) is in desperate need of finding Captain Jack Sparrow so that he can free his Father (Will Turner) from the Dutchman. Captain Jack Sparrow as always is up to no good and is in trouble himself! Captain Salazar (Javier Bardem) is living in the land of the dead and will stop at nothing until Sparrow is dead.The story starts out incredibly well and keeps your eyes glued to the screen the entire time. Within the first 30 mins or so it starts to slow down a little bit, which is a little disappointing. The acting by everyone is fine, including newcomers Brenton Thwaites (who plays Henry Turner) and Kaya Scodelario (who plays Carina Smyth). Johnny Depp is really what keeps the entire film going and you can tell he's having a great time playing the drunk, witty and hilarious Jack Sparrow! Javier Bardem is an excellent choice for a villain. He's very intimidating, straight to the point and wastes no time on killing whoever he wants, whenever he wants. There's no mercy with him. Problem is that the script doesn't allow him to shine as much as he could. He needed more screen time and more lines.All in all it's the best Pirates Film since the 2nd one. It's a fun film, and you're bound to really enjoy yourself. Especially if you're a die hard Pirates fan. The critics have been too harsh on the film by saying it's pointless and how Jack is cruel etc. Completely over exaggerated. Dead Men Tell No Tales is fun on an epic scale, it's a vast improvement over the last installment in terms of script, tone, visual effects and chemistry. The professional critics may be mixed to negative about this one, but from me personally I knew what I wanted to see and I got it, leaving the cinema with a cheery mood and a feeling of satisfaction.3.5/5 - Nick 3/5 - Jay Check out for more reviews on Instagram and our Facebook page.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Shallow Story in a Campy Pirate Movie,"Of all the tales that the depths of the ocean contain, this one is quite shallow. Disney's latest installment in the swashbuckling franchise Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell no Tales proves that neither changing directors, writers, nor the inclusion of an undead Javier Bardem, can bail enough water out of a sinking ship. No doubt the next chapter in the life and times of Jack Sparrow was one to be anticipated by fans, but sadly the writing was not strong or developed enough to carry the waning film series. This film reminds me of the Child's Play franchise. What??? That is likely what you're saying. But hear me out. After the first two Chucky films, the studio realized that the series was not working as a hard horror film, so the studio went the camp route and capitalized on the ridiculousness of the characters and the situations. Dead Men Tell No Tales contains many camp elements such as completely ludicrous antics and escapes that are even too much for a Mission Impossible movie. Although there is an attempt at some closure between characters at the end of the film, it plays out as forced and on-the-nose. Still, there are moments that will mildly tug at your heartstrings during the showdown, but it's not enough to add any dimension to this flat tale. One thing that this Pirates movie has going for it is the impressive visual effects. Both the editing and score are pretty outstanding, and certainly add to the experience of the film. However, if you watch the movie in 3D, as I did because there wasn't a 2D option at the earliest showing, some of the magic of the undead pirates will be lost due to noticeability of editing. Over all, Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales is a great popcorn movie and a fun one to watch with friends or the family. Be sure to stay after the credits for a sneak peek at the next (and hopefully last) one.Return to the swashbuckling world of the franchise inspired by the iconic Pirates of the Caribbean attraction at Disney Parks! Many years after the encounter with Davy Jones, Jack Sparrow (Depp) is being sought out by a young Henry Turner (Brenton Thwaites)–yes, that Turner. After witnessing his entire ship's compliment slaughtered by ghost pirates led by Captain Salazar (Bardem), Turner is even more determined to find Captain Jack. Unbeknownst to Turner, Jack Sparrow's fortune is not what it used to be. With his luck turned sour, Sparrow is captured and Turner must free him if the ghost pirates are to be stopped and the curse of Davy Jones lifted. By sheer happenstance, Sparrow is sentenced to die alongside an accused witch named Carina (Kaya Scodelario). If that wasn't bad enough, Captain Barbosa (Rush) has been cornered by Salazar into leading him to Sparrow as well. Other than a need to find Jack, Turner, Salazar, and Carina all share a common interest in locating the trident of Poseidon. That trident is the key to unlocking the power of the ocean and breaking curses.Like so many franchises that have come before, Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean appears to have suffered the same fate. Although this can't be said of every franchise, the area that fairly consistently fails to deliver is strong writing inclusive of plot and character development. Often times it seems that story is exchanged for merchandising, impressive visual effects, or pandering in longstanding franchises. After an outstanding opening sequence that instantly hooks you, the rest of the movie just plays out so paint-by-the-numbers that it becomes nearly predictable and lacks any real substance. Sometimes franchises fall into the trap of realizing that it can no longer take itself seriously and allows the camp factor to increase significantly. That is the one word that pretty much sums up this film: camp. Whether you are talking the perpetually drunk Jack Sparrow (yes, even more than usual), unbelievable escapes that defy all logic and past precedents set is previous films, or the supernatural playing off more as a joke than a serious plot device, there are many elements in this film that attempt to cover up poor writing by going for the flash in a pan approach.One of the down sides to the recent Guardians of the Galaxy I found was the film only focusing on Acts I and III, leaving out the chunk of story development typically found in Act II. By the same token, Dead Men Tell No Tales spends most of the time in Act II, leaving Act I and again Act III to be rushed through. The common variable in both scenarios is a weak third act. To explain where I feel that this movie should have ended and the next one begin would give away a plot spoiler, so I won't mention it. However, there is a place in this film in which there is a great opportunity to end this story on a high note of anticipation of what is to come but it just rushes through the rest of the story. Had more time been spent on developing a solid story, then this Pirates movie would definitely have turned out much better. Sadly, it seems like more time was spent in post-production and scoring the film. Certainly, the talent behind the lead characters is excellent. Perhaps the writing is poor and the screenplay was weak, but with a lead cast of Depp, Rush, and Bardem, the movie is fun to watch. And sometimes that's all you want–a good popcorn movie.If you ARE looking for a good popcorn movie to watch with your family or friends over the holiday weekend, then checkout Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales. Perhaps the sequel to this film will be stronger and pick up where this one failed to deliver.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Pirates returns to form, with a vengeance!","Once again, the ""professional critics"" show they are ignorant and know nothing about a darned good story! Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales is a true return to form.The feeling I got when I first watched this was the same feeling I got when I watched Star Wars: The Force Awakens. It reminded me of the excitement of the early movies, the intrigue, and the sense of wonder, all captured in the first movie. After the so-so Pirates 3 and Pirates 4 (which I feel was the worst of the series), this is the Pirates' return to form. It has everything. It's got action like Fast & Furious, it's got familiarity like Star Wars, it's got heart and jokes like, well, the first Pirates of the Caribbean. And of course, FANTASTIC CGI - I couldn't stop staring at that ""floating hair"" of Captain Salazar!This is a movie beautifully made for those who longed for the excitement of the first one. The characters are all fleshed out well - Henry Turner, Carina Smyth (hint: I won't throw spoilers here about her name), Captain Barbossa and of course, aye, silly old Jack Sparrow. You'd be missing out big time if you listened to the useless professional critics. Watch it, and decide for yourself. Thankfully, I always ignore pro critics - they're the most unreliable bunch when it comes to movies.Ultra highly recommended if you liked the first Pirates. This installment has truly redeemed the series. Go Pirates!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"It may be sinking, but it's still ""see""-worthy! (PUN WARNING)","I personally love the franchise. But it has definitely died down and hit some hidden reefs every now and then. But this brings the ship back to sea level.The film itself is not at all a masterpiece, but no ship wreck either. If you judge it as a stand alone film. It's worthy of about 3 or 4 stars. But this is a Pirates of the Caribbean film! So you must join the crew, down the rum, and raise the damn flag!As a Pirates of the Caribbean film, this has all you could love! Jack Sparrow. Witty dialogue. Campy scenes. And of course, the cringe worthy jokes. It may not be the first film, but is certainly no third. It's a mix of good and bad. But it's not exactly meh.If you liked the others, you'll like this one. If not, then maybe this'll raise your sails to the franchise!I personally was disappointed no Alestorm songs were used in the film (wasted opportunity) and I personally forgot the tongue in cheek style of the franchise. So of naturally I was put off course in the theater.However, there's one scene, (not saying what it is because I want this to be spoiler free) that made me realize that despite it's flaws and tattered sails, people care for the characters this world has made. And that takes true film craftsman'ship'!Overall, if you go in expecting a campy Pirates of the Caribbean film, you will NOT be disappointed. But if you expect something serious or cinematically fantastic, you'll be let down, but still be able to enjoy the film. And other than a few godawful jokes. This film is pretty good! And I would recommend it to a fan or someone interested in the franchise any day!...sorry for all the pirate puns. I'm personally sad I didn't get to make a 'why is the rum gone?' joke but I hope you enjoyed and found this somewhat helpful anyway!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Boring, pedantic, predictable, empty romcom","Hey! Were you captivated by the rich world of Pirates of the Caribbean in the first movie? Did you enjoy the thrilling action and deep characters of it's sequels? You want to see Orlando Bloom and Johnny Depp take to the seas once more in their cursed pirateships to fight an epic battle against an unstoppable force of evil? Well don't expect that in this movie. There's no epic battle, just a few minor brawls. You thought Pirates 4 was bad? Well this is worse. If you're hoping to see Orlando Bloom return for his role as William Turner in this dung heap they call a movie you're in for a sour surprise because he barely has 3 minutes of screen time. Were you hoping to see Johnny Depp return to the hilarious badass dumb genius pirate captain Jack Sparrow? Well he's just an empty shell of slapstick comedy. No? Then how about seeing Keira Knightly as the loose pirate queen of Shipwreck Cove, Elizabeth Swann? Too bad. You get to see her for maybe 20 seconds and ONLY at the very end of the movie. Or perhaps you were hoping to see Javier Bardem preform an amazing role as the most feared ghost piratehunter of the seven seas, Armando Salazar? You'll sorta get it? I mean, half the movie is captain Salazar's backstory and how he met the previously lovable Jack Sparrow. No? None of that? Then how about seeing good ol' Geoffrey Rush reprise his role as Captain Barbossa? Well he's always good, even despite the horrendous asspull they did in the last bit of the movie.Now then let's move on to the latest additions to the cast. Kaya Scodelario as Carina Smyth, the strong, smart, independent woman who don't need no man but still kinda wants one, who's really just there to replace the hot clickbait actress they cannot afford anymore (Keira Knightly) or how about Brenton Thwaites as Henry Turner? Yes, the kid we saw at the end of the third movie, who was then still called Bill Turner back then, has received a name change as well as an actor change. He doesn't really do anything. He's just a plot device called ""hurr durr I need to find the trident of Poseidon to save my father hurr""This movie is incredibly dumb, and only small children would enjoy it. Which will be hard considering it's a PG-13 movie.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Hilarious fun for the first half,"Captain Jack Sparrow and his crew return for another adventure in the fifth installment of the POTC franchise. And while it was a good looking film all around, with great special effects and set pieces, the convoluted story holds it back from being truly great.The first half of this film is the better half, featuring plenty of hilarious moments, scenes filled with action and comedic charm. Dialogue is entertaining and interesting while the story makes sense for a first time viewer in the franchise. However, more and more things have to be explained as the film goes on and it becomes very confusing. Certain fights and ideas added to the plot feel unnecessary and odd. Multiple characters are given screen time but then disappear for the entire movie. (A few in particular are tossed in at the end for closure that felt rushed and not expanded upon). So many characters are given their purpose for being there that it's difficult to keep up with everyone's motivation!This film is a step above stranger tides, but a step below dead man's chest and black pearl.

This movie is getting too much hate.,"I'll open with this, I'm a big fan of the Pirates franchise as a whole. Despite its weaker aspects(specifically the fourth entry), it's a fun series that never lets you leave the theater bored. And this movie is no exception.This is the sequel fans have been waiting for. Providing thrills, laughs and stunning visuals(this movie looked sharp). The story was compelling and I felt that every actor excelled. That is not to say it didn't have flaws. But regardless it brought a fun filled, action packed movie that I thoroughly enjoyed all the way through. A couple plot holes, an iffy final act and questionable cameos aside it was exactly what I could ask for from a Pirates movie. My advice to possible viewers: if you enjoy the fun of his franchise, see this movie and you'll have a great time. My advice to people who didn't like it, either you hated the franchise to begin with or you forgot how fun/silly the first few movies were to begin with.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Stop relying on Jack, the franchise is so much more than him","Dead Men Tell No Tales (a title far superior to Salazar's Revenge) was about as good, and as bad as I expected.Fortunately the film feels much more connected to the original trilogy which I hold so dear. The only issue is that Jack Sparrow's character is completely flanderized, and by far the worst part of the film. He started off as not the main focus in the first (and best) entry in the series, but has progressively gotten worse and worse. Here, he slurs his words for most of the film, and seems to just get incredibly lucky rather than actually use his hidden intelligence. I suspect that they're trying to make him out to be a shadow of what he once was. I just think it's not clear enough and could have been executed better.Fortunately the new side characters breathe a little bit of life into the franchise. The sets and character designs (especially for the villains) are visually interesting, and help reinforce the quasi-mythology that Dead Man's Chest and At World's End set up so well. Salazar himself is actually intimidating for the first half of the film, before he gets stuck in a weird loop saying 'Sparrow'. And the leitmotifs make a lot more sense in this film than On Stranger Tides.Still, Dead Men Tell No Tales is a shadow of what once was a fresh and exciting franchise. Fortunately it does try to actually be something different, and as a result doesn't really ruin the world for me.Just fix Sparrow or get rid of him entirely. There's still interesting stories to be told here, stop relying on a tired character.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"classic setting, classic Disney, nothing special, mostly as expected","6.5 of 10Having a look at all five existing movies up to now, for me, the first one still stands out as the only ""true"" one in many ways - where the three proceeding ones decrease in quality from movie to movie.""Dead Men Tell No Tales"" does not make any technical mistakes, improves to the 4th ""On Stranger Tides"" (I even forgot watching that one which obviously did not leave any impression) but also does not provide anything more than a standard Disney movie. On the positive side, we have: nice well-known beloved characters, animations, costumes, setting, coherent plot, jokes, ...However, the whole movie I was asking myself if it can really tell me something new about these beloved characters and the ""bigger story"" behind it. They try but I did not buy it.When a movie is getting too straightforward in the fifth sequel, too focused on Hollywood animation with fun, fire and blingbling - so to say tries too hard to artificially entertain - and does not take itself serious at any point up to the end, why should I as an observer do? Many scenes contain very unlikely behaviour of humans and material even for a fantasy movie which makes this movie feel more like a musical than a fantasy movie.Obviously, the turn to a more epic story with a bit more complex leitmotiv than a children's tale will never happen with today's Jack Sparrow - sigh :\.I recommend watching if you aware of what to expect from a ""nice-evening, don't know what to do, oh yeah Jack Sparrow"" perspective.Watched in English.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"A Return to Form, But You Can Never Truly Go Home","It can be said that there hasn't been a truly good Pirates of the Caribbean film since the first one, The Curse of the Black Pearl.Dead Men Tell No Tales is probably the next good Pirates film, but much like Star Wars: The Force Awakens, it probably owes many of its good elements from the first film of its franchise.Indeed, in this fifth adventure of Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp, both current and a surprisingly effective de-aged version) we once again return to the well of an undead sea crew and a captain with a personal grudge against Sparrow (played by Javier Bardem, but not quite as menacingly as Geoffrey Rush's first time as Barbossa).Much like the first film, Jack Sparrow is found rather down on his luck, and he must be rescued from the executioner by a Turner (this time the grown son of Orlando Bloom's William Turner) and seek a mystical artifact which will solve everyone's problems.Let's set one thing in stone: this is definitely not the worst film in the Pirates franchise.There are many great aspects of this film, mainly stemming from the fact that this is more or less an adventure film with not too much emphasis put on the made-up rules of the mystical elements of the story.While Depp's Jack Sparrow is still the main man of the film, his role is significantly curtailed with the elements of Javier Bardem's Captain Salazar's motivations and the budding romance of Turner and Carina Smith, played by Kaya Scodelario.The problems with this film, however, stems from the fact that these two elements take too much of the film away from Depp. He tends to fade into the background while we learn about Salazar's backstory, which has a few cool Easter eggs, but not much substance, and the romance with Turner and Carina feels very, very forced.All told, even some well-placed innuendo isn't enough to take away from the fact that while this film is a return to form, almost as satisfying when the credits roll (don't forget the tantalizing post- credit sequence) as the first film, but 14 years later, the Curse of the Black Pearl is still king, and this film does not displace it.Still, this film will definitely leave you with enough of a smile on your face to make the price of admission worth it.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It is better than the last one but nothing more.,"When I saw the last scene of ""At world's end"", I thought the next one will be the story about Turner and his son. But it did not come up until now.

And since the last one, it seems that Jack Sparrow is not doing the main acting or we say not the actual leading character in the film. Rather someone attached to the story for a very unique and not so firm reason. Certainly, I would like to see more sea battle between the captains or legends.Needless to say, the graphic design is marvelous. The film technology is improving but the script quality is decreasing.

"Thrills, Excitement, Good Acting, Lousy Script","As is typical with franchises, each new installment is worse than the last.The centerpiece of the franchise is the acting of Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush. The more they give them to do, the better the film. Unfortunately, as has been noted by other reviewers, they don't give them much to do in this film, despite that they are on screen a lot.The supporting cast does a good job. But, again, they are saddled with a lousy script.One of the desirable qualities of a script, or any story, is that you don't know see what's coming. The element of surprise. Unfortunately, in this film, you can see everything coming from a mile away.The ending obviously has been designed to lead into the next film. Like it or not, there's a major issue that must be resolved.It seems that the only thing important to the studio is action. There's plenty of that. And, can't argue with success, that makes them money. That's what makes everyone in Hollywood money.The entire franchise appears to be set in the late 18th century, with the latest film PotC 5 set approximately 20 years after PotC 4. By this time, no one was killing witches. So, I consider that aspect of the film to be a flaw. It really doesn't have any notable effect on the film, but it really doesn't have any good reason to be there. either.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales (2017),"I am by no means a fan of the POTC franchise. I enjoyed the first one but didn't care a whole lot about the rest. After the trilogy they should have buried the franchise but instead returned with On Stranger Tides and now a new installment. Marketing for this was low, as it just came and went without making a wave or splash (hehe). I heard some really awful things about the film. I do agree that the franchise really needs to retire itself but at the same time the film isn't actually terrible. Its not very good, however a few things stand out.The film follows the adventures of Jack Sparrow once again this time accompanied by the son of Will Turner and a potential love interest. A dead crew led by Javier Bardem's Captain Salazar are after Sparrow and are ruthless in their approach to get him. We once again get large scale nautical adventures with exactly what you would expect out of a Pirates film. The film doesn't tread any new ground. Its a case of, ""if you've seen one, you've seen them all.""Jack Sparrow's whimsically drunken and eccentric nature is running its course. Its the same old for five films now. The film still does feel overlong, despite being the shortest in the franchise. There is some nice back and forth, especially from Kaya Scodelario's character but overall even the dialogue feels worn. The air of familiarity is present throughout. I must say though Javier Bardem is a stand out as Salazar. That man was born to play a villain.The best aspects are when we see Salazar and his crew. The effects for re-creating the crew are actually quite spectacular and you notice this just from seeing the trailer. There are some stupidly enjoyable moments but they don't often come around. Still, I'd rather have seen this then check out the newest Transformers film (I am dreading seeing that horror show). Overall, nothing new in a tired series but special effects are top notch.6.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The Best Since the First,"Dead Men is the fifth(!) movie based on a plot less 1960s theme park ride. Only Disney would have the cojones to get away with something so (frankly) stupid. Despite all odds, the first film was a critical and cultural behemoth, entertainingly combining fantasy lore, swashbuckling action and refreshing silliness. From there, everything became overly convoluted, & then completely pointless, until this latest seafaring adventure. Not that Dead Men will be confused for great, but it returns Jack Sparrow back to the cool set-pieces, broad laughs and series nostalgia that made it passably diverting. Dead Men opens with a high energy chase. Captain Jack and his band of bootleggers have stolen an entire bank building and are dragging it through a colorful old town. Later on, there's another center-piece escape scene, with Jack using the guillotine shackles he's stuck in to ward off the enemy. It's peppered with Buster-Keaton-Jackie-Chan-esque CG stunts, captured within a story about a cursed crew and a family reunited. It marries past characters and stories to present woes, and rarely strays off its predetermined course. The straight-forward plotting gives plenty of room for Depp to quip and waddle like we want. Unfortunately, it also gives room for the movie to slow down for another charisma-less romance between two unknown, charmless model-actors. In these moments, and the many others that scream of corn and cheese, the 129-minute length started to feel much longer and even made me almost doze off. So do I actually like this because it's ""good"", or am I just reacting to the unfairly terrible reviews and its preceding sequels? Oh well; just drink up, me 'earties and enjoy this slice of pirate life.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I watched the whole series again and recognized that Jack used to be a very special character who can not be removed in previous episodes. He used to be a wonderful leader, clever captain, and strange friend. However, this movie just needed him as a joke maker or even did not need him to make it complete. He was just a reason to have a story and that was all. Nevertheless, I think this movie is still attractive and worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
great movie especially in 3d,"Hi, Just saw the pirates movie in 3d and I was pleasantly surprised.I thought the story was good and inventive like the past ones.I thought the special effects were very inventive and you just kind of watched the crazy actions scenes in awe.I thought johnny depp the young guy lead and the young woman lead were very good in their parts and johnny depp seemed just as into the role as in the other pirates.

Treasure,"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales is a prime example on how to resuscitate a franchise. I consider myself a Pirates fan, and I am happy to say this film is a worthy addition to the franchise. As soon as the movie started, all the shameful exposition made me think this would suck, but as the new characters are introduced, and the old ones etch their way in, the movie improves greatly. Dead Men Tell No Tales spends the necessary time in character development, and Kaya Scodelario makes the otherwise dull plot devices tolerable. She is the single best addition to the franchise and should be what the next movie should focus on to make it the best it can be. Her screen presence is completely magnetic and she steals every scene she is in.The other new elements, like Captain CGI and Henry Turner, are solid, but nothing extraordinary. I really wish they had used more practical effects instead of a motion capture transparent army, but it wasn't too bad.The movie also has some GREAT set pieces, and I swear the guillotine sequence is one of the funniest I've seen in some time. Depp and his antics are perfect for set pieces so that really helped the movie, and the script was sharper than I thought it would be. That last death scene was also very good, and though the reveal seemed a little gratuitous, it didn't negatively affect the end product that much.The score is mostly evocative of the previous movies, as it is expected, but it embraces that and does it well, unlike some other Disney movies. Geoff Zanelli also introduces some new themes that are good, but his spotting for the old Hans Zimmer themes is remarkable. The fleeting french horn motif he uses for the small Black Pearl was magnificent, expressive orchestration. I really hope he stays on for the next film.Overall, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales is a good movie that is fun to watch, and that is all that really matters. Taking into account the non-existent source material (a theme park ride), Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg do a pretty good job at directing it, and Jeff Nathanson and Terry Rossio pulled a pretty passable script out of their asses, even though there are some pretty blatant continuity errors (compass origin story) that hopefully most fans will overlook. Combined with very sharp cinematography by Paul Cameron (Deja Vu, Collateral), and a good score by Geoff Zanelli, Pirates 5 ends up being a pretty good movie, setting the stage for a much better continuation.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The story of how I fell asleep (nearly) during a pirate adventure,"So, I went to see this (presumably... or not) last chapter in the PoC-saga. I honestly went in with an open mind, not really expecting much after the previous fiasco that was 'On Stranger Tides"". Even so, this polished piece of scrap metal indeed did it's best to disappoint me for what seemed like an eternity. In short: this must be one of the most boring action/adventure - flicks I've seen in a cinema these past years.Quick recap:Ridicoulusly loud and messy action no-one would ever be able to followThe least engaging romantic tension in a love story since Edward an BellaJohhny Depp overdoing an already overdone character (yes. This was ACTUALLY possible)Weird over the top CGI (why, tho? We want cannons and wooden splinters. That is all.)A less scary villain than Blackbeard from the previous filmA script presumably thrown together with no thread whatsoeverOne gazillion plot-lines, none which are remotely interestingBarbossa Barbossaing (yay for this).I've enjoyed some messy flicks here and there. I've been charmed by them, I've been able to ignore annoying moments. But I had NEVER expected this Disney monstrosity to be so utterly dull and boring. The one star rewarded goes to Geoffrey Rush. He made med snigger on two occasions. Let's now hope this puts the final nail in the coffin of the Pirates-franchise.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A lot better than I expected,"This movie was a lot better than I was expecting. Reviews of this movie have been pretty cynical and negative, but I don't think the negativity is deserved. This is a fun movie. A lot of the old cast returned for this film, and it bookends the series in a lovely way. It's not perfect, and we'll get into that below. But if you are looking for a fun adventure movie, with a lot of laughs, this movie fills all those check boxes.Lets first get the negatives out of the way, which are few, but deserve mention. The two new leads in this film are rookies, and not strong enough as actors to carry this movie. They are adequate, but never succeed in convincing you that they deserve being in this movie, contrary to Orlando Bloom and Kyra Knightley in the past. Fortunately the old cast are able to bare the weight of the movie, with both Rush and Depp doing a great job.There's a scene where they show a young Jack Sparrow, and as usual, the effect for that is not good. Please Hollywood, stop de-aging actors with CGI! It looks terrible. His mouth looked like it had just been pasted on. It was really weird and jarring. Not as jarring as CGI Peter Cushing in Rogue One, but pretty jarring none the less. There is no reason to do this with CGI. Just cast a young actor who looks enough like a young Depp and you're done. It's cheaper, and the audience will accept it more easily, instead of being distracted by a lousy effect.The script is okay, although there is a lot of plot convenience, and a lot of stuff that defies physics. But I can look past that, because this is not a movie franchise that should be taken too seriously. The dialogue in the beginning is a bit stiff though, especially when the two new leads are basically telling the audience their backstories. Show, don't tell! (But don't show it with bad de-aging CGI!) Now for the positives, Depp does a great job. I thought that I would be bored of Jack Sparrow by now, but I guess not. Both he and Rush seemed to be having fun, and giving it their best. And it is fun watching these actors just having a lot of joy on set. The humor is also really on point. Most of the jokes work.The action is pretty fantastic. I was amazed by some of the crazy action scenes that they came up with, especially during the very strong opening of the film. Yes, it is absurd and over the top, but there was a lot of practical stuff, and just good old stunt work. It was so much fun to watch. I feel that they could have ended the film perhaps with a big battle, but the ending we got instead sufficed.The design of the ghost pirates and their ship is really well done. And the undead sharks (which you can see in the trailer) were pretty creepy. I also liked the quality of most of the special effects. The ships all look really good. The high production values are clearly on display. There's some green screening here and there, but I think the general audience will not even notice that. The set designs are fantastic, and there's just a lot of awesome practical stuff in the film.So as you can tell, I had a lot of fun at this film. I was not disappointed in the slightest. Stick around till after the credits for the usual post credits scene. But I could be mistaken, but isn't this going to be the last PotC film? Then why are we getting another post credits teaser? And why does the post credits scene seem to contradict the finale of the movie? Ehh... whatever.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Terribly incoherent,"If you would ask me to recount the plot, I wouldn't be able to. The fifth installment is simply incoherent. It jumps from action scene to action scene with no discernible story. Obviously, there are plenty of impressive visuals, but they don't contribute to anything larger than that. Yes, 'Dead Men Tell No Tales' tells no tale. The movie also lacks the wit of the first installment and lacks any emotional or intellectual development on the part of any of the characters. The ones you would like to sympathize with, such as the female astronomer, are still too shallow and stereotypical to be any good.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Best Pirates of the Caribbean film since Dead Man's Chest,"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales is a solid movie. It gives me the same feeling the first one did.The Cons: They ruined Jack Sparrow's character. He goes from a quick-minded, tipsy pirate that is good at being a pirate to a drunk, stupid, bad pirate. It also got me hyped for Will Turner returning, but he was only in the film for probably a total of 10 minutes.The Pros: Salazar is a villain to remember. He is frightening to look at and has a reason to be hunting down Jack. This movie has funny moments that aren't force, like the guillotine. The movie gave me the same feeling the first one did.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
A mix of good and bad,"I thoroughly enjoyed all iterations of Pirates of the Caribbean. I have mixed feelings about this one, however. First thing's first - the plot.The story is fairly complex, especially if you haven't watched any of the previous ones. The two famed pirates we know from before, Cpt Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) and Cpt Hector Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), find their paths intertwined with Henry Turner (Brenton Thwaites) and Carina Smyth (Kaya Scodelario). They all come to seek the trident of Poseidon. Needless to say obtaining it is easier said than done. One of the factors stalling their progress is Captain Salazar, brilliantly interpreted by Javier Bardem.The movie shifts from being an uncomfortable teenage romantic movie, to a bad sitcom and then to a fascinating fable with jaw-dropping special effects. The two former spoils the experience for me, the latter pulls me right back in. The typical Hollywood script of boy meets girl and girls body gets highlighted in various camera angles and talked about throughout the movie is there. Together with not-very-fun punchlines in almost every scene. The serious story and scenes of significance that Jack Sparrow and his ludicrous crew normally are supposed to bounce on are too few here. The ones that are there, though, are really intriguing. This is where Captain Salazar shines and reminds us of the magical, unforgiving and endless universe that is Pirates of the Caribbean.The movie as a whole is still good, and if you're a fan of the previous ones - worth your time.At the very least your top villain of all time list will get a little longer",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"It is an okay film, but nothing hugely spectacular except for the IMAX screen and hence easily forgettable!","I watched Dead Men Tell No Tales in IMAX with Laser and it was nice. This resulted in bright images, especially the oceans, projected by dual projectors on the giant 42 feet high, 65 feet wide screen of IMAX, completely using the whole screen without chopping the picture. The images are larger than life, but they don't confuse the eye or strain the vision of the audience. Along with 12000 Watts IMAX proprietary sound system that was used very well for the sound editing!I feel people like me went only to see Jack Sparrow and the awesome visuals. The movies is Depp's recovery and comeback movie as all of his films have become flops between Stranger Tides (2011) and Dead Men Tell No Tales (2017).The story seems to be written as it goes along, so you lose track of what's going on and who's doing what and why we even care. The jokes have become all stale now.The good news was at two hours and twenty minutes, this one being the shorter films in the series. The bad news is this aging franchise has long overstayed its welcome. There is a lot to like about this movie, but unfortunately it's all the stuff we've seen before.My significant digit score: 6.3/10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The most other-worldly visual effects of any recent movie.,"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales is the fifth installment of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise and has the most other-worldly visual effects of any recent movie. The CGI is the most mesmerizing piece of treasure throughout the film. Johnny Depp again stars as Jack Sparrow and Geoffrey Rush as Captain Barbossa. It also stars the terrific Javier Bardem as the new villain, Captain Salazar. Brenton Thwaites plays Henry Turner and Kaya Scodelario plays Carina Smyth. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley have cameos as Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann, respectively. Full disclosure: I am a huge Johnny Depp fan and I have loved the Pirates of the Caribbean movies since I was 5 years old!At the beginning of the film, Captain Jack Sparrow is presumed dead. He resurfaces in a most humorous way. Captain Salazar is Jack Sparrow's oldest nemesis. He takes revenge on Sparrow by unleashing the vicious ghost pirates of Devil's Triangle. The ghost pirates are hell-bent on killing Sparrow and destroy multiple pirate ships in the process. The only way to break the curse is to find and destroy the Trident of Poseidon. Along the way, we learn the background of Will Turner's son, Henry Turner. He's looking for Sparrow and also trying to find the Trident in order to save his father who is trapped in Davy Jones Locker. Carina Smyth is a young astronomer who is also searching for the Trident. What ensues is a humorous, action packed adventure on the high seas.The special effects and CGI are astoundingly lifelike. The most stunning visual effects in the film are the CGI animated ghost sharks, which are sent to hunt down Jack Sparrow. The movements of the ghost pirates and sharks are hyper-realistic. Out of all the Pirates of The Caribbean films, this one utilizes the most mythological elements. Johnny Depp again aces his performance as Captain Jack Sparrow. His interpretation of Jack Sparrow is one of the most entertaining and memorable characters in recent film history. The inimitable Geoffrey Rush is again terrific as Captain Barbossa and Javier Bardem, an acclaimed actor from art house and independent films, is riveting as the vicious Captain Salazar.One flaw of the film is how Keira Knightley suddenly appears for one minute during the movie. It's the one false note because it seems gratuitous. However, it doesn't distract from the impact and excitement of the film. Compared to other movie sequels, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales flows surprisingly well and moves along at an exciting pace. The film is appropriate for 10 to18 year olds. I give Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales 5 out of 5 stars.Reviewed by Clayton P., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A discontinuous movie,"Surely better than the useless fourth episode. Some things are very good, some not. Maybe after the third episode a prequel movie that explains the origins of Jack's myth it would have been the right choice. A lost occasion, and I'm so sad about it.

Uncredited Keystone Kops Rip-off,"I noticed a comment in the trivia section for the movie ""Filming was started without a finished script."" I think that about says it all for me. If you put 5 monkeys in front of 10 typewriters for 10 years, the script for this movie would be what you would get from their efforts. What a crappy, noisy, confusing bunch of overdone special effects. I only went to see it because my husband wanted to. And for the record, I LOVED the first movie! Why do they always have to make sequels? Hmmm...oh I forgot, to make more MONEY!!! Not only is the plot confusing, but the whole movie is visually repulsive. Everything and everyone is slimy, sweaty, dirty, and have rotten teeth (except of course for the lovely two leads, who have to be pretty and dirty at the same time.)

Amusing at times but unbearable at others.,"I don't write reviews often because I'm told I nitpick which isn't fair, but I have to say this movie lost me almost right from the beginning. The opening scene was quite ridiculous on both counts - yup I'm talking about the preface being 9 years earlier and the opening surrounding good ole Jack himself. I literally cringed into the side of my girlfriend as I couldn't believe what had just happened twice. I grew up with the pirates series and the first 2 were quite incredible, they've gone down hill since, and by down hill I mean more and more outrageously hard to believe. The first movie and almost the second you could stow away your better judgment or understanding of physics and science and accept it for what it was, a swashbuckling good time. Now you have to be outright stupid, or mindless to not want to question who the heck wrote this movie... It still passes the two hours well, but there were too many moments that I almost couldn't bare to watch.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Captain Jack Sparrow's Charisma saves the weak Script, a Fulfill End to the Franchise.","PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN : DEAD MEN TELL NO TALES REVIEW - I have seen all previous films of this Franchise on TV unlimited times and enjoyed each one of them. But i never got a chance to watch Captain Jack Sparrow on Big Screen and today i got the chance and i couldn't resist myself. I wasn't expecting much but was expecting a Fulfill End to the Franchise and i enjoyed the film a lot but not upto the mark. Script and Logic wise this is the weakest film of the franchise but still it didn't fail to entertain you as promised. Captain Jack Sparrow's charisma saved the weak script and dull direction. Beginning 15 minutes are let down and then Johnny Depp aka Captain Jack Sparrow arrives and takes the charge of the Ship. Once he arrives film doesn't lose the tempo but some illogical scenes irritates you. For instance, Pulling a house with the help of 4-6 horses is not acceptable, sometimes gravity doesn't exist, no specific reason to why Barbossa die. Excluding these minuses film has everything to entertain you with it's barrier. I don't think any other Actor would have done the role Jack Sparrow as Johnny Depp has done. All 5 films of the franchise revolves around his character, others disappoints but he kept entertaining us. Thank you Johnny Depp for playing memorable Captain Jack Sparrow with such an ease, you will be remembered for years as Mr. Sparrow. Editing of the film is tight, probably shortest film of the franchise. Cinematography is Good. 3D effects and Visuals are excellent except few scenes. Comedy and dialogues could have been better. Direction is the weakest aspect here, i don't understand why Director went away from the line and tried to make good logical film, a fictional one. Overall it is slightly down but yet another Entertaining film from Disney's Pirates franchise. You will get what you want to see, just don't keep expectations high. Hopefully it is the last film of the franchise and i think it was a fulfill end to the most entertaining franchise ever, so i would like to thank Disney and Johnny Depp for giving us Pirates series and Hilarious Captain Jack Sparrow. Go for it If you're a fan of the franchise or Johnny Depp. Compared to previous films i must say each film of this franchise has lost some comedy and some logic consistently with each upcoming film. POTC1 > POTC2 > POTC3 > POTC4 > POTC5. I'm going with 6/10* as i found this one as One Time Watch, but will watch on TV many times only because of Captain Jack Sparrowwwww....",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Excellent Swashbuckler,"After all it is a PIRATESLIFE, this movie is an extraordinary sequence of the pirates. I have booked back to back for the long weekend. Excellent work by the directors and the artists here as always in the pirates film. No word of pointing anyone's performance, but it would have been good part if Will Turner's(Orlando) shots were more. He gets only 2 start and end of the film.Overall this is a good way to end the franchise. But they say 6th installment awaits, Have to watch it as well",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An Honest Review.,"Really, there's enough reviews out there for people to get the general idea of the film. It has a very clichéd plot, the action scenes are non stop (and feature some AMAZING CGI), the overlying story is basically just like someone took #1-3 and put them in a blender, while using #4 as the ""wacky adventures of Jack Sparrow"" due to the lost cast of Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly (which both get extremely short cameos rather than roles)However, the one thing I want to add, is that this movie is a HARD PG-13. My sister had to take my 12 year old nephew home because of the violence (sure, no blood, but ""water droplets instead"" and a flopping arm on the ground is pretty gruesome.)So if you have kids that are scared of violence, be careful when taking them. Just because the ""blood"" is replaced with ""water"" doesn't mean that a 10-14 year old won't realize that someone lost an arm, got decapitated, or got eaten by a ghost shark.All in all, the worst of the Pirates movies, but still extremely entertaining. I have to give this one a 6 due to them just rehashing a mix of the first 3, with Johnny Depp doing his Sparrow bit the whole movie, and especially because there were violent acts that substituted sparkles (for ghosts) and water for blood. With Adobe, I could color all of those ""water splashes"" red and this would be an R rated movie. So again, probably the worst POTC movie, but still an entertaining movie. Just make sure your children are ready for some extreme violence hidden under ""WE NEED TO GET PG-13!!!!"" mentality.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Should have waited for release on HBO,"The plot isn't especially good and Depp just needs to step away from this role. The whole Jack Sparrow act was fine for the first two movies, but now it just feels tired and annoying. Luckily Javier Bardem adds a good performance, as he always does, so that saves it from being a complete annoyance. Overall I would say it's worth a cheap rental at best.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Abandon Ship,"This review of Pirates of the Caribbean: Salazar's Revenge (Dead Men Tell No Tales) is spoiler free** (2/5)WHEN YOU GET on a theme park ride for the first time it's an original piece of memory that you will never forget, but when you return to the ride multiple times it gets monotonously tedious. Pirates of the Caribbean: Salazar's Revenge (changed its name from the US title Dead Men Tell No Tales) is just like that it's the same thing over and over again. And for the fifth film in the franchise it's exactly the same ride. Promising a return to form to 2003s original film; Curse of the Black Pearl Captain Jack Sparrow and his bunch of misfits are back but not to the return to form we expect.Story-wise it's the same thing, there's yet another pay-check seeking villain Javier Bardem's Captain Salazar – and his crew of ghosts manning a ghost ship out for revenge and there's another mishmash of a plot to hold it all together. We open with Henry Turner (Brenton Thwaites) the adult son of 2003s titular show runner Will Turner (Orlando Bloom who's back in full swing), on a search for Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) who's been missing for some years. He goes on a mission to find the lost trident of Poseidon to end his father's curse. A racy yet stunning opening to kick start it's promised return to form, this holds wholly well for the fifth film, there's a stunning set-piece of Jack being dragged by a moving building through a backdrop of a Caribbean island. A hilarious set-piece that holds firm in the film's first act thanks to the stunning cinematography, a drunk Jack who's surprisingly back to his unhinged form that nailed his character's strength in the first film. Though after horrendously bad ideas that pile up he's ridiculously routine, thus putting a barrier over his loose hinge. Through these it adds up to the same ride, yet much less fun than the previous four times.On a fair scale you have to credit Norwegian directing team Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg who found their sea-legs in 2012s Kon-Tiki, the fault of the bad ideas aren't all theirs it's the editing, the best bits happen to straggle in the film's first half. On that note there's a rotating Guillotine, centrifugal to it's axis it spins several times over, the audience look on unblinkingly while the room fills with laughter. Moistly to the look on Jack's face as this makes him dizzy. But this quickly dwindles the film's promising due to the piling bad ideas, the continuous jokes (the word ""witch"" is on repeat), and the additional flimsy CG. The first act's hilarious swashbuckling proves to be the strongest force.There's a return of older characters that have been here since the beginning too, specifically when we revisit Geoffrey Rush's Captain Barbosa he's living the high life after the death of On Stranger Tides' villain, Blackbeard. This is short lived once he hears the news of Salazar's return, he proves to be the reigning strength yet through the film's clogging list of ideas he's long-winded. Salazar seeks out his help to find Jack, along the way coming up with plans to kill him. Enter a much-needed flashback showing the origin of Salazar's revenge, it's here when the flimsy CG first comes to light (Depp's computerized younger self is an example of this), the film improves slightly over the previous misinterpreted Pirate venture of mythology. The new players improve it too; Henry Turner falls for an attractive adventurer Carina Smyth (Maze Runner's Kaya Scodelario) she sees adventure with Jack's crew as he goes in search for something weird. For some moments it runs the same storyline as the first adventure it shows this in full swing as Salazar is trying to stop Jack from doing his job.Pirates of the Caribbean: Salazar's Revenge follows along the lines of mythology too, Jack still has his magic compass which points to things he wants most in life, there are zombie sharks, and there is a cacophonous plot involving the lost trident of Poseidon which Jack must find to end Will's curse. Due to the bad ideas that pile up throughout it's not the return to form that was promised but thanks to a strongly hilarious first act it's along the lines of improvement over the last Pirate adventure. This is not the worst film this far into the series and it's certainly far from the best but there is improvement.VERDICT: A dull pirate venture for Jack and crew's return that promises a return to form but after piles of bad ideas and flimsy CG this is one ship that Depp's promising performance can't save.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
O no.,"The Pirates series started off so well. The characters were so nice to watch. Jack Sparrow used to be really funny... Now the only fun is in the way Jack Sparrow's name is pronounced by Salazar.Dead men tell no tales.

Please don't get me wrong, I'm not saying this movie is not entertaining.Maybe the problem does not lies with the actor actress,story or the series at all, maybe I have just reached to the point where I've seen too many pirates movie which were quite similar, I've just become too accustomed to all the twist & turns and I've simply come to expect too much.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not as amazing as other parts,When it comes to this viewers expect something out of league.

Far better than expected,"I was not sure what to expect from this after Pirates 4, so guess I kinda wen't in open minded.First of they nailed the tone of the movie, it's back to the root of the first movie.They introduce quite a few new characters, which worried me, because I was afraid it would make them too shallow. Luckily I actually felt i got to know them enough to care about them.It's mostly me personally, but I really ain't' a fan of Javier Bardem, but he did work pretty well as a villain.As expected the visuals were great, awesome effects and scenery which is a joy to watch.The music and sound effects where amazing, and several times downright epic.No movie is perfect, and this had a few issues like any movie. Like most sequels, they try to top what was done before, and I felt sometimes it got to be to unreal, rather than being smart and funny.Depp plays the role quite well, but he can't match is own performance from the first pirates, which I think most expected.No spoilers. The story was rather good actually, and worked as a backdrop for for the action and where they went.The story did have a some plot holes, and a few things wasn't explained too well, but overall it all made sense.So a final thought, too all those who lost faith in Pirates of the Caribbean after the letdown of the 4th.

All age appropriate, given that too young or too old may not be hip to the previous stories, although it is not too necessary to be hip to the previous installments, given the amount of special effects to keep your mind occupied and trying to figure out all the who, what, when how and where, and since my generation likes stories it is light on that.

Rating: C+,"The Pirates of the Caribbean saga isn't properly a great one ... Its first film established an amazing character that mostly defines Johnny Depp career (he's been criticized in other movies for doing too ""Jack Sparrow-isms"") and it was a movie full of adventure, fun and thrilling action scenes. From the second installment to the fourth it has been a tormentous journey, with each movie worse than the latter. Well, one thing is certain: Dead Men Tell No Tales (or Salazar's Revenge, as it was shown at my theater) is the best one since the first ... Which is not saying much.Let me start with the good things first. The soundtrack keeps being epic and memorable, which makes every action sequence better, even if the action itself isn't great. Henry and Carina are excellent additions to the story as well as the actors portraying those characters. Javier Bardem also does a great job as the villain and Barbossa gets a very emotional role in this installment, captured brilliantly by Geoffrey Rush. Actually, if there's one thing that defines the Pirates of the Caribbean series, is the cast's chemistry, it feels that they're all there having fun and not just there to receive their paycheck.The story is the most interesting since the first film of the franchise, even if it becomes a mess mid-way through and too exaggerated. The ending, I dare to say, it's perfect. I mean, with all its flaws, this movie manages to end on an extremely high note, full of emotion, with a lot of mysteries solved and even some closure (if this isn't the last time we've seen Jack Sparrow, the production is just going to keep drowning the whole thing and ruin it more than what it already is).For all it's worth, I still can't quite give a positive review to this one ...The action scenes are disappointing, they're there more for a comic relief moment than for a thrilling set piece and there's more running and jumping than actual sword and ship-fighting. Some of them are so over-the-top that it just makes them look stupid. The humor is also a bit too much ... Not that the movie isn't funny, it's just that they never once understood when to stop a joke (there are several jokes that go on and on and on and on ...).The pacing is surprisingly slow until the beginning of the third act (best one of the film) and it feels like there's no rush in saving anyone's life. The characters are just going from place to place in the messiest, strangest and badly scripted way possible which doesn't help to keep me captivated at all and actually makes the movie feels longer than it is (even if it is indeed a bit too long).My biggest disappointment is, by far, Johnny Depp. Don't get me wrong, he was born to play this role, but I feel that giving him 100% freedom, which is something that was definitely decided behind the scenes with the directors, kind of damaged his performance. It feels like he's doing an impression of himself portraying Jack Sparrow! In addition to this, Dead Men Tell No Tales is the movie with less screen time for this character ... Interesting, at least.Finally, I didn't enjoy the humor as I expected to. I think the comedy isn't as funny and clever as it was already in the previous movies and the whole film seems like a bunch of cool scenes glued together with a messy plot. The production/directors built the story around these awesome moments instead of the other way around and the final result isn't exactly good.In the end, Pirates of The Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales (or Salazar's Revenge) is another film that critics are giving too much of a hard time to. It's the best movie since the first one (which is not saying much, I know), it has an interesting premise, some great additions to the cast and story, the usual epic score that helps the action sequences a lot and the ending is nailed perfectly. However, it does have a lot of flaws: from the action scenes themselves to the slow pacing and from the messy plot to the surprisingly not that funny humor, going through a disappointing performance from Johnny Depp, this film isn't near perfection whatsoever.MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A return to Pirates Greatness,"After watching this film, I simply cannot wrap my mind around the rating that the Rotten Tomatoes critics have given it. I thought everything was great, from the plot to the new and old characters to the action. Javier Bardem was amazing as Captain Salazar. Geoffrey Rush breathed another fresh breath of air into the series as Barbossa, and Depp once again performed well as Captain Jack. Be sure to stay until the very end of the credits to see a very cool extra scene with a large cliffhanger!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A step in the right direction after the last film,"After On Stranger Tides, I didn't expect too much from Dead Men Tell No Tales. The return of some past characters, and a romance between the side characters that wasn't forced for once, made for a nice romp. Barbossa being back was as great as ever since he's one of the highlights of this series. However, I felt that Gibbs was a bit underused even more than in On Stranger Tides this time around.The action scenes are a bit of an improvement over the last movie, but still nowhere near the first two movies in the series. The whole first chapter that took place before the characters took to the sea was insanely enjoyable, and I wish we had more of that. The story once they got onto the sea was a bit less interesting, and I felt like the villain in this movie, Salazar, kind of sucked and is probably the worst villain out of all the movies so far. I had so much trouble understanding what he was saying most of the time, but thankfully Netflix subtitles saved the day for me.Overall, despite the villain being a little underwhelming, I feel like this is a much better installment to the Pirates franchise than On Stranger Tides was. If you're not expecting a totally memorable movie and just want to kill a weekend adternoon watching a decent movie, I feel that this is a good contender.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Even the one and only Javier Bardem couldn't save the franchise,"Johhny Depp's performance as 'Jack Sparrow' has always been the light of the franchise, but this time Javier Bardem takes the biggest spotlight. Johnny's Stale and boring performance took every charm away that made Pirates Of The Carribbean the box-office performance of the century. A too un-developed plot truly made this franchise sink to the bottom. Obviously they needed more than Javier's performance to make this movie equally as good as the first three.

A good pirates movie,This was a good Pirates of the Caribbean movie. It wasn't the best but not the worst. I was entertained through out the entire movie and I thought the new lead actors did a great job. I believe Johnny Depp's time as Jack Sparrow should come to an end before it gets to much. They need to start a new franchise with the two new lead actors. But good movie and great franchise!,7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great stuff! Watch in 4dx!,"Ten out of ten for a movie experience! I loved the first couple of Pirates movies, but after the first two just hated the rest, they were imo dull, by numbers movies just made to cash in on the poor fans... So when I was dragged along to see this in 4dx I had really low expectations, and it turned out in 4dx to be like one long, exciting Disney ride, being sprayed with water every time they crashed in the sea, and having bubbles floating around when they find treasure, and the seats shaking at just the right times. The great, genuinely fun, storyline and cast combined with 4dx was amazing, this movie was made for 4dx and 4dx was made for this movie! Aside from the 4dx, the new cast were all great. Its not often recently I've left the cinema having enjoyed myself, but this was a great return to form and I'll be telling my friends to go see this in 4dx.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This Pirate Ship Sunk Long Ago,"""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" was a surprise. Disney had been trying ride-based movies for a few years and they were all awful. Then suddenly here came one that was fun and featured a character that would for better or worse define the rest of Johnny Depp's career. The movie was a critical and financial hit.Unfortunately 14 years and 4 sequels later, all the charm and sense of adventure that made the original so much fun is nothing more than a faded memory. Part of the problem is the popularity of Jack Sparrow (Depp). Each movie exposes some untold backstory in order to make him relevant to the plot. Unfortunately, Captain Jack Sparrow is just overblown comic relief. Yet, his past seems to constantly dig up enemies who are after him. Now instead of seeing humor in Sparrow's role in the story, I just wonder why so many trust this loose cannon with such pivotal items.""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales"" is a decently put together film. The effects are fantastic which is par for the course with this franchise. The problems here lie with the characters and the story. Since Jack is too goofy, other characters have to drive the plot. This time those characters are Henry Turner (Brenton Thwaites), son of Orlando Bloom's Will Turner, who is a character about as engaging as paint drying. The other key character is Carina Smyth (played wonderfully by Kaya Scodelario). These two enlist Jack Sparrow as they search for the Trident of Poseidon. The villain this time is Captain Salazer played by Javier Bardem. Remember how he intimated James Bond in Skyfall and terrified everyone he crossed paths with in No Country for Old Men. Well get ready to hear him gurgle unintelligible lines. If the filmmakers went out of there way to make Bardem suck as a villain, they succeeded. Further, Geoffrey Rush's Captain Barbossa is tacked on to the story and at the end they attempt to give him a reason to be there meant presumably to maximize some emotional impact that fails miserably.Part of the problem with this entire series is that it fails to do any character development and in its place inserts so many plot points such that if the audience wishes to follow the story properly they should keep notes. But, who wants to keep notes on characters who fail to evolve in any way. By way of contrast, The Fast and the Furious characters appear deep, intricate, and thoughtful. In conclusion, this pirate ship sunk long ago.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Unforgettable Movie,"I never thought I would ever be a fan of Johnny Depp ever, but after this I absolutely adore him and his career as a pirate that I've completely fallen in love with. Johnny Deep was made for this movie. This movie is full of adventures, action and comedy. I love the way Jack sparrow walk and also his jokes. Johnny Depp's performance is one of his best ever as the slightly camp Captain Jack Sparrow. Even under his tangle of hair and blackened eyes, he will make you swoon and laugh both at the same time with his tones of witty lines and mannerisms. He was a witty, drunk, Sword fighting Pirate, with a flare for the dramatic. Seen for the first time in possibly the greatest hero entranced ever made. I glanced my stunned eye's at the screen to behold the one they called Jack Sparrow, or should I say ""Captain"" Jack Sparrow. Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) was a pirate but a good human. He helps Will to find Elizabeth in Black Pearl and he himself was cursed. Will and Elizabeth all part is my favorite. It starts in Port Royal, Jamaica. Where Elizabeth Swann, the governor's daughter gets kidnapped by a crew of cursed pirates. Right before the kidnapping a pirate by the name of Jack Sparrow comes into town looking to commandeer a ship. Sparrow agrees to team up with Elizabeth's childhood friend Will Turner in search of Elizabeth. But what Will does not know is that Jack is linked to the kidnapping and the cursed pirates in more ways than one. I believe that Elizabeth (Keira Knightley), Will (Orlando Bloom) and Jack (Johnny Depp) are absolutely perfect in their role. Jeffery Rush, also acted brilliantly with his part as the evil captain Barbosa. Also love how Barbosa manipulate people. Geoffrey Rush. Again, enough reason to see it. I wouldn't call him frightening, just scarily cool, dark and ugly. Very different role to the voice over of Nigel the Pelican.
The story is pretty simple but is an old tale that people of all ages will react to, for some time, as they always have. Everything feels and looks authentic. -The ships are also very cool! This is one film's set design I would love to visit and be a part of. -The soundtrack has been one that has been in my head, stuck for nearly two decades. Equal to the greats like Howard Shore or Hans Zimmer. It brings so much action and joy and makes you want to move around for sure. Everything you'd expect in a pirate movie, including a talking parrot, a monkey, Spanish gold, a ship battle.
The combination of some of the best make-up/costume design ever done and top tier acting makes this character unforgettable. Great story, great music. The movie will be always in my best movie list.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
THIS ONE FIXES THE MISTAKE WITH THE LAST ONE,"I loved. It was entertaining, funny and smooth. But I amd disappointed with some things too. Like Henry and Carina. Their connection is really weird and doesn't quiet fit in the picture. Captain Salazar is disappointing too. We expected him to show more his evil, but it was just little in shadow and that made a feeling that he made bad acting.
After all it is relly enjoyable and nice.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Worst Of The Pirate Movies,"Continuing my plan to watch every Johnny Depp movie in order, I come to the fifth Pirates movie. Salazar's Revenge, or Dead Men Tell No Tales depending what country you are in.Whilst I wouldn't go so far as to say I liked it. I didn't hate it when it was released. Today I found it a real chore to sit through.This movie represents a perfect example of what is wrong with movies these days 
a half-baked casserole of recycled elements from past installments of the franchise tossed together with lackluster action sequences and gratuitous special effects. like so many summer blockbusters, this is designed to deliver a momentary adrenaline jolt while providing audiences with a few familiar characters and elements. If it's the characters that keep film-goers coming back, Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow is the character most (if not over 90%) of the audience turn up to see.Captain Jack does not turn up until after 20 minutes. By which point I had considered turning it off twice. Depp who was paid $55.5 million for his role in the fourth movie, netted himself a pay rise as he was paid £60 million approx ($78 million). But (much like Sly Stallone in Rocky V) he seems to have totally forgotten how to play Captain Jack. Instead he seems to be doing a drunken impression. This is a totally different Captain Jack than the one we met 14 years ago!!The douche Paul McCartney has a pointless cameo which he was no doubt paid a fortune for.Salazar's Revenge, grossed $172 million at the domestic box office to end the year to 18th highest grossing movie of 2017. So domestically it was the worst performing pirate movie, by quite some distance.The film was a financial success worldwide, grossing $794 million, to end the year the 11th highest grossing movie of 2016 worldwide. The 10 movies above it, are a sad indictment of today's tastes. Every movie is a superhero, remake or sequel.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fresh blood,"Here we go again, part 5 of the most successful pirate series ever. The best moment was the confrontation of the old captains, when Geoffrey Rush (Barbossa) is trying to make a deal with Javier Bardem (Salazar). Every look they give each other is a statement, here are two captains of the same caliber, don't ever turn your back on either of us... Johnny Depp, well, has he been better than in the first part in any of the sequels? He does his usual routine. Brenton Thwaites as Henry and Kaya Scodelario as the astronomer (!) Carina really keep the action going, frankly I didn't miss Bloom and Knightley that much. The movie has a few weaknesses, from the fight at the bottom of the ocean (just to show off where the money for the effects went, but the audience never believes it is real) to silly jokes (I just say 'horologist', ouch!).But all in all, 'Salazar's Revenge' aka 'Dead Men Tell No Tales' is a good movie to finish the series. They brought some fresh blood in front of the camera (the two young main actors) as well as behind it (two new directors), so you never get a feeling of watching someone flogging a dead horse. I voted 9-8-6-7-7 for the 5 movies of the series.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Ship of Ghouls,"(RATING: ☆☆☆½ out of 5 )GRADE: B-THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Entertaining but predictable, one need not jump ship on this film series...yet!SYNOPSIS: Supernatural forces again plague Captain Jack Sparrow on his 6th voyage to misadventures.JIM'S REVIEW: In the sixth installment of this profitable film franchise, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales, the McGuffin of its treasure hunt, besides trying to locate a good idea in its overly busy script, is a mysterious object called The Trident of Poseidon, which can undo any curse. A fine premise, but all this movie really does is undo any logical sense in a convoluted ho-hum plot. It's a series of fun-filled mishaps (with some fun) that involve our pirate anti-hero once again, namely Captain Jack Sparrow. Played by Johnny Depp, his role is more of the same...drunken stupor and slurred diction with comic pratfalls. Mr. Depp's colorful character is losing some of the charm in a performance that once was imbued with a twinkle of wit, a major asset in previous installments. But it is still diverting enough to entertain.Pursuing Capt. Jack on this voyage are a ship of ghouls, led by a vengeful walking dead Captain Salazar (Javier Bardem). Mr. Bardem's interpretation of this worthy foe saves this sinking ship. That, and the excellent CGI of a ghostly crew from the netherworld with assorted animated zombie-like sharks and birds help to make this nonsense more tolerable than it need be.Also back on board is Geoffrey Rush as the crafty Barbossa, who delivers some nice moments along with Kaya Scodelario and Brenton Thwaites as the young lovers (substituting for the aging Keira Knightly and Orlando Bloom, and minus their star power).The film retains strong production values that one has seen and expected from this big budget series. Even if the direction by Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandburg is serviceable, and at times, rather inventive, the script by Jeff Nathanson (Four other screenwriters are credited with the story.) is just too formulaic and predictable. What was once an imaginative jaunt, especially on its first two adventures, is now become slightly tedious and monotonous in its execution. The action, which is non-stop, has an unfocused look, both in its plot and photography by Paul Cameron. Sometimes the film relies on too many close-ups which undercuts the action and its action sequences need some editing and better staging. (A couple of major rewrites wouldn't have hurt either.)Back in 2003, the original film was the result of a popular ride at Disney World and it gave the movie-going audience a wonderful adrenaline rush. This latest reincarnation resembles a frenzied loud cinematic ride, an apparition of its former self that only tires and rarely inspires. Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales may still have interesting tales to tell. But on this voyage, the story telling needed to follow a better course.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
To hell with the codex!,"Pirates of the Caribbean all movies are good. But as practice shows:

Absolute Redemption for those still open to the series,"Sometimes initial reviews, especially those of the critics can shape the psyche of a movie goer. I would even go as far to say that some movies have been severely limited on the economical upside due to these preliminary reviews. The best example of this I can think of is a movie called 47 Ronin. I believe it came out at 9% on Rotten tomatoes and absolutely panned by overseas critics. I make no claim that 47 Ronin was a fantastic movie, but after being destroyed at the box office, and failing miserably (financially), the IMDb score eventually started to climb to a much more suitable value in time. A lot of effort went into that movie, but it never stood a chance.A rotten tomatoes rating somewhere in the 20's for this Pirates instalment is absolutely asinine. It has already influenced those ready to smash the 1/10 button to find reasons to do so.We did not see this movie immediately due to the initial reviews, and the defensive nature of the positive reviews (of which there were several). Many positive reviewers would defend their position as ""simply fans of the series"". Not a fantastic endorsement to say the least.I am not a fan of the series. I was a fan of the first movie. It was a clean, linear story line with fantastic character acting, hilarious engaging dialogue and some great action. The best part was the element of surprise. Nobody saw it coming and even large skeptics left the theatres with big smiles. After that Jack Sparrow turned into Homer Simpson. Far less effort in his schemes and dialogue sets. Mainly just random situations with a whole lot of babbling and flailing. The writers assumed the mere sights and sounds of Jack were enough. Although the graphics and action remained quite good, the content was just so much weaker. The story lines became bizarre, and not in a good way. There was constant filler, with emphasis on weaker characters trying to act out stronger roles. And I could go on.This movie needed not attempt to recreate the first story, as the element of surprise was gone. What it desperately needed was an overhaul in content. The desire to make the writing, visuals and acting make us enjoy the movie, not the expectation established characters will do it regardless of content. At first it may have seemed like another random story thrown together so Homer Simpson (Jack) can bumble around for another 2 hours. This seemed particularly apparent during the first phase of the movie. I even found myself assuming that the reviews were likely to be more accurate. A tiny bit of patience and an open mind prevailed as the movie immediately took off after one particular scene. I would say this scene was a perfect representation of where this movie fits within the context of the series. There have been TONS of scenes of exactly this nature, but it was just done better. I went from being put off, to starting to chuckle, and it did not stop there. The smile stayed on the face through the entirety as they added bit after bit of hilarity fuelled by attention to detail. I'd not felt as positive about a scene since the first movie. From there the movie alternated contextual scene, to action scene (similar to the first), where the scenes for context were absolutely hilarious and the action scenes were consistently effective. The sheer effort placed into the dialogue of this movie was exactly what I was looking for. The volume of comedy (often fuelled simply by the dialogue) far outweighed scenes of suspense or drama. Even with that said, when called upon, the power house actors of this movie really made you feel what they wanted.Was this the first Pirates all over again? Of course not! But it was an absolute redemption of something I did not think they could pull off. As it stacks up, I feel this movie and the first pirates instalment are a little bit different. Character development and story were paramount in making the first Pirates so successful. I wouldn't describe the first as a single genre, but a blend of so many. No doubt this instalment is also a blend, but I could much more comfortably describe this as a comedy. That is not to say that it didn't have fantastic scenes full of action, suspense, and even drama as well.Those with an open mind will find this to be a wildly entertaining movie and score it highly. A handful may even see this as rival to the first. After all, it is much harder to write the extra content for a movie where all the characters are developed.If you are mentally checked out, or rolling your eyes at the thought of more Jack Sparrow, I highly doubt you will feel the way I feel about this flick.I simply wish there had been more of this kind of review a few weeks ago to balance the ratings and perhaps get more people out to the theatres. After all, I have suddenly found myself hoping they make another Pirates!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Could have been better,"This movie really didn't add to the series like I had hoped. Having loved the first three Pirates of the Caribbean movies, when I watched On Stranger Tides, I was disappointed. I had hoped they would continue where they left off at end of The World's End. This movie had lots of scenes that were too much to the point of no credibility in them. Jack Sparrow was nothing compared to the character he was in all the other films. The sets, the makeup and the cgi are all top notch as well as the music. The acting and the overall plot line were disappointing in keeping up with the rest of the series.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The ship has well and truly sailed for Pirates of the Caribbean,"Pirates of the Caribbean has done very well for itself, considering it's a franchise that came about from the popularity of a theme park ride at Disneyland. Taking plenty of money at the box-office over the four films so far, the fifth film, Dead Men Tell No Tales or Salazar's Revenge here in the UK (annoyingly) has been unleashed in cinemas. Could it provide the franchise with a much needed energy boost after the underwhelming On Stranger Tides?When Captain Salazar (Javier Bardem) escapes from the Devil's Triangle, he sets about getting revenge on Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), the man who caused Salazar and his crew to perish and remain cursed. With the help of Henry Turner (Brenton Thwaites) and Carina Smyth (Kaya Scodelario), Jack Sparrow must search the seas for the legendary Trident of Poseidon, a powerful artifact that gives whoever is in possession power over the seas.I don't really no why but I went into Salazar's Revenge with a sense of optimism that it would provide the franchise its best film since The Curse of the Black Pearl some fourteen years ago. Unfortunately the result is a film that feels as uninspired as the previous entry. I suppose the warning signs of franchise fatigue were there but this should have been a much better film than it turned out.Back when Pirates of the Caribbean began, it was a simple film that blew people away with how entertaining and fresh it all felt. As the franchise has gone on though, the films have become weighed down with too many plot points and a feeling of staleness that makes for a more dreary experience as a viewer.Where Salazar's Revenge makes its biggest mistake is with the narrative. Don't get me wrong, this is a pretty simple story however, they try to chuck in subplots that just feel so forced that it doesn't allow the audience to connect emotionally with either the characters or the narrative properly. Decisions like that always feel to me as if they made them as they were making the film and would have been better left to remain as an idea.A major strength of the franchise has been the stellar visual effects and, while they are still mostly impressive here, there are certain points where it looks unfinished and cheap. Salazar himself just looks ghastly in comparison with the magnificent work on Davy Jones earlier in the franchise. They do aid the action sequences immensely mind, even if there is only one really imaginative sequence that comes right at the start of the film. Just a shame that they don't make the most of having zombie sharks and that the finale is really dull.One of the other major strengths of these films is the riveting score that has accompanied each and every film. That is no different in Salazar's Revenge as Geoff Zanelli composes a score that captures the swashbuckling essence of the film rather well. I will always hum along to the main theme as it plays over the end credits.Coming to the performances, Salazar's Revenge sees Johnny Depp once again lazily play the character that has done so much for his career. It doesn't help that Sparrow is now written as a man who just falls over and screams all of the time but Depp couldn't look more unenthused if he tried. I can't even say Geoffrey Rush was a highlight in this one because even he looks as if he's given up on the film. Javier Bardem makes a valiant effort to make it feel as if there is actually something at stake in this film with his villainous turn as Salazar however, it's nothing that will be remembered.I was actually surprised at how much I took to the new characters portrayed by Brenton Thwaites and Kaya Scodelario. I haven't really seen much of either before but I found myself more interested in what their respective characters were getting up to. Fourteen years ago I would have said Jack Sparrow is a character I can't wait to see more but now I wouldn't mind if they got rid of him totally. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley both return a full ten years after their last appearances as Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann, Bloom getting a little more screen time whereas Knightley feels a little shoehorned in at the end, which feels a bit disrespectful seeing as she was one of the main characters of the original trilogy.Pirates of the Caribbean: Salazar's Revenge is luckily not the worst film of the franchise, an honour still held by On Stranger Tides. What it is though is a lacklustre effort that shows the world that the ship has well and truly sailed for this particular franchise.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A notable effort of approximating the glorious early days of the franchise.,"Exciting, thrilling and very funny, the fifth installment of our beloved franchise, comes with the great burden to clean up the mess that ''On Stranger Tides'' evoked and restore the greatness of Pirates of the Caribbean. The plot is very interesting and arouses immediately the attention of the viewer with a villain that can easily be compared even to the great Davy Jones. The introduction of Will Turner's son is also a pleasant and mysterious addendum to the plot. Johnny Depp although satisfactory finds himself struggling to imitate his old self, with jokes and facial expressions which are rather played out and don't manage to shock the audience. In addition, the visual effects seemed quite fake, giving me the impression I was watching an animation movie in certain scenes. Despite these weaknesses, the movie was fascinating and moving. Totally worth watching, although everyone can agree that the first three installments will never be counterbalanced.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Another Addition To The Franchise That Nobody Gives A Damn About Anymore,"Another unnecessary addition to the franchise that already sailed into the sunset on a satisfactory note a decade ago, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales is the fifth instalment in the series nobody gives a damn about anymore, tries so hard to be funny that it's actually pitiful, and fails to move an inch off the seabed after On Stranger's Tides sunk it in such spectacular fashion.Set 5 years after the events of the last movie, Dead Men Tell No Tales finds Captain Jack Sparrow being pursued by an undead sea captain & his crew after he unwittingly sets them free. Joined by Henry Turner, an astronomer & an old friend-foe, all on board with agendas of their own, his only hope of survival lies in seeking the trident of Poseidon, a powerful artifact that would grant him control of the seas.Directed by Joachim Rønning & Espen Sandberg, the film lifts its plot outline from the first entry in the saga yet is devoid of all the elements that turned it into an instant classic right away. Direction is poor as the plot feels repetitive, convoluted & bloated. Writing is just as bad, for the returning characters have got nothing to add while the new characters are more or less hopeless and have no meat on their arcs.A number of scenes pay homage to earlier entries of this series but they don't mean much because just like everything in the movie, it feels forced as if slapped on to the narrative just for the sake of it instead of contributing in any meaningful manner. Despite running at 129 minutes, which makes it the shortest entry in the series, the film feels overlong & bloated, thanks to its lazy editing. And the background score isn't any different this time.Coming to the performances, the returning cast of Johnny Depp, Geoffrey Rush & Kevin McNally, in addition to Orlando Bloom & Keira Knightley, reprise their respective roles while new additions include Javier Bardem, Brenton Thwaites & Kaya Scodelario who play Captain Salazar, Henry Turner & Carina Smyth respectively. And yet, there isn't one performance in the picture that stands out or leaves anything remotely resembling a positive impression.Depp's acting career has been on a downward spiral for a while now and even a return to his most iconic role fails to turn things around for him as Jack Sparrow in this instalment is more annoying than amusing. Rush condones to tag along with the circus for another easy check. Bardem is truly wasted in the role of Captain Salazar, while Thwaites & Scodelario are the new Bloom & Knightley in this soft reboot but neither their individual inputs nor their chemistry ever hits the right note.On an overall scale, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales is an unneeded instalment to the saga that was better off as a trilogy & shouldn't have been disturbed ever since. Incompetently directed, poorly scripted, lazily edited, awfully paced, terribly performed & marking the departure of Hans Zimmer from the franchise as well, there is just about nothing that works out in the film's favour. In the end, it's just as appalling as the previous entry, if not more, and needs to be put out of its misery. Just skip it.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Vidiot Reviews...,"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No TalesHistorically, pirates buried their fortunes in the holes of the nearest whorehouse.Real items of value, as confirmed by this adventure/fantasy, were hidden.To free his captive father (Orlando Bloom) from the Flying Dutchman's curse, Henry (Brenton Thwaites) must obtain Poseidon's Trident. But in order to pinpoint its whereabouts, he must first locate Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp).Meanwhile, an old adversary (Javier Bardem) from Jack's past has returned from the dead to exact his revenge as well as claim the three-pronged spear for him and his ill-fated crew.With pointless subplots and recurring characters thrown in to convolute the narrative, this fifth chapter in the seafaring franchise surpasses previous installments with ease. However that distinction doesn't mean that it's still not a bloated rehash of plot points with a derivative villain and a worn-out hero.Incidentally, it's more lucrative for pirates today to hijack a Backstreet Boy cruise ship.Yellow Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Same Procedure as Every Year,"To start with the conclusion: There is nothing wrong with ""Dead Man Tell No Tales"", but it feels like every other ""Pirates of the Caribean"" movie. Johnny Depp acts silly, there is a young couple which is constantly fighting but secretly in love, there is rivalry with Captain Barbossa, there is also an army ship searching for them and they are all chased by an evil ghost ship and it's ghost crew. You'll probably guessed it, all of them are chasing a mysterious artifact and that's about it with storytelling.Yeah, everybody is acting good especially Javier Bardem, but all characters are kind of one dimensional. I hated the character of Kaya Scodelario, even though she is very likable and beautiful. It's not her fault. The writers gave her exactly two characteristics: She is smart and she has boobs. The First one is mentioned and used as a joke way to often and for the latter, there are a way too much scenes focusing on her cleavage. Even the male me, was annoyed by that and kind of sad for Kaya Scodelario.

good,"In order to have a better look at Pirates of the Caribbean 5, I have reviewed the first four movies again these days. Classic is the classic, never tire of seeing it, the effect is excellent! The scene is really quite shocking! This kind of film still works in the cinema.
So is Johnny Depp, who has made captain Jack Sparrow live! We have to fight it out!

"A sad attempt at a ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movie","I am a big fan of the first ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movie. I really enjoy the character of Jack Sparrow and the action was amazing.This movie just made me feel sad, I thought that this was just a sad attempt at reviving what once was a fun movie.Let me talk about Jack Sparrow. Jack is one of my favourite characters in cinema. He is so clever although he looks stupid. In this movie he turned into a cartoon character. He just kinda goes with the flow and never does anything clever. He is supposed to look like a drunk failure although he is brilliant, in this movie, he is just a drunk failure.Also, this movie attempts to have a Will Turner-ish character and a Swann-ish character, and these two characters and their loves story suck in comparison to the original.The CGI sucks, I admit captain Salazar looks pretty cool, but the rest of the effects look really bad, specially the green screen. Also, WTF happened to captain Barbossa. He is dressed in some ridiculous clothes that looked terrible.Actually, this movie is a cartoon. The ""comedy"" is cringe-worthy slapstick with Sparrow doing some stupid sh*t. The sound effects are straight out of a Tom and Jerry episode.I really was expecting a bad movie, but I at least was expecting to be entertained by all the stupid sh*t. Oh not at all, this movie was actually pretty boring. I actually was nodding off in some of the ""big action sequences"".Don't see this movie, it will only make you miss the old one.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Hilarious movie. Great fun!,"Laughed so my stomach aced for hours. Recommended. The Captain is Back. Finally. And, sorry to say - for the last time..? Jack Sparrow. The way he walks and speaks is pure genius for a action/comedy. And also great to see the original cast back also. And Javier Bardem is never wrong for a movie. Thumbs up for this one!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not Bad,"Thrust into an all-new adventure, a down-on-his-luck Capt. Jack Sparrow feels the winds of ill-fortune blowing even more strongly when deadly ghost sailors led by his old nemesis, the evil Capt. Salazar, escape from the Devil's Triangle.

Waiting for Pirates of the Caribbean!,"Johnny Depp is my favorite Hollywood actor! he do best acting! When he do some roll then he puts his all efforts! I am his big fan. Pirates of the Caribbean is my favorite series. Dead Men Tell No Tales doesn't worry about building a trilogy of films (there is no cliffhanger) and takes the time to tell its own story on its own terms. The story is easy to follow (which is saying something for this series), the action isn't confusing, and the situations are often fun and funny. You can't say any of that about the previous sequel. Series newcomer Kaya Scodelario is a stand-out, and Javier Bardem does a fine job as the film's villain.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Sparrow and Spectacle in another unneeded (but not unwatchable) sequel,"Kudos to Pirates 5 for showing us a younger Jack Sparrow, for bringing back Will Turner, for adding some fresh young blood, and for Captain Salazar's (Bardem's) sizzling screen presence.As for Jack Sparrow, the franchise has left him behind. Sparrow is a puppet meant to be laughed at as the plot whirls him through various comedic scenario's (including a forced marriage at gun point). Sparrow is no longer a catalyst of the tale, he is a victim in it. As you watch, you get the hunch that Depp is so discontent with the franchise that he is deliberate trying to sabotage it though his performance. He is not even even speaking his lines, he is garbling them.And yet somehow the movie still gets by. If nothing else, it is an improvement over the inert and imagination-free Pirates 4. The set pieces are far more spectacular but still they are far from compelling. When it comes to the 'circus' aspects of the film, directors Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg are good with the set up but not the punchline. Frantic editing, and poor lighting render most of the action scenes disoritnenting.The first and final scenes of the movie are the strongest. They are centred around Will Turner's son who seeks to break his father from the curse of the Dutchman. This is the starting point for the film muddled plot which has a beginning and an end, but no middle.The character of Henry Turner, and his 'girl to be' Carina, bring a hint of something that was missing in the last film; a sense of character purpose. He seeks to free his father, and she to find the map in the stars from a clue that her father left behind. If only the film has given them a little more time. Other highlights of the film include a flashback to the origins of Sparrows rivalry with Salazar's Barbossa's brimming new beard / hairstyle combo, as well as a cute cameo by an almost unrecognizable Paul McCartney.And then the film ends on the kind of note that is perfect, and very much needed, The kind that brings resolution to it's characters and does not cry out for another sequel.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Stale, but fun.","Unlike most people I've heard voice opinion on this flick, I enjoyed myself watching this. The unfortunate fact of the matter is the Pirates franchise is no longer quality cinema as the first and arguably second films were... Heck, even the third film had moments of cinematic brilliance. The fourth entry was a huge visual drop off and plot-wise was a mediocre filler episode with some mildly entertaining chemistry between Sparrow and his female counterpart.It had become clear the plot was leaning toward pirate lore rather than a clear arc or saga route. Whereas the initial trilogy was reminiscent of the Star Wars original trilogy in structure and tone, the more recent entries don't even attempt to articulate a grand personal journey like the aforementioned franchise's prequel escapade.Immediately I think this Pirates movie stands out from the last one. A strange decision made in one of the earlier films immediately comes to a head, and I was hooked. But then we are treated to an evolution of familiar characters that took me off guard. I was wondering since the second film how this universe would survive with the evolution of its setting, and now we are seeing my question play out... it's not so pretty. In a way, as a prelude to the aforementioned franchise's similar story this year, this depiction of that core element is far more satisfying, despite being in far less demand.I was surprisingly invested in these new characters. The female lead is genuinely charismatic, but the bland male lead only manages to be interesting because of his back story, which is briefly detailed in the intro scene as a fantastic hook. Some of the story progressions of these characters are to roll eyes at, but I think it works. Just barely.Visually, this film is far superior to the Black Beard adventure last time around. Visuals are always a highlight of these films, but this time it was THE highlight. Not particularly imaginative, but serviceable and immersive.The pacing is a little wobbly, like the sadly predictable at this point Jack Sparrow, who is pitiful in this film. That's not a spoiler so much as fair warning. If you go to see these movies to see Jack Sparrow, don't bother. He's moderately entertaining, but a point is made of his devolution. I found that entertaining in its own right, but all short of former glory. I don't think Jack would be as entertaining as everyone thinks he'd be if he were still the wild card he once was in every film, so I appreciate his character having a trajectory that at least resembles an arc, even if it's the opposite of one of those.The tone is par for the course. I didn't regret seeing this movie, but I do wish I could have had my way with this plot line, even as an amateur inexperienced writer. There was some missed opportunity.Which brings me to the strange surreal ending of this movie. It seems like this movie could have been two, and more epic if it were. But it works fine as one, and that's always been a complaint I think is useless. It seems weird and rushed that this thread is set up and wrapped up in one film.There were two parts to the ending, one I liked but thought was rushed and not unsatisfying but less satisfying than it should have been, and the other one I thought was totally wrong and slightly infuriating... but understandable as decision all things considered.Overall, not bad, not good. It was fun. It wasn't boring. But it is a far cry from the bombastic epic film-making classics the initial trilogy films are. It is not exciting or exhilarating anymore, it's a mindless popcorn flick with some personality injected into it. It's average. That's kinda sad, but I'm okay with it. If some people aren't, I understand. I loved this series too, and I wish it could somehow recapture its former glory. But all good things must come to pass. No great film streak lasts forever. You either die a hero, or live long enough to - you get the idea.It could be so much worse than it is, honestly. I'm seriously okay with solid b-grade movies over the series dying out or becoming a monster of its former self like other franchises we've seen live this long or longer. Look at Star Wars... took a nose dive with The Last Jedi. Look at Fast and Furious. Look at Transformers. Streaks of high grossing easy money cash in crap shoot franchise Hollywood machine cancer with no signs of slowing down. I'm totally fine with coherent, inoffensive, mildly entertaining b-movies.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Better than all the other sequels,but still not enough","After the 1st movie,this was certainly the most entertaining of the franchise.The runtime is less,the pacing was good,great visuals(no surprises),and of course,it had Johny Depp. But still I couldn't get completely satisfied with this movie and its nowhere as good as the 1st movie.May be because this franchise has run its course and I have become exhausted watching the same thing again and again.Still it was far better than the sluggish ""At world's end"".Overall,its neither amazing nor its an absolute trash pile",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A welcome guest for the summer,"The review for the latest installment of the PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN film franchise is fairly simple - did you enjoy the other Pirates movies (or at least one of them?).  If you did, then you'll enjoy this one.  It is a very well made - and faithful in tone, style and content - entry in this long running franchise.Fortunately for me, I enjoy these films, so I had a great time in the cinema - enjoying a film equivalent of comfort food.Once again, Johnny Depp is back - and in his element - as rogue pirate CAPTAIN JACK SPARROW.  Depp knows this character well and plays him with a major wink in his eye always bringing him to (but never going over) the line of caricature - keeping Jack a person and not a cartoon (not an easy thing to accomplish).Directors Joachim Ronning and Espen Sandberg (best known for the TV show MARCO POLO) and screenwriter Jeff Nathanson (CATCH ME IF YOU CAN) - do a very smart thing.  They know that a little of Captain Jack goes a long way, so - even though he is central to the story - they use Sparrow sparingly throughout so when he is on screen creating havoc, you enjoy his hi-jinks as opposed to getting sick of them.Consequently, the core of this film must fall to someone else - and it falls to the very capable hands of Geoffrey Rush (back as Barbossa) and Javier Bardem (as the bad guy in this tale - Captain Salazar, seeking revenge).  Both of these veteran actors commands the screen when they are front and center with Rush, especially, taking charge in a character he knows very, very well.Add to these two the obligatory ""young loves"", played (this time) by Brendan Thwaites (MALIFICENT) and Kaye Scodelario (The MAZE RUNNER films).  They more than hold their own when the weight of the story shifts to them, with Scodelario rising above - she is an actress to keep an eye on.And...of course...we have the regular ""rogues gallery"" of Pirates - bringing back old favorites Gibbs (Kevin McNally), Scrum (Stephen Graham), Marty (Martin Klebba) and even the monkey - Jack.  All welcome returnees.  There also are two other characters from earlier Pirates' films that show up (but telling you who this is would spoil it) and a very nice cameo by a major Rock Icon who plays Jack Sparrow's Uncle Jack.  A totally needless and throwaway cameo, but fun and welcome nonetheless.Kind of like this film - it's like eating a juicy piece of watermelon on a warm summer's day.  A welcome and tasty treat.Letter Grade:  B+8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not bad,"To be honest, I did not want to see this movie because the last two were so boring and confusing. But Dead Man Tell No Tales was not as bad as I expected. In fact, it was better than the last two. The plot was good enough, though it did not really improve upon its predecessors . But it was not confusing. And there's a plot twist at about 2/3 of the movie. At first I thought that twist would not matter, but eventually became important to finish the film.(Not going to tell you). The visuals were stunning. I think this one has the best images of the 5 films. The ending scene was incredible. The worst part about this movie was probably character building. Jack and Salazar are supposed to be the main characters, but DMTNT focused entirely on Henry Turner and the scientist(Forgot her name).And the actor who played Henry just could not act. But who cares, the main actress(scientist) was so hot. In overall, POTC 5 was an entertaining film, and will be a suitable film to enjoy this weekend.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"The re-animated corpse of a pirates film. All the hallmarks, with none of the soul.","I watched this for the second time about a week ago, and a week later its impression still lingers on me like bad breath, enough to take the time to leave a review. There were lots of thoughts and examples that came to mind while watching it, but I can't bring myself to re-watch just for this, so here's what I remember.The 4th was bad, but this one misses everything that worked about the original trilogy, and is completely creatively redundant. At best, it feels like a bad SNL parody. At worst, it's some young kids playing and pretending they're in a Pirates movie.Jack is not Jack. He's supposed to be a genius *playing* the fool, who always manages to cleverly bend situations to his favour and get out of sticky situations based on his quick wit, charm and negotiating skills. He always has the upper hand even when his back's against the wall. In this, he's just a fool. A genuinely pathetic drunk, who uncomfortably letches over young girls undressing, and gets out of situations based on luck or the actions of others. Things happen *to* him, rather than because of his actions, which is never a good basis for a main character. Literally none of his lines land; I think I laughed at one maybe, but I can't remember what it was. The writers just don't understand him. A perfect example of this is the retconning of items jack carries on him (the hair beads, reindeer shin bone, decking material? Etc). These are supposed to hint at a rich backstory of the great adventures of Captain Jack Sparrow - and add to the world-building. It made the character more 3-dimensional. What on earth was he doing when he managed to pick up a reindeer shin bone? Where was he? Does it hold particular personal significance to him? Trinkets and souvenirs built up over a life exploring the seas. Nope. Some sailors he didn't really know gave him all of it at the same time, and his outfit hasn't changed at all since. Brilliant 👏All of the clever writing, verbosity and intelligent humour is gone. There's so many well-crafted lines I can easily reel off from the originals: ""allow me to lend a machete to your intellectual thicket"" etc etc which gave a beautiful poetic quality. You only need check the imdb 'quotes' page to see all the awful writing here; ""'I'm the son of Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann' 'Eww - you're the evil spawn of them two'"". What?? This reads like a highschooler's (bad) attempt at writing a Pirates fanfic. This isn't his vernacular, and is completely out of character; he is very fond of Will and Elizabeth, and we're given no reason why he wouldn't extend that to their son. ""Does mummy ever ask about me? Does she call my name in her sleep?"" WTF? Who is this for? Why is he saying this stuff to her son?? Much of the script is written this way - taking the place of the witty repartee and intellectual besting we had before.Depp was obviously going through some personal stuff at the time, and was working with the awful script, but his characterisation needs mentioning as well. Another review put it that he's acting Mad Hatter while dressed as Jack Sparrow, which I think hits the nail on the head. The strange affected voice and general demeanour didn't feel like Jack - he's lost all his cool.The complex, 3-dimensional, sympathetic villains of the past are replaced with one that, despite having a great actor, is painfully one-note. Barbossa just wanting to live and experience life again; wanting to feel. Davy Jones, a lover scorned and bitter, who cut out his heart, rather than suffer the agony of heartbreak. Even the dynamic between him (a fearsome, mythical sea creature) and Beckett (an equally formidable foe with his political power and leverage) is fascinating. Salazar: 'Pirates bad. Must get revenge. Jack Thhhparrow'.Apparently 'Sparrow' isn't even his name now? Salazar mentioned it to a crewmate shortly before dying, so how did Jack ever find out about the name to use it? And how does Salazar know it ever caught on, or expect others to know and use it when saying 'Do you know Jack Sparrow?'? And why does everything need retconning? Why can't that just be his name?Lazy retconning of the compass, which again, doesn't remotely work. Giving it up frees the pirates, even though Jack's given it up in the past?They completely missed the point of the celebrity cameo as a relative. Keith Richards was in the third and fourth because Johnny Depp modelled. Jack. After. Him. This meant Keith was naturally a good fit tonally and stylistically, and his inclusion was a fitting tribute to the inspiration for Depp's character. Their similarities made the father-son relationship plausible and bedded-in. They added the cameo because they wanted Keith Richards, not the other way around. Paul McCartney is in the fifth because.... they wanted a cameo, and attempted to replicate the 'formula' with any musician from the same era? His short appearance, complete with Liverpudlian accent, is entirely jarring, gimmicky, and takes you even further out of an already bad movie - for the sake of 'hey, I recognise that guy' and a bad joke about a delayed hanging. What does it add? Real smooth brain stuff.They bring back Davy Jones in a post-credit, even though he clearly and unambiguously died in the third. Add to that, breaking the trident was supposed to destroy all curses, yet Jones still appears in all his tentacled glory? The writers are not just tarnishing previous world-building, but actively destroying their own, in the sake of meaningless fan service.Even the cinematography is terrible; the whole thing looks like it's shot on a soundstage under studio lights. Everything's too clean and 'hollywood'. Compare that to the originals where you felt you could smell the rotting fish on board the Dutchman, Barbossa's bad breath or the salt-water of the Maelstrom. It was so tangible and immersive. Rich and visceral. The fact it was all so grimy, gritty and 'real' is a big part of why I think the franchise was successful. It was exciting and different.There are countless more examples I could write about, especially if I bothered to re-watch, but I've made my case.Normally I think film reviews are subjective, and can usually understand where someone is coming from, even if I don't agree. This film is as close to objectively bad as I think you can get. I genuinely don't understand the positive reviews. It's such a blatant cash-grab, and a genuine insult to market it under the same title as the original trilogy. Nothing about it works.People are quick to say ""Pirates won't be Pirates without Depp"", but that's only half the picture. We had him in this and it definitely wasn't Pirates. Pirates won't be Pirates until they bring back Verbinski, Elliot and Rossio. Pay them $300M and 1M alpacas each!The VFX were reasonable.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An Honest Review,"It was a lot better than the 3rd installment, it was more memorable than the bulk of the 4th...but there are issues.The charm of the original two is missing and Jack seems worn down and not nearly as much fun as he was in past installments.He seemed to go from the lovable scoundrel that Forest Gumps his way through the 7 seas, to just, well, to just a drunkard.Lets hope in the next one we get the charm and fun back, rather than a paint by numbers installment with a less than fun Sparrow.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
More of the same...,I didn't have great expectations for this movie and of course I wasn't disappointed. For some reason it felt like more of the same but more boring...

"'Here's an idea, how about a good old-fashioned stoning? I'd kill to be stoned right now!'","The seemingly endless series of the Johnny Depp films PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN seems to be coming to an end with this 5th installment. For fourteen years this tale has been on screen, television, video games, Halloween costumes etc and this latest version – DEAD MEN TELL NO TALES – seems to have a prescient subtitle! The story is more reflective this time round (we see the initial seeds for the series as we face the past), most of the cast members remain (if only for a brief moment for some like Kiera Knightly and Orlando Bloom), some fresh actors enter (such as the very welcome Brenton Thwaites and Kaya Scodelario), the mainstay actors remain (Johnny Depp, Javier Bardem, Geoffrey Rush et al), and the newest aspect is the increasing imposing use of CGI graphics.But on to the story as written by Jeff Nathanson based on characters created by Terry Rossio, Ted Elliot, Stuart Beattie and Jay Wolpert and directed by Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg. Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) searches for the trident of Poseidon while being pursued by an undead sea captain Captain Salazar (Javier Bardem) and his crew and finds the winds of ill-fortune blowing even more strongly when deadly ghost pirates led by his old nemesis (Captain Salazar) escape from the Devil's Triangle, determined to kill every pirate at sea...including him. Captain Jack's only hope of survival lies in seeking out the legendary Trident of Poseidon, a powerful artifact that bestows upon its possessor total control over the seas.Oh, there is more detail to the tale and the actors employed are excellent. Nigel Phelps designed the production, Paul Cameron is in charge of cinematography and the musical score is by Geoff Zanelli. The movie is a bit long in tooth (a slow excess of two hour) and for the most part the CGI effects are the stars, but for those addicted to the Pirates series this final (hopefully) version will satisfy. For others it is a visual hallucinatory delight.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A Dip in Quality but Satisfying Conclusion,"Salazar's Revenge/Dead Men Tell No Tales doesn't quite pack the punch that the original Pirates trilogy does, it's probably on par with its predecessor. Whilst there is a jump in CGI quality (for the most part), and ties made with all previous films, a different approach is clearly taken.The big thing missing is the whimsy. There are little jokes and witty moments, but really Captain Jack doesn't have the same effect. This is by no means Depp's fault, who again is difficult to fault, as are the whole cast, but even the new pirates who have a couple of lines don't have the same effect as those before.Whilst previous films have toed the line along myth and legend, Salazar's Revenge does swing quite heavily towards a more superhero storyline, where you're half expecting Aquaman to turn up at times. That being said, the connections within the saga's arc are commendable. Sparrow is given an interesting origin (albeit with the shakier of the CGI), bloodlines are continued through main characters, and a conclusion to finish with which closes the book on at least a couple chapters (until the next one comes out...)It's not as fun, the new secondary duo are just as irritating as the first, but really it finishes Pirates of well. If you've watched the rest, it's well worth seeing.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Jack Sparrow was a spectator!,"The character we learned to love with the previous movies is absolutely DESTROYED in this movie. Jack Sparrow feels like an empty shell - a simple spectator barely reacting to his surrounding.

Forget about his clever-ish clumsiness, it's gone!I truly think Johnny Depp could've been much better if he had the right tools (decent writing/director) to expend his personality and his story that we love!",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Back where it belongs,"14 years ago I was in the cinema with my family. Although being only 10 years old at the time, I still remember like it was yesterday, the first time I met Captain Jack Sparrow.Since then, I've been an eager fan and attended every Pirates of the Caribbean screening. However, I must admit that it has been downhill since the Curse of the Black Pearl. Until today. Today I attended an early premiere of Dead Men Tell No Tales, curious about whether my fellow Norwegians, Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg, would manage to take the saga back where it belongs. And I am proud to say, they have pulled it off.Throughout the movie there are numerous exciting scenes with a perfect mix of action and humorous dialogue (especially from Jack Sparrow, who finally got the script he deserves). Also, Javier Bardem was as frightening as only he can be, playing the villain, Capitan ""Salamander"".In contrast to the forth movie, where I was yawning half way through, looking at the clock, I did not take my eyes off the screen once during this one. Even though the final sequence of the movie was a bit cheesy and could have been executed better, this was overall a great movie, and I'm sure the billions of marketing spent on promoting it will be well worth it!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The new characters , Henry and Carina , wasn't that cool at all i felt like they are low budget actors.Finally , the villain , Captain Salazar , i feel like he didn't get a full chance they could divided the movie to two parts so they can give every story it's right "" before and after his death"" , i guess if he got enough time he would play it better , although he did good. The only good thing was Barbossa , Geoffrey Rush did the job as usual .

"Where is the real gold, and how to get hold of it. Some inspiration from reality.","Quite a few cast here that we saw in earlier instalments. So, I suggest we make the next PoC movies a lot more realistic. Where is the gold ? Do bank notes matter ? I absolutely love how American fellows dislodged whole ATM machines in US 24/7 stores. Very cool. But I don't think you can spend that money. That money becomes worthless the moment the ATM disappears. That's how banks did it. Putting millions of dollars in plain sight. And you can't even steal that money. So that plot won't work for the next PoC instalments. Next try. Burn a giant heap of central bank notes, like the baddie Joker does in a late Batman movie. Won't work, either. The central bank can just reprint the bank notes. You really have to get hold of the central bank's gold. They can't reprint gold. Another PoC plot that wouldn't make any sense. Gosh. So where is the gold ? Most central banks have gold. And some of them are quite massive. Just follow countries' conscription practices. Forcing young people into military serfdom against their will. That's usually a sign that they are protecting gold. Singapore, Israel and Russia conscript young people for not just one but two years. (While other countries cap murder sentences at two years.) Anyway. That's where you start digging. Singapore eventually became the secret hiding place of the 1200s Great Kahns. Otherwise known as Golden Horde. They financed the entirety of Asia. How inspiring is that ? Shouldn't that make an awesome PoC sequel ? Anyway. Singapore. They invest in mobile manufacturers all over Asia, from South Korea to Uzbekistan, across 3,000 miles. That tiny conscripting city state. It's possible that you won't find their hiding places for the gold. Instead, you need to find out who knows about the gold. If you feel your guess is good enough, you must kidnap their family. For ransom. What a plot that would become for the new PoC movie. Also, we would see how it would play out. How far would you go as a kidnapper ? Because, of course, the central bank acquintances will insist that they know nothing. It's not gonna be nice on their families. Probably a 16 rating. But those inner central bank circles really got too close to governments. The new movie needs to be honest, here.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

..good enough but lags compared to previous ones.,"I have my peculiar favorites when it comes to movie series. The 'Pirates of the Caribbean' series lies among my favorites.After the first movie the graph improved and stayed better until the fourth movie. The fifth movie however is the one where I endured a little set back.The fantasy factor has allured me throughout the series. In the fifth movie however trident related with all the wizardry existing in the sea is broken. Does that mean fantasy factor will be lost? It is thus the reason why I disliked that part.Final Verdict: Being one of the series I follow, a good enough movie to add to ones collection.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Jack Sparrow like we are used to see him.,"What is not to like about a Pirates of the Caribbean movie? Dead Men Tell No Tales is the fifth movie of Pirates of the Caribbean, and probably not the last. If you liked the ones before you probably will like this one as well. You have to have an open mind though, it's just fantasy. Most of the action scenes are just overexagerated but that's just how those movies are. If you can't get over it you should just not watch them. To me it's a good movie for a lazy sunday afternoon. The CGI's are like always very good. Johnny Depp plays the usual Captain Sparrow, a most of the time drunk pirate that has no fear of dying or at least he always acts nonchalant about it. All the movies are like this and I don't see why they should change the concept. I'm ready for the sixth Pirates of the Caribbean. Bring it on!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Jack Sparrow takes back his fame in Pirates of Caribbean : Dead Men Tell No Tales,"I have seen the premier of the movie ""Pirates of Caribbean : Dead Men Tell No Tales"". Being a fan of captain Jack Sparrow and the Pirates of Caribbean movies, since 2003, i had better expectation when I started seeing the movie.I won't tell you a lot of details in the case you haven't already seen the movie so I don't spoil the surprise.Captain Jack Sparrow, played by the famous Johnny Depp, more funny and more aventurous than ever had a good impact on the movie, in which he was hunted by his former enemies. The movie soundtrack was very good and amplified the atmosphere. The 3D effects weren't amazing, but the characters and the action of the movie worth the money, because it all went great.The mix of the elements of science fiction with action that takes place in the times that pirates rule the sea of Caribbe can't fit better then in this movie. In this movie the science fiction elements fit like a glove with the rest of the movie.The story is very good with Salazar's revenge and I am sure that Jack's Sparrow unfortune will never end by the way things are going.It is not the best Pirates of Caribbean movie, but it's definetly a movie worth seeing.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Awesome movie 'cos I don't trust negative reviews,"As always they say any movie that has the third or more sequels are never good. Well this one surprised me - it remained exciting.

A Solid Pirate Adventure,"It's been almost two years since this films release and about a year since I've had this film on DVD, yet I only now decided to watch it. I'd heard and read up on it, seeing all sorts of hate and saying it's a garbage film not worthy of the series. After watching it last night I have to say, what the hell are people talking about. Sure it's not perfect but it's still a damn good film with a lot of fun, action, and humor. I think the performances all around are good (yes even Johnny's despite what people say) and Javier Bardem as Salazar is fantastic. The plot is surprisingly straightforward which I definitely think is a plus, not once was I confused about what was happening or who a character was. The only real problem I have with the film is that Jack isn't his usual witty self, however that's not on Depp but more so how Jack's meant to be portrayed this time around. He's washed up, cursed with bad luck, and just depressed, so obviously he's gonna be a bit different. Overall though I really enjoyed the film, I didn't feel like it lagged at any point, and it's good summer time movie (I mean c'mon, it's pirates we're talking about here).",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
By Far the Worst of 5 Installments,"All of the dialogue is just to get you from A to B.None of the wittiness of the previous 4.The antagonist 'being released' by Jack 'giving away his compass' makes no sense - as he has before.They must of been trying to save money, as the CGI is sloppy compared to the first 4 - and kept as minimal as possible; to the point there is no reason to even have scenes like the antagonist attacking the pirate vessel upon release. The first 4 surely would have turned that into a spectacle. Instead we get ghost seagulls and a sloppy thing going on behind them; to which lasts all of 10 seconds.And don't get me started on the ever nauseating feminist tropes.(For the record - the great majority of 'witches killed' were women up to no good; with 'they're a witch!' simply being the explanation for simpletons. ""Women who were intelligent being punished"" has forever been a historical lie. I encourage all to read 'The Demon-Mania of Witches' by Jean Bodin for context, if they're interested in such subjects.)",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Swashbuckling Spirit, Mixed Results","Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales does a commendable job of capturing the adventurous spirit of the original films. The movie retains the franchise's signature blend of swashbuckling action and supernatural intrigue, delivering some entertaining moments that fans of the series will appreciate. Johnny Depp returns as Captain Jack Sparrow, bringing his signature charisma and eccentricity, which helps to maintain the film's connection to its roots.The production values are impressive, with visually striking sequences and a score that reinforces the franchise's iconic atmosphere. The addition of new characters and the continuation of existing storylines provide enough to keep the plot engaging, if somewhat familiar.However, the film has its share of shortcomings. The storyline often feels predictable and formulaic, lacking the freshness that made the earlier installments stand out. Some of the new characters, while well-cast, don't add much depth to the narrative. The pacing can also be uneven, with certain scenes dragging or feeling excessive.Overall, Dead Men Tell No Tales succeeds in delivering the adventurous spirit of its predecessors but struggles with a predictable plot and inconsistent pacing. It's a solid entry for fans of the series, offering just enough charm and excitement to be a worthwhile watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"No more tales, I beg you.","Pirates of the Caribbean was an excellent trilogy with three solid films. For those that doubted the sequels' quality, I give you this film to show how far the franchise has sunk. This film is a zombie with no understanding of how to portray its world nor its characters. It brings in new characters to fill the shoes of Will and Elizabeth and both are anything but interesting. Jack Sparrow is at his worst. While the film justifies it as him literally being at his lowest, they forget to bring him to his highest too. Johnny Depp is clearly phoning it in throughout the film. The film seriously seems to think Jack Sparrow is a loser and truly stupid too. It thinks pirates are all stupid. Those cunning swashbucklers from the old franchise? Gone. The new villains are boringly overpowered and yet lack any of the fright possessed by Barbaossa or Davy Jones, their ships, or crews. The only saving grace in this film is Barbossa's subplot but it still felt far too rushed. All mystery has been lost in this franchise' world and at this point, any world building feels tacked on and often contradicting of previous lore. We've already seen the heights of this franchise. A time of a compelling Jack Sparrow, formidable pirate nemesis, and exciting adventures waiting on the horizon. That time is over. Now, it's time for it to fade into legend. Let your ship rest, Disney. I beg you.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Rollicking good humorous film.,"Saw this film recently at cinema. As with all Pirates of the Caribbean films, Johny Depp is both witty and camp as Captain Jack Sparrow. All supporting cast are good, particularly Javier Bardem as Captain Salazar, and Geoffrey Rush as Captain Hector Barbossa. Deadly ghost pirates led by Sparrow's old nemesis, Captain Salazar escape from the Devil's Triangle determined to kill every pirate at sea, including Jack Sparrow.Jack Sparrow's only hope is to seek out the legendary Trident of Poseidon, which bestows its' possessor control over the sea. A monkey provides humour too. Good special effects and an enjoyable film all round. Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom are only in the film for the last moments generally...keep watching after the credits have rolled..there is a snippet of a visit to them by Davy Jones, who leaves wet barnacles on the floor beneath them..to set things up nicely for the next Pirates of the Caribbean...bring it on!",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Terrible from beginning to end.,"As a Pirates fan I was very disappointed in this movie. I think my least favorite thing was the female character. It was almost like she was trying way too hard to be a hero. I found her annoying and I noticed her chest was constantly exposed. I loved Kiera Knightly's character because she was so classy and did an amazing job and there was a good balance between her and the other characters. I hate how they depicted jack in this one. He is more of a womanizer than a bad ass pirate. There were too many sexual references as well which is not what pirates is about. One thing I loved about the first pirates was the fact that it felt realistic, pirates 5 felt more fantasy and fake. All together, I saw it once and would not see it again. I wish Hollywood would stop making movies based on feminism, sexual content, etc. just make good movies with substance!",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Pirates of the Caribbean: Salazar's Revenge,"If only we could recycle our waste as efficiently as Disney appear to be able to recycle this theme! Once again, we find ""Jack Sparrow"" (Johnny Depp) in a bit of bother from someone from his past. This time it is Javier Bardem (""Salazar"") who has escaped from his purgatory in the ""Devil's Triangle"" to avenge himself on his arch-enemy. Meantime, the young ""Henry Turner"" (Brenton Thwaites) seeks help to track down Poseidon's Trident which will empower him to take control of the seas, and to reunite with his father - the original ""Bootstrap"" (Orlando Bloom). There's no doubt that this is a great looking film, the effects are spectacular but the story is little better than a regurgitation of voyages gone by. The cuties that were Bloom and Kiera Knightley have been succeeded by the handsome, boyish Thwaites and his feisty astronomer pal ""Carina"" (Kaya Scodelario) but otherwise, it is another pretty formulaic prolongation of this colourful adventure franchise. It has some humour, there's a tiny cameo from Sir Paul McCartney that raises a smile (if only because you are never entirely sure if it is actually him); Geoffrey Rush still manages to inject oodles of charisma as ""Barbossa"", and Bardem offers a bit of menace - but Depp can only get away with that hail-fellow-well-met meets a drunk persona so often before he becomes a parody of his own characterisation. It's fun to watch, for a time, but after a while I was just bored. The format offers unlimited opportunity for fantasy and adventure, but maybe it is time for the ""Black Pearl"" to join the ""Queen Mary"" and HMY ""Britannia"" and just settle down as a respectable old lady of the sea - and a tourist attraction!",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I liked it more than I thought I would!,"I liked it more than I presumed. To my utter astonishment, it fared much better than the past few installments of the series and that includes the last two iterations of Verbinski's original trilogy. I am sure, I will now be getting a dozen frowning eyes gaping upon me and my judgment, but I gotta be honest with you all and confess that this is certainly my second favorite coming from this franchise.What can I say? I treasured almost everything that it had in its offerings. The mesmerizing visuals, the scintillating score, and the newly introduced characters for whom I had shown care, much more than I ever believed I could. Not only did they make me joyous, but also quite expressive, quite emotional.

Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales (2017),"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales (2017) Starring: Johnny Depp, Javier Bardem, Brenton Thwaites, Kaya Scodelario, Geoffrey Rush, Kevin McNally, Stephen Graham, Martin Klebba, Orlando Bloom, and Keira Knightley Directed By: Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg Review Back when I saw the first Pirates of The Caribbean movie with my family in our home I had a lot of fun watching, it was adventurous, the sword fights were plenty ( I love love love love love sword fighting) and shot really good but since then the series has gone completely downhill. Captain Jack Sparrow is pursued by an old rival, Captain Salazar, who along with his crew of ghost pirates has escaped from the Devil's Triangle, and is determined to kill every pirate at sea. Jack seeks the Trident of Poseidon, a powerful artifact that grants its possessor total control over the seas, in order to defeat Salazar. When I saw the opening sequence which is Henry Turner going to The Flying Dutchman to see his father Will Turner played once again by Orlando Bloom I knew the ending of the movie. The main reason I think they keep making movies is not because it makes money but also because of Jack. Who in the first movie was really cool, he's lost his coolness since then. I mean he looks like a drag queen or something and is like the worst pirate in the beginning of the movie, I mean he steals nothing, isn't adventurous and not once does he go like to Salazar Oh now I remember you. Everyone else I liked in the movie like Barbossa is a lot more interesting when you find something out later in the movie. Henry Turner he has cool like quest to get his father back, Carina is known as witch because of how smart she is all of these characters where way more cooler than Jack. The action wasn't all that great either I mean it was just lame. There were barley next no sword fights. Which was very disappointing. Pirates of The Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales is the best Pirates movie since the original but that doesn't make it entirely good movie. It is fun on times and the acting is pretty good with interesting characters but hopefully the next Pirates is the last Pirates, I'm giving Dead Men Tell No Tales a three out of five.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

unforgettable movie,"The film is tied to how one sailor is trying to unravel the curse of the flying Dutchman and save his father. This movie was written by Jeff Nathanson and directed by Joaquim Ronning. The film stars Johnny Depp as the main character.Thrust into an all-new adventure, a unlucker Captain Jack Sparrow finds the winds of misfortune blowing strongly his way when deadly ghost sailors, led by the terrifying Captain Salazar (Javier Bardem), escape from the Devil's Triangle bent on killing every pirate at sea-notably Jack. Jack's only hope of survival lies in the legendary Trident of Poseidon, but to find it he must forge an uneasy alliance with Carina Smyth (Kaya Scodelario), a brilliant and beautiful astronomer, and Henry (Brenton Thwaites), a headstrong young sailor in the Royal Navy. At the helm of the Dying Gull, his pitifully small and shabby ship, Captain Jack seeks not only to reverse his recent spate of misfortune, but to save his very life fromthe worst enemy he has ever facedAll in all, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales offers viewers a gripping story with plenty twists and turns.

Worst installment of the franchise,"I'm not into commercial blockbusters at all. I feel that films created with money as their sole purpose do not deserve my attention as they completely miss the point of the art of filmmaking. I haven't seen a single Transformers film nor any Marvel film since the very first Avengers film in 2012. Having said that, I have always been fond of the Pirates of the Caribbean for some reason. I enjoyed all the first four films (yes, even the fourth one I thought was quite entertaining) and even if I ignored titles like The Fate of the Furious, Wonder Woman and Beauty and the Beast without even watching a trailer, I was very enthusiastic about the latest Pirates film. Sadly, I was in for a big disappointment. By far the worst installment of the franchise is a big mess.The story revolves around the legendary Poseidon's Trident and the efforts of the main characters to find it and use it to break the curses of the seven seas. Johnny Depp reprises his role as Captain Jack Sparrow along with a few more returning characters like Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and Will Turner (Orlando Bloom). Jack Sparrow faces a new threat when Salazar (Javier Bardem), the captain of a crew of dead, gets released from his curse and comes to haunt the man that caused his doom. Jack's only hope is finding the Trident that can make Salazar mortal again. In this search he is joined by Will Turner's son, Henry (Brenton Thwaites) and a highly intelligent girl named Carina (Kaya Scodelario) who both seek the Trident for their own different reasons.One of the major disappointments concerns one of the most important aspects that made the films so popular, Jack Sparrow. Yes, Jack seemed like a dumb, careless man that is usually busy drinking, but at times he would show why he became such a legendary pirate. Not this time though. His only purpose is to try to make the audience laugh by acting silly with no avail most of the time. It's not that Johnny Depp's acting is bad, but it feels that even he himself is tired of this overused character, especially now that he appears more useless than ever. The rest of the cast is average. Rush and Bardem do a good job, but they don't seem to have much to work with.Then, we have the script which may be good for a 13-year old fan boy, but dumb for any self-respected cinephile. Apart from the part when Salazar recounts his first encounter with Sparrow, the story is shallow and completely devoid of any meaning. It doesn't even try to be original, but rather recycles material from the original trilogy. I cannot know why the Rønning – Sandberg duo was chosen to direct this fifth installment, but they definitely failed to make the film live up to its expectations (which were not that high after On Stranger Tides). The film has some good points, the cinematographer did a good job and the special effects are great. Overall though, it's just another pointless blockbuster especially when you think of the potential it seemed to have with Johnny Depp in one of his most renowned roles and Oscar winners Rush and Bardem in major roles. The franchise delivered some great moments, but even though this is not a befitting end, I really hope that the creators won't release a sixth film.More reviews: https://reflectingoncinemablog.wordpress.com/",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"It's bad,very very bad","It's not a good movie at all.It's actually pretty bad.I think that we all understand the reason why this movie was made.Not because of the greatness of past movies and not because they decided to continue the story.No,understand me correctly,the story continues,but it does only because they had no choice.They couldn't just create the story from nothing.There are all characters from previous movies,there are even one extra character,very well known for all fans) But it's not enough.While you are watching this ""piece of art"",the feeling of futility doesn't leave you,even for a second.It doesn't matter who is going to appear next or who is going to die,because you understand that it means nothing.The creators car resurrect anybody they want and because of that you don't fell sad when something happens with main characters.Jack Sparrow is playing very bad.Many years passed and he hasn't changed a bit.He is still as foolish as the man can ever be.He plays with death and he wins not because of his personality.He wins because this is the only way the movie can last longer,and that's all.I pretty much understand that these things can be said almost about any movie.Yes,they are.But the main goal of creators to make it look natural,to make people believe the actors.And i don't believe anyone on the screen at all. Hovewer,there is one plus - sometimes this movie is funny.There are a lot of jokes and the movie itself is made in a way that many people would laugh a lot and have a positive feedback because of that.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Also, in this film, we learn the origins of Jack Sparrow's name, very interesting, as Jack would say.Anyone who has not seen the first four films will certainly be lost if this is the first one you see.

Great If You Like Special Effects,"The story opens with a now one-dimensional Jack Sparrow lounging inside a bank vault loaded with gold and no explanation how he got there.Shortly after that, his band of merry-makers steal the entire building and drag it through the streets with a team of horses.Yeah.That's as good as it gets.Forget that they are able to secure the bank vault on a ship after somehow eluding authorities.Practically every transition from scene to scene in this movie is nearly impossible to follow and frustrating to watch, with a ridiculously stupid finale that made me think, 'Thank God it's over'.This production is the epitome of what a big-budget (1/4 of a BILLION dollars!) Greedywood movie that has every flashy thing under the sky and nothing of substance.There is no definable plot. There is no palpable pathos. There is no anticipation of anything to come.

"Fun? perhaps, but really just the same old, same old.","This film is very much mirroring of Johnny Depp's career, He has become so molded into a character actor who must play these over the top strange characters that his portrayal of Captain Jack Sparrow has really became dull and unnatural in a sense. On the other hand movies such as Black Mass does prove that Depp is able to pull off more emotional roles with more depth involved.So why is Pirates 5 very much like Depp's career as an actor, well personally I see this in many franchises as they extend to their 5th or 6th installments not to say that this is a certainty but it is often seen, the case where each sequel follows that same formulaic structure that all the predecessors follow, there's no new blood; Well in the case of the 2 latest Pirates movies there is an attempt of doing so but the filmmakers are so afraid of putting these new character forward that they simply get drowned By Captain Jack. So yes Pirates 5 was fun and yes it was enjoyable but really it went nowhere whatsoever.About Depp and Jack Sparrow his performance in this film just seems like the same old thing, and what was once legendary now seems tiresome, annoying and ridiculous. He is no longer a groundbreaking performer but someone who is attempting to 'rekindle the fire' and the desperateness, it shows. Also the 'young couple' that Sparrow must team up with are very under utilized and may have been great, I really can't tell because of how little their characters were explored.I am personally a supporter of the second and third installments of this franchise and I think the biggest reason why is that it progresses the story further, whereas these past 2 films really just went nowhere and seemed like side quests in this greater main plot line. This leaves me wanting to move back to the main storyline desperately, I do hope that with the addition of Elizabeth Swann and Will Turner in this film we may see a return to forms and a continuation of a story. Afterall I think what was so compelling in the franchise's early days was how there was a sense of adventure and questing as audiences leap from film to film.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

And like part three, it had exquisite picture quality, cinematography, and a very well-written script and overall plot. For me, the ending of we-all-know-who was completely epic and heroic. I'll keep remembering the words that most stuck out: ""treasure!"" The writers did absolute justice to one of the finest of the series. (I tip my hat in his fictional honor.)

Poor character development left a hallow shell,"The premise was fine, the special effects were good, and the flash backs were interesting however the film suffered from poor directing. The scenes simply didn't flow well despite being filled with interesting tidbits about Jacks history and the possible consequences of the ending. I think the big problem was character development. In the 1st movie, the characters had a lot of quality scenes whereas in this one they had equal time but the scenes were not great or memorable. For example, in the 1st movie we had that great fight scene between Jack and Will filled with comedy and purpose. In this one, the only scene Henry had that was remotely interesting was at the beginning when tried to locate his dad but the problem is that the scene was simply dumb. He basically committed suicide simply to say hi to dad. It was not reasonable and it certainly did not make me like Henry in any way like I liked Will in the 1st. Elizabeth Swan also had a better story than Carina who was largely a wimpy version of Elizabeth and although she is supposedly smart, she did not come off as such as her only purpose in the entire movie is to point a ship in a direction and that is all. She served no other purpose and her romance with Henry was not convincing. Lastly, and possibly the biggest problem, Jack was not funny... actually, I cant remember a funny scene in this movie which is a huge let down. They tried to crack a few jokes here and there but they were not good. I also felt like Jack played practically no part in the movie aside from making it things harder than they should have been. In fact, this movie did not need Jack Sparrow at all. He didn't have any smart tricks up his sleeves, nor did he contribute much of anything and Salazars hate of Jack felt as empty as Henry and Carina's romance. It simply made no sense.Overall, id say its an average movie. Nothing worth watching more than once, and certainly not worth the price of admission but its better than straight to TV movies and certainly better than movies like the Ninja Turtles debacle or the lousy Transformer movies.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A Delightful Addition to the Beloved Franchise,","Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales, or, Salazars Revenge, as it is called in some places, is a great movie with a very well developed plot and a terrific cast. It is honestly my favourite Pirates film since Curse of the Black Pearl, it combines a lot of the elements that made that movie good and took away a lot more serious, melodramatic plot lines that made the likes of Dead Mans Chest and At Worlds End a lot weaker. It is simply very fun, it never takes itself too seriously, it does not diverge on any grittier plot details, it is a good time at the movies.I was very underwhelmed by Will Turner's contribution to this movie, Orlando Bloom promoted the movie and advertised in a way that he was making a return to the franchise. However, he is only there for two key scenes, and it felt more like fan service, rather than him gladly stepping back in this role.The cast is certainly what makes this franchise, and it is as good as ever here. Johnny Depp is still in excellent form as Jack Sparrow, having fun and not looking like he is having any trouble stepping in to this role, and as long as he keeps returning to these movies, I am happy to see them. I was also glad to see Geoffrey Rush, as good as ever as Barbossa, and Javier Bardem shines in a role he is very use to by now, the main antagonist.

they ruined Jack Sparrow,"They completely ruined Jack Sparrows character in this movie, the movie is soooo boring and forgettable.

Surprisingly good,"After watching ""On Stranger Tides"" I felt that the film series was quite finished. The trailer made me believe the movie to be boring and it didn't give me the same feeling the other Pirates of the Caribbean movies did. Critics was poor at a start and many of my personal friends said they were disappointed, hence I didn't expect much when I went to the cinema.But after watching the movie I felt very surprised. Casting, effects, and story line are terrific, however I do feel some of the scenes were a bit too long, and could be shortened down a bit without affecting the story. But in general the film is good and very entertaining.When it comes to acting I'd say that Johnny Depp did a good performance of his character like he always does, there is more of a lack in the writing than in his acting. The original cast and characters did a solid performance. Brenton Thwaites portrays Henry Turner, the son of William Turner brilliantly.In the movie we look back at Jack Sparrow's younger self and this helps tie the entire franchise together very well.The special and visual effects in this movie were brilliant, no doubt.Was this an ingenious movie? No. Was it entertaining and worth my time? Yes, indeed. If you are disappointed in On Stranger Tides, I do recommend watching this one to get the Pirates of The Caribbean feeling back.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
PotC: Dead Men Tell No Tales was a great time!,"Nothing wrong with this latest film in the PotC franchise. Johnny will always be a delight to watch as Captain Jack Sparrow, it will never get old in my opinion. & Brenton Thwaites is a thoroughly engaging up & coming actor, & not to leave out Kaya Scodelario who put in a fine performance as his genius love interest. Of course we got to see Geoffrey Rush again as the insane scurvy dog, Captain Barbossa. & this time around we got the eerie & creepily fun performance of the big bad Javier Bardem. & last, but not least, we get some fine cameos from a few characters that I really appreciated.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Dead Men Tell No Tales,"Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Men Tell No Tales is the fifth film in the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise and currently is the last one. How it ended, there could be a sixth Pirates of the Caribbean down the line. If anything, if they're still working on a sixth Pirates of the Caribbean, they should keep Johnny Depp. The franchise is nothing without him. I predict a sixth would bomb if he doesn't return. That out of the way, I find this one is a good addition to the franchise. It deals with death and the Trident of Poseidon. That really expands the mythology of the universe. What it introduces is really what makes it deserving of another sequel. I probably can't go on a lot further without mentioning the franchise getting another sequel and actually talk about the film itself, so I'm leaving it off here.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Set Sails For Calmer Waters!,"Avast ye scurvy scoundrels, it be Captain Robbie of the S.S. Review, sailing the seas of the cinema in search of the treasure known as a good movie. Alas, this weekend Admiral Bruckheimer's armada set out on a fifth voyage with Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp)taking the wheel once more. Will this adventure be smooth sailing and reward us with a crown jewel, or will we be drowned in the sea of sorrow at another hand me down adventure? Yo Ho, Yo Ho, A pirate's life for me, drink up me hardies, sit on your captain's chair and read my thoughts on Pirates of The Caribbean 5: Dead Men Tell No Tales.Summary: When it comes to the plot of these movies, one never knows if they'll find gold or mere rocks. The fifth installment is fortunately back on the path to good storytelling, focusing on the characters instead of well immortality. Among the number of scallywags, we get some background on about five of the cast, each with a unique angle to help them stand out. While certainly not the best story, it is miles above the mess number four was.The story is a nice component, but the acting is really the aspect that brings the pirate's life to welllife. Newcomers like Brenton Thwaites and Kaya Scodelario are a welcome addition that have spunk, class, and a number of other qualities that many will latch onto, (especially the cute factor) and they aren't bad to look at either. Scaring is way into another antagonistic role, Javier Bardem brings his bag of tricks back to the screen, including the suave accent and cantor that oozes evil. Of course the main two you are probably coming to see are Geoffrey Rush and Johnny Depp, the legendary captains we fell in love with in the first movie. Rush is incredible, bringing the sea saltiness and arrogance that is the famous Captain of the Black Pearl. Depp on the other hand is as enigmatic as ever, capturing the goofiness, lackadaisical attitude of Sparrow with a dash of heroic charm. Together, the two actors lead not only the character development, but the comedy. Yes Pirates 5 certainly has the laughs in spades, using every in their arsenal to get a chuckle. I loved the clever word play, idiotic banter, and comedic timing in this movie, which helped relieve the darker aspects of the film.Of course, it wouldn't be a pirate's movie without incredible special effects. Yes Disney and Bruckheimer combined their studios to bring the magic back to the screen. Chaotic maelstroms expand across the vast screen, as ships sail across dead infested waters, firing explosive cannons at the specters that haunt the blue. The journey is certainly beautifully illustrated in a mix of art and excitement, all under the unifying banner of the epic orchestra work we all have come to love.Summary: Alas, despite the jewels that sparkle in the distance, the story still needs some work. With five main stories, each a different motif to quest for the elusive item, the plot gets spread thin and deprived of real sustenance into the character's history. Sure, one of the stories has more bite than the others, but this Pirates took a hit in the rich depth we have come to expect. Therefore, the bland characters were lacking at times and not as strong as I had hoped.Even more bland are the action scenes that they tried to bring to the movie. Don't get me wrong, there are some beautifully animated battlegrounds in the movie, it's just that they lack the same sting I feel in love with. Where were the epic sword fights between two swashbuckling men amidst dangerous landscapes? Where were the notorious ship to ship battles where a well- placed cannonball and evasive maneuver meant the difference between life and death? And where was the suspense and thrills that kept me on edge all those previous installments? I'm not sure, but Pirates 5's action scenes were malnourished forms of battle I loved, with many scenes reduced to pan over shots of extras fighting CGI enhanced ghosts. A few scenes were gaining the potential to be awesome, but comedic relief set in and reduced it to some quick ended scuffle that quickly turned to running. Glad to know our pirates could have run track.And finally, the cameos. While certainly a great tool for nostalgia, most of the cameos were shallow shout outs to the characters we have wondered about. It allows for some neat little tie ups at times, but these less than 5 minutes screen appearances were missed potential. Only Paul McCartney, the legendary beetle, was able to pull off an appearance that was worthy of being included well done Paul.VERDICT:Pirates 5 took a step in the right direction with its returned to character driven story, comedic style, and special effects that scream pirates. However, it still has room to improve to get back to the glory of the first film. It's unbalanced at placed, and lacks the excitement of the battles, or an exciting conclusion at all to wrap up the supposed final entry. Seems they wanted more of a comedy than anything else, and one will certainly enjoy the laughs, and most likely the movie, if you go in for the comedy over everything else. Worth a trip to theaters? I'm sure you would still go regardless what I said, but the special effects are certainly worthy of the theater's sound and video. Yet you could still hold off on this film and check it out at RedBox, because this finale sets up the series for yet another installment.

"Dear Jerry, please don't make another one!","'What we bring to the screen is great storytelling, with wonderful characters caught up in this magical fantastic world' - Jerry Bruckheimer (Producer) on this fifth installment.Sorry, Jerry. This movie did not have great storytelling, it had boring uninteresting characters (even the ones that were interesting in former installments were stale and washed up) and the world was anything but magical.If anything, this made me love the first three movies even more. (even the second and the third on what they were attempting to do with the epic scale and world-building storytelling)This movie was terrible. This is coming from someone who tolerated the fourth movie. On Stranger Tides was mediocre but it was sometimes enjoyable at least when you watched it the first time. This thing was like staying too long at a dance party. The lights are already turned on, there is no music playing anymore and some really drunk people are still dancing but only because they had too much to drink. And you are in the middle of the room, looking around you and wonder: why didn't I leave sooner. This party isn't fun anymore.The main problems were the uninspiring story-line, it's contradicting script, boring characters, the cringe-worthy forced jokes and worst of all it's retconning and undermining of the lore from previous movies.Here's another quote from Jerry: 'Johnny Depp has created an iconic character. One of the best characters ever created in cinema.'Thanks Jerry. Depp indeed created an iconic character in the first movie (and kinda continued with that in the second and third movies) but his performance is best described as a washed-up former rock star with alcohol issues. You almost feel bad for Depp when you watch his performance in this movie.Dear Jerry, please don't make another one!",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Absolutely amazing!!!! Coming from someone who strongly dislikes almost every movie.,"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales is an absolutely astonishing continuation of the series! I personally dislike more movies than I do like, and I especially disliked the fourth pirates movie. So I was incredibly surprised to see that the fifth was good enough for the both of them. If this is the last Pirates of the Caribbean movie, then it's a wonderful way to end the great series, but if there are more to come then this movie has definitely given writers tons of inspiration for an amazing sixth movie. I was terrified at the thought of Dead Men Tell No Tales being a disappointing addition to the legacy the previous movies left, but by the time I left the theater I was extremely grateful to Disney for doing the franchise justice. I would absolutely pay to go see this movie again in theaters, and I will certainly be buying it when it comes out.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Script was even worse than pathetic and Johny Depp's acting was just terrible. The plot, where to start with the plot, oh yeah, it hasn't got any plot.

Much Better Than Critics Say,"You know the old saying that those who criticize only because they fail to do it themselves? This is all I can think of reading so many reviews that say this movie is horrible. We saw an advanced press screening of Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Men Tell No Tales and it was such a thrill. I give it an eight because one of the ending scenes (about two minutes of screen time) on a bluff overlooking the ocean was dumb and cheesy. The rest of this movie was everything we wanted in a Pirates sequel. Javier Bardem is perfect and Depp's Jack Sparrow hasn't lost a step. The new ghostly characters, some which are barely there at all are so cool and the scene with young Jack and how it ties in with his character was such a nice addition.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This movie belongs in a Jar of Dirt!!,"'PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: SALAZAR'S REVENGE' was a joint directorial effort by Joachim Ronning and Espen Sandberg, and stars Johnny Depp, Javier Bardem and Brenton Thwaites.​Long ago, Jack Sparrow(Johnny Depp) first earned his rank of Captain when he outmanoeuvred Spanish Pirate hunter Captain Salazar(Javier Bardem), cursing Salazar to life in hell. But when he has come to the end of the line, Jack exchanges his treasured compass, and releases his greatest foe.This is a franchise that, while I enjoyed 2 and 3, should have died after the first one. It didn't need to continue this long and they're really beating this skeleton of a once good franchise. Please, for the love of god, stop making these movies. If you enjoyed this movie, then I can't say I understand why but I'm happy you did because I wanted nothing more to like it. That said, after 'On Stranger Tides', this and even the already decreasing quality of 2 and 3, this franchise has proved it was a one trick pony and trying to get any more goodness out of it is a waste of time and money.For starters, the story is very weak and not engaging in the slightest. I understand that the casual audience member may not care about the story and focus more on action(don't worry; I'll get to that later) but I still expect a coherent narrative that makes logical sense and engages me to an extent. To be fair, the ending was actually pretty great and neatly ends of the franchise, if they end it here(please do!).CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow is a name that used to mean something in movies. Johnny Depp received his first EVER Oscar nomination for this character and now it's devolved into a pathetic, practical joke. That is genuinely sad because of what he was, and what he is now. RIP Old Jack. Javier Bardem provided perhaps his worst performance as Captain Salazar which is also a huge shame because I respect Bardem as an actor immensely(he's in my top 3 bond villains for God's sake!). I understand he had little to work with, and thus do not blame him for such a bland, unforgettable and uninspiring villain. Brenton Thwaites was also pretty weak as Henry but making the character the son of Will Turner cleverly links him into the rest of the franchise and gives me a reason to actually like him and want him to succeed. Caya Scodelario was decent as Carina and I really like the strong, powerful female character that each Pirates movie has included. I'll say that Carina is definitely better than Angela but slightly weaker than Elizabeth Swan(but that may be down to Swan having three movies to develop). Geoffrey Rush and Kevin McNally are the only two actors in all these movies that I still genuinely like. Both Barbossa(Rush) and Gibbs(McNally) are incredibly likable characters and I love the way their arcs end, one in particular.Each Pirates movie from the Gore Verbinski trilogy to 'On Stranger Trash' at least had a unique feel to them and all of them FELT like a Pirates movie. This movie just felt like a mesh of 100s of other action and adventure movies thus causing this movie to lose its identity which is really sad. The costume and set design was fine but it didn't feel as alive as the other movies. The effects for this movie are also fine but I don't think they hold a candle to even the effects in 'The Curse of the Black Pearl'(but I may need to re watch it to be sure).Right, another of my main flaws in this movie is the action. It's a PIRATES movie and contains the less Sword fighting and cool scenes than Schindler's List(you just imagined Oskar Schindler and Amon Goeth in a sword fight, didn't you?). The only sequence in this movie that had even remotely good action was the opening sequence(involving Sparrow) but aside from that, I wasn't impressed by any of the action.A fair number of the jokes hit in this movie, which I was impressed by but I think that less time could have been spent on jokes, and more on an engaging narrative.The pacing for this movie is also awful and it is WAY TOO LONG. You could have shaved off a good 20-25 minutes and wouldn't have affected the movie in any way.The score for this movie is also awesome but that was established in 'The Curse of the Black Pearl' and can thus not be credited to this movie.All in all, I really didn't enjoy this movie. It didn't contain enough good of anything to excuse the bad of anything. The bad outweighs the good for me and I just recommend it. If you liked it, I envy you because I really wished I did but I suppose the title(Salazar's Revenge. Really?) should have gave away how lazy this movie was gonna be. I don't recommend you see this movie and I'll rate it 3 out of 10 mute cameos.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Reboots just don't work for this franchise,"First off, Dead Men Tell No Tales is magnitudes better than Stranger Tides.Instead of a misplaced attempt to cater religious nuts, this time we see a politically correct female scientist astronomer (yes, indeed) as female ""lead"". The weirdness doesn't stop there, because she also believes in blood moon star constellation magic. Still better than the bible study of Stranger Tides.We also see a return of Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley. They play small roles , but add some much needed substance to the otherwise slow and flat story.However, the movie falls short in two major points: The villain and the introduction of new young lead characters.The main villain is a pale shadow of Bill Nighy's Davy Jones. He reminded me a lot of General Grievous from Star Wars. CGI overkill without any soul to be found. After the trilogy, it simply feels dumb that there is yet another Big Bad out there.The new young lead characters suffer from the Indiana Jones IV-syndrome. They feel forced and out of place. Among a band of seasoned pirates, they are the new kids on the block. The trashy hip hoppers among the Mozart-aficionados. The fast food generation clashing with lobster gourmets, especially the guy. The female ""scientist"" is okay, because she has some decent lines with Jack, but the dude is just another young Indiana Jones copy.Anyway, this movie series could have ended after the first, and it should definitely have ended after the third. I love the trilogy. Please don't make another.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

This Ship Sinks,"If you're like me, you were never much interested in the buccaneering, larger-than-life characters that populate the Pirates of the Caribbean (2003-Present) series. Subversive characterizations; forget about it, constantly shifting alliances; no need for it, organic integration of plot combined with clever setups and payoffs; pirate please! Everyone knows this series is and should always be a catalog of increasingly far-fetched pirate folklore almost entirely based on a small collection of supernatural trinkets Jack Sparrow (Depp) and Captain Barbossa (Rush) happen to have on them.Submitted for your approval: Dead Men Tell No Tales answers the pressing questions of how Jack Sparrow got a hold of his magic compass. It's cursed (of course) - having the power to release the owner's worst fear the moment it is betrayed. Naturally, Jack betrays the compass at a bar, unleashing the ghostly Captain Salazar (Bardem) from his watery tomb. This then allows Salazar to seek revenge against the pirate who outsmarted him a generation ago. There's also some throwaway exposition involving two star-crossed lovers (Thwaites and Scodelario), and a mythical trident that gives the movie an excuse to dust off and use Orlando Bloom for all of five minutes.With a narrative foundation positively drenched in seafaring happenstance, Dead Men Tell No Tales is an uncompromising success of messy, soulless, conveyor-belt cinema. Its emotional stakes strain under the weight of Depp's, by now tired and embarrassing performance while the pacing ebbs and flows with the force of every exposition drop. The special-effects are a master's class in ""quantity over substance"" with a showstopping zombie shark sequence being a real standout in the patently unnecessary.Speaking of the patently unnecessary - Captain Barbossa's inclusion blows any of the unnaturalness of the previous movies completely out of the water. His contrived, lazily detailed story serves as a perfect metaphor for series' parent company's indignant lack of creativity. But while some other franchises I could name, disguise familiar trappings with a false sense of reverence (cough cough Star Wars, cough cough) or at the very least retool them to seem new (cough cough Marvel), Pirates just lets its complex myths dangle in front of Disney's nakedly plain ambitions to keep this moneymaker chugging.It's almost like the movie is daring you to hate it. It brazenly has no economy of thought - letting its dry exposition scenes, its tired comedic scenes and its loud action scenes serve their simple purpose with nary an overlapping thread. It then perverts the original film's fondness for coincidence into an oppressive highlight reel of bad storytelling, bad editing and bad franchise maintenance. Then, as if to purposely p**s everyone off, the movie manages to fit in a reoccurring joke about Scodelario's character being a witch because she happens to be smarter than everyone else in the f**king movie! This is now the fifth movie cataloging the adventures of Captain Jack Sparrow and his confederacy of loose fitting friends/enemies. Five movies...out of a franchise that arguably only made one good one! Can we please be done with these? Please? I don't think I can stomach another lucky brush with a well armed, supernatural villain on a search for vengeance and quite possibly Jack's hat. If anything this movie is proof that some things just need to die.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I am so pleased that I did! Everything that On Stranger Tides wasn't, Dead Mean Tell No Tales is. Fantastic job, getting us back to the characters we know and love. Thoroughly enjoyable for the entire family. Jack and the rum are certainly back in the way that they were always meant to be.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The final quarter kills a good film (once again),"Here's how every 'Pirates of the Caribbean' sequel seems to go: it starts off fun, light-hearted and clever, then as things go along it becomes more and more convoluted until it reaches the point where it becomes so self-loving and obsessed with it's own cleverness that it is nothing short of unwatchable. Unfortunately 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales' is no different, however it is better than some of the previous installments.Unless you somehow have managed to care enough to follow the mythology that the stories follow, then you (like me) are here for Johnny Depp playing 'Jack Sparrow'. You're happy for there to be a story and for other characters to have their time in the spotlight, but at the end of the day you've paid your $20 to see Depp. That's why the last quarter of these films is always so disappointing, because his character almost always becomes nothing more than a chess piece in the extravagant action sequences.The first 3/4 of the film, where Depp is allowed to do what he does best, are admittedly very good. Almost all of his jokes land and the film keeps a good pace avoiding being bogged down by storytelling. Javier Bardem is the other bright light in this film. His performance is genuinely scary at times. These films are incredibly frustrating because they truly could be great, but instead always end up sinking into mediocrity.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Feels like yesterday's spaghetti bolognese,"This unnecessary fifth entry of the franchise feels like yesterday's Spaghetti Bolognese. The gravy has coagulated into a thickened blur of red and the noodles have congealed into a bloated mess of starch. It looks great from far, but once you get up close all your alarm bells start to go off. If you put one spoonful in your mouth, the only thought pervading your consciousness will be how much you miss its formal glory and then you will proceed to spit it out in a hurry.For a movie franchise that is built on fun and adventure on the high seas, while maintaining a deft balance between light and dark elements, these sequels missed their mark with increasing notoriety. For me, On Stranger Tides (2011) flatlined from the get-go, while this new one helmed by Kon-Tiki (2012) directors Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg takes a while to get to the point of no return. There is no denying the fact that this entry feels unnecessary and almost redundant. There is some effort in trying to do a soft reboot with the introduction of new characters Henry Turner (son of William Turner and Elizabeth Swann) and Carina Smyth, but they lack chemistry and the uninspired script barely allowed them to stay afloat.One of the joys of watching a Pirates of the Caribbean movie is Jack Sparrow, a joyful collision of spur-of-the-moment slapstick and irrelevant eccentricity. The script of this latest entry doesn't even push the character a millimetre forward. He slurs and staggers his way through any scene and nothing is truly memorable, except maybe that guillotine scene.The story features yet again a MacGuffin, the Trident of Poseidon, and it feels too familiar and bloated. It doesn't help matters with so many characters which basically dissolve into a chain of cause and effect events.Dead Men Tell No Tales does look great at times, especially with inventive scenes featuring zombie sharks and the parting of an ocean, but like all money-spinning franchises the studios don't want to think up fresh storytelling ideas and is content with letting the CGI overwhelm the movie like a Kraken. The studio motto is ""the boat that carries the gold shall not be rocked"" and it is clearly evident here.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
thoroughly enjoyable,"i don't go to the theater quite often but it has been long since i enjoyed watching a movie. its a movie that will entertain you and you wont get bored in any scene as the story line keeps you attached to the screen.

Overall,"To be honest, I'm giving such a low rating because I don't appreciate it when companies think they can ride on the success of a franchise with a completely different director and try to make a continuation of something someone else did, and NOT pay attention to the small details of their work. It's both lazy and insulting to the one who put a lot of effort and time into making those specific characters have depth.The graphics, unfortunately, is the really the only praise I can give for this movie. A little bit more praise would be that I think Salazar was a well-rounded antagonist in this film, but there are a few things that I have issues with as for him over all, and most of it has to do with bad writing. The first thing that comes to mind is that, if Salazar was the one that gave Jack his ""Sparrow"" name, how did everyone else hear about it, if him and his crew were cursed to the Devil's Triangle and couldn't leave? Another would be that his death was far too sudden. As the main antagonist, I feel that it should have had more meaning. On a similar note, I want to know, how did lifting the curse not kill him? Because half of his head was gone, and most of his men got blown away (hence why they were missing a few pieces of themselves).Another thing; that was the most open end ever.Now I want to touch on some of the answered frequently asked questions. First, Tia Dalma giving Jack the compass in a barter. I think it's a little stretched to say that Jack lost it and had to barter to get it back, ESPECIALLY since if that were the case, this whole issue with Salazar would have happened then, instead of now. And Will. I can handle the idea that he's turning ""fishy"" because he's behind, but then I don't feel like that would be the only development. However, my main concern was what was up with the crew? I feel that money was the reason that the rest of the crew wasn't included, but I don't like the fact that the rest of the Dutchman's men were a part of the ship again.Why was Jack's history that was revealed in the third movie completely obliterated? This is where I feel like this movie should be taken as a slight alternate universe at this point. Because if you pay attention in At World's End, Jack and Beckett have a conversation. This conversation states that Jack was employed by Beckett to deliver cargo. Jack states that ""people aren't cargo"", and the movie itself hints at what all happened, but here's the canon explanation:Jack worked for Beckett for about a year, and after he comes back empty handed from an errand that Beckett sent him on, he demands that Jack transport some slaves to another area. However, Jack ends up setting the slaves free and Beckett hunts him down, burns the hull of the Wicked Wench and brands Jack as a Pirate for ""stealing"" his slaves. In an attempt to save his beloved Wicked Wench, Jack dives in after her and instead, is picked up by Davy Jones. He strikes a deal with Jones for his ship and 10 years at sea as pirate Captain Jack Sparrow, at the cost of his soul and 100 years of service at the end of the 10 years. Jones agrees and raises the Wench, of which Jack renames, due to her now black hull, as the Black Pearl.This is how Jack became a pirate, however, in this new movie, he was given the title after the original captain dies in the battle between them and Salazar. This also ruffles my feathers, because Jack wasn't a first mate. There was no real reason for him to become the next captain. In all honesty, I feel like this whole scene was created, because they wanted to show off their technology in making the actors look young again, as they did to Carrie Fisher in Rogue One.Jack's personality. In ALL the previous movies, Jack has had a few moments of clarity and wittiness. In this movie however, he seems to have just lost all sense of reality. I want to attribute this to the ""loss"" of the Pearl, but the thing is, I feel like Jack would have taken any measure to get her back. But because of this fact, I believe that is why he was pretty much broken and refused to sail on, and therefore brings me to another short and sweet point: he seemed more like the Mad Hatter, than the Jack Sparrow we know and love.And something else I can't stand is when there is no time in between a theory and it's reveal. Carina tells us that her father leaves her this journal while talking to a pirate (avoiding the other name for spoiler purposes). This is the first hint that we know who the father is, then boom! It's confirmed. Now, I know I'm dissecting this a little harshly, but seriously. The better way that myself and others have stated was that it should have been at the tattoo scene. That would have been the perfect reveal time, since this was supposed to be the last movie in the series.Which all of this leads me to my final issue. Barbosa. I'm not sure WHY Jack and Barbosa went their separate ways. I may have missed that from between the fourth movie and this movie, but over all, it seemed like things were relatively patched up between the two.So, to wrap up this exceedingly long review, I just want to say that overall, I was not impressed at all; I'm very upset that I wasted my money on it.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Pirates of No Inspiration, or How a Shitload of Awful CGI Can Destroy a Movie","I'm quite sure Walt Disney would cry to see his name in this.Like the other three sequels, ""Dead Men Tell No Tales"" is made by the motto More Is More, which, apparently, is still not the case. Having watched, and loved, ""Kon-Tiki"" and ""Max Manus"" -- two impressively well-made productions by talented Norwegian directors Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg -- I must admit that I couldn't help hoping that I would once again get to experience the wonder and magic of ""The Curse of the Black Pearl."" Regrettably, though, there is nothing of that to be found here, as the latest installment of the series is completely devoid of story and inspiration and even, at most times, fails with the so-important humour. Bardem and Depp, both at times great actors, brings no real energy to their characters, and despite a few glimpses of light, I walked out from the cinema feeling that for 129 minutes, I'd been watching a movie on autopilot. One of the few things preventing this from being an unbearable experience was the music, which of course relies heavily on the works of Zimmer/Badelt from before, but also adds some nice new touches from composer Geoff Zanelli.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Funny, exciting, and satisfying! Looking forward to seeing it again :-)","Apparently, there's no pleasing some people, especially critics. I loved this movie.

Solid Entertainment,"I wasn't really expecting that much out of this film as I rarely do out of films that are sequels in a long series. And for the most part the comedies that have been out lately have been very disappointing. But I was pleasantly surprised. The action scenes are good, the special effects are very impressive and there are plenty of good one liners that will bring a chuckle in the film. The film moves along at a quick pace and the cast were all very good. You expected Javier Bardem and Geoffrey Rush to be good since they always are and Johnny Depp has the Jack Sparrow character down to where he could probably play him in his sleep. Kevin McNally and Stephen Graham are also back and again provide solid laughs. Brenton Thwaites and Kaya Scodelario are the new two young characters a la Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley (who both appear in minor roles themselves that are basically just cameos). They are well cast for the roles and deliver what they were cast for (both are young, energetic and good looking). The plot isn't the movie's strong point, but is is good enough to move things along quickly and to allow you to enjoy the action, effects and comedy without getting in the way. All in all an enjoyable two hours.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The worst one yet,"Jack Sparrow is more obnoxious than ever, and the CGI has never looked worse. Bardem and his dusty crew look awful, especially compared to Davy Jones and company.

Is this a self-parody?,"Where's the wit and the charm of the original films. This feels like a village panto spoof. Poorly written lines poorly delivered.

Why so much exposition, why so much aimless dialogue?halfway through the movie and oh, what's the point? Who cares what happens next?...

Plus no one wants to see Davey Jones again; he was a lame villain the first time around. Speaking of villains, this movie has a great one who is no only menacing but is flushed out well with a great backstory to boot. The whole movie is great, even the newbies are good.

Checked off the to-see bucket list ... same way this film was made.,"No spoilers here. But, even if they were, they wouldn't really be spoilers because ... in fact ... that would be impossible. You've seen it all before.Why did I watch this? Because, like many other people, I really liked the first films. Just big fun. And so I figured, hey, they would do that, right?Disney: evidently when they sat down to figure out why people like the first films, they got lost in their corporate, accountant driven, audience surveyed calculations, and decided it wasn't acting, or storyline that people wanted, but special effects. And that's all this is, from beginning to end. Resulting in, simply, a CGI-generated piece of ... uh ... whatever. With a plot line tidying up (more like scraping up and disposing) loose ends from previous films.Where to begin: First: Johnny Depp -- who is admittedly the main reason the other films were interesting -- had absolutely nothing to work with in this script. He had nothing more to say. And he was evidently not interested in putting any personal investment into it. So all he did was crack the few not particularly interesting jokes he was handed, grimace a bit, and his principal acting skills went into scenes where he had to pretend he was staggering around drunk. And I'm not sure he was really pretending, because in later scenes, he still moved, and spoke, as though he was hammered. But I'm going to assume Disney had a clause in his contract against that, so maybe he was just severely hung over. Funny no more.Plot? There was no plot. It was more like an IKEA instruction manual of how to make a (not so) cheap, mass-made and disposable consumer item. Just the usual package of some unlucky souls on an unlucky ship, trying to kill Jack. And the evil regular guys? They didn't even get enough time to be really evil, developing their bad guy thing, with maybe some time for them to develop a bit of humanity to make them a bit interesting. Just ... forget it.I watched it. Yes I did. All the way to the end. Not expecting anything after the first 10 minutes ... going into a sort of catharsis, not caring, bored, but stuck watching it with the idea that ... what the heck ... I'd seen the others so I might as well see this out to the end. Like paying final respects.Message for Johnny Depp: OK, you get paid a lot for this. Big, big bucks. But, frankly, you don't need to do this now. You obviously don't get any enjoyment out of it, other than maybe whatever Disney's catering service has to offer. Frankly, unless they can come up with a script that involves actual acting, some real character development or story line, and little or no CGI, let it die in peace.It's over. I'm done with this franchise. Captain Jack Sparrow has obviously now become just a canned, makeup department effort good enough for keeping alive the Halloween costume industry tie-ins for another year.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great Movie!  **Spoilers**,"Potential **SPOILERS** y boyfriend and I just saw this movie this afternoon. We LOVED it! I agree with a lot of other reviews that is much much better than the 4th movie. The movie didn't even seem like 2 and a half hours. I experienced no lulls in the movie and while there were a few touching scenes, this movie was a lot of fun to watch. A lot of old familiar characters. It was fun to see them in this movie, as well as some new characters, Henry Turner, Karina Smyth and Salazar.**SPOILER** I love how they brought Will Turner and Elizabeth Swanns love story full circle. To see them reunited after their son helped break his fathers curse of being on the Flying Dutchman.

Nail in coffin,"All in all, the fifth instalment of POTC is a sorry spectacle. The bafflingly high user rating here on IMDb seems to speak to the low standards of today's audience. If this film adds to the quality of someone's life, it must be an awful life to begin with.Pros: When it comes to filming locations and technology, POTC 5 is as good as its predecessors. Beautiful landscapes and colours. Awesome effects. Without a doubt, Disney has nailed CGI and post- processing.Cons: 1) The story is part predictable and otherwise boring. The first 50 or so minutes represent a mixture of things that we have seen in previous instalments, pure insult. The rest of the film boils down to yet another oh-so-powerful pirate artefact, but one so uninteresting that one's attention and intellect, already numb from the first half of the movie, simply walk out. 2) The acting is altogether terrible, not a single cast member performs memorably. Johnny Depp has lost all charm and wittiness, Sparrow's lines are painfully flat, goofy, and cringy. Not once did he induce even just a chuckle. Geoffrey Rush equally feels like a mere shadow of his former self. Javier Bardem's character fails to make an impression as well. The two newbies Brenton Thwaites and Kaya Scodelario are OK-ish but not great.Technological competence cannot compensate for lack of story, lack of direction, and lack of acting. POTC 5 is such a spectacular failure that even a free ticket would not justify the movie's consumption.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales"" is an entertaining return to the roots of the franchise.","The trident, a three-pronged spear appearing in European and Asian mythology and still a recognizable symbol today, is the object of everyone's desire in ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales"" (PG-13, 2:09), the fifth film in Disney's ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" franchise. Historically, tridents have been used for spear fishing and as weapons. In Greek, Roman and Hindu religious traditions, the trident is the weapon of the gods Poseidon, Neptune and Shiva, respectively. In the folklore of the ancient Greeks, Poseidon used his trident to create bodies of water and also to stir up storms at sea. In short, the trident is said to be able to control the waters, a handy implement to have at your disposal, especially if you're a pirate, a sailor, or have become somehow beholden to the powers of the sea.Captain Jack Sparrow is not dead. He's just sleeping. In a safe. It's part of a bank robbery scheme that he and his crew want to pull off – if Jack can stay sober long enough to make their plan work. But not much works out for Jack (Johnny Depp, in his fifth turn as the perpetually unlucky, inebriated, horny pirate). He soon finds himself on the wrong side of a new French invention called the guillotine. (And the way that turns out, let's hope it doesn't inspire the Disneyland parks to create a guillotine ride next to the ride which originally inspired this film franchise.) As Jack peers into a basket of severed heads, he's just yards away from a young woman named Carina Smyth (Kaya Scodelario) who is standing atop a wooden platform with a noose around her neck. As Jack is about to lose his head, she's about to have the blood flow to hers cut off because she is believed to be a witch. What else would 18th century British colonists in the Caribbean call a woman of science who is so knowledgeable about astronomy and horology? Carina had recently met another new character to the franchise, Henry Turner (Brenton Thwaites). Henry was under arrest on suspicion of treason because he was the only survivor of a British naval vessel which was destroyed in an area of the sea known as the Devil's Triangle. Henry was serving on the ship as a way of searching for the Trident of Poseidon, a mythical object that supposedly can be used to control the oceans – including their curses. Henry is the son of Will Turner, whom we last saw in the third ""Pirates"" movie, and Henry wants the Trident so he can free his father from his cursed existence aboard the ghost ship known as the Flying Dutchman. Carina thinks she can find the Trident – and she wants to do so very badly – as a way to connect her to the seafaring father whom she never knew. In the chaos that ensues as Jack's crew, led by his friend and First Mate Joshamee Gibbs (Kevin McNally), frees Jack from the guillotine, Henry saves Carina from the hangman's noose and a big new team is formed. Captain Jack, always up for an adventure, loads everyone onto the Dying Gull and they shove off.Not surprisingly, this mission won't exactly be smooth sailing. Jack is being pursued by an undead Spanish naval officer and former pirate hunter called Captain Armando Salazar (Javier Bardem) and his (literally) rotten crew on a ghost ship of their own. Captain Salazar blames Jack for his fate and that of his crew (which we understand after seeing a very informative flashback sequence). He wants nothing more than to see Jack dead – and also to get a hold of the Trident so he can break free of his curse. While searching for Jack, Salazar cruises the Caribbean, destroying every ship and killing every crew in his deadly path. When he comes upon the ship commanded by Captain Jack's old First Mate and rival, Captain Hector Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), convinces Captain Salazar to spare his life so he can help find Jack. Plus, Barbossa wouldn't mind getting his own hands on the Trident of Poseidon in the process.""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales"" is an entertaining return to the roots of this lucrative cinematic franchise. With a new crew on deck (the directing team of Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg, screenwriter Jeff Nathanson and composer Geoff Zanelli), the intention was to get back to the relative simplicity, sense of adventure and heart of the original. There's still a lot going on in this movie, but the plot is relatively straightforward (even if it feels a bit contrived) and it's definitely less bloated than the previous installment(s). This one also nicely ties up its storyline (along with some others from earlier in the series), while a post-credits scene makes it clear that there are potentially more stories to tell. But as far as 2017 is concerned, the fifth film displays the great acting, the sense of humor and the action-packed spirit of fun for which the franchise is known – plus the heart of the earlier films.

Passable time-waster.,"Disney's ghoulish swashbuckling adventure rages on with a sequel that sees the indomitable Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) reluctantly team up with Henry 'son of Will' Turner (Aussie youngster Brenton Thwaites) to find the trident of Poseidon. Six years after the dull On Stranger Tides proved this seafaring franchise should take its last sip of rum, instalment number five, although a step up, does little to change that viewpoint. Battling against a mishmash script that doesn't bother to hide its contrivances or uninspired storyline — save for a neat subplot that ties up loose ends — this outing lives and dies by its big budget set pieces and tongue in cheek humour. And signs are positive for the first hour or so. A wildly ambitious, exhilarating and funny bank robbery sequence is the perfect introduction to a still-drunk Jack Sparrow, and an early demonstration that Norwegian directors Joachim Ronning and Espen Sandberg could breathe life into the 14-year-old series. But they well and truly run out of gas by the tremendously tedious third act; the set pieces become increasingly muddled and so CGI-heavy that the undersea finale may as well be a cartoon. Brought on board as the murderous, revenge-filled Captain Salazar — and given an awesome vessel-devouring ghost ship to boot — Javier Bardem's swishy-haired and tar-drooling villain is a delight to watch. Pity the rest of the cast don't leave the same impression. Depp can do Sparrow in his sleep by this point, which is the heart of the problem. The drunken sway, slurred words and permanently confused expression still provide the odd giggle here and there, yet it just as often draws yawns and eye-rolling. If you're a big fan of this franchise then there's enough here to keep you entertained, but on the whole Dead Men Tell No Tales is a merely passable time-waster.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
We needed more scenes with Will and Elizabeth,"As other posters here, I grew up watching Pirates of the Caribbean. To the point I was literally obsessed with the franchise. I have watched the first one countless times (more than 10 for sure), and the others, while not my favorite, at least 5 or more times. Maybe it is because I was a little girl when I started watching them, but I have always loved all installments. Including this new one.When they said that Orlando Bloom (Will Turner), and Keira Knightley (Elizabeth Swann)were returning, I was so happy. But they only appeared on screen for a couple of minutes that I think it was not worth it. I know Keira said sometime ago that she would never return to the franchise but this return was kind of disappointing. Maybe if they did 10 minutes of screen appearance I would have been content.On another hand, while it is predictable, it is also a very entertaining film. It had all the points of the previous ones that made it a really fun watch.I do really recommend it, specially to people like me who grew watching this, and to teenagers. Kids under 12 might go with parents. But after all, then I remember I was barely 8 when the first one was premiered, and my little sister was 6, and besides my sister saying ""Rum for all"" at every family gathering, we didn't understand the double-meanings until we were teens and adults.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
In five words: A tale not worth telling.,"The fifth movie in the Pirates of The Caribbean franchise is promoted as the final chapter. It will be the last time we'll see Jack Sparrow sail the open seas on the Black Pearl and follow him on a crazy adventure, depending on the box office results off course. So did they close the franchise with a swansong or did they jump the shark. Well let's order some rum and ""drink up me hearties yoho!"" and dive into ""Davy Jones' locker"" to review this movie.First some background about the franchise. Pirates of the Caribbean is a movie franchise that started strong with a movie that breathed new life into the pirate movie genre in 2003. A genre that died in 1996 with Cutthroat Island starring Geena Davis. The first movie ""The Curse of The Black Pearl"" is a good and entertaining movie with a strong story and well balanced action and humor. This is also the first time we see Johnny Depp play a drunk and brilliant pirate named Jack Sparrow.Following the success of The Black Pearl, Disney decided to shoot the back-to-back resulting in mediocre action movies with a convoluted story. The fourth movie however completely jumped the shark by including an uninteresting villain and a story that made no sense; furthermore it primarily focused on Jack Sparrow. Don't take me wrong, Jack Sparrow is a brilliant and funny character; however the fourth installment showed us that he can't carry a movie. So how is the fifth and final movie?Story: The fifth movie is about a boy named Henry Turner whom wants to find the trident of Poseidon in order to free his father from a curse. To achieve this he needs the help of Jack Sparrow and a horologist named Carina Smyth. During this endeavor they are followed by Captain Salazar an old enemy of Jack Sparrow's and he is seeking revenge. While this is the main outline there are also multiple other side stories and none of them are paid-off properly, resulting in some plot holes. Basically they tried to juggle too many story lines and in the end they ended up with nothing. A shame though because there is a specific side-story about the character Carina Smyth that had much potential and in my opinion should've been the main story.Characters: There are too many characters in this movie and they all do not have enough screen time to fully develop. Together with an unfocused story it isn't always clear who the main character truly is:Carina Smyth (played by: Kaya Scodelario), a girl who tried to follow in her father's footsteps as a scientist. She is headstrong, inventive and personally I think she should have been the main focus of the movie. Her story has so much potential. She is portrait reasonably by Kaya and I think she can do better, however the script is letting her down.Henry Turner (played by: Brenton Thwaites), the son of the main character from the previous movies Will Turner (played by: Orlando Bloom aka Legolas). He is adventures, innocent and focused on freeing his father from the curse. He doesn't really do much in the movie. A forgettable character and the performance by Brenton was bland.Jack Sparrow (played by: Johnny Depp), worst performance yet by Depp. The character was entertaining in the previous movies, partly because we see a new side of Jack Sparrow, in this we're just going through the motions. While it is interesting to see his younger self and his relation with Captain Salazar it is regrettable that we never truly see this character grow.Hector Barbossa (played by: Geoffrey Rush), I've said it once and I'm saying it again he should've been the lead in the previous movie and especially this movie. I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll keep it a bit cryptic. His part in this movie is a little short; however it has soooooo much potential. If only Geoffrey Rush had more lines and a better script this movie could've been great.Cinematography: Nothing truly noteworthy. If you've seen the previous movies you'll know that the in camera shots on the sea are beautiful to look at. The CGI effects are a little dated but still good enough.Three-Act-Structure: Beginning: The movie starts strong, mysterious followed by over the top action. However, after I don't know how long (felt like an hour), they were still introducing characters and unnecessarily fighting and it dragged.Middle: Almost non-existent mostly action scenes and no character development. At least none that truly mattered.End: Really, this movie has a dragged out beginning, and after that an anticlimactic ending. Because the movie doesn't give us any time to truly connect with the characters. They are mostly used to setup the next action scene or plot. And because of this we are not emotionally invested in their motivations and choices, resulting in a specific moment at the end of the movie that really wasn't earned.Conclusion: A shame that is the only thing I can truly and honestly say about this movie. If they only had focused the story on the female lead Carina and invested time and money to rewrite the script they could've made one of the best pirates movie to end the franchise. As aforementioned, most of the stories aren't fleshed out properly and even though Salazar is portrait as the main villain he didn't leave an impression on me. It was mostly a copy paste work with interesting ideas and some with much potential.So even though this movie isn't any good it is important to note that it didn't commit the unforgivable SIN a movie can ever commit and that is being boring. If you don't overthink it and just go with the flow, I think you'll have a good time.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"If you liked Pirates for their comedy, this is your movie.","The reason I loved this one was because it was humorous and it had a plot. Unlike 'At World's End', this movie wasn't jumpy with 50 different plots. It had one focus that made since but still had a lot of action.'Dead Man's Chest' is still my favorite, but this one really hit the box office. I know there are many mixed reviews about this movie, but most of the people saying ""We don't need another Pirates"" likely haven't even seen it. It's just like 'Diary of A Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul.' People should at least give it a chance before jumping to conclusions about the new cast. But anyway, this Pirates of the Caribbean was by far the funniest. The action was a little hard to see at first, meaning the camera angle, but the final battle turned out amazingly. I encourage all of you to see it, even if it means having someone babysit your 2-year-old child.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The entirely worn-out 'Pirates' franchise stands to prove that that the Dead do in fact continue to Tell Tales.,"It seems that the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' franchise will keep sailing until star Johnny Depp decides to hang up those washed out boots. 'Dead Men Tell No Tales' (or the significantly inferior 'Salazar's Revenge' in the UK, which I refuse to refer to it as,) has some fantastic moments, but its nadirs are so low that it is hard to relate to at points, churning out the same thrills, the same problems, and the same franchise developing plot devices that culminate to form a generally uninspiring sequel, which promises that more of the same is still yet to come.The so-called ""beginning of the end"" to the 'Pirates' series sees the return of familiar faces, notably Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley - whose cameos comprise some of the most moving moments in the film - alongside newcomers Brenton Thwaites and Kaya Scodelario as Henry Turner and Carina Smyth respectively. The plot follows the latter duo on their journey to find the Trident of Poseidon with Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow, who seems somewhat unassured in the role this time round, and Geoffrey Rush's fantastic Captain Barbossa (the best developed character in the entire series). This is all whilst being chased by an undead sea crew, headed by Javier Bardem's Captain Salazar. Oh, and of course, the protagonists also have some altercations with the British Empire along the way (an entirely pointless sub-plot that only adds to the convolution of the narrative).The motives are identified clearly from the start and founded upon rather basic principles, making it easier to follow than other 'Pirates' films, and it relates back to the beloved trilogy a lot more than the miserable 'On Stranger Tides'. But these aspects are often too plainly reiterated to the viewer that it hollows the plot disproportionately, sacrificing the development of potentially more engaging material. Bardem's antagonist thus feels loosely integrated into the franchise's narrative, which is sad given that he plays the role with natural certitude.However, during the instances where Disney is showcasing its mastering of the CGI department, or the alcohol-fuelled scenes of Jack escaping near death situations (not to mention Paul McCartney's ingenious cameo), 'Dead Men Tell No Tales' provides some undeniably delightful entertainment. Yet in terms of an original, witty, swashbuckling joy of a ride, it fails to deliver on most fronts, conforming to the structure of the preceding films but also feeling far more conveniently pieced together than ever before.It is a tale told by a franchise that should've been dead long ago; where it ought to be looking to bring back those wonderfully crafted sword fights of the first 2 films, 'Dead Men Tell No Tales' instead decides to expand its mythology to dismal effects.Figuratively, no ships are being blown out of the water by this entry.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

H2O, how Real does it look, and does it carry the significance of life with it, as water symbolically does in many ways. Action, Life and Rebounding character is what this movie conveys...along with just being an excellent example of what Disney can do, and set the standard for, many years ago; fun escapism fantasy. It reminds me of when I saw the first Indiana Jones movie or, of course, the first 'Pirates' movie. Although the follow ups are good, one always feels the first is best. This 5th in the Pirates series is as good as seeing a movie genre at first fresh viewing.

"Wait, WHAT?! Naw, this rocks!","This is the best one, although my favorite before this was Stranger tides... I always thought worlds end was too much.I was pleased when I saw that the franchise had started back up again with the trip to the fountain of youth... especially the scene with the mermaids singing... they look so beautiful, but you know something horrendous is going to happen. And it does, to Scrumm of all people, and now he becomes a member of the crew that frequently follow Jack or Barbossa around.This final film has no such trickery, no images of beauty that are representing things evil. We see the evil in all of its rotting glory, and we know what it is. It's one last major dilemma that Captain Jack Sparrah has to face, one he is responsible for, which he exacerbates by making a stupid move involving his magic Compass.I will let you figure out exactly what that is, though, by watching this.And once again we get to see Barbossa, although now he is an ally.What I really like about the Barbossa character is that he had a slight bit of domesticity in Stranger Tides, he liked being served his meals on the deck, he liked being a bourgeois officer and privateer.We see in this film, this tendency of his has carried on. He surrounds himself with Music and items that he never would have enjoyed as a pirate, when we first see him here, well, I can give you a clue: he is rocking out.This was a part of Barbossa that we never knew existed... he enjoys good things. Good food, good music. And, the man is a lot more than the apple eating pirate that we have come to love as Jack Sparrow's nemesis, and sometimes pseudo ally.But that does not make him any less dangerous, as he still has Blackbeards sword... and Barbossa has one last thing he needs to do with that sword.After that, he has one more thing he has to do. There's one more thing we learn about him that we never expected, we start getting clues in the middle of the film.But mostly this film focuses upon Henry, the son of Will Turner. And one other person of roughly the same age.This is also the final ending of the romance between Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann... or is it? There is always a reason to stay in the theater until the very very end of all of the credits, because something else is always brewing, innit?I feel badly that this was final teaser not pursued, but I hope now that it will be now that Johnny has been sufficiently ""pardoned"" (much like the character that he always plays- he always gets into a spot of a jam, and then some Governor or King or Lord gives them a ""get out of the gallows free card""...)",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"No Tales, This Movie Was Awesome😎","Pirates of The Caribbean five, with surprisingly two titles, was one of the best Pirates of The Caribbean movies ever, I have to admit. It will never beat the first one, classic, but this is definitely a second place movie! Can really see how far they have come, and how good it has become, it was a good comeback, because number three and four didn't impress. A really good comeback, and now I will tell you my favorite aspects and what was good. Great acting. Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow was awesomely preformed, as well as Javier Bardem as Captain Salazar, great visuals and effects, Pirates of The Caribbean are really good at doing that. The including of Will Turner's son, Henry, was a good way to expend the universe, and the connection between Jack and Henry was ridiculous, but in a good way. We also meet a random girl that are trying to find the same things as them, her name was Elizabeth Swann, and she wasn't the best character but acceptable. The hate between Salazar and Jack was showed in a bloody and violent way, were we also got flashbacks from their lives, what I think was needed, then we could find out even more about Captain Jack Sparrow. The iconic theme really made the work, and the movie was the perfect length. My favorite scene from this movie was when Jack and co. Was dragging a whole bank across a town, and when the action started, the suspense, and the music theme, which made the scene awesome! They are showing in this movie how women was treated back in the day, what is really important to talk about, this is a good thing that they showed in the movie. This movie can you learn a lot from, it is entertaining, full of action and funny Jack Sparrow, so this is a good comeback to film three and four👍",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Better than the  original !.. new thrills, excitement with a new tale!","The original instalment in the series captivated many with its exuberant style, actions special effects and the witty humour of Depp And then you rode it again and again and it got less fun, until finally you wondered why you like the series in the first place? And here we are with this one, a bunch ghostly villains and old Captain Jack Sparrow is back yet again to and it captivates immensely just like the original movie did...But what was amusing, clever and innovative in 2003's original, is back again.Do not read the negative review on the net saying that its a rehash of the previous movies. The acting performances are stellar and Jack sparrow is yet back with his usual charm and witty antics.Depp remains wholeheartedly the focus of this fifth Pirates film, and saying the character's loopy novelty has faded is like complaining that there are maggots in the below-decks gruel: You knew what you were getting when you came aboard.""Yes dead men tell no tales but there is indeed a new tale with this one that goes back to the previous tales to tie up everything together.

Its worst offence: it's never really entertaining.,"'Pirates Of The Caribbean: Salazar's Revenge (2017)' is the latest in its financially viable yet creatively strained swashbuckling series, hitting the UK with a baffling alternate title (who on earth is Salazar?). The thing is disappointing, for sure; it's a huge step down for the franchise, which has been consistently good since its inception. The problems mostly come from the writing, as the visuals are typically on point. We're fed the same basic story we've been getting for the past four films, stripped down to its apparent essentials but lacking in its charm. Depp seems like he's done caring, coming across as a parody of what he once was (which was, essentially, itself a parody). He unenthusiastically stumbles about almost as if really drunk, while Bardem - in potentially his worst performance - chews the scenery like an untrained puppy. The hokey, near parodic plot pushes through its intangible, CGI-fuelled action sequences as if it can't wait to be over. It all feels somewhat inconsequential, even if it attempts to tie back into the 'original trilogy'. Of course, the thing does have its moments. Some of its action is decent and Rush's Barbossa is as good as ever. In the end, though, it's just mediocre. Its worst offence is that it's never really entertaining. How many times will this series emerge from Davy Jones' locker? 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great Film and Excellent Performance ! Why so much hate for the movie ?,"I'm not going to lie, but when I went into the theatre I had mediocre expectations. Instead this film exceeded my expectations and got amazing performances mainly from Geoffrey Rush and Johnny Depp. Amazing visual effects and amazing storytelling. Back in 2003, Johnny Depp received an Academy Award nomination and a Golden Globe nomination for Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl and Recieved another Golden Globe nomination for Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest and I can go as far saying that he deserves at least another Golden Globe nomination for this Fifth Film installment. Johnny Depp needs at least one Oscar winning performance and he deserves one for this movie. Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales. But Surpisingly I enjoyed Geoffrey Rush's performance more than Johnny Depp and until you see this movie, you will understand why. He is has an Amazing performance as Captain Barbossa. Trust me, you won't be disappointed despite of the bad reviews. If your a big fan of this franchise, you will definitely see some cameos and will get excited from the Easter eggs. This is the 10th best selling movie of the year which is impressive. No wonder this a 4.5 Billion dollar Franchise !",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Like the old ones, but even better","I'll admit, I walked into the theater half-expecting this to be the dying gasps from this long-running franchise. But instead I found myself hugely entertained by this fun spectacular adventure. This is an enjoyable movie.I'd even say this installment just may be my favorite one of the franchise yet and here's why. The positives of this franchise, the huge spectacle, silly humor, and grand sense of adventure, also tended to be bogged down by its convoluted & confusing plots & mythology.But by now that we've reached this movie, it feels like they've smoothed out all the old defects in the formula, so to speak, and the result is a streamlined pirates movie, retaining all the elements that worked in the old ones, while simplifying some of the excessive plot details that tended to bog down the old ones. So while this movie doesn't necessarily feel like something new, it does feels like we're getting the same formula from all the way back to the first movie but improved.And I actually quite like that Jack Sparrow is a character who hasn't evolved one bit throughout this 14 year franchise. He's the exact same buffoon from the first movie. It's like he hasn't learned a single thing or changed at all in any of these movies. This may be the most brilliant thing about this franchise. That's why we can have this movie, so many years after the first one and still feel so much like nothing's changed, because the story really hasn't even tried to have him change as a person. And that's a good thing, because we can like his character as he has always been.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Same Old Pirates Film,"Same old Pirates film then before. I gave it a 4 out of 10 because I liked the special effect of the villain and ship but that was about it. Basically the film is about Harry's Will Turner son is trying to find Jack Sparrow to help him get the Trident to bring the curse to get Will off the Dutchman. That's it. That's the film in a nutshell but without any spoilers add in. The reason I gave the film a 4 out of 10 because it was the same old Pirates of the Caribbean film like before. Jack gets drunk, Jack gets in trouble, the British army try to capture Jack but fail, Jack is about to be killed but oh by some miracle he's rescued by some mystery person or the same old trick where Jack is about to be killed but is saved by the last minute. Ugh it was just so annoying and I heard they're making another Pirates film. Why? I'm tired of these same movies by this series so I'm probably not going to see the next film unless it's on TV or on cable. The only positive of the film was that cute guy who played Harry he was adorable so that was a plus.Should you see this film?

"Long, very long, didn't need that much, sweet...","In Pirates of the Caribbean 5: Salazar's Revenge, Captain Jack Sparrow finds the winds of ill luck blowing with greater force when a group of ghostly pirates are released by an old enemy: Captain Salazar (Javier Bardem), who after escaping of the Devil's Triangle is determined to kill all the pirates of the sea, especially Jack Sparrow.

"Has the most ""Pirates"" feel out of the sequels","I love the Pirates of the Caribbean movies. The first one is brilliant and the others are kinda good as well. One of the problems with the sequels was that they really did not feel like the original. This movie does however. It has great pace, simple story and fun humor. It is also one of the movies with the most heart in it.Johnny Depp is back as Jack and he does a great job. The same goes with the new characters.My main problem with the movie is that villain(Captain Salazar). He is not really that good. He is much more of a character than Blackbeard but not anything close to Barbossa or Davy Jones. Some of the humor he tries to pull of really does not land.All in all I will say that its a fun movie.

R.I.P. Pirates of the Caribbean 2003-2017,"In the past, sequels to Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl, have been a rollercoaster in terms of quality, from the mediocre Stranger tides to the amazing At World's End, but that ends now.This movie killed the franchise. That's all that anyone really needs to know, but here's my reasoning for why.Well, first off, we were promised Will Turner and Elizabeth Swan, but Will got a very minimal role, and Elizabeth had literally thirty seconds on screen. The movie even tried to replace their characters with Henry Turner and what's-her-face mathematician girl.Of course, the movie retains amazing effects, music, and acting. But the plot of the movie killed everything. And though I blame this on the person who scripted the lines, and not Johnny Depp, but Jack Sparrow seems like a shell of his former self. Giving away the compass for a drink just doesn't seem like him. At least his comedic quotes stayed the same.Some people have recommended not watching this unless you are a big fan of the franchise. I recommend the opposite. This movie basically ruined the franchise for me, so I only recommend it to those who hated it already, because I guarantee you will love this.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Definitely the best since the first!,"The first pirates of the Caribbean is one of my all time favorite movies, unlike lots of people I really like Dead man's chest and At World's end as well. But like most people, I found on stranger tides a massive disappointment. So I was anticipating this movie for so long and when the reviews came out, I was very heartbroken. Regardless, I still went to the theater and was praying it would be good, and I am so happy to tell you the critics are dead wrong! This is a terrific film! As always, Johnny Depp as captain jack sparrow was great, and also loved the characters of Henry Turner and Carina Smyth. They both did great jobs and unlike on stranger tides, this one has characters besides captain jack, that I was interested in. Javier Bardem as Captain Salazar was so menacing and such a cool villain. He actually has a lot of depth and motivation to his character unlike Blackbeard. Critics are saying this film is ""boring"" but I did not find a scene that dragged on and I was very invested in the well written story of this film. My only issue with the film is I wish they would've given captain jack sparrow more to do with the plot.

"""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales""- The best in the series since the original.  Big, loud, silly dumb-fun at its finest!","I came out of the theater from seeing ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales"", the fifth chapter in the pirating adventure series, with a bit of confusion and bewilderment. Because I've been following the critics and the fans and the general audience reception, and have seen how decidedly mixed people feel towards the film. Some love it. Some hate it. And many more come out somewhere in between. What confuses me is the simple fact that, as a fan... I thought this was easily the best entry in the series since the original, and see it as a grand new installment that reinvigorated my interest in the franchise after the somewhat lackluster fourth film. Sure, it does have its moments of nonsense and a few leaps in logic here and there, but I left the movie wanting more, which is perhaps the best feeling you can leave one of these films with. I had a non-stop blast with ""Dead Men Tell No Tales"" and I didn't want it to end.Young Henry Turner (Brenton Thwaites) has spent his entire life on a mission- to try and discover a way to break the curse that binds his father William (Orlando Bloom) to the Flying Dutchman for all eternity. And he may have just found a way- the legendary Trident of Poseidon. Whomever wields this ancient weapon will have control over all the ocean and every ships that sails it. However, there's a catch- Henry will need to seek the help of the daring young scientist Carina (Kaya Scodelario) and his father's former adversary/ally Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) to get the help he needs to free his father. At the same time, Jack finds himself being pursued by a vicious ghost-ship lead by the dreaded Captain Salazar (Javier Bardem), whom holds Jack responsible for the vile curse that have kept he and his crew imprisoned somewhere in between life and death for decades. And so, our heroes must try and race to get to the trident first (eventually joined by Barbossa, once again played by the delightful Geoffrey Rush) before Salazar can have his revenge...Directed by the Norwegian duo of Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg from a script by Jeff Nathanson, ""Dead Men Tell No Tales"" is a good example of classic ""dumb-fun"" done right. It never takes itself completely serious, and is simply here to entertain us with another story of adventure. It's filled to burst with oft-clever action, non-stop gags and consistently thrilling visual effects set-pieces while only occasionally slowing down to throw some story or minor character- development our way. In some ways, I feel this follow-up has rectified one of the major faults of the past few entries in the series- it never goes too dark, and it never outstays its welcome with needlessly convoluted storytelling. This is a fast, concise bit of entertainment. Rønning and Sandberg are cool and confident with their slick visuals and sometimes jaw-dropping action, and they cement themselves as a good fit for the material by the time the first major action set-piece is finished. Sometimes I did miss the weirdly gritty aesthetic of original director Gore Verbinski, but I think the new creative team does an admirable job at continuing the franchise without simply just repeating what came before with less gusto... Which is a major issue that I felt dragged down the previous installment, ""On Stranger Tides.""The cast is great fun as always. While Johnny Depp could play Sparrow in his sleep by now, it's always a pleasure seeing him on the big-screen and he's charming as always. He's a bit more broad this time around, but I didn't mind it. Rush and Bardem are great foils to Jack, with Rush once again often stealing scenes and Bardem being just a delightfully disgusting baddie that you'll love to hate. It was also fun seeing Orlando Bloom back, even if his role is fairly small. Will turner is a key character in the franchise, so it's good seeing this film honoring the series. Where the cast starts to shake a bit is with newcomers Brenton Thwaites and Kaya Scodelario. Don't get me wrong. They're both likable and charming. And they play well enough off of one-another. I think the problem is the script, which is clearly trying a bit too hard to make them the new surrogate replacements for the original characters Will Turner and Elizabeth Swan. Thwaites does well playing the child of those two, but comes off too often as a slightly tamed-down William. Scodelario fares much better as a feisty woman of science, but again... she's a bit too similar to Elizabeth to stand on her own. Though I like the characters just enough that I wouldn't be opposed to seeing more of them.This isn't a film without flaws by any means, however. While I appreciated the quicker pace and simplified storyline, the film can sometimes rocket through key moments or leave minor characters in the dust, which is a shame considering there's a larger ensemble cast. Some of the action can be a bit far-fetched even by ""Pirates"" standards. And I felt the climax almost felt like it came out of nowhere. But those issues cannot detract from the sheer fun I had with the film. And I really can't wrap my head around the mixed reception. It's a tight, fun film with non-stop thrills and a fair share of laughs and giggles. Just like the original that people love so much. And it stars several characters we've come to love to boot! That's what I wanted. And that's what I got. It's not a perfect film. But I found it to be a charming and more-than-adequate return for the franchise that left me satisfied and even craving more. What more could you want?As a fan of this series, I give ""Dead Men Tell No Tales"" a very good 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I mostly enjoyed the film.,"'PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: DEAD MEN TELL NO TALES': Four Stars (Out of Five)The fifth film in the 'PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN' film franchise, with Johnny Depp once again reprising his role as Captain Jack Sparrow. In this installment Jack must locate an artifact called the Trident of Poseidon, in order to stop his old enemy Armando Salazar, and his Spanish ghost navy crew, from controlling the seas and killing every pirate on them. The film was directed by Joachim Ronning and Espen Sandberg, who also co-directed the 2006 western-comedy 'BANDIDAS' (starring Salma Hayek and Penelope Cruz). Jerry Bruckheimer once again produced the movie, and it was written by Jeff Nathanson and Terry Rossio. It costars Brenton Thwaites, Kaya Scodelario and Javier Bardem. Kevin McNally, Geoffrey Rush, Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley all reprise their roles from the earlier films. The movie has received mostly negative reviews from critics, but it has done well at the Box Office so far (on a $230 million budget!). I think it's at least better than the last sequel.Henry Turner (Thwaites) desperately wants to break a curse that is imprisoning his father, Will Turner (Bloom). He needs an artifact called the Trident of Poseidon in order to do so. Henry believes that Captain Jack Sparrow (Depp) can help him find it. At the same time Jack's old nemesis Armando Salazar (Bardem) has escaped the Devils Triangle, with his Spanish Navy ghost crew, and he's coming for Jack. An astronomer, named Carina Smyth (Scodelario), who's also looking for the artifact, joins Henry and Jack on their journey.The movie starts out promising but (like the other installments in the series) it gets overly complicated and somewhat boring in the middle. It also ends with a great climax though. Depp is once again hilarious in the lead role, but it's definitely nothing we haven't seen him do before. The movie also has some great visuals and the action scenes are somewhat exciting too.

Love the 3 first - hate this one,"Gore Verbinsky's style cannot be replicated, as seen in this poor try-hard of a sequel. By try-hard, I mean that it's trying to blend too many different genres into one movie. First it's a flashback with a simple revenge tale, then it's lighthearted comedy for like an hour, mixed with some action and adventure. Later it tries to be dramatic and deep, but ends with an edgy and pointless climax.... if you can even call it that.The actors are wooden and boring, the effect seems like downgrades - compared to the previous movies. The dialogue seems rushed and ends up being the worst part of the long drawn out dramatic scenes.The movie never seems to find the right tempo or theme, as it shifts in between scenes from being witty - to being childish - to being downright sad. The problem here is that you don't care about the sad parts, because the characters have such a short buildup, that you never get to feel any empathy for em.

Many people complain this movie is not funny enough but this movie does not only meant to be funny, it is more like a adventurous story of Jack Sparrow. I want to watch more Pirates of the Caribbean movies. Please make more.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Below average,"Being a fan of the series, I would still recommend this if you enjoy the series, however this film is below average.The main problem is the last hour and a half or so with the island scene just wasn't done well at all, doesn't fit with the plot well, and just feels like filler that doesn't make sense.I thoroughly enjoyed the first hours action scenes as well as the last couple scenes with the water wall on each side.If you want to be able to enjoy this film, have a drink and watch along for the actions and maybe take a break in the middle to go get a refill of whatever your having.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Dead Men Tell No Tales brings the fun and wit back to the series,"The third PotC film was great (in my opinion) but lost a lot of the audience by being long and complicated. The fourth film completely lost the heart of the series, most of it not involving pirates and none of it taking place in the Caribbean. Thankfully, this fifth installment comes back to what made people love the first film. It's a swashbuckling, funny, daring, creepy, romantic, and exciting ode to the most preposterous of pirate mythology. It balances the things we expect to see with keeping us on our toes.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
3 Starts for visuals.,"Like i say in the title, this piece only gets its starts for the visual effects, which are of course fine since its a huge budget film. The story, jokes and the acting however are just like a poor parody of the former episodes. A lot of people like the first one, i really liked the second one, and i think the third was very good as well.This one you can skip, it has nothing to offer for the series, and Johnny Depp looks and sounds like he couldn't care less about doing this role anymore.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Incredible,"My favorite part of the whole Jack series. A great movie full of exhans, comedy, spectacle, drama ... And great effects. I look at it once again and I will never get tired. The latter is being exported not only to this film but also to the whole series. Bravo to all the people who are behind this movie adventure.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Sad, Terrible Way To Bid Jack Sparrow Farewell","The Pirates franchise seems to be nearing its demise, as it spirals down further with Salazar Revenge's boring and repetitive offerings. The sense of exciting adventure for instance, has dissipated, through fantastical pieces that are FAR from impressive and forced. The presence and scenes of its newest characters suffer the same un-stimulating vibe, with one dimensional blandness given to their personas & an out of place romance story that doesn't quite level with Will & Elizabeth's appealing pairing. Also, the absence of chemistry with Johnny Depp was glaring, ushering this unconvincing show of camaraderie. The picture's treatment of my favorite characters such as Geoffrey Rush' Barbossa, was another nuisance, relegating the supposedly polarizing pirate, as a forgettable sidekick with dramatic arcs that were difficult to actually care for. As for dear ol' Jack Sparrow, it was disappointing to witness this rendition that screams washed and aging. Gone are the endearing, eccentric mannerisms leaving only a drunk, filthy, occasionally comedic character that is borderline watchable.In case not clear, Salazar's Revenge continues the downtrend of Pirates and should be considered THE LAST HURRAH, if you can call this forgettable blunder that. Its unimaginative everything that attempts to re-hash its predecessor's winning attempts sees to this, wasting away the pristine, Oscar-worthy visuals effects & Javier Bardem's praise-worthy portrayal of Salazar. Au revoir les pirates!",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
If you love CGI this one for you.,"This movie is filled with CGI effects. If you love that sort of movie then by all means this is right up alley. Looking for a movie that has a great story and brings new life to this series then you are sadly mistaken. It lakes a great story. There is one there but, have to use special effects in order to tell it. Sad that a once decent series has come down to this. Two movies to many I'm afraid. Time to truly let this franchise sink to the bottom never to be seen again. PLEASE.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
