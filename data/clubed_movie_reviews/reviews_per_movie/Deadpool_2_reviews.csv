Honest review of all 3 versions,"It's true that you can have too much of a good thing...please no more different editions!THEATRICAL CUT - was the best version of any of the ""cuts"" it was the most cleanly edited and it had the best soundtrack out of the three. It is clear after seeing all the versions of the film that they tested all of the jokes and the ones included were cherry picked, and the best were picked to be included in this one.SUPER DUPER CUT/EXTENDED - this was supposed to be an extended version of the film but it was actually a different cut...what I mean by that is that they changed the soundtrack and they cut out what I considered to be some of the funniest jokes from the theatrical cut and replaced them. They ALSO added some additional footage to the film after making those changes. This version of the film feels darker and less funny to me personally so I prefer the theatrical cut over it.ONCE UPON A DEADPOOL/PG13 - This is the edition that nobody asked for and is the most unnecessary. From an editing standpoint this version of film is very sloppy, and seems like one giant montage. They don't even start this version of the film out at the beginning it jumps right into the ""safe room scene"". A lot of the footage included in this edition was already available on the home releases and online (apart from the short amount filmed with Fred Savage). The movie would end up edited on TV regardless of this edition existing or not. So in reality there was no need for this edition to exist apart from making more money.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Captain Deadpool 2,"Sequels are tough. When I first saw this, I didn't think it quite lived up to the first but on rewatch that's flipped a bit. It's still a flawless Reynolds performance but now he has a solid supporting cast around him, a story that has some meat on it and, surprisingly some growth for the Merc with the Mouth. Still flawed, but so much fun.Also, much love for Domino and Cable here.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Deadpool 2 is a great sequel, suited for adults as well. The same hilarious and riveting action as in Deadpool 1, but with more credible characters and better oneliners.","A suicidal superhero comes to the rescue of a fat superhero kid who has got no friends. Will they live happily ever after? I didnt really like Deadpool 1, but I did like this sequel, because the jokes are better and thankfully there are some breathers in between the action scenes, so adults, who value characters and a good story, will be able to appreciate this movie as well.Deadpool 1 had a too fastpaced tempo, which destroyed the fabric of the movie. Deadpool 1 was more of a longwinding gimmick, this time around though the characters and the story can be enjoyed though in a normal pace, which makes for a lot more pleasurable watching experience. The action is still fantastic, but even the action is more enjoyable, because it isnt non stop as it was in Deadpool 1. A pause now and then, with some hilarious sentimental scenes between the characters, greatly enhances the fun for me of watching these sort of bizarre action comedies, which are usually only made for teenagers, but as I said before this movie can be enjoyed by adults as well.Watch out for some great short cameos by Brad Pitt and Matt Damon. And there is some great seventies and eighties music to be heard by: Dolly Parton, AC/DC, Enya, Barbara Streisand and lots of others, whose music is truly hilarious in the context of this bizarre superhero story.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Hilariously funny: a great follow-up to the first Deadpool movie,"After his trials and tribulations in the first movie, the life of Wade Wilson (aka Deadpool) has now settled down. He's still killing bad guys, but it's more business-as-usual now. Moreover, he and girlfriend Vanessa are madly in love and want to start a family. Then a tragic event throws his life into disarray.The first Deadpool movie was great, and was a very pleasant surprise, being a comic book movie. Instead of the usual CGI-driven, all style no substance, drivel that most comic book movies are, Deadpool was a comedy, and a really good one. Outrageously funny, original and entertaining. Clever, snappy, laugh-a-minute dialogue. Some great cultural references and in-jokes, especially regarding other comic book movies.Deadpool 2 continues in the same vein. Some brilliantly funny, laugh-out-loud moments, often based around in-jokes, cultural references and film-industry-deprecating humour.More action than the first, which is disappointing. Part of Deadpool's charm is that it parodies other comic book movies. By becoming an action movie it threatens to become what it is parodying. There's always an element of humour involved though, even in the deadliest fight scenes, and in so doing the writer and director manage to avoid the hypocrisy of the film becoming what it mocks.Great work again from Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool: his comedic timing and delivery is spot-on. Good supporting cast, with Josh Brolin playing a great straight character to Reynolds' clowning.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Nice sequel,"I actually like this better than the original which hardly ever happens. Not for the kids but damn it's entertaining for adults.

Entertaining,Most superhero films are just tedious and boring because there's no elements of threats or worry that the characters might not make it through. You simply cannot emote to any of the superhero films unless you have severe emotional developmental problems or you are under the age of 12.Thankfully in Deadpool can overlook do usual tropes and stereotypes because it has a quite a bit of humor. The action displayed pretty entertaining too.,6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The humor is what makes Deadpool better than all the other superheroes.,"I'm not a huge fan of comic character movies even though I watch them all but Deadpool is definitely my favorite Marvel character. I guess it's because he's just a bit kinkier with his sometimes vulgar sense of humor. That's something you will never see in the other Marvel or DC Comics movies. Deadpool doesn't fit in that family package as his constant humor is just above the edge. I'm normally not a huge fan of Ryan Reynolds either but I have to admit that his Deadpool character fits him as a glove. About the story it's a typical superhero against evil like all other superhero movies but that little humorous touch makes all the difference. And for a sequel it's a good one, just waiting for a third one now.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Deadpool 2: Worthy sequel,"I loved Deadpool (2016) I was blown away by it and Reynolds commitment to the character, it was fantastic.I was however heartbroken when I saw the first trailer for this sequel, it looked pants. Not just pants, I mean granny pants. 15yr old, torn, badly stained (4 different shades) granny pants.I've never been so happy about being wrong. Deadpool 2 delivers and is easily comparable in quality to the first movie and I sure as hell did not expect that.With fantastic new additions, all the returning cast and excellent cameos this is the Deadpool sequel I desired but didn't expect (Or possibly deserve).With it's brand of over the top violence, quick fire humour, endless pop culture references and Reynolds in the role he was born to play Deadpool 2 is a worthy sequel in a franchise that I don't ever want to end if it continues like this.So damn funny, I can't wait to see what they do with the third movie. The concept however of bringing Deadpool into the existing Marvel Universe though fills me with dread. How could Deadpools brand of R rated goodness possibly fit into the Disney universe? Don't........do it!The Good:Cast are fantastic againSo damn funnyAction packedSoundtrack as random as it may beThe incredible during credits scenesThe Bad:That kid, he's just beyond annoying in everything he's inSome questionable casting choices for the new charactersThings I Learnt From This Movie:Everyday should be international womans dayVinnie Jones is all grown up",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Successful Sequel,"Deadpool 2 masterfully pushes the wild humor and emotion to new heights, which sufficiently covers up narrative flaws and a misstepped social commentary.
Compared to Deadpool, Deadpool 2 seems more comfortable handling the elements that made the original a success. The humor is bolder and more self-aware because the audience is already familiar with the characters. Ryan Reynolds masters the tricky balance between heavy emotion and outrageous wisecracks because the audience is trained to expect a joke for every heartfelt scene, and the movie gladly obliges. Every trick in the book is used to evoke emotional responses, but the winks to the audience make such manipulation acceptable, even welcome. 
For those worried that Deadpool 2 is more of the same, they needn't fret. The movie introduces a handful of new characters, each well-acted and funny in their own way. There are also some celebrity cameos sprinkled in. Sure, some of them are there solely to make a joke or two, but a couple of the new characters clearly places in future movies. 
Compared to some superhero movies, Deadpool 2 has a streamlined narrative and pulls off a highly successful third act. The climax of the movie not only avoids the Marvel ""villain problem,"" but it's also packed with great action, hilarious jokes, and solid character moments. This success overshadows some plot inconsistencies in the first and second act, which are minor but might bother some hypercritical audience members.
Despite Deadpool 2's undeniable strengths, two features hold it back slightly. First, the subject of death is handled with such inconsistency that it seems jarring. One character's death is an unspeakable tragedy, while another's is just a comic bit. The movie missed an opportunity to make fun of the careless treatment of civilian deaths in comic-book movies, but instead fell into the trope. Deadpool 2 also tried to make a progressive commentary on diversity in superhero films, but its minority characters did not have particularly strong roles. Thus, this commentary seemed a bit undeserved and out-of-place. 
For fans of the original Deadpool, the sequel will not disappoint. The movie capitalizes on what it did well in the first movie and the result is a riotously entertaining, surprisingly emotional, and satisfying second installment.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
No more sequels please,"Did you ever have a friend who constantly made snide remarks to try to make people laugh in order to draw attention to themselves and become liked? It works at first but after awhile becomes so annoying people quit laughing and just start ignoring the person. That basically sums up this movie. Funny for about 10 minutes, tolerable for the next 10 minutes, and annoying for the rest of the movie.As a result this movie quickly became a long, boring, clichéd. over hyped, unfunny, annoying, and disappointing mess. Linear storyline, no plot twists, forgettable characters (with the exception of Domino), uneven pacing, marginal acting, and just totally forgettable. The entire movie was lazy writing!One star for the character of Domino and one star for the rather interesting trailer insert at then end of the movie but other than that not worth watching much less paying to see it first run.Look for this one to be out in DVD by July and in the discount movie bins at Walmart by Christmas.",2.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Loved it,"Your going to be hard pressed to find a movie more over the top than Deadpool 2, David leitch takes it to a whole new level entirely. It works namely because the violence here is just to creative.

Do not go into this movie expecting deep plot, meaningful conversations among characters, or anything remotely resembling a serious action or drama movie.Loved it....",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Far from dead in the pool,"Like Marvel films better than some do, have never been and never will be part of this ridiculous MCU vs DCU war, and the positive critical reception drew me in to seeing 'Deadpool 2'.Being someone who really enjoyed 'Deadpool', though not completely loving it, expectations were high for the sequel and they were met. Like 'Deadpool', 'Deadpool 2' was very entertaining, and again credit is due for trying to take more of a comedic edge to a genre that can be taken seriously (sometimes overly so) and for taking risks. It's also a very good film and count me in as another person who found it an even better film than its predecessor (not many superior sequels out there), being funnier and more ambitious with a much better and memorable villain.'Deadpool 2' for me did have its issues. There are instances where the special effects are rather ropy and artificial-looking.Also personally found Julian Dennison on the annoying side and parts of the story are disjointed.However, 'Deadpool 2' is very well made visually. Slick, stylish and brooding with generally typically well crafted effects. The music is haunting and rousing and most of the direction is very assured and sharp, and more in control of the tonal balances. The action is dynamically choreographed and exciting (the parachuting is unforgettable), the scale bigger and bolder, and the romantic and emotional elements just about avoid the mawkish sentimentality trap and instead give 'Deadpool 2' its heart. While not quite as resonant as in the first 'Deadpool' there is more of the man behind the mask.Most of the humour is very funny and has enough freshness, though its extremely black and sometimes crude comedic nature again has proven to be an acquired taste. The jokes are more consistent and there are less ""don't quite land"" ones, while there is the vulgarity, the crudeness does not go overboard. As said, that it, like the first 'Deadpool', that tried to incorporate humour into an often taken seriously genre was interesting and refreshing. The story is a pretty lightweight one structurally, while showing more ambition in depth and scale than its predecessor, and is occasionally disjointed, but the hugely energetic pace, emotion, tension and sense of fun elevated it. The final act is much better here, more exciting, less muddled and doesn't feel rushed.Ryan Reynolds brings charismatic charisma, vulnerability and great comic timing to the title role, one he was born to play and he successfully allows one to root for his character. Even better is a brilliant Josh Brolin, bringing all the qualities, but with more gruffness and even more menace, that made Thanos in 'Avengers: Infinity War' such a great character and makes Cable a significant improvement by far over the villain in the first film, being actually memorable.Zazie Beetz was a fun addition as Domino (don't agree with the criticisms directed against her), Morena Baccarin and her chemistry with Reynolds still has heart and all the cameos from the X-force members sparkle.Overall, highly entertaining and a sequel and overall film that ticked most of the right boxes. 8/10 Bethany Cox",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Although it is a cliché, it is basically done properly","The script is barely fluent, but the first half is too sluggish. Of course, this practice of letting jokes go beyond the script may also be the intention of director and screenwriter. Although it is not conducive to the integrity of the film, it does attract some audience.
In terms of the construction of the world view, the film is not as sluggish as the Avengers, but it is also rougher (and perhaps a stylized choice), and basically only takes care of a specific audience. This is also a common problem of all kinds of mainstream superhero movies.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Fun yet getting old,"Well, I am quite a big fan of the X-Men and X-Force franchises and found this film quite an enjoyment. It's still got that Deadpool charm of the first movie with some great action. While this movie could have been perfect, I found that it overly referenced the Marvel universe in a way that took me out of the movie. I get that it's part of the humour, but it made the film just a fun one time watch rather than a true rewatchable masterpiece.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"*More Merc, More Mayhem*","First of all i want to say, i didn't watch Deadpool 1 and 2 until today. I watched both films because Wolverine is in Films 3rd instalment. I watched both movies in one day and i must ask myself why didn't i watched these films before?Deadpool 2 is an even wilder and more ambitious sequel that surpasses its predecessor in nearly every way. It retains the irreverent humor and fourth-wall-breaking antics that made the first film a hit, while expanding the world and introducing a host of memorable new characters.The X-Force sequence is a masterstroke of comedic timing and brutal efficiency. The film doesn't shy away from killing off characters, a bold move that sets it apart from the typical superhero fare. Domino, with her uncanny luck, shines in this sequence, becoming an instant fan favorite.Ryan Reynolds once again delivers a tour-de-force performance, effortlessly balancing comedy, action, and heart. Cable is a formidable addition to the Deadpool universe. Josh Brolin brings a gravitas to the role that contrasts perfectly with Ryan Reynolds' manic energy. Their dynamic is a highlight, with Cable's seriousness often clashing hilariously with Deadpool's absurdity.The film's emotional core is unexpected. Colossus' sacrifice is a gut-wrenching moment that adds depth to the story. Deadpool's journey of grief and redemption is handled with surprising sensitivity. The ending, with the introduction of young mutant Firefist, hints at a potential new direction for the franchise.The action sequences are even more spectacular and creatively choreographed than in the first film. The film doesn't shy away from violence, but it's always delivered with a wink and a nudge. The emotional core of the film, however, is what truly sets it apart. Deadpool's journey through loss and grief adds depth and complexity to the character, making him even more relatable.Deadpool 2 is a masterclass in balancing humor, action, and heart. It's a film that respects its audience while pushing the boundaries of the superhero genre.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Deadpool 2 is Alive of Pooling for Great Entertainment Purposes.,"Delivering a sequel means that the predecessor is a mainstream hit and a big success. Audience wants what they saw before but keep in mind that they too do not want to see what they saw before off of the previous installment. The quality of driving the path of a sequel has always been the journey of a bumpy ride of whether that movie successfully dodges the bullets of negative reviews or hits the bullseye mark of getting bad responses from the audience. Walk the talk, does Deadpool 2 live up to people's expectation???Deadpool 1 has been a massive hit and die-hard fans have been asking for the second entry ever since. This mischief premise opens with Ryan's character, Wade Wilson babbles about his ongoing life and what has happened to him before we get to witness what brings him to be of that kind of emotional feelings that struck him to that day.The plot here is rather simple compared to the previous movie. He keeps to his promises to narrate his own story. The dark green-blue tone appears once again to help telling Deadpool's depressing story who is bent on taking revenge for the miserable life he had. Deadpool 2 also shares an unbelievable delightful moral lesson as the curtains closes its storytelling.This sequel delivers a top notch comedy compared to the original entry. It leaves you wanting more between stupid physical antics and harsh banters. However, there is a massive problem for the jokes to work out for people who do not have the knowledge of pop cultures. Why? Because David Leitch (Director) and the writers make use of mega-hit pop culture references from the latest biggest opening movie of all time, Avengers: Infinity War to the try-hard erotic sexual romance, Basic Instinct. There are so many of them you definitely can't count with your own fingers. Nevertheless, what makes Deadpool so fun is that the lead character is fully aware of this and is constantly commenting on it. This proves surprisingly fruitful terrain for a comic book movie.Action-packed? Well, I hate to tell you this but it's not much. Basically, the probability of of action scenes is of the same percentage as the first one but it's more promising and stylish with Hollywood effects being thrown around for the sake of a good quality movie. Similar to Deadpool 1, the Big Finale is relatively small. It turns off people who are awaiting to hit a gigantic impact in the face for a final showdown because it does the same mistake by wasting the potential energy for the heroes to show off their mega powers and use the advantage to build the characters' developments with violence especially when it is given the golden ticket for a rated-R film. However, the problem with Deadpool entries is that it tries to be semi-realistic in the sense of a comic book movie with less action scenes and centralizes more of real-life teenage hormones affection. Ex: Dirty jokes, dumb characters.You must be wondering the entirety value of the post-credits scene of either it's a precious gem or another waste sequence of garbage merely to fill up its holes for future entries/entertainment purposes. First off, Deadpool 2 as the title says, gives the audience two end-credit scenes. Ladies and gentlemen, the wait for the scenes are worth it! Hilarious is the perfect word to describe how the audience feels of watching 'em. They don't relate much with the whole story but the crack jokes are powerful enough to make people care of the clips. But again, pop culture references are used in the making.Verdict: 72/100. I personally feel that the sequel is better than its predecessor. It delivers humorous comedy that tickles both your brain and body. Deadpool 2 proves yet again that it is immature, childish, mischievous and entertaining in good ways. It also proves that Ryan Reynolds once again doesn't disappoint audience with his born-natural character. This is a movie that makes space for violence, sex, and swear words, but never bites the hand feeding it by diverging from formula. If there's one thing that we all can agree on, you will have a plenty of great time watching this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Delivers the Hilarity, Vulgarity and Action-Packed Fun That I Wanted","I was able to see Deadpool 2 at an advance screening. Deadpool shook things up and delivered offbeat fun when diehard fans were looking for something new from the genre. I thought it was a surprisingly well-rounded movie that perfectly encapsulated its hero and lovingly poked fun at both itself and other genre tropes. It was among my favourite movies of 2016. When it comes to bringing the laughs, I think Deadpool 2 is just as funny as the original entry. There's even more meta jokes, the same gleefully dirty spirit carries over and some unexpected payoffs left me cackling. They build upon some of the previous memorable bits (I admire Ryan for being so willing to relentlessly skewer his filmography) without it going stale. Luckily, they didn't ruin the movie by putting all the funny bits in the trailer and there's plenty to enjoy. They weren't afraid to push the envelope with the humour and stick around past the finale for a truly epic bit that rolls during the credits.We've got all your favourite players back from Deadpool and I want to credit the writers for giving the opportunity for the characters to grow. Wade Wilson/Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) is his typical wise-cracking self but he's found happiness and the change in his relationship with Vanessa (Morena Baccarin) has really impacted his outlook. Colossus (Stefan Kapicic) and Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand) return as X-Men members and while they're familiar, they're attitude does change towards Deadpool's antics. We also get back Dopinder (Karan Soni), Weasel (T.J. Miller) and Blind Al (Leslie Uggams) as the rest of Wade's crew and they all bring something new or hilarious to the film. I also really liked the new members of the cast; Cable (Josh Brolin) and Domino (Zazie Beetz) lived up to the hype. Cable has more depth than I expected and a highlight of Deadpool 2 was how they worked in Domino's ability into the action. They were so creative in how her abilities changed the way the action flowed. I also really liked the character of Russell (Julian Dennison) and how they used him in the movie. He becomes the driving force of the plot and they shape his character in a way that finds a nice balance between too soft and too arrogant. If I had any complaints, Eddie Marsan's character is one of the weakest villains I've seen in the genre, he has little dimension and his screen time is limited. I also preferred the treatment of a few of the original characters in the initial installment (Negasonic and Blind Al were stronger in the first movie). Keep your eyes open for a couple of surprise appearances by a few famous faces in the X-Men lore.Director David Leitch is well known for his work in stunts and co-ordinating memorable action set pieces. This has carried over into his directorial efforts, I had a general knowledge of this going in, so I was expecting big things. Again, this movie rose to the task. It equals the original and, in some ways, surpasses it. I've already mentioned Domino, Colossus has a standout fight in the finale of the movie, the direction the movie decided to go with the initial X-Force mission was very surprising and I also liked Cable and Wade's first fight in the prison. The movie doesn't have a signature scene like the 12 bullets opening in Deadpool but there was never a moment that I was bored when the severed limbs were flying. Leitch and his team definitely got the job done and they balanced the humour and the thrills superbly.Ryan Reynolds followed up his signature turn as the foul-mouthed mercenary with an equally impressive performance. He's joined Hugh Jackman and Robert Downey Jr. as the benchmark of acting within the genre and I question if anyone else could even come close to him playing this character. Morena Baccarin still has great chemistry with Reynolds and their relationship remains as sweet as it did before. Brolin is appropriately cast as Cable, he lived up to high expectations and was appropriately gruff. Zazie Beetz is great as Domino, her casting was met with a lot of criticism but she's funny and I wish we had spent more time with her. Karan Soni carried over his charm from Deadpool as did Brianna Hildebrand. Julian Dennison did a solid job as Russell, I hadn't seen his previous work, but I can understand why so many people were excited to see him. Terry Crews, Bill Skarsgard, Lewis Tan and Rob Delaney were all good as the new X-Force members. Delaney was the standout as Peter. I also liked Stefan Kapicic and Leslie Uggams in their respective supporting parts.One of the more surprisingly successful parts of the original Deadpool movie was the love story between Wade and Vanessa. It was surprisingly effective, and I dug the direction they took with it. Deadpool 2 is a story about family and while it still worked, it didn't tug at my heartstrings like the emotional core of the first one did. This isn't the fault of the actors or even the writers, it just didn't have the same impact.In my opinion, this is a great sequel. It delivers a potent mix of both action and comedy. I was impressed that they refused to rest on the laurels of the original adventure and tried to do something new with it. If you found the first one too crude, too violent or too meta, I don't think this one will work for you. Its a movie that stands on its own, but you get the same creative expression as you did in the first one. I wouldn't say this is better than Deadpool, but it is on that same level for me. Its not perfect so I can't go all the way to a 10 but my actual rating is 9.5/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

An improved formula!,"Before the viewing of this film, I lowered my expectations knowing that majority of sequels are not as good as it's predecessors, but luckily the cast and crew made sure that this sequel is better in every aspect. Deadpool 2 abounds in funny moments, action scenes and importantly emotional ones, which were kind of weak in the first installment. This sequel bring some teachable moments on the table, but not too much, so the core of the movie is still very Deadpool-esque. The humor is similar to that of the first, with couple more pop culture jokes which might be a problem for some viewers, but for the most part they are easily understandable with the basic knowledge of pop culture. Along with well known original cast, we have couple of newcomers who fit in the cast perfectly. Brolin has a lot of screentime and he delivers in each scene. It features very entertaining references and cameos, and has one of the funniest post credits scenes in superhero movies, so be sure to stick around untill the very end. All in all, Deadpool 2 is a movie that can be enjoyable not only for fans of superhero genre, but for all who want to have a laugh while enjoying interesting action scenes.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

An Infusion of Fun New Characters Makes DP2 better than the First,"The first Deadpool received much acclaim for being bold and unique. Viewers loved that it did and said things other movies were not willing to do or say. That's an issue for Deadpool 2 because it's a sequel and, by definition, cannot be as bold or unique because it is, by definition, similar to the original.Many fans raised this concern about Deadpool 2. They worried it would be a rehash of the first film. I'm here to tell you that those fans are wrong. And they're also right.Sure Deadpool 2 hits many of the same beats as the original. Hearing the notes a second time ring stale in some situations, but other times the writers tweaked the gags just enough to make them feel fresh. 
 One of the simplest and best ways to make a sequel feel fresh is to add fun and interesting new characters. Mission accomplished. Domino (rising star Zazie Beetz) announces her arrival loudly with a scene-stealing performance. The movie cleverly pokes fun at her possibly fake superpower, luck, while still empowering her enough for her to easily be the coolest character in the movie.Josh Brolin also joins the cast for the sequel, making this his second villain role in a major superhero blockbuster this summer. Once again, he's terrific, settling once and for all the debate over ""can Josh Brolin succeed as an actor without a fake purple chin?"" Yes, yes he can.The weak link among the actors is Julian Dennison. He plays the powerful and troubled teen, who call himself firefist. It's a terrible name and a mostly terrible character. It's not all Dennison's fault. He is not given much to work with in this part. The best thing he does in the whole movie is point out that no superhero or sidekick or remotely powerful person in a superhero movie is anything except exceptionally fit. He's right. Why not include one chubby friend who happens to have psychic powers? Or something like that. Be creative.Firefist's relationship with Deadpool, along with some other event that I won't mention, provide the emotional stakes of the movie. My question: why is a Deadpool movie creating emotional stakes? Deadpool's entire gimmick is making fun of superhero movies and all their silly tropes, yet Deadpool 2 falls face first into those tropes.This is supposed to be an action-comedy about a smart-mouth anti-hero. It doesn't need emotions. It rolls its eyes at emotions. The entire effort felt disingenuous.The determining factor in this whole equation of movie's effectiveness is Ryan Reynolds. If you like the guy and find him charming and funny, you'll like this movie. If his schtick wears you out after a while, this movie will do the same. He rattles off what feels like nearly ten jokes per minute. Reynolds brand of comedy is an acquired taste and a potent one. A little goes a long way.Overall, this movie works. It has just enough humorous moments, new material, and truth in its characters to accomplish the goal. It's a funny, self-aware, different type of superhero movie. It manages to match, or perhaps even exceed the level of the original. That's an achievement.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Well-Done Action Packed Sequel,"As you expected, ""Deadpool 2"" is all that we expected and above. The action does not stop almost the entire movie, the new characters are great especially Cable and Domino. The humor as you can expect is something without the movie will not be the same...yet it is a distinctive feature for the character of Deadpool.The story is good and you can expect some surprising people to interfere in the the movie, but I will not tell you, see for yourself. The effects are very good, the music choice fits great with the action scenes and the individual moments in the movie.Supporting roles also do not lag behind and accumulate a lot of points. If I have to determine which is the best part of the movie, then that's undoubtedly Josh Brolin as Cable.I advise you to stay until the end of the movie, there are some pretty good things waiting for you.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"Chimichangas! X-Men! Cable! Peter...and of course, Deadpool. Check out this review of Deadpool 2 written by the Merc with a Mouth.","What's up suckas! It's your friendly Deadpool again with a bona fide sequel ready for your pleasure. You all probably remember the Oscar winning Deadpool (Fine! There were no nominations, but I should have won ""Best Actress""). It was a movie we'd tried to make for a while, but Fox wouldn't agree with the direction and the R rating that's the only way to do me justice. After much arguing and bedfellow time, Deadpool was finally made and was a big hit. That wasn't it for me. We then had shirts, cereal, a Christmas rap album, elementary school textbooks...you know, the stuff that appears everywhere!Whatever, even if one or two of those things didn't happen, Deadpool proved that there is an audience for an R rated super hero story. So now we got more money and more freedom to do what we want with our sequel. So where do we go from there? In the previous movie, I teased that Cable would finally show up. It's not Keira Knightly, but I'm happy with what we have. We've also got more meta stuff, a full team, and plenty of the gory good stuff you want. Let's explore Deadpool 2 and see if it's just as good.Just as I, Deadpool (Played by Ryan Rynolds) am settling into a nice lifestyle of sword slashing and target hunting, something awful happens to me when I nearly get myself killed...or blown up. It's only when Colossus brings me back to Xavier's (Stewart or McAvoy, take your pick) mansion where I agree to join the X-Men as a way of healing. When I try to help out a young mutant Russell Collins or Firefist (played by Julian Dennison), he and I get arrested where our powers are stripped as we try to do what we can. But that's the least of my worries.Just as prison starts to look cushy, a cybernetic solider from the future Cable (played by Josh Brolin) breaks in to apparently kill Russell. I wasn't going to let this maniac get him, so I manage to separate us, but leaving Russell still in that prison. To prevent another strike, I finally decide to start a team I call X-Force. Joining this team also includes Domino (played by Zazie Beetz), Colossus, Negasonic Teenage Warhead (played by Brianna Hildebrand), Shatterstar (played by Lewis Tan), Bedlam (played by Terry Crews) and I think a guy named Peter; no powers, but seems like a team player.What's best about Deadpool 2 is what you don't know. That's why I'm glad to say that the sequel is just as good as the first. Not better, not worst, but just as entertaining as my last outing. What's fascinating this time is that while the original Deadpool was a love story, the sequel is definitely a family story. Not that it's appropriate for children (which I'm sure they'll catch at a friends sleepover), but it's willing to dive deeper into my complex nature.I have to say that aside from Ryan Reynolds doing another phenomenal job playing me, Josh Brolin makes for a fun Cable. Like a good buddy cop story, his grizzled (but understandable) nature is a fantastic contract to my anarchy ways. Perhaps if he's lucky, he'll get his own movie. I have to give kudos to young Julian Dennison whose not only a rare big kid whose not here to make fat jokes, but carries a lot of pain from his time before. Yet, I can't give away just why, but it involves more mutant discrimination.So where does my movie not shine. I think it's from the fact that I seem too quick to the idea of joining teams even though my last movie was a tribute to why I wouldn't. That makes for a slight departure in character who only cares about himself and his close ones. That's not to say he gains new friends, but it could have used a bit more quieter moments to let it sink in. How about that humor? It hits well. My constant jokes, puns, and occasional forth wall breaks don't overshadow the movie's intent, but rather builds on that tone that people like.I'll give this eight pictures of me with super soakers out of ten. What can I say but you know what your getting if your seeing my movie. So check it out if you want an X-Force movie...or at least a Deadpool 3.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Ryan Reynolds reprises his role with a movie that does it right all across the board,"A sequel that surpasses the hit original, Deadpool 2 is laugh out loud funny the entire way through.

Overstuffed & Empty At The Same Time,"Attempting to go bigger, louder & darker than its predecessor yet feeling overstuffed & empty at the same time, the second instalment in the Merc with a Mouth saga tries so hard to be funny that its attempts only come off as desperate & off-putting. Lacking the freshness of the original and never aspiring for a proper balance between all aspects, Deadpool 2 is an overkill for the most part.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Could have been better,"I'm pretty mixed about this movie. I would say that it was better overall than the first Deadpool in terms of plot, but it wasn't nearly as funny as the first.The jokes in DP2 were a carbon copy of the original ones, but they felt too forced and fell flat more often than not. There were still scenes where I was laughing out loud, but they did not come as often as the first Deadpool. Unfortunately I think they became just a little too aware of how they could push this type of comedy and just went too far with the references and little in-jokes.I'm also mixed on the characters. Deadpool is more or less the same, as is Dopinder and most of the other side characters. I REALLY enjoyed Cable and also thought Domino was ok. Unfortunately I was very much disappointed in how they used Negasonic Teenage Warhead. In the first movie she played a useful role as the young, nihilistic, attitudinal brat that contrasted with Deadpool's over the top exuberance. In DP2 she was only there to showcase that she was a lesbian. I'm sure there is plenty of more meaningful footage of her collecting dust on the cutting room floor, because she just felt like half a character. The same thing goes for Yukio. A completely pointless character other than as a political tool.Overall it just felt like they took themselves way too seriously this time around. The first Deadpool was so clearly a gamble of a movie that they treated it as the character should be treated. This time around it felt more like a corporate owned studio movie that had to tick off their list of items/political commentary that they always need to cover rather than just making it a fun movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Exciting movie,"Foul-mouthed immortality mutant Wade Wilson (Deadpool), brings together a team of fellow mutant rogues to protect a young boy with supernatural abilities from the time-traveling cyborg Cable.

Not as good as the original,"The plot of the movie wasn't as interesting as ""Deadpool"" (2016) and it was kinda different than the first movie. The storyline was just okay, it reminded me the X-Men movies storyline. There were many new characters, but they weren't very well-developed. I prefer the characters of the original movie. It was a very intense movie, there were too many fight scenes and they were kinda better than the first movie. It was a very bloody and brutal movie (just like, Deadpool (2016) and Logan (2017)) probably the bloodiest movies of the franchise. The kills were EPIC. The opening scene of the movie was as intense as the opening scene of the original movie, it was very enjoyable. It was very funny and Ryan Reynolds was iconic, as always. The ending scene was totally unexpected and it was kinda messed up, lol. Of course, the CGI and the graphics were really good. In my opinion, the first movie was better than the second movie.

A rare case of a sequel being better than the original,"It's no secret that the first Deadpool movie was a huge hit, mainly because of its unique approach to a comic book movie, emphasizing comedy through its parody of various pop-culture references. Two years later, we now have the sequel, ""Deadpool 2"", directed by David Leitch, which is the eleventh film in Fox's X-Men film franchise. Deadpool 2 manages to be a slight improvement over its predecessor with plenty of the usual laughs you'd expect, despite having a plot that seems a little too familiar.Deadpool 2 is seemingly set shortly after the events of the first movie, with Ryan Reynolds returning as Wade Wilson/Deadpool. In this, Deadpool is up to his usual antics: fighting crime, making jokes, and embarrassing criminals. However, things soon take a turn for the worse when he comes across a young mutant named Russell (Julian Dennison), who's currently being hunted by a cybernetic soldier from the future named Cable (Josh Brolin). To stop Cable, Deadpool forms a group with other mutants and calls the group ""X-Force"". It's an interesting story, but the problem here is that some of the aspects of the plot feel a bit too familiar. It's basic plot is very similar to ""The Terminator"", a robotic guy hunting down a young boy because the boy is important in the future in some way, shape or form. Of course, it's not exactly the same, as Deadpool 2 obviously has its own narrative elements that separates it from The Terminator, but the basic plot outline is a bit too similar. Nevertheless, the story does manage to be an improvement over its predecessor, as that movie had a very formulaic and predictable plot that bogged down the overall experience. Deadpool 2's plot, while familiar in a way, is much more coherent, unpredictable, and overall more engaging and satisfying.What I really like and respect about the Deadpool series is that they don't follow the traditional comic book movie guidelines. Instead, it tries to be its own unique entity with its crude jokes and parody. Like the first film, it often breaks the ""fourth wall"" by making jokes about various other pop-culture fads and even other movies. It's a comic book movie but also a parody of everything that's popular in today's culture. It's certainly not ""kid friendly"" like Marvel's MCU movies, which is why it has an ""R"" rating. Although some may not like that, it's a refreshing and unique take on the superhero genre that helps keep it from getting stale. The movie has its fair share of jokes, but where it improves upon its predecessor is the quality of the jokes. I found myself laughing more often while watching this one compared to the first one where it only had a few decent laughs. Even though Deadpool 2 lacks the surprise element when it comes to the comedy because we knew what to expect coming into it, it still manages to be funnier than the first one, which speaks to the quality of the writing by Rhett Reese, Paul Wernick, and Reynolds. Speaking of Reynolds, he is just as good here as he was in the first movie. Many actors and actresses fit their superhero roles well, and Reynolds as Deadpool is no exception.All in all, Deadpool 2 delivers exactly what you would expect: comedy, action, and an overall good time. It ends up achieving the rare feat of improving upon the original, even if it's only a slight improvement. In the summer of big blockbusters, Deadpool 2 makes it two for two so far.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Nothing like the first,The first was much better. This is not even close...,6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Heartfelt, Tragic, and Darkly Humorous. Ups the Ante on Everything in the First.","DEADPOOL 2 is a family movie, or so claims our titular protagonist. An extremely violent, witty, fourth wall breaking family movie. At its core is a tale of loss, a tale of wanting to belong, of failed father figures, and the cycle of vengeance all wrapped in a message of overcoming personal tragedy to be better individuals. It mixes genuinely funny comedy, pop culture references and lovable characters with a deeper more personal tale of the Merc with a mouth put through .As with the first movie, DEADPOOL 2 defies genre and subverts viewer expectation at every turn. Each time a ""typical"" story beat or trope is brought up, it is soon subverted and deconstructed in the most clever way possible. An escape plan right out of PRISON BREAK? Does not end well for Wade and Russell. An action packed vehicular chase through the city? Very different from what one would expect. A team up with a bunch of badasses to form X-Force? Yup, definitely not how one would think it would go. In fact, DEADPOOL 2 subverts all expectations of what Deadpool should be about.Even the characters undergo this subversive deconstruction. The poor abused boy who's supposed to be running scared? He's starting to show the makings of a serial killer. The part man part machine time traveler Cable? He is the embodiment of ""generic 90s comic badass"" taken to its logical extremes, complete with tragic motivations, growling voice and eternal scowl. And it all works in the context of the franchise's self referential humour.Deadpool himself is slowly revealed to be a stepford smiler, using humour as a means to bury the pain he feels while he undergoes the various stages of grief. Ryan Reynolds effortlessly channels both Deadpool's funny and dramatic side, bringing an earnest portrayal that serves as the heartfelt emotional core of the film. The narrative does venture into some heavy territory, showing the initially self serving Wade subconsciously subjecting Young Russell to the same emotional neglect that his own father put him through.The script, courtesy of Rhett Reese, Paul Wernick and Reynolds himself is masterfully written, full of wit and charm. Jokes come perfectly timed where appropriate, segueing into drama and back again without coming across as jarring. It even improves on the musical aspect.The score, now composed by Tyler Bates (WATCHMEN), sounds much more epic and unique compared to the previous work by Junkie XL. The choices of songs, peppered throughout the movie, have lyrics that run parallel to what is happening in the story itself; cleverly used to heighten the emotional impact of many scenes.This is an amazing movie and a great sequel. Not perfect though. The steady clear shots and fluid fight choreography that Director David Leitch brought to movies like JOHN WICK is missing here. Instead it is replaced by rapid fire cuts and some erratic editing which, in hindsight, may have been a cost cutting measure considering how some of the special effects, particularly on some fully CGI characters, look spotty at times.Nonetheless, nitpicking aside, DEADPOOL 2 takes its titular character to new depths, ups the ante on everything that made the first movie such a hit, and then goes beyond with bigger action, a new cast of unique and relatable characters, and all while keeping it grounded in the very personal tragedy that is the life of Deadpool. Truly a movie to add in the list of great sequels.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Every bit as enjoyable as the first movie...,"Granted, I am not one that is particularly keen on superhero movies, and usually tend to only sit down to watch them with someone else who is interested in watching such movies. However, I did like the first ""Deadpool"" movie, so of course I also wanted to watch the sequel.I must admit that ""Deadpool 2"" was every bit as funny, action-packed, colorful and witty as its predecessor was. So if you enjoyed the first movie, then you will definitely also like the sequel.There was a bit more focus on humor and jokes aimed below the belt this time, so that might work against the movie if you don't even that kind of humor. I found the humor to be funny though, so it worked out well enough for me.The storyline was good, and I really liked the Cable character. And Josh Brolin was really well-cast for that role. Just puzzled me somewhat why they opted to go with him for both Cable in this movie and Thanos in the ""Avengers: Infinity War"" movie. Sure, you can't see it is him in that movie, but still...The characters in ""Deadpool 2"" were every bit as colorful, interesting and funny as the characters were in the first movie. Aside from Deadpool and Cable being favorite characters, then I also think that Domino was a rather interesting character, and they had opted for a great choice by casting Zazie Beetz for that role.The special effects were fantastic in ""Deadpool 2"", but then again they have always been so in all the Marvel movies, so I guess that is a standard of expectations for these movies.I thoroughly enjoyed ""Deadpool 2"" for what it was; which was an equally entertaining movie as the first ""Deadpool"" movie, so just lean back and enjoy the ride, have the laughs and learn new jokes as the movie progress.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Movie Review: Deadpool 2,"I'm very split on Deadpool 2. Some elements of this film is very unexpected and others are painfully predictable. I really liked certain decisions towards the middle of the film regarding Dennison's character Russell and Brolin's Cable. Reynolds is again perfect for his role and again this is a very funny movie for the most part. There are a few times where the film takes the obvious joke and doesn't let serious moments lie for as long as it should, which is an issue I had with the original. As I said up top this film can be way to predictable, this usually isn't too much of an issue but the film appears to frame it's self as completely unexpected based on a small handful of moments that on the long run don't have much of an impact on the film as a whole. All action scenes are shot extremely well, which is to be expected as the director is one of the guys behind John Wick. It's an unpopular opinion right now but I this wasn't as funny or as focused as the original and it didn't leave much of an impression on me.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Deadpool is back; as hilarious as ever,"As this sequel begins the unkillable superhero is trying to kill himself. A short flashback sequence shows the tragic events that led up to this. Inevitably he doesn't die; Colossus recovers his body parts and puts him back together. He is encouraged to become a trainee X-man but his first mission goes wrong; he realises the out of control young mutant, Russell, he is meant to stop is actually being abused at a Mutant Re-education Centre and kills one of the abusers. Deadpool and Russell are taken to a high security facility where control collars supress their mutant powers. While there Cable, a super-soldier from the future, turns up determined to kill Russell for crimes he has yet to commit. During the fight Deadpool gets out of the facility but Russell is left behind; convinced he has been abandoned. Deadpool determines to rescue him; to do that he assembles his own team of superheroes: The X-Force. Not surprisingly things do not go according to plan.If you enjoyed the original 'Deadpool' you are sure to love this; it has all the irreverence that made the original so much fun. It may be crude and violent but it isn't mean-spirited. The story starts well with his explosive suicide attempt; this is followed by a fun flashback sequence where he kills bad guys as Dolly Parton's 'Nine to Five' plays in the background (priceless) followed by a shocking tragedy. This all serves to lead to the main story about Deadpool's attempt to save Russell... this contains lots of action and plenty of good twists. Cable made a good adversary for Deadpool and the X-Force members were amusing, even if mostly ineffectual. Ryan Reynolds really carries the film as Deadpool; he is really great I the role; Josh Brolin impresses as Cable and Zazie Beetz is a lot of fun as the lucky X-Force member, Domino. The special effects, both physical and CGI are impressive throughout. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to fans of the first film... and advise viewers not to switch off when the credits start; there is more to come including some very important details.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Less than the sum of it's parts!,"The jokes are funny(but not as funny as in the first!), the action is good(but doesn't pack the same punch or have the same elegance to it as in first), the plot... the plot is a disjointed, unfocused mess that leaves barely any room for new characters to be developed, which means a lot of the time when a big action sequence is going down you just think ""why should I care?"". It does try to do too much at once and up the jokes and action at the same time, but sadly often it feels like a parody of itself(which is basically a parody of a parody).

That's something I'm wondering about a specific reviewer, though I'm sure he isn't alone in this. We have different tastes so it is normal for people to dislike this sort of comedy. But if you are with Ryan Reynolds, you love this as much as he does and you will have a great time. This ups the ante and has even more jokes, even small ones, where they actually are able to have big names for a punch line hired or just a visual joke.Very funny, if you don't mind the non political correct route it takes ... because this is anything but nice ... and still manages to be sweet in its own right!",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"I believe X will give it to you, again","I was expecting less, and pleasantly surprised that it over delivered. In the first outing, when the jokes were stripped away there wasn't a whole lot happening. This time, there is a greater belief backing the picture - probably because this time Deadpool and crew more tightly inhabits the MCU. The new characters are all well fleshed out, Cable is a great foil, Domino a great sidekick and the action is not second rate. In fact the action was very solid. Cable kicks ass in a non derivative way - he is clearly a soldier. The emotional story is played reasonably straight - another sign of confidence. It doesn't hang off the film, but is integral to it. The plot is strangely lacking in the usual jar load of massive holes - even given the time travel. This just all gives the humour even more space to stand. (For me, Weasel gets top billing)I'm happy to give a film, however lowbrow, an appropriate score if it delivers on it's premise. But there is an issue here: this film burns it's own genre for heat. The X-men are thrown onto the fire right in front of our eyes. With Thor: Ragnorak also played for laughs, there will be a more stratified feel to future Marvel. There is room for funny, or political, or world stretching. But falling between these stools will no longer work.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

ACTUALLY laughing out loud,"The simplest thing I can say about Deadpool 2 is that I actually laughed out loud. I don't normally laugh that much anymore from anything, but despite my cynicism of some of the regurgitation of material that was used in the original, this is one of the few movies that actually had me laughing out loud.Seeing Ryan Reynolds reprise the role he was born for is such a breath of fresh air. Reynolds has been in a sort of time-warp for his entire career until he hit gold with Deadpool. He's unbelievably funny as the talkuntilyouwanttoshootyourself super ""hero"".Josh Brolin is absolutely amazing and menacing as Cable. Zazie Beetz is incredible as Domino and because of her powers, her fight scenes are hilariously gory. I can let it slide that Hollywood needed to rub their diversity hands over her character and change her from white to black. This is the far left leaning Hollywood after all.One criticism is the popping up of regressive left identity politics and views again. It seems like a lot of the movies and TV shows I watch are increasingly wagging their finger at these issues from a 1 sided perspective.The most shocking thing about the movie is it managed to somehow keep the momentum of the original going, although it did lose some of the originality that made the first movie so amazing.

Right from the start something seemed off with both the script and acting, it seemed as though the jokes were... missing. I assumed it was a movie that got better the more you watched and they were saving the better laughs for the second half. But no, hardly any memorable jokes, just lots and lots of CG action scenes which seemed boring. I found myself bored and yawning at the thin plot and shallow characters.

Humorous drama that tickles both your brain and body,"Ever since DP became a sensation and a worldwide phenomenon, die-hard fans have been asking for a worthey second entry.For a long time, superhero movies - not to be confused with films based on graphic novels, which is an interesting item of truth - have become a pinata for serious film critics and reasons are not lacking because we are talking about a cataract of conservative products, mediocre and totally interchangeable with each other. Typical examples of what happens when marketing and advertising discourse replace creativity and some kind of narrative, rhetorical and / or even formal talent (the stories of these ""cosos"" are otherwise schematic , do not say anything at all and are even hyper redundant in terms of digital gadgets, today present in all sad pompous proposal of the mainstream). But perhaps the worst of all is that they bore with their childish and semi-televised dialectic - from the TV of yesteryear - oriented to reproduce ad infinitum the same antics.With this panorama it is not surprising that even the exponents who try to break a couple of rules of the format end up falling into the usual quagmire of non-development of characters, the most ancient political correctness, the humor for young children, that pathetic self-referentiality and constant a concatenation of prefixed niches of the market - it is not even possible to call them subframes - that can only appeal to a series of individuals co-opted by the most aseptic industry, the one that for a couple of decades has decided to ignore any nonconformist substrate at the level of the ideological basis of their ""toys"".Deadpool 2 is another link in this endless chain of perky fun-time itself (hobby products that do not even pass the time), which once again highlights the crisis of a cultural conglomerate that fetishes the most burned clichés.Pretending to be ""set sail"" for the puerile level of superhero movies, this sequel to the work of 2016 essentially repeats the formula of its predecessor: many jokes with harmless puteadas, some very innocuous sexual allusion, scenes of action that are ironic, Tired questioning to camera and a cheap background melodrama that sabotages itself because the movie-read the Marvel factory-does not understand that because of so much ""attitude surpassed of everything"", both beretta cancherism and so many plastic simulated CGIs, nobody can identify with these shiny but well-emptied jars from a rusty and insipid assembly line.In other words, DP2 is the perfect sequel to DP, specifically. Doubles down on everything that fans love about the original, nonstop graphic violence, gore, torture, sex, nudity, swearing, drinking, drug use, and more, so expect the same here, while it fixes some of the first film's issues. Also this one features the best post credits scene EVER. Yes! Deadpool 2 as the title says, gives the audience two end-credit scenes. Ladies and gentlemen, the wait for the scenes are worth it! Hilarious is the perfect word to describe how the audience feels of watching 'em. They don't relate much with the whole story but the crack jokes are powerful enough to make people care of the clips.The sequel is superior to its ancestor. It conveys silly comic drama that stimulates both your cerebrum and body.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
I enjoyed this movie,"Deadpool is a great movie filed with a lot of jokes, however, it is above age 18 in since it contains a lot of bad words. The first movie of Deadpool I did not like a lot, however, the second one was a great movie. The first one was because it did not have a lot of meaning hidden, it was just a Marvel movie, however, the second one was the opposite its main idea was love, and this is the reason that I liked the second one more.",,Anonymous,Comedy
"Everything deadpool 1 was, but a bit less","""Deadpool 2"" (2018) is almost as good as the first movie. It was also really funny and gory and I still really enjoyed watching it.The biggest miss I saw in this movie was the visual effects, a lot of scenes were kind of mediocrely done but there was still parts that were good.The casting was really good, adding characters like Domino, Cable, Yukio... and the actors they casted was perfect surrounding jokes and other things.Not much else i can say besides that the movie ended with an open end to be continued in ""Deadpool and Wolverine"" (2024)This movie is still really good in every other department and i stil very much recommend you watch it after watching the first one.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A Very Very Entertaining Sequel to the Wise Cracking Superhero,"Wow, this movie truly delivered. When I saw the first Deadpool movie, I was surprised at the totally different way of showing a superhero and I was really intrigued of how they would pull it off again in this sequel. It turned out that this time around, the action sequence was even grander and more amazing. I totally loved the scenes involving Domino, Deadpool and Cable in the city which were absolutely thrilling. And I was also amazed during the finale fights scene as well. With a great sound system from the theater, it really gave the complete awesome experience.Just like in the original movie, there were so many funny moments which were delivered by the actors (mostly involving Deadpool and his friends). One person that was given quite a lot of comical role was the taxi driver Dopinder (Karan Soni) reprising his role from the first movie. Almost all the scenes in the film were funny and I personally felt that this one was even funnier than the original movie. It gave us various jokes and one liner, making fun of so many things which gave all the audience a good amount of laughter. My wife and I really enjoyed watching this movie as it made us laughed really hard a lot of time. My own personal favorite funny moment would definitely be during the scene involving Deadpool and his old roommate Blind Al (Leslie Uggams) which was really hilarious.The pace of the movie was quite fast but there were occasional slower paced more dramatic scenes here and there. There was even a brief moment of touching scene towards the end that affected my wife a bit. Overall though, the movie was having a lot more fun and entertaining scenes. Through the entire movie duration which lasted for 2 hours, audience would be filled with a lot of craziness and jokes which should not be taken too serious. Like in all Marvel movies, this one also had 2 mid end-credit scene with the latter one also quite hilarious and should not be missed.What I also like about this movie was the additional characters in this sequel were actually quite memorable. Domino was an awesome superhero and really kick-a$$. Cable was amazingly characterized by Josh Brolin (who was able to transform into a different character from playing Thanos in Avengers: Infinity War earlier). And Russel was also greatly portrayed by the young Julian Dennison. The chemistry of all those characters were nice to see and you would notice that they really had great fun playing this movie. One thing that I noticed missing here, were the use of the fourth wall was not as frequent compared to the original movie and replaced more by the narratives by Deadpool.In the end, this was a very fun, enjoyable and entertaining superhero movie, which was very violent, had an R rating and should not be seen by children. There were so many killings, body dismemberment and foul language used here that were really not suitable for the young audience. So if you are a fan of the original movie, you should definitely watch this one and I am sure you would have just as much fun as my wife and I did.For my complete review, pls have a look at michaelnontonmulu.blogspot.co.id",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Funny but not as good as the first,"The curse of the sequel.Deadpool tried to be bigger, louder and darker.

Once Upon a Deadpool - Added Scenes are Better than Most of Film,"It is funny that I decided to watch this film, because I was sorely disappointed by Deadpool 2 in the first place. However, I loved the gimmick in how they would update the movie for a PG-13 rating. Despite the concept that could have gone so much deeper than it did, this ""update"" did not work for me at still. Every new scene with Fred Savage was completely hilarious, and even with me not ever seeing The Princess Bride, I was still completely enthralled. I loved how these new scenes were sprinkled throughout the entire film, instead of giving them to us all at once.Regardless of how much those new scenes were great, the rest of the film, especially in the first half, are mostly garbage. The film really starts to get good when the auditions for the new superheroes happen, but it continues to get ruined by bad jokes and a horrendously over-the-top child villain. Compared to my first watch of Deadpool 2, I was genuinely bored in some parts, and had to resort to my phone so I didn't fall asleep.I still love the original Deadpool and him as a character, but he did not work for a lot of the second film. Still, he works in these new scenes very well. The parachute scene will be the funniest scene of 2018. And the post-credit scenes were forever be ingrained in my memory.I just wish the rest of the film was on this level.Also, I might mention that my rating went down from my previous rating because with this being PG-13, all it did was remove certain scenes (intro scene) and bleep out the cuss words. It wasn't funny and actually ruined some funny moments actually. The PG-13 element worked much better in the added scenes with Fred Savage.",,Anonymous,Comedy

Perfect for people who like tongue-in-cheek blood-baths,"Marvel anti-superhero (super anti-hero?) Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) deals with a potentially rogue mutant, a cyborg assassin from the future, and guilt feelings about his recently deceased girlfriend, all while managing to keep up a never-ending stream of one-liners, insults and wise-cracks. A sequels go, this one isn't too bad and, since it doesn't differ much from the first entry in the series, if you liked that one, you'll probably like this one too (although the novelty of a foul-mouthed pseudo-X-Man mutant-hero has worn off somewhat).

Now THIS is how superhero movies should be made,"I'm the first to admit I am not a big fan of superhero movies. They take themselves way too seriously, are all the same and are way too easy to write (because whatever power a hero needs to get the job done, he always conveniently has - something that is wonderfully made fun of in 'Deadpool 2'). The only superhero movies I have ever really enjoyed were 'Batman' when Christopher Nolan was making his trilogy. But now even 'Batman' films have become terrible sadly. That's why 'Deadpool' is such an incredibly refreshing character. Not only does he not take himself seriously, he knows how stupid all the others are for doing just that and makes fun of them accordingly.This movie is flat out hilarious. It's one of those films where you aren't finished laughing at one joke before the next one is being thrown at you. It's actually exhausting (in a good way). I lost count of all the great quotes in this film. I kept thinking to myself that I need to remember them, but eventually there were just too many to do that. The writing on this movie is phenomenal.If 'Deadpool' were a serious character I would be very frustrated by the fact that he basically can't die or be hurt (what would be the point right?). But because of the way the film sets itself up, it doesn't bother me in the slightest. In fact it just leaves more time for hilarity. The soundtrack on this movie is also amazing. 'Deadpool' is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen and if you're like me and don't like superhero movies usually, give this one a try. I suspect you'll be pleasantly surprised.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

A Littel Rough At The Star But Brings Home Another Winner,"The Mercenary with a mouth is back with the eagerly awaited arrival of ""Deadpool 2"". The films sees the generally well-meaning but highly dysfunctional Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds), back to taking out bad guys as a contract player but also managing his relationship with Vanessa (Morena Baccarin). When an unexpected event sends his life into a freefall, Deadpool tries to find a new purpose with the help of his X-Men associates from the last film who attempt to recruit him into their organization.
His first mission is to defuse an angry and destructive young mutant named Russell (Julian Dennison), which takes an unexpected turn and lands them both in serious trouble.One would think that would be enough to cause some major life changes for Deadpool but thanks to the arrival of Cable (Josh Brolin), a cyborg soldier from the future; things are about to get much more complicated and intense.
Undaunted, Deadpool opts to form his own league of heroes and aside from Domino (Zazie Beetz); they seem to be as unlucky or dysfunctional as their leader which makes for some very hysterical consequences.
What follows is an action and laugh-laden adventure which brings even more of what made the first film such a success to the audience as the film takes the bawdy action of the first and ups the ante thanks in large part to an expanded budget and cast.My biggest concern for the film was that with an expanded budget there would be too many characters and an attempt to do far too much with the film. That did play out at times in the beginning as for me, the first film worked so well as they had to let the characters rather than the action and effects carry it and the rapid-fire arrival of so many jokes and creative profanity made repeat viewing of the film necessary to catch everything.
This time out we get elaborate action and chase sequences as well as a much larger cast. At times it seemed as if this would possibly overshadow the characters and story but Reynolds and Director David Leith never let it cross that line.They also go back to the core elements in the final third of the film which really allows the film to fully connect with the tone of the original film and brings the film home to a satisfying conclusion. What really sold the film for me was the brilliant and very inspired extended scene during the credits which allows Deadpool to ""fix"" various issues which perfectly captures the irreverent character and the best aspects of the series where the cast is willing to make fun of themselves as well as the larger universe in which their characters exist.
I cannot wait to see what comes next as ""DeadPool 2"" is another fun outing for the character and something very different from most comic based movies.

Who else hated Rusty Collins ?,"Well,, I was going to give this an 8. The movie starts off well, loads of action, good humour and was leading onto a good story line, I was happy. However, once Rusty Collins came into the picture my opinion on the movie was sinking. He is one of the most annoying characters I have ever seen and is the type of character you hope will die early in the movie. I also was not too keen on Domino. Her character had a really annoying attitude with no humour, the writers made her indestructible, never got hurt and at that point you could see them turning this movie into a girl power flick.

The slow death of R,"Deadpool 2 is fun. Ryan Reynolds is fun. There are jokes aplenty. There is a lot of nice CGI, too. What the movie lacked was a story. I mean, stuff happens, but not for any particular reason other than comic relief. Yet you have to have something to be relieved from, first. And it's not like the ideas didn't have potential: a hero losing his will to live, a bunch of other superheros from which Domino has the superpower of luck, the origin story of a hero or a supervillain, depending on the choices of the characters in the movie, time travel, Cable, Juggernaut... Yukio? Anyway, none of these ideas get developed after a quick exposition. Domino is pretty cool, but her superpower is just ... too super. Cable was cool, but as a character he is pretty much, just like Juggernaut, another version of the straight face man, just another Colossus.And yes, Brad Pitt is the Vanisher and Matt Damon is a redneck and there are probably other cameos of note, and yes, there are a lot of sex jokes and foul mouthed dialogue, but the violence is now more subdued, with less blood, less gore, less pain, less impact. There is no substitute for the sex scene with Morena Baccarin from the first movie and the only nudity that counts is probably Jugernaut's ass. So while the movie starts with swearing at Wolverine for doing a hard R Logan, the rest of the film is mild. Rather than a competition for Logan, Deadpool 2 is more a counterpart for Tucker and Dale vs Evil.Bottom line: mindless fun. I kind of liked the first one better because there was a better story and way better characterization.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

A Good Sequel that has some heart,"So I have almost finished the X-Men films and the next film is Deadpool 2 and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees Deadpool and a team of mutants have to save a young mutant from the time traveller Cable.Main Character
Ryan Reynolds is back as the 4th wall breaking Deadpool and what more is there to say except that he was born to play this character and he is once again fantastic here. He is still hilarious here and the references are all still here mixed with the R Rated language. It is funny that he actually has a character arc here, there is an emotional journey he goes on here and I thought he did a really good job with it and it helped flesh out the character.Supporting Cast
There is a huge supporting cast here and that shows, Zazie Beetz plays the character of Domino and I thought she was great here. She comes into the film quite late but she is fun to watch and the way they show off her powers is really great and unique and is a real highlight. Josh Brolin is no stranger to comic book roles with Thanos and Jonah Hex and he now plays Cable here and I thought he did a good job. He is very clearly the dark and more serious contrast to Deadpool and it works here, you are given a reason to care about his character and his motivations and he adds plenty to the action scenes. The rest of the cast also do good jobs in their roles but the film lessens all of them, like Vanessa played by Morena Baccarin, we really got invested by their romance in the first film but even though it plays a part here it feels like her character gets short changed. The same could be said for characters like Colossus, Negasonic Teenage Warhead and Blind Al, who have less screen time and you just wish there could have been more time with them, especially Negasonic Teenage Warhead.Story
The story is decent, the emotion of Deadpool's character works here and it does make you care about his character and feel like he has actually grown as a person by the end. Also the individual arcs in the film are all entertaining individually, it is just how they balance that is an issue. This film does suffer from what a lot of sequels do, that they have to raise the stakes and add much more to the film an this film does that. But there is so much going on here that elements of the film that were great in the first film fall to the wayside and aren't given the love that they deserve.Script
The script has the fun and laughs that the first film had with all the references and 4th wall breaks that you can muster. The drama is just as good if not better here and does a better job in telling a fully fleshed out dramatic story. Though here, I felt like the film had some lazy writing, addressing it as lazy doesn't hide the fact that it is indeed lazy writing.Style
The style of the film has some great action scenes in it, the violence is still here and the unique power sets of the characters allows for some fun sequences. The film flows nicely and you aren't ever bored which is a good thing considering how many plot points there are. There is one poor CGI fight but I am willing to accept it as it is a small part of the film.Overall
Overall, this is a good sequel. It keeps the humour and feeling of the first film which is a good thing, but it does struggle to balance the load of the sequel which hurts it but overall this is a worthy sequel.Rating - 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

A new class of superhero,"I liked Deadpool 2 (2018), It was a solid sequel to Deadpool (2016). I liked the new characters they added along with new jokes and references to laugh at.Ryan Reynolds is still great as Deadpool/Wade Wilson, I still love how funny he is throughout the movie and thought he was still great in action scenes. I especially liked the new 4th wall breaks he does that fit in well with the situations.There are funny references to other movies, X-Men, and surprisingly little jokes at DC Comics. The plot has a simple revenge story, but they make it entertaining and fun with the new stuff they add.I still like the appearances of Negasonic Teenage Warhead and Colossus. Their appearances were funny, and I liked Josh Brolin as Cable because he looked cool and brought a lot to the character and the plot of the movie.The movie has a lot of funny moments but there are also effective sentimental scenes and serious scenes that fit well in the plot and are put together nicely. I would recommend watching Deadpool 2 (2018) if you have not seen Deadpool (2016), there are also a few after credits scenes that are funny and worth watching in the end making it a funny experience.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

No Annoying Kids Please. Just Repeat Deadpool,"Why do potentially great movies keep adding children to them, especially adult movies? This same thing happened in, Logan, I thought and it made me dislike both that and ultimately most of, Deadpool 2.There were just too many super characters as well here. I'd rather have a bad guy, maybe two and Deadpool and that's it. I don't need some child in the film as a mutant, uggh.The first Deadpool movie was pretty much perfect in every single aspect in my opinion. Well, the deserted X-Men headquarters, while a funny joke, was kind of lame I thought. And that Negastupid teen chick mutant was just pathetic and boring as well. Still, just the overall awesomeness of the original Deadpool, I would give ten out of ten stars every single time. It's a film I don't believe I could ever grow tired of viewing.They didn't need to clone that film for the sequel in my opinion. But sticking very close to all that great points that worked and just adding a little bit new here and there would have made such a better sequel in my book.Deadpool 2, ultimately left a bad taste in my mouth for so many reasons. The high I got from the first film and that I gleefully carried with anticipation into watching this sequel. Was abysmally crushed, sadly. I'm glad I saw this movie. Yet, I really wish it had been something different and on the same rad level as the first film.Also, like others have mentioned, I also felt like they tried to make you feel too many emotions for the character of Deadpool in this movie and they jacked up the love of Vanessa too much. Deadpool is a basically good guy deep, deep, deep down inside his heart I believe.But, he's also a schizophrenic, totally annoying punk and nut-job. I don't want to try to sympathize or invest in him emotionally any more than they had us brilliantly do in the original film I thought. That was just enough to care about the character but also see him for who he was and know he's a hilarious loon most of the time. That's the actual comic book character.I realize they take liberties in the first movie. But just stick to the comic stories and stop heaping all this baggage onto a character that doesn't warrant it or need it. He's a maniac with a good heart in there somewhere floating around the unicorns and Mexican food. With other comic characters I think it's great to sympathize with them hugely, like Thor and Peter Quill and at times even Iron Man. Here though I'd have preferred if they'd just have played it like they did in the original. That was a perfect level of emotional investment to have in this type of anti-hero character.You don't have to clone a story to still make the same movie and have it be rad in my opinion. Just change enough small things to make it not a direct copy and I would have been happy as heck because the first film is golden! That's all I wanted coming from how amazing Deadpool was, to this sequel that really bummed me out more than anything. Thank you for trying, though.I still do think nobody could ever play Deadpool than Ryan Reynolds. He's a master craftsmen in my opinion and the only guy who can pull this character off. I still enjoy his great acting.",5.0,Anonymous,Comedy

An excellent sequel for a fun franchise,"Doing a good sequel seems impossible nowadays for Hollywood, but Deadpool 2 is an exception. As always Ryan Reynolds portrayed this antihero wonderfully: he's humorous, irreverent but he can also be lovely. In this movie his character was deepen and we discover more of his personality, confirming once again what I had already expressed in the review of the first movie: there is no other character like Deadpool in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and for me these two movies with Guardians of the Galaxy are the only ones that are really worth to be watch, because they are different and really intriguing.This time we are also introduced to new heroes, such as Domino or Bedlam, that are a nice addition, even if they don't have much time on screen. Very weak the performance of Julian Dennison as Firefist. He is in fact really annoying and he is used only as a pretext to go on with the story. Honestly, creators here could have done a better job. I was personally very disappointed by the final fights that could not catch me much, as seems just another, generic battle against the super villain. I need however to say that the story and the narration were not at all obvious and there a few plot twists that I was not expecting at all.For cinema lovers Deadpool movies are a must, even for people that does not love this genre:they are different and refreshing, you don't need to watch any Marvel movie before it, because it is a standalone movie. Even if X-Men are mentioned, don't worry, you don't need to watch the whole X-Men saga. There are many references to the pop culture, such as other movies or music. If you are able to catch them, the movie is even funnier.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"When you bet ""no way it could be better than the first one"", and lose.","The first Deadpool is one of my favorite films of all time, and I figured no way even DP2 could beat it, but it did.

We need more of these type of films that make you forget all the garbage going on in today's society... a film that has every positive element including top-notch non-stop comedy that toned my six-pack laughing while I was watching the film. Props to our Canadian boy Ryan Reynolds for topping what I thought could not be topped! This franchise needs to continue and I can't wait for DP3!

More or less the same as the first one.,"Deadpool 2 is a very fun action movie, which is all it needed to be. This movie isn't better nor worse than the original, it is just as good, which is fine. This movie has incredible humor. with some amazing jokes and many many references. This movie also has some great action since the director of John Wick is behind it. Lot of fourth wall breaking, and even a great score from Tyler Bates. It's everything you could ever want from a Deadpool movie! Where this movie sort of loses me, and it's a nitpick, is when it becomes sad, yes a Deadpool movie has some depressing moments, and it's understandable, but I didn't really come to a Deadpool movie to see dark imagery and sad scenes, I came to have complete fun. However that is a nitpick for this movie is still great, Cable is a standout played beautifully by Josh Brolin; yet he is very underused and not used to his full potential. If you worried about the trailers showing you an Avengers like team up with Deadpool leading them, you have nothing to be concerned about since its nothing like that, it's still a fun Deadpool film. Deadpool doesn't really do anything ""bad-ass"" in this film, he's very funny but doesn't do anything that stands out really. A very excellent entry to the Deadpool franchise, but by the end of it, I wasn't asking for a Deadpool 3, not because I didn't want one, but because this movie feels like a conclusion for his story.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Quick Review,"I will always love the movies with Hollywood-Businesses jokes and ""Deadpool 2"" is full of them. Though it's a funny and fast Picture, the overall meta-vibes are in cases way too many and makes the film looks heavier than it really is.Quickly, I didn't love it as much as I loved the first one, but it was a perfectly nice follow up and it made me waiting for the next one!",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"Second in the series, dark comedy with an irreverent anti-hero.","I watched the first Deadpool two years ago, my wife watched it with me but decided to skip this one. I watched it at home on BluRay from my public library.For me the only really annoying thing is the constant filthy language, it may be faithful to the comics, I don't know, but it gets distracting very early. It just isn't necessary at the frequency they choose to use it. Almost as if they are saying ""Hey look, I can use all the vulgar language I want in this R-rated movie.""For those who can get past that the movie itself is frequently very entertaining, especially when the humor is injected. One example, there is a character that is invisible, until he lights up after parachuting into high power lines. Whose face do we see? Brad Pitt.So Ryan Reynolds is back as Wade Wilson who is mostly in costume as Deadpool. He also provides the voice for the very large convict, Juggernaut. His chief nemesis in this movie becomes Josh Brolin as Cable, a cyborg from the future out to get a mutant to prevent future problems. But Deadpool, searching for a ""family"" is intent on saving the boy.I watched the extended 2 hour 13 minute version, in many respects the whole movie represents a sensory overload.",,Anonymous,Comedy

Best superhero sequel since 'The Dark Knight',"When considering 'Deadpool 2,' there hasn't been another superhero sequel as good if not better than the original since Christopher Nolan flexed his muscles in the genre with 'The Dark Knight.'The main body of 'Deadpool 2' blends together the action, plot and soundtrack to such a high degree that it's virtually unparalleled compared to other films. From recent memory, the only other film that comes close-besides the first Deadpool-was last year's 'Baby Driver.'The film's dialogue is packed with movie references, nods at pop culture, and even jokes at Ryan Reynold's own expense, so much so that a second viewing would absolutely be necessary to try and catch them all.The movie isn't perfect. For example, the first half of Cable's storyline feels a bit disjointed from the rest of the film. However, it steadily becomes increasingly well integrated over time.However, for a franchise that prides itself on violent irreverence, it'd be unthinkable to assume that they were capable of making audiences well up with emotion at the end, yet they had the entire theater choking back tears, a rare achieve that strongly rounds out this film and places among the best in its class.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Josh Brolin steals it as Cable,"The self aware anti hero named Deadpool is back, and this time he forced to protect a mutant boy named Fire fist from Cable(Josh Brolin) a mutant/cyborg who has traveled from the near future to kill him. With an all star team behind him, Deadpool will do what it takes to save the boy, but the question is will he?This sequel tops the original, and it knows it. Ryan Reynolds once again kills it as Deadpool, but Josh Brolin really steals it has Cable, did the same as Thanos in Avengers Infinity War. The way he and Ryan Reynolds just play off each other, makes them a perfect duo, and as Cable he comes into his own. Action scenes are well shot. The jokes really deliver on q perfectly. The film never loses sight on what it is.Looking forward to see more Josh Brolin has Cable.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
An alright sequel...,"Alright story with decent consistency. Dull start but good finish. Great CGI and choreography, the Juggernaut design was pretty good. Good acting and dialogue. The characters were good, we are introduced to some ones too. Music composition was good. Couple of reused elements which were fine but was exhausting to see it again and again.Overall a semi-enjoyable movie but not rewatchable. With some annoying parts from this movie and what felt like alright writing it is still a recommmend watch.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Good but familiar,Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) has to deal with a teen mutant called Firefist (Julian Dennison) who has anger issues. Then Cable (Josh Brolin) comes from the future. It seems Firefist as an adult killed his wife and kid and wants to kill him before he grows up.Sequel to the wildly successful original. However it's not as good. A LOT of the jokes are carried over from the original and they aren't funnier the second time around. Also at almost two hours it's too long. On the plus side the acting is good and Brolin clearly enjoys playing Cable. Lots of action and violence too. So--it's up to you if you want to see it.,6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"Too bad we'll never get a true 'DEADPOOL 3', now that Disney owns the rights!","'DEADPOOL 2': Five Stars (Out of Five)The sequel to the 2016 blockbuster R-rated superhero flick 'DEADPOOL' (based on the Marvel Comics character), and the 11th entry in the 'X-MEN' film franchise. In this chapter Wade Wilson (AKA Deadpool) fights to defend a young gifted mutant, named Russell, from a time traveling mutant called Cable. He forms a new superhero mutant team, called X-Force, to help him. The movie stars Ryan Reynolds (reprising the title role), Josh Brolin, Julian Dennison,Zazie Beetz, T.J. Miller, Brianna Hildebrand, Stefan Kapicic, Leslie Uggams, Karan Soni, Morena Baccarin and Eddie Marsan. It was directed by David Leitch (who also helmed 'ATOMIC BLONDE' and co-directed 'JOHN WICK') and it was written by Rhett Reese, Paul Wernick (the duo who also co-wrote the original film, and 'ZOMBIELAND') and Ryan Reynolds (in his screenwriting debut). I loved the original movie and I found this sequel to be almost as good (but not quite).Wade Wilson (Reynolds) has been killing criminals for two years now (since the end of the first film), under the name Deadpool. He's planning to have a child with his girlfriend, Vanessa Carlysle (Baccarin), when tragedy strikes. Wade then befriends a young troubled mutant named Russell (Dennison), who he later learns has been targeted for execution by a powerful time traveling mutant, from the future, named Cable (Brolin). Wade forms a team of new superhero mutants, he calls X-Force, to help him protect the kid and stop Cable.The movie is filled with nonstop gags and slapstick humor (just like the original), as well as really graphically violent action scenes (also just like the original). For me this film went a little too far in some of it's slapstick humor, whereas I thought the original movie had the perfect balance of action and comedy. This one also has a lot of sci-fi craziness on top of everything else. I still, of course, really enjoyed it, but I definitely can't say it matched the original. Reynolds is once again amazing, in the role he was born to play, and the supporting cast is more than decent. The script is clever and brilliant, and the directing is good enough. I think if they could have kept the original director though, this film could have been even better. As it is, it's still one of the best films of this year, and any year as far as superhero movies go. Too bad we won't ever get a true 'DEADPOOL 3', now that Disney owns the rights (and will never do a hardcore R-rated movie), but we can always dream.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Better than the original.,"""Deadpool 2"" is a fine example of how the sequel can improve the original.

Insanely funny with good action too,"At one time I wasn't a fan of movies or TV adapted from comic books, and despite the connection to ""comic"" books, a lot of movies and TV weren't actually funny. This movie, however, takes superhero comedy to an entirely new level. I saw the first one and enjoyed it, but don't remember that much about it.And while not every scene is funny, this movie usually maintains a level of humor that is unmatched even in most conventional comedy movies. For one thing, it never forgets it is a movie. And there are constant references to other movies, TV, whatever. Ryan Reynolds is great.But like I said, not everything is funny. Josh Brolin gives a very effective dramatic performance is at least some scenes, and he plays it completely straight. Reynolds gets a couple of more dramatic scenes with his girlfriend in the great beyond (and he looks normal), but this does not mean what you think it does.Domino is fun. I didn't know her name, but she was incredibly lucky.The girl with the pink hair was adorable even if she had only a few lines. Her punk rocker friend was ... not.A highlight is the audition sequence, where people try out to be members of the X Force.And the best action sequence comes right after the auditions and involves parachutes before it really gets going. When vehicles are involved, it's a nonstop thrill ride with constant damage and mayhem.Family friendly this is not. I enjoyed it enough to put up with the numerous uses of the S-word and the occasional F-word. Even so, sometimes it seemed like some bad language had been edited out. Unlike Samuel L. Jackson's possibly record-setting performance, this was on FX when I saw it and they sternly warned us at the start and after each commercial break. They did the same thing with ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" earlier in the day, but this time it was necessary.The warning mentioned nudity, and I'm not sure just what the others saw when Deadpool was cut in half and put back together. I couldn't see it. This was one of the few gags that didn't work for me.And of course, while actually bloody violence was rare, implied violence was unspeakable. Maybe they had it coming, though.And don't think it's over when it's over. There's more. I was reading there may have been even more. I hope I didn't miss the end.I hope this isn't the last one, and I hope to be on vacation when someone airs it. I don't get these channels at home.",,Anonymous,Comedy

Ryan Reynolds was born for this role; his humor is one of the best things ever and the action is entirely epic!

No matter what others say this is just as good as the first one if not better.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Good, but could have used less winking and nudging","Let me say off the bat that I'm really happy with Marvel's decision to take a chance on the first Deadpool movie based on the strength of the demo Reynolds made. As we all know, it paid out handsomely. And for good reason! It was fun, funny, and had... a story. I wont say it was great, but without Morena Baccarin, it wouldnt have been what it was.Deadpool 2 was good. I liked it. The cameos were awesome and unexpected, Josh Brolin and the woman who played Domino were great, and the action scenes were decent. Morena Baccarin was good again. My complaint is with all the 4th wall breaking and the avalanche of pop culture, MCU, DC, and other relevant jokes. It takes away from the story. Yeah, I know it sounds funny. Like anyone went to see Deadpool 2 for the story. But when you have a storyline that requires a bit of acting and emotion, it's hard to buy into it when it's preceded and followed by ""thanos fart dildo Wolverine buttplug lol"" jokes like, for 20 minutes at a time.Again, I did like it, and I did think there were plenty of funny moments, but it'd be neat if Reynolds could find a way to stop sucking himself off so much in the next one. I'm sure there are plenty of others would do it for him. Not that I'm volunteering.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

A Surprising Sequel,"I'll keep this as short and simple as I can. Based off the trailers, I was expecting an ""Avengers"" team-up crapfest of a sequel -- but I will say that the trailers did not do this movie justice; in fact, it was almost downright misleading (in the best way possible).The first 15 or so minutes were somewhat sloppy and stale, and a lot of the jokes landed flat. But the last half is where the movie really gets good, and it made having to sit through the beginning completely worth it.Some characters from the first film have a much smaller role, while others (well, one other) has a bigger arc that suits him well. Yukio was surprisingly delightful to watch, and her chemistry with Deadpool was the strongest out of the bunch.This sequel is far less funny than the first one, but it has more heart, which in my opinion makes it as (or almost as) good as the first one. I'd highly recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the first.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Dead cool too!,"If you enjoyed the heck out of the first Deadpool film, there's a very good chance that you'll be thoroughly entertained by this sequel as well. It's essentially more of the same, without being exactly the same. We get more extreme violence, more smart-ass quips courtesy of the main character, more breaking of the fourth wall, more in-jokes, and more expletives; all of this is wrapped up by an easy-to-follow plot that sees Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) trying to find a reason to carry on living after a split second mistake results in the death of his girlfriend Vanessa (Morena Baccarin).Director David Leitch (Atomic Blonde) does a fine job in emulating the style and tone set by Tim Miller's original, and ably delivers plenty of giggles to go with the action (although none of the gags made me laugh quite as hard as the gaggle of nerdy Marvel fanboys in the seats behind me, who clearly wanted everyone else in the audience to know that they got ALL of the clever references). An excellent soundtrack adds to the excitement, with everything from AC/DC's Thunderstruck (which accompanies the beginning of one of the film's funniest action scenes that features almost as many sudden superhero deaths as Infinity War), to Skrillex's dubstep anthem Bangarang.8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for the X-Men cameos, an appearance (or should that be 'disappearance') from Brad Pitt as The Vanisher, and a hilarious Basic Instinct-inspired shot during the scene in which Deadpool grows a new pair of legs.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Bloody Hilarious,"Deadpool 2 follows deadpool's mission to protect a mutant boy Russell a.k.a Firefist (Julian Dennison) from the time travelling mercenary Cable (Josh Brolin).This movie does everything the original did but takes it up a notch. There's more comedy, more action and more characters than before. Ryan Reynolds is once again excellent as the merc with a mouth. Deadpool is not just about quips and meta jokes all the time but there are even some emotional moments that I really liked.I loved Cable in this film and Josh Brolin was a great choice for the role. Also just weeks ago Brolin amazed us with his performance as Thanos which is made fun of as we saw in the trailers. One big thing about Deadpool 2 was The X-Force. The trailers almost exclusively promoted the X-Force although after watching the movie I'm in a bit of a pickle. Without spoiling anything I think the direction that they took the X-Force was outrageous and hilarious but also a bit disappointing.Apart from Deadpool and Cable, other notable characters were Domino (Zazie Beetz), Firefist, Dopinder and this one character I can't spoil. Also Colossus gets a lot to do and his interactions with deadpool are some of the highlights of the film. I quite like Colossus but the previous X-Men films always kept him in the background which made me very happy when I saw the original deadpool and he is just as fantastic in deadpool 2.That leaves us with the rest of the cast including characters like negasonic teenage warhead (Brianna Hilderbrand), Blind Al(Leslie Uggams), Weasel etc. were entertaining but don't really get much to do.Veteran stuntman David Leitch who directed this films has previously worked on John Wick and Atomic Blonde, both films with some exceptional fight sequences. So it was obvious that Deadpool was gonna have great fight scenes and it does deliver but doesn't surpass Leitch's previous work. The music is pretty good and it really works well with the tone of the movie.
 
Lastly my one problem with the movie which doesn't really bother me that much but still worth mentioning is this one decision that cable makes at the end that I'm not going to spoil but those who have seen the film will probably know what I'm referring to.Deadpool 2 although at times may feel more of the same and has a few other minor problems is an extremely entertaining and hilarious film filled with cameos, easter eggs, references and a lot of graphic violence. I had a blast watching Deadpool 2 and I do like it better than the first one.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Better than the original in just about every facet,"It's finally here! The film all those creepy people at conventions who mistake cosplay for invasion of personal space will be quoting for years on end!To preface real quickly: I truly liked the first Deadpool film. While I never believed it was as big of a 'game-changer' as most people branded it, other than it being the first R-rated superhero smash hit, I thought it was an entertaining and simple film that deserved most of the adoration it got from its fans.This, though?...Wow, let's talk about this...Deadpool 2, as most sequels do, takes its predecessor and cranks everything to 11. The jokes are flying at the audience faster, the stakes are heightened, the action is heightened, likely triple the amount of characters, a plot that is somehow jumbled and bloated in comparison to the original's simple one......And in the end, what we get is actually an absolutely great time at the cinemas.Don't get me wrong, this film is flawed. Its CG work is still absolutely horrid and little was improved from the first film, its characters lack much depth beyond a kiddie pool, and the plot somehow manages to feel overstuffed compared to the first's minimal plot, as it feels as if it has two Second Acts and two Third Acts.But...gosh-darnit...this film is simply the most consistently hilarious comedy that has been released thus far this year.From the first minute of this film, as one would expect from a Deadpool sequel, the jokes are flying fast and furious toward you. In terms of how many of them land...to give you a fair ratio, if one joke falls flat, about nine of them land.This film is HILARIOUS, and while it never has anything too in-depth to commentate on regarding the superhero genre of film, which is coming dangerously close to the state of 'over-saturation', this deviation of the genre and take-nothing-serious approach is more fun than any DCEU film has managed to be, even when they try to be.Dialogue gags, sight gags, editing gags, even an incredible credits sequence that comes straight out of nowhere that managed to both leave me in hysterics and somehow top the first film's excellent opening sequence, this film brings an entire arsenal of jokes that work nine-out-of-ten times. A ratio like that, I think any mainstream comedy would kill for.The cinematography here is also surprisingly well-done in terms of action and choreography, which comes as no surprise to me considering the film was directed by one half of the creative team behind 'John Wick' (David Leitch), with cinematography by the man who did the INCREDIBLE camera work for the same film (Jonathan Sela). Whereas the first film looked muddy and ugly in its low-budget glory, this film trades that for action scenes and sequences that really do look FANTASTIC at times. When the scenes are allowed to be practical, and the ugly CG is traded-in for actual actors, these action sequences look great.So yes, this film is not perfect. It certainly has flaws in plot flow, its FX department, and still doesn't truly commentate on the superhero genre in any way, shape, or form.But with THAT said; this film is consistently hilarious, features great action, has an unending sense of fun that never ceases...and yes, has the best post-credits sequence ever.I've thought hard about it, but...I think this is an instance where the sequel surpassed the original. Go nuts, internet!",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Deadpool 2,"Deadpool 2's jokes are as crude as ever, thats why the film feels weird when the story and the plot is something so mundane.

Without going into spoilers, the film just felt strange, certain characters I didn't like or felt generic. At the end It didn't have the same satisfying feeling as the first one did.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Deadpool 1 was way better,"I gave the first Deadpool a 9/10 i had fun of my life with it every joke hit , well the second Deadpool has a lot of dead jokes it tries way to hard to be funny while it is not and the story line of that fire fat kid annoyed me very much.

"A sequel with more heart, violence, jokes and ambition.","When I saw the first Deadpool, it was the perfect antidote to oversaturation of superhero movies that consumed the media. Since then the amount of superhero projects has ironically increased with Deadpool's second movie, once again, responses to this. This is especially clear when it released only a few weeks after Infinity War.While John Wick's David Leitch takes over directing duties from Tim Miller, the writing duo of Paul Wernick and Rhett Rheese and Ryan Reynold's full embodiment of his character's off-kilter persona is what keeps the sequel from loosing its mojo. The jokes are twice as funny with visual gags that caused an explosion of laughter while watching it in theatres. The humor rarely ever feels like goes too far thanks to Reynold's execution and delivery of the script and blends very with bigger action set pieces. But probably what surprised me the most was the emotional depth has a lot more weight and complexity. While Deadpool 2 never forgets it's a comedy first, it puts the character on an arc that brings an existential question about himself. Sometimes the movie tries too hard to copy the same emotional beats from the previous X-men movie Logan (whether jokingly or unknowingly), it still makes you feel pity for Wade Wilson despite he is a cold-blooded killer.While Reynolds continues to be perfect as Wade, the rest of the cast, both new and old, standout. Colossus gets more screen time to show more depth to the dysfunctional relationship he has with Wade. Newcomer Zazie Beetz as Domino becomes a scene-stealer even though she doesn't show up till the latter half of the film. Beetz's is hilarious especially with seeing how her character's power of luckiness works on a cinematic level. While still not as captivating as his previous Marvel character Thanos from Infinity War, Brolin still makes Cable distinct enough with how he talks and behaves in a grizzled and damaged way. While I wished there was more, his good-cop-bad-cop dialogue with a not-so-serious Deadpool was both fun and interesting. It was also great to see Julian Denison get to expand his acting chops even though his character Russell was a bit of heightened version of Rick Baker from Hunt for the Wilderpeople. It did feel awkward that TJ Miller's role wasn't shortened after the amount of controversial that has happened within the actor's personal life. It was a shame that Morena Baccarin's role as Vanessa is reduced for the sake of the story which felt a bit hypocritical at times.Where David Leitch does improve from the first film is the action. Leitch's experiences in fight choreograph makes the practical fights in Deadpool 2 look more real and vicious especially with Wade's first encounter with Cable. There we get to see how far Wade's healing factor can go leading to some disturbing body horror. While Leitch is better with handling practical action, the use of cgi shows to be more of Miller's talent. Since Deadpool 2 does not have Tim Miller's visual eye nor his vfx company Blurr Studios that made the cgi for the first movie, the visual effects don't feel as seamless. It is especially the case when an iconic comic book character in cgi shows up in the third act and feels more cartoonish then real.Deadpool 2 is funnier and more emotional but what keeps it from being better then the first is that you can feel the plot dragging by the last quarter of the movie. While the first Deadpool felt quick and short (compared to the runtime of most superhero movies), the extra 10 minutes this sequel has causes the runtime to feel more noticeable.While Deadpool 2 does not have same surprise factor nor quickness, I can still say it is an accomplishment since most sequels to superhero movies and comedies fail by being too repetitive or not being ambitious enough. Deadpool 2 swings bigger then the first instalment and for the most part succeeds where others have failed. Also stay for the post-credit scenes. They are unforgettable.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"F is for Family in ""Deadpool 2""","""Deadpool 2"" is hysterical, whimsically crass, electrifying action, and despite superfluous intentions: ""Deadpool 2"" is about family. Sweet surprise. Ryan Reynolds is the mercurial snarky reluctant hero Deadpool and his human persona Wade Wilson. Wade possesses amazing mutant regenerative powers and martial arts skills. Josh Brolin is Cable, the mechanically armed cyborg from the future, seeking to alter the time line; thus, erasing his own personal tragedy. Wade's heartbroken cynicism and Cable's dour intensity compose this unique Yin and Yang of Director David Leitch's eclectic ""Deadpool 2"".Leitch has a masterful eye for martial arts execution as displayed in ""John Wick"" and ""Atomic Blonde"". Brolin's Cable and Reynolds's Deadpool go full throttle in vicious throw down, upon each other or in tandem thrashing a villain horde. With all the spectacular shoot 'em eye candy, gaudy CGI battles, and cleverer than thou self-conscious pop culture references the story by Rhett Reese, Paul Wernick, and Reynolds discovers genuine gravitas in its conventional heart: What is it to be a family?At the narrative arc Vanessa, played by beautiful soulful Morena Baccarin, tells her lover Wade, ""Kids give us a chance of being better than we use to be."" In this ""Deadpool 2"" emerges greater. ""Deadpool 2"" is more of the same hyperbole action sequences and smart aleck sensibility. Yet, Wade experiences profound loss and discovers his purpose in saving suffering young mutant Russell, played by innocently brave Julian Dennison, who commands fiery flames through his hands.In all its misdirects and the comic narrative obsession for Wolverine and Hugh Jackman, ""Deadpool"" is really about family and love. Deadpool himself would rather vomit in his confession. He forms the ""X-Force"" to complete his mission to save Russell's soul and the future's well-being. Strong mesmerizing Zazie Beetz as Domino, whose mutant prowess is luck, comments on the team's name: ""Isn't that a little derivative?"" Exactly. Zazie is total kick ass and a star. Domino. Cable. Deadpool. Russell. Family doesn't necessarily have to look a certain way. But you know when you are one.Reynolds beautifully balances aloof smarter than thou and big-hearted hero. He is literally stifled in that red mask. Yet, Leitch wisely exposes Ryan's well of emotions when unmasked. Wade tells tearful Russell, ""You're a good kid..."" Deadpool reveals his own truth. Through all his bluster and irreverence, he knows that we all deserve kindness. Josh Brolin is Ryan's understatedly powerful foil. In contrast to motor mouth Wade, his Cable's selected words command gravity. He moves us as he speaks of ""the most pain"" you will ever know.""Deadpool 2"" is loud, smart aleck hysterical and total over the top carnage. No surprise. What surprises: It's sense of humanity. Seems even Deadpool knows that Hero is about family. Hero is about love. He might even say that with a straight face, if you could see his face. Just saying.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Enjoyable Second Film for Deadpool,"Despite being fun and inventive, this is a sequel that dives crotch-first into a moral quandary. It also suffers from a lot of the same problems many other sequels have: re-hash. Moving from one plot point to another, it repeats the creative strategy from the first film. Yet still, it is an enjoyable second entry into the ""not really a superhero"" superhero genre.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"As action-packed, hilarious & unforgettable as its predecessor.","Deadpool 2 continues with the escapades of Wade Wilson/Deadpool(Ryan Reynolds), after the events of Deadpool(2016). Deadpool has to protect a young mutant named Russell(Julian Dennison), from Cable(Josh Brolin) who is a mutant from the future. However, Deadpool can't do this alone & takes the help of his fellow mutants.Deadpool 2 is a mind-blowing film. Director David Leitch & writers Rhett Reese, Paul Wernick & Ryan Reynolds give us a film that is filled with hysterical one-liners, hilarious gags & the kind of raw, realistic action that made all of us fall in love with the first movie. Deadpool's appeal & what makes his character so unique, is his fourth wall breaking antics & constant references to other superhero franchises. The action set pieces are amazing. The visual effects are flawless. The extremely talented cast is the highlight of the film. Ryan Reynolds is spectacular as Wade Wilson/Deadpool. Reynolds' effortless portrayal of the foul mouthed anti-hero, makes it seem like he was born to play the 'Merc With a Mouth'. Josh Brolin is outstanding as Cable. Brolin has given us back-to-back memorable performances of two iconic Marvel Comics' characters, this one & Thanos from Avengers: Infinity War(2018). Morena Baccarin is awesome as Vanessa. Zazie Beetz is incredible as Domino. Brianna Hildebrand is great as Negasonic Teenage Warhead. T.J. Miller is superb as Weasel. Julian Dennison is brilliant as Russell. Karan Soni is excellent as Dopinder. Stefan Kapicic is impressive as Colossus. Leslie Uggams is unforgettable as Blind Al. Bill Skarsgard, Terry Crews, Rob Delaney, Lewis Tan, Jack Kesy, Eddie Marsan & Shioli Kutsuna are good as Zeitgeist, Bedlam, Peter, Shatterstar, Black Tom Cassidy, Headmaster & Yukio, respectively. Deadpool 2 is a must watch. Go & witness a completely wacky superhero movie!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"I enjoyed the jokes, if you expect more than you'll be disappointed.","Watch Deadpool, if you enjoy the humour in it for what it is, then you'll probably enjoy the humour in the second. I went to the film with this in mind and got my money's worth, and enjoyed some of the parts I didn't fully expect, (such as the X-Force launch). The overall action-direction has also improved, with action being more fun to follow and funnier than the first.That being said, besides the few times that it circumvents its own plot, Deadpool 2 follows a hackneyed, cliche plot that doesn't stray far from typical beats, and the ""sad part"" at the beginning feels incredibly shoe-horned in and weak. Many of the characters are also very under-written, such as Russel and Domino. A lot of wasted potential, but I'd say similar things about the first.Worth the price, but isn't particularly noteworthy. I don't think I'd see it again, but I'm glad I watched it.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A masterclass of destructive humour,"Savage. That's the least I can come up with to describe Deadpool 2 in one word. This will probably be the coolest movie released this year or for some time now. Sometimes crass, sometimes extremely clever and sometimes emotional, this movie does everything. The self destructive humour this time is up a notch compared to the last one. The comic book, music and other Hollywood references make this movie a treat for a serious movie fan. The humour hits the nail on the head and mocks Hollywood and meny sensitive issues. The promos themselves that lead to this have been brilliantly executed and the movie does one better.This time the movie is not just about Deadpool himself but about the other mutant characters as well. The movie is probably building up to a new generation of XMen. Deadpool fights to save a mutant teenager from Cable who has come from the future. Things get complicated than they are supposed to be and Deadpool fights a moral battle within himself to make the right decisions. The action is indeed brutal thanks to R rating and yet is fun to watch. Old school rock and hip hop music adds to the funky flavour of the movie.What makes this movie special is the way the characters are written. Every character is so unique and almost everyone makes an impact just because how weird the characters are (watch out for a super special guest appearance). Special mention to the dialogue writers of the movie for the insanely clever lines. Ryan Reynolds is just brilliant and it feels like he should be only be playing as Deadpool in whatever the movie he is in. The role of cable suits perfectly for Josh Brolin and with Thanos and this it seems like this is a second coming of his own. All the other support characters do a very good job and special mention to Karan Soni's Dopinder whose role is much more funnier than the first part.Deadpool 2 does everything what you expects it to do and still manages to surprise you. This movie will probably give birth to a new genre in Hollywood something in the lines of parody-satire-action. God bless the coolest crew who made this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Brilliant! So funny, simple yet effective storyline, great casting.","Both deadpool's are brilliant. I perhaps enjoyed the first one a little bit more, but this is still a brilliant movie. My thoughts are:(1) Great plot, script & visuals. The storyline is solid and there is a clear goal. The movie is also well structured, as is the pacing (good combination of talking and action scenes). The comedy is on point & I would assume that most people would find it funny.(2) Great casting. Ryan nails the role (to the extent that I don't feel like he is acting, it feels natural). I'm not sure if the movie was specifically written for him, which I wouldn't be surprised about. Also, the supporting characters complement him well. The kid (Julian aka Firefist), isn't the type of person that I would typically put in that role, but it worked well.(3) If I was forced to find a critique, I would say that the ending was a bit abrupt, almost like ""and now we're all friends"", the end. But at the same time, at least they didn't unnecessarily drag it out.Would recommend!",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Bigger, Better, Bolder. Maximum Laughs and Action.","TL;DRBeat the sequel curse - better than the first oneBetter story with more heartStory takes a surprising directionNot bogged down in origin storiesPlenty of jokes and references, never falling short on comedyAs much a comedy as it is a superhero filmBreathtaking, exciting action sequencesHumanises Deadpool moreReturning and new characters all a joy, but never steal the light from ReynoldsBest post-credits scene yet (yes, even better than MCU)------------------------------------------------Despite the wide variety of characters in Marvel comics, Deadpool has always been a unique; the Merc with a Mouth has won the hearts of comic fans worldwide and more recently the hearts of film fans too with 2016's Deadpool. The first film was an excellent portrayal of the character, Reynolds proving the perfect choice for playing the inimitable Wade Wilson. Hopes were naturally very high for the sequel, but, as with all follow-ups, there was a worry that it wouldn't live up to the original; that it would perhaps go too far or be just a rehash of what we've seen before. Fortunately, that's not the case - if anything, Deadpool 2 is better than its predecessor, with a better story, more characters and much more references and humour. Still, although this film succeeds on every level, it still struggles to be quite as unique and memorable as the titular character himself.The story in Deadpool 2 is hugely better and more entertaining than the previous one, jumping straight in with full-on Deadpool action and leading on to a genuinely engaging narrative. Unlike the first, this one doesn't have the handicap of being bogged down in an origin story. This results in a better story with much more heart and more even more comedy. In fact, the story takes a fairly surprising turn, taking us in an unpredictable direction. Despite the sheer volume of promotion for this film, it's commendable that much of its plot details were not leaked ahead of time. As much as it mocks fellow superhero films, in this respect it's an improvement on Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, a film that was famously criticised for giving away the main antagonist at the end as well as the inclusion of Wonder Woman.On top of this, it has a different feel to a lot of other superhero films and comes across as notably fresh even in an already saturated genre dominated by the MCU. A lot of this has to do with how Deadpool is different and how humour is at the heart of both the character and the film. There are plenty of references which can make anyone laugh, particularly film and comic fans though. It takes a certain boldness for a film to ridicule itself, but it definitely works to its advantage here. There's even wise-cracking and jokes in the middle of intense action scenes, never falling short on laughs. These jokes make the otherwise breathtaking and exciting fight scenes that much more enjoyable. It's just as much a comedy as it is a superhero film, arguably even funnier than most comedy films released. This is precisely what we need in this genre, making Deadpool 2 stand out even though coming out just weeks after record breaking superhero film Avengers: Infinity War.Since wise-cracking and comedy is at the heart of Deadpool's character himself, it then comes as no surprise that this is without a doubt Ryan Reynolds' film. Once more completely throwing himself into the role, he's proven himself yet again to be perfect as Deadpool. This film managed to give him a chance to humanise the character, giving us a more emotional Wade amongst the ceaseless joking. Not that our titular hero gets edgy at all - that duty is served perfectly by newcomer Josh Brolin. Even though we've just seen him as Thanos, he makes an excellent adversary to Deadpool as Cable (although he's still called Thanos once in one of many great one-liners), with a large heart underneath the gruff, rugged persona. Another newcomer, Zazie Beetz also fits in very well as an opposite to Deadpool, rolling her eyes at all his jokes and quips, often effortless managing to steal the spotlight in some of the action scenes. Julian Dennison too is very welcome in his role, only his comedy talents seem slightly underused - still, he's gone from Hunt for the Wilderpeople to a more mainstream film. Hopefully this is a step in the right direction for a up and coming star. Other supporting characters return fresh-faced and excited to continue, but they never manage to steal the spotlight from Reynolds.Anyone who enjoyed the first film is guaranteed to enjoy the second. Everything that we liked from the former returns, this time bigger and better; more story, more characters, more action, more laughs, more heart - think Avengers was the only excellent superhero film this year? Think again. It's almost as if Black Panther was a starter, Avengers was the main, Deadpool 2 is dessert, and Ant-Man and the Wasp will be coffee. Not only is it impressive for Deadpool to stand among the MCU titans, but dessert has never been so fun.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Hollywood execs had more input on this one than the first Deadpool,"Unnecessary diversity that adds nothing to a backstory. They made the New Zealand/Arab looking kid a terrorist when he gets old, wtf why? 
Zazie's character as Domino was the most pointless character in any comic book movie to date. She was literally there for no reason and they had to make her back to put her on a poster. Hollywood needs to chill with this diversity for no reason thing. 
It's like black Annie, there's no point of it... If you're going to make diversity in a movie, don't make it the most politically incorrect comic book character of all time. Hollywood this isn't pokemon, we don't need to catch them all and shuv one of every race into a film, it's not necessary whatsoever.

The Return of the Vulgar Vigilante,"This film essentially begins with the masked vigilante known as ""Deadpool"" (Ryan Reynolds) taking it upon himself to eliminate organized crime members in various parts of the world utilizing his incredible superpowers. Yet even though he has a great deal of success at first, his failure to take down a certain leader of a crime syndicate backfires when his girlfriend ""Vanessa"" (Morena Baccarin) is accidently killed by a bullet that was meant for him. Needless to say, this devastates him to the point that he attempts to kill himself due to his profound grief. His plan is thwarted, however, due to his incredible healing abilities which allows the superhero named ""Colossus"" (Stefan Kapicic) to take his unconscious body back to his mansion where he eventually talks Deadpool into joining the crime-fighting unit known as the X-Men--but only as a trainee at first. Naturally, being the arrogant and abrasive person that he is, Deadpool dismisses his probationary status much like everything else in life--and it's this cavalier attitude which soon results in problems for everyone concerned. Now, rather than reveal any more, I will just say that this film pretty much resembled its predecessor in that it contained a great deal of action combined with a heavy amount of vulgar humor. So, adult supervision is probably warranted. Be that as it may, although I don't believe that it was quite as good as its predecessor, I still enjoyed this movie to a certain degree, and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Setup Alone Worth Price of Admission,"The setup is an homage to The Princess Bride featuring an adult Fred Savage being read an adult fairy tale by Deadpool.The plot is stupid, but it's nothing more than a vehicle for an action-comedy that borders on parody. The character of Deadpool is irreverent, jocular, and self-aware - certainly a very fresh sort of character and a joy to watch on screen.Far more effective than Mel Brooks movies because it's more coherent and the dialogue and situations are more outrageous, plus the plot, while not the strong point of the feature, would be serviceable on its own.Honourable Mentions: Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult.

This movie looks like a meta joke married a vulgar script,"The first thing to notice about Deadpool 2 is how much it improves on the first, from the comedy, to the story (which is 10x better than before), to the action, to the direction, to the characters.Deadpool 2 feels more like a movie than the first, and not a 20 minute storyline painfully stretched out to be feature length. And while the first 30 minutes do become boring, overall this is a much better time than before, it even has some decent emotional moments (which could be completely undercut if the end credits scene is canon).The story is still nothing special, and still falls into the trap of being exactly like the cliché comic book movies it ridicules, and is no where near as meta as it thinks it is, or needs to be, in order to be something really different, especially when all marvel movies mock themselves anyway. The Deadpool movies simply need to go further as at the moment the meta moments are by far the most forced and unfunny moments in them - why hold back? Why make a joke about there being a big CGI fight, but then have the CGI fight play out like a normal movie? Truly go for it, do something like render the CGI so bad and maybe you could get something more than a cheap laugh.Speaking of laughs, this is THE definition of 50/50 comedy, and truly is one of the best examples of the writers throwing everything at the wall and seeing what sticks.Ryan Reynolds is clearly in love with this character and is a big reason these movies work, and with this being a large step up from the boring, formulaic first instalment, hopefully part 3 will top them both.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Review from someone who hated the first film,"To understand where I'm coming from, I disliked the first movie. I thought the jokes weren't funny, I thought the whole thing was juvenile, the action was too over the top to be enjoyable, just an overall dislike.Going into Deadpool 2, I had worries about enjoying it. The first 15 minutes of the movie didn't do anything to dispel that. The humour was the same, the action was the same, it just wasn't my thing.However, after that a few scenes started popping up that were well done. The acting was slower, more heartfelt, had some weight behind the scenes. I started caring about the characters (some, not all. TJ Miller is still TJ Miller). The action started clicking for me. The jokes started hitting. And I realized that I was enjoying this movie much more than the first.Part of that credit goes to the new characters. Josh Brolin's Cable is menacing, but you care for him. Domino is a fun new character, with her (non) superpower.There are still scenes which were too like the first movie for me, and I'm docking point for that. But, if you like that movie, feel free to consider this score 2 points higher.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Gotta Love These Movies,"(Late) Deadpool 2 Review:Deadpool 2 is the hilarious marvel sequel to the first one. Deadpool is one of the best superhero and Marvel movies so I had high expectations. The expectations for me were met. Ryan Reynolds was once again spot on with his portrayal of Wade Wilson/Deadpool. He is hilarious and just perfect. Josh Brolin as Cable was pretty good too. I liked his character, but not as much as I expected I would. He was still good. Other stand outs for me were Zazie Beetz as Domino, Julian Dennison as Firefist, and as always T. J. Miller as Weasel. The movie had amazing jokes and was probably funnier than the first one. Sometimes it did rely on jokes a little too much which you could tell at parts. The action sequences were good, as they were either deep or humorous. The CGI was fine, there were quite a few times that you could tell it wasn't real however. The music choices were amazing. It reminded me of Guardians of the Galaxy. The plot was interesting and kept my attention for almost the whole thing. There was one character that was added which I thought was cool but it just seemed a little bit out of place. I though Deadpool 2 was a funny and enjoyable movie.

Very pleasantly surprised,"I was actually very pleasantly surprised by this. I thought the original Deadpool, while amusing at times, was also super forced. It seemed to think that because it was R-rated and had gore and ""bad words"" it was something completely unique, but it still followed all of the conventions of the genre. While it wasn't a bad film, it wasn't one I liked very much because it was just so annoying. To my complete surprise, I found the sequel so much better. Although the first act was a little rough, it finds its groove in a way the original didn't- it actually has a strong main storyline, strong antagonist, and it actually does break away from the conventions of the genre in a way the first didn't. Not to mention I also found it a lot funnier (the ""landing"" of the new superheroes Deadpool recruits was an amazingly done scene). It's not perfect, but this is the super entertaining, funny and outrageous film the first wanted to be but wasn't.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Actually funny,"I started the movie a little skeptical thinking it couldn't live up to the first one, which was a masterpiece. Then right in the beginning of the movie something seriously sad and uncalled for happens, which I'm still a little mad about. However I actually did make me laugh and it made my boyfriend laugh hysterical. Plenty of physical comedy.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Enjoyable but overdoes the self depreciating humour.,"Just like the first film Deadpool 2 is exciting and funny. Ryan Reynolds is again great in the title role and has great support from some new characters. The thing that let's it down is the continuous attempts at humour from the same joke. In the original the ""who's in charge now McAvoy or Stewart?"" line, was funny but trying to rehash variations of that same joke time and time again, became tedious. We know it's a film, they know it's a film, they don't need to keep on about it.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
I love it!,"As wonderful as the first Deadpool was, I would say I actually enjoyed the sequel more. It has lots of action, mixed with comedy. I love all the jokes and the fact that they're not afraid to offend anyone. I know it's been said before but Ryan Reynolds was born to play Deadpool. It was cool to see Julian Dennison. He was fantastic in Hunt for the Wilderpeople, as well as in this film. Josh Brolin and Zazie Beetz were also great additions. I would definitely recommend watching this sequel. It's an awesome movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Hilarious aftercredits.,"The movie is worth it from the aftercredits alone. The things you will see in the aftercredits are totally crazy and hilarious, you would expect such thing from no matter what movie it is, but I guess with Deadpool it is a different story. The movie overall is in the same rank as the first one, altho this one felt more like an episode than like a film. The jokes were amazing, this time Ryan really outdone himself and he will keep you up until the very end. The apperance of Cable is something I really liked and I expect to see more from him in the future because he really fits the MCU, I am not into comics, but I am sure he is a character in the comics.

Deadpool and the cast shines,Deadpool is back. He is softy now. He has new members who all have personality and are badass enough so the movie still feels like Deadpool 1. I find second one more fun due to the new members. There are multiple cameos from different X Men which are all great. The first half of the movie kind of lags but second half makes up for it where all the jokes land and its action packed.I give Deadpool 2 8.5 stars.

Ryan 'Deadpool' Reynolds is back with bang!!,"Deadpool 2 is an action, adventure, Sci-fi, comedy movie directed by David Leith and stars Ryan Reynolds, Josh Brolin, Morena Baccarin, Julian Dennison, Zazie Beetz, T. J. Miller, Karan Soni and Eddie Marsan.This is the second instalment in the Deadpool series.It's very rare to see the sequel more effective and entertaining from it's first part as far as deadpool 2 is much more entertaining, hilarious, fun and action packed.The best part of the movie is it's Witty characters, great special effects, funny one liners and above all Ryan Reynolds who had completely submerged himself in the character of Deadpool.Screenplay of the movie is fast and superb and will keep you engaged throughout the movie, action scenes are amazing and special effects deserves standing ovation.Back in 2016 the producers took a gamble by producing a R rated superhero movie which gave birth to this stupendously funny series and we should thank the makers for this.Acting is been superb and as mentioned earlier Ryan Reynolds had infused the life into the character and had almost single handedly took the movie on his shoulders, Josh Brolin was brilliant as always and was spot-on, Julian Dennison was amazing but looked lost in few of the scenes but this hadn't affected the movie. Zazie Beetz, T. J. Miller and Karan Soni had done equally effective job. Morena Baccarin could've been utilized better.This is undoubtedly one of the best 'R' rated superhero flick which will keep you entertained till the end credits of the movie.

Littered with hilarious jokes and no fourth wall whatsoever,"Making a good sequel is hard. Making a brilliant one is even harder. Making Deadpool 2 must have been insanely hard then because this movie is a home run in almost every aspect.Since there is only one negative thing I have to say about this movie I'll get it right out of the way.
A lot of the cgi was visibly very bad. Surprisingly bad actually. I have no idea if it was ironic or not but its really not that big of a flaw.Ok so positive stuff: 
The movie was absolutely stomach-pain-inducingly funny. There are moments in this movie where the whole theater was screaming from laughter. I didn't notice a single joke that fell flat. Of course some are either low brow or just not as good but none of them were horribly cringy or in general bad.
Ryan gives, yet again, another perfect portrayal of the merc with the mouth. Born for it , literally. 
Josh Brolin was a absolute blast as cable as well. Layered performance and actually well written character.I think this movie works best with someone who watches lots of movies, follows pop culture (particularly marvel (and heck even some dc) movies). The references are at least 60% of the humor along with the hilarious slapstick and visual comedy.All of the characters are great, the standout being Domino. Not because of the performance as much as just the brilliantness of the idea of a lucky superhero.The movie is action packed with a lot of hilarious visual comedy as well as plenty of gore and limbs to satisfy the R rated hungry Deadpool fans.The movie has some seriousness to it too, not only being 100% wacky like the first Deadpool. The writers actually injected some emotion and ""family connection"" into the movie and it all worked very well.Please do yourself a favor and stay until the after credits (of which there are two, just don't miss them).Fantastic sequel and probably the funniest movie I have seen in a while.

"A Razor-Sharp, Funny Sequel","Ryan Reynolds' Merc With a Mouth is finally back in action. While not a perfect film, this sequel is incredibly entertaining and is probably guaranteed to please fans of its predecessor. This movie primarily centers around Deadpool forming a team of amateur superheroes known as the X-Force to stop Cable (Josh Brolin) from killing a mutant teenager named Russell. The R-rated action and humor moviegoers come to expect from this franchise is on full display here, with impressive action scenes that operate on a greater visual scale and with deeper interpersonal stakes than in the first movie. One skydiving sequence that occurs midway through the film is particularly memorable. Deadpool's fourth-wall-breaking, foul-mouthed dark sarcasm certainly doesn't disappoint in the movie. The film is loaded to the brim with meta jokes that take on everything from comic book movies to music to politics. Generally, the jokes on display here do feel fresher and funnier than the humorous lines in the original ""Deadpool,"" which is greatly appreciated.Reynolds is always great as Deadpool, nailing the part just like he was able to do in the original. Josh Brolin does a fantastic job playing Cable, giving him a unique sense of grit and depth absent from many other superhero-movie villains. In fact, the unique personification of Cable's own circumstances adds a layer of subtle sophistication that enhances audiences' perception of the narrative. The other new characters, from ""ordinary"" X-Force member Peter to Russell to Domino, are all quite strong. The movie is a bit too long and suffers from one overly generic action scene (the prison fight) and a moderately erratic third act, but it's an incredibly entertaining ride that will induce plenty of laughs and cheers from audiences. Just be sure to stay for the credits! 7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Am i the only one???,"I ADORED this movie so much it was hilarious, i think that it was better than the 1st one it was great and Domino was badass.Cable was great and it really felt like a fun action movie that everyone will loveI recomend the deadpool movies to everyone, even the people who dont like marvel.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A wildly entertaining sequel,"Josh Brolin is awesome. For the last month, he has been dominating world cinema with his formidable supervillain Thanos. All the moviegoers have been talking about him and his character. Here in this film Deadpool 2, he continues his dominance with a new supervillain Cable, and this time the new character has a heart. In some way, Josh Brolin is transforming the character development of villain that is usually bad for no reason, in the sense that his charaters are either reasonable or not that bad, or both.This sequel improves over its 2016 original movie ""Deadpool"" in terms of the number of jokes and the number of topics covered in the jokes. Particularly, it refers to Martin Luther King Jr.'s speech. It also touches on James Cameron's actioners ""Terminator"" and ""Terminator 2"" that some villain is traveling back in time to kill some boy, preventing something in the future to happen. Even Brolin's makeup is similar to that of Schwarzenegger.Of course, nothing is perfect. The shortcoming of this movie is the same as its original, which is that the plot is too simple. Besides, the profanity and violence prevent it from being a family-friendly movie.",,Anonymous,Comedy

Exquisitely careless,"Deadpool 2, much like the first film in the series (which will no doubt become a trilogy) is very clearly a passion project for Ryan Reynolds. His sheer dedication to portraying what we see in the source material and putting it to film is something that unlike other super hero blockbusters can only be achieved through a sense of cairlessnes from Director David Leitch and writers Paul Wernick and Rhett Reese. This is due to the nature of the title character himself, the Deadpool that readers know from the comics doesn't care about studio rivalry, copyright infringement or timeline consistency. This is a character that says and does what he wants, when he wants and it's because of this that the Deadpool films have secured and maintained their own unique brand of humour that simply couldn't be achieved by any other character. Of course all humour is subjective though and one could make the argument that Deadpool 2 has an over reliance on pop culture references which is especially risky territory when it comes to comedy as anyone who is not as pop culturally aware as the common geek will be left wondering why everyone else in the theatre has tears of joy in their eyes while they're sat quietly wondering what the hell just happened. It's clear that the writers aren't going for mainstream appeal when they reference obscure 90's comic book trivia and why should they when this brand of humour worked so well in the first one? The plot keeps things simplistic and somewhat relatable, it's a semi unorthodox family tale with a revenge plot woven into it which is the motivation for Josh Brolin's mercenary from the future ""Cable"". The title character's emotional journey isn't anything we haven't seen before but it is a refreshing change of pace from the gorgeously gory action sequences we've all come to expect from this character. Deadpool's healing abilities are incorporated into the action in far more more interesting ways than what we've seen from Hugh Jackman's ""Wolverine"". There is no over use of shaky cam and the chase sequences are top notch and easy to follow. Overall ""Deadpool 2"" is a sequel that has an excellent blend of humour, action and emotion. It's certainly not something that will appeal to more traditional viewers who value immersion above all else but if that's what you're looking for then why would you even consider this film? 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Fun ride overall with some pacing issues,"Let me start by saying that I like the movie overall. The characters are pretty good, the story fits for the characters and the effects are alright as well. Also the humor and references are a lot of fun.I completely lost it during the mid credit scenes.The movie has weak points though. The pacing is a bit inconsistent and some stuff is to drawn out and in terms of humor missfires.I'd give the movie a 7/10 but I have one problem I cannot overlook which drags it down to a 6. There is some extremely forced social justice nonsense that just makes my eyes roll. It's just unnecessary. The humor related to it doesn't work for me as its not really represented in a sarcastic way.In the end you need to decide for yourself whether or not you want to give the movie a chance. It is not as good as the first one, but still has quite a few high notes.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Untitled Deadpool Sequel,"If only Untitled Deadpool Sequel was the title. If only. I just got back from seeing Ryan Reynolds' return as Deadpool and I didn't expect much, but found it to supply a lot of laughs and more breakage of the fourth wall. I didn't catch much of the trailers so everything in this movie was new. I liked the first one, but I was never much of a fan like most other people.Deadpool's woman dies by some criminal and Deadpool kills him. I thought this was going to be a revenge story (might have explained the plot in the previews but I missed that) but instead he joins the X-Men and saves some kid with fire hands. Then we are introduced to Cable (Josh Brolin) who wants to kill this kid while Deadpool in the kid are stuck in the prison from Escape Plan.The action scenes are spectacular. Honestly, what's even better is the ending to this movie. Let me just say it is good to stick around to the end (nothing after the credits so don't bother) and you are in for a treat. I was taken by surprise by it and it was very clever. I love it.I am certainly positive they will make a third installment. If you are a fan of comic book movies or Deadpool is your thing, you should really see this. I'll be honest, I thought this was going to be an average sequel that doesn't live up to the first. I don't remember much of the first but this one might be better. Just remember, it's a family movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Just as Good as Its Predecessor,"I'll start off and be completely honest in saying that I thoroughly enjoyed the first Deadpool film, but wasn't blown away or busting a gut laughing from start to finish. The meta jokes were fantastic and the story itself was even quite engaging, but it wore thin for me by the third act. That being said, I found myself hoping that a sequel would be even better. Deadpool 2 has just hit the big screen, and while I can't say it's a funnier movie, I can say the film itself is a vast improvement when looking at the filmmaking alone. This movie does a good job of creating new jokes and even making old jokes funny again, but there's something about these movies that has me having a hard time falling in love with them. Here's why Deadpool 2 comes highly recommended for fans, but not at all for anyone else.Quite a few plot devices are used here, but without getting to any spoilers, Deadpool 2 follows Wade Wilson once again, as he feels the need to protect a young boy with superpowers, while a time-traveling mutant in Cable is one the rise, hunting this boy down. From realizing that he may just work better with partners, to realizing that he may love more than just himself, there are a lot of storylines and emotional aspects that elevate this from another average superhero comedy. I found myself shocked to see how much time was spent on action or drama, instead of the need to always joke around. Yes, this movie is riddled with humor from start to finish, but this felt like a more mature version of the previous film.As far as the humor itself goes, I mentioned that I quite enjoyed what they did with the first movie, but felt that it wore out by the end. This time around, the jokes felt a little more spread out, which is why I believe they worked better here, so I could catch a breath and not be hounded with excessive amounts of comedy. You may actually feel differently about that because there are jokes throughout certain dramatic moments, but I chose to see it as a dramatic moment, rather than a comedic one. So I was pleasantly surprised to see a nice blend of those two genres.Ryan Reynolds continues to prove that he was born to play this role. Not many actors/actresses can prove that they were meant to act in a specific role, but Reynolds is definitely one of the few who can. It goes without saying that his heart is in these movies until the very end, so how was the supporting cast? Josh Brolin delivers a solid performance as Cable, but I feel as though he comes out of nowhere during the beginning of the movie. I felt a little short-changed in terms of his development. His screen time vastly increases by the end and made his character worth it, but I still wished to see a little more from him.Everyone has been seeing images and footage in the trailers for the tease at the X-Force team that Deadpool recruits here, and I can say that their screen time is easily one of the highlights of the entire film. Looking back on the movie, the character of Domino (played by Zazie Beetz) is easily my favorite in the entire film. Her ability is hilarious and very unique in combat, and each of these characters just added another level to the movie, whether they were shining in an action sequence, or just there to make the audience laugh, or leave them shocked.In the end, I enjoyed this sequel just as much as its predecessor. I thought the first movie lacked a tone that this one presented, but the comedy will impress viewers more in the first film, so there is a balance that really has me debating which one I liked more. Deadpool 2 benefits from very solid direction from David Leitch and the fact that Ryan Reynolds joined writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick made it feel a little different from the first. The first movie was a celebration that a movie like this could be made, but this one dives a little deeper and I quite enjoyed that about it. While I don't love either of these movies, they are a blast to watch. Deadpool 2 has its issues, but it's a solid movie all around.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Just when you though the Marvel movies couldnt get worse...,"This is easily the worst Marvel mutant movie made to date. Not funny in any way unless you're about 10 years old. The story is asinine and writing was something out of a high school production.Also, the depiction of the comic characters is one of the worst in any movie so far. I am a big fan of Domino and Cable but I hated everything about them in this movie. They are nothing like the books I read back in the 90s and 2000s. Cable was completely ruined and Domino is now a ditsy clown. They couldn't have selected a worse actor for the character for Nathan. He was so out of place with the written character that you might as well had given the roll to Ben Stiller. That actor needs to be replaced immediately.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
I get the hate. This movie is just tooooo much...,"But that is the point!
We got used to serious films with deep messages and serious story, even while watching comic book movies so people got disappointed with Deadpool 2 which is actually closest to its comic book origins than any superhero movie ever.
With so much of goofy action scenes and jokes this movie is basically parody in the vein of ""The Hot Shots! Part Deux"" but it also has lot of serious stuff. There is no parody that makes fun of everything and also has the space for the meaningful story like this one.
I've expected something like Deadpool 1 but I've got Deadpool 1 on steroids :DIt has funny references and jokes for any kind of viewer.
There were some everyday jokes that casual viewers found hilarious and few seconds later there is some reference and parody of pop culture for geeks like me.
Even if you don't get half of the jokes, the other half will laugh your ass off. I think movie was written in that kind of way. To literally please everyone and surprise someone who will get all of the jokes.
Some will say it's just the lazy writing :P but that kind of writing is actually rare.Some hate the movie because they think it's too much and I understand that opinion because it is too much haha, personally I don't like that in other movies but its really goofy made in this one and we needed that.

"Is black humor a racist disposition, Mr. Deadpool?","I'm not sure if Deadpool would fit into Marvel Studios' new rising canon in relation to the recent billionaire contract between companies, hence the aggressive and abrasive superhero shines out in a simple, direct plot. The screenplay is written by Rhett Reese, Paul Wernick - two screenwriters from the first installment - and Reynolds himself, the story decides to develop itself within the limits fixed by the previously selected genres, resting, as could not be otherwise, on the scarred shoulders of the red-and-black hero. Nonetheless, this is a far-seeing second film, which allows nearly fifteen additional characters to be included in a split second, opting for a quintet/sextet - is Dopinder, the taxi driver and faithful squire, on the team? - that lays the groundwork for what will be their standalone film - cough, new franchise, cough,- X-Force. The exposition of the daring group is irregular because they don't present in their own movie, a fact that caused the writers to compact the materials organically without deflecting from the plot focus; having said that, watching them working on the screen isn't as magnetic and special as one would expect, but they produce enough charm to sympathize with each of them. The incorruptible morale of Colossus, voiced by Stefan Kapicic, and the commendable CGI effort bring a strong and fantastic counterpoint to our hero because they compose a ridiculously genuine bromance; Zazie Beetz's Domino doesn't reach Valkyrie's empowered female impact, but defends its lucky storyline by means of a sincere and distant acting development that falls apart trying to fill the impression she couldn't cause - it's respectful not include in the final footage the sequence led by her stunt double, Joi ""SJ"" Harris, after the tragedy that took place on 14 August last year; - Taika Waititi's big Kiwi revelation, who portrays Russell, is one of the characters who gains an important background and dramatic development, which helps him become a vital handle to the general plot by means of a plausible, emotional and, to tell the truth, quite realistic performance; as a mutant, Firefist is the spirited new youth incorporation in the clan, it'd be interesting to see how it would develop his storyline in a story in which he and his burning hands become part of a team; Nathan Summers' time travels are truly wasted - save the epic and meta-narrative post-credits scene - for large-scale situations, they're never used as an instrument in storytelling, are simply an input/output mechanism for a half-human, half-machine-and-armament hero; in the same way, its introduction is tremendously indecisive and ineffective, with a flat and out-of-place edition delivering short, insubstantial glimpses about the next member of the gang. However, ever-fierce Josh Brolin endows Cable, the most long-awaited new character by the fanatics, with virility and overwhelming visual portent, his scenes expel physical and mental strength, not excluding a subtle emergence of comedy through his unwavering and austere personality; And last but not least: Deadpool. The actor from ""Green Lantern -"" I'm sorry, I had to do it - found what Hugh Jackman and Tom Cruise found in Wolverine and Ethan Hunt respectively: the role by which he'll be recognized for the rest of his career. The naturalness, dynamism, vigor and passion impregned by the Canadian interpreter are really a cracker, the irreverence and comicalness of this fella, who had been pursuing these movies since his failed incorporation in ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"", reveal how much hard work he did, every line coming from his mouth, adorned with his characteristic gestures that aren't hidden under the suit, is cruel, dramatic and hilarious; it's incredible the power his performance has to know how to handle the rhythm throughout the film and the exact moment of each parodic insertion leaning on a brutal script. No doubt, this highly-anticipated sequel never loses sight of its raison d'être, providing an authentic, entertaining story, which is open to receive the incessant jokes coming from the screenplay. Ryan Reynolds is killing it as Deadpool.It's increasingly obvious the writing of the screenplay was more complicated than you thought, as shaping the hilarious dialogues for the anti-hero demands inventiveness from more than one brain. Reese, Wernick, and Reynolds stick thousands, thousands, thousands of references, not just as the usual easter-eggs game. Pop-culture is key, the endless mentions on screen through one-liners are sickeningly amusing thanks to our strange time. No-one and nothing can get away from the vicious signs: literature (Pericles), music (dubstep), singers (Cher and Justin Bieber), actors (Jackman and, oh!, Reynolds), of course film (""Star Wars,"" DC, Marvel, 007's ""Spectre,"" ""John Wick"" and a long etcetera), and even the movie conception itself, laughing at the writing process, the production companies, its screenwriters and director through an unforgettable meta-cinematographic language. Such was the impact that I began to hyperventilate, picking references that maybe were never deliberately introduced by the screenwriters (""Spy"" by Paul Feig or ""Inception"" by Nolan). Hands down, the film with more explicitly-implanted-in-the-script pop-culture references I have ever seen.It's sad to admit, but fourth wall breaking decreases in impact and number. It's an understandable decision because this time our hero isn't alone, but the movie should find ways and new narrative incursions which replace the role that played this brilliant technique. However, the few are short and don't get the importance they deserve, yes, we still have his peculiar voice-over monologues maneuvering anachronistically the story and mocking even the smallest detail, but they never bridge the gap of those long and hilarious soliloquies and conversations he held with the audience as a narrative mechanism with tremendous effectiveness.It'd be demoralizing to say that, after the titanic and classical work put into ""Infinity War"" with regard to the creation, treatment, and exposition of its villains, Marvel has taken a step back, sorry, somehow it did. All right, Ed Skrein's Ajax isn't the best Marvel villain of all time, but it's neither the worst because he gives it a proper development and time enough on screen to make the viewer understand who the bad guy in the movie is, however, on this occasion, there is no a delimited antagonist. Obviously, most viewers buy a ticket to see their favorite hero do and undo, but it's important to know if whoever gets such punches- curse words in this case -has managed to involve with the audience and the story, here, none of that happened of course. Villain's role changes so many times that, in the end, the course of events seems disoriented; firstly, Cable would become a pain in the neck for the antihero according to the script, however, thanks to a shrewd plot twist, Mr. Nathan gives up his seat to two more characters, a yo-yo move that doesn't favor and ends up giving the perception there is no real villain, perhaps, the only baddie is Deadpool.This installment had the chance to remedy the lack of spectacle in the mise-en-scène and the exposition of the largest and most expensive set-pieces, however, even with a highly qualified stunt coordinator, you never get something really epic matching tremendous levels of violence with some kind of visual beauty. Stuntman-turned-filmmaker David Leitch is known for what ""John Wick"" is recognized as a cult-film today: its fierce, brutal, meticulously choreographed combats. Although it's evident an upsurge in less-artificial fighting scenes and comically bloody sequences, none of these serves to mask a lackluster visual buffet, in the last, lacking styled compositions that leave you astounded, doing no justice to the exquisite visuals and action in ""JW"" and ""Atomic Blonde,"" the two previous works of the filmmaker. Jonathan Sela's cinematography handles intelligent and frankly striking angles, but he never ventures to pass the limits over and decides to settle with a couple of laudable sequences that always shine under the shadow of the well-made fights in the first flick, I find it somewhat strange, especially taking into account who its director is, not even the final sequence which draws its strengths on the always-funny performances and the unbeatable screenplay. There are similarities in a specific sequence, one that many remember from Miller's pic for the misuse of special effects, yes, the one in which Wade Wilson is kicking asses along a freeway as an opening scene, here, it's Domino who must withstand an embarrassing set-piece, it's unheard of the poorly-achieved digital effects it must endure, it seems as if the crew had forgotten to finish it and had decided to release it that way, the scenes aren't realistic at all, it looks like a 2000's video game. Tyler Bates doesn't do a sincerely rewarding feat as his ""soundtrack"" for the film vomits hyperactive and energetic melodies over the frames, that don't contribute anything to the visual part to excel. The only original song which can really monopolize the spotlights soon is 'Ashes ' interpreted by the queen Celine Dion.""Deadpool 2"" by David Leitch unimpeachably dynamizes only some of the features which made the first movie so freestanding, unusually special and extravagant while neglecting aspects of cardinal importance as a good approach to the characters, a stunning visual section and a deep, conscious development and treatment to a powerful villain. But don't worry, you'll get more vicious action, trenchant jokes and one-liners, visual gags, a new volatile group of heroes, many, many references of all kinds and an experience that does not disappoint, but what's a Wade Wilson/Ryan Reynolds who gets his long-awaited sequel where the only thing that matters is the surface? By the way, did I leave the stove on?",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Deadpool hits his stride,"The original Deadpool was fun but didn't feel like it reached its full potential.

Funny movie but not as good as the first,"While this movie has an estimated budget double that of the first and feels bigger plot and location wise.... bigger doesn't always mean better.The movie recycles the plot of terminator 2 with Cable (played by Thanos AKA Josh Brolin) looking so much like him that I was just waiting for that joke to come up.... spoiler, it never does.The Movie has quite a few funny scenes and at times it feels like it's trolling the audience with how they subvert your expectations which I loved.Other times however I questioned some of the choices made as they felt like a rehash of the jokes in part one.Cable and Dominos where amazing and the highlight of this movie which kindda makes it wasteful since it takes awhile for them to make their entrance.Is this a fun movie? Yes, it's a good one for a night out.Is it epic and memorable like the first one? No, the first one was tight and the jokes landed way way WAY more often.IMPORTANT!There are two end credit scenes (actually Mid-credit). Make sure to stay for the second one, it alone is worth the ticket price. Hands down saving the best for last.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Bigger but weaker,"Deadpool 2 is noticeably weaker than the original mainly because it's not as funny or overtly meta. However, it's a sequel that goes bigger in its action and heart with some great jokes that it only can only do because of the success of the first one. It declares itself to be a family film early on and by the end it has wholeheartedly earned that title, ensuring that this sequel understands that the heart is just as important as the juvenile nature.Ryan Reynolds has still got it when it comes to playing the merc with a mouth as someone who never shuts up and has a response for everything. He's almost too perfect here since he can be a little grating at times in ways he wasn't previously but that's not a huge problem thanks to an even greater emotional weight that Reynolds has to carry throughout, which proves he's more than just his endless parade of quips.The supporting cast is a lot bigger and better. Josh Brolin is the ideal straight guy for all of Reynolds antics and can still be funny by playing it so straight faced. Zazie Beetz is instantly likeable and only continues to be a lot of fun throughout. One of the smartest decisions this film makes is to massively increase the screen time for Karan Soni who's growing psychopathic tendencies only make him more adorable.David Leitch's direction lacks the visual dynamism of his predecessor so he makes up for that in the action, which really shines here thanks to his previous experiences. All the set pieces are a lot bigger whilst still being able to maintain the personal stakes that are always welcome in such an overblown genre. The soundtrack is even more prominent than last time and every song is implemented beautifully so the moment they kick in it feels like the perfect choice.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Everything you love deadpool is in this movie,"Wow a very good summer blockbuster film. I'm not going to say it's better than it's predecessor but it is very entertaining film you will not disappoint. It's a R-Rated film for a reason. I love all the reference and jokes in this film that only deadpool film have that power to do that. Beside all jokes we see humane of deadpool. this film bring deadpool down to earth a little bit.

Its overall IMDB-rating should be no higher than 7,"A rating of 7 usually indicates that a movie is good fun to watch, but won't revolutionize your view on the industry. This movie is very much like that. There are things in it that are hilarious, and if you are a frequent movie-goer, you will enjoy the many references and gimmicks. However, what that is said, no real story is ever told. There is no real arc for the characters, even though the movie attempts to force one down on them. It feels very much like a transport into the forthcoming X-force movie, and Deadpool 2 is, in my opinion, not able to stand on its own.
Another problem I have with it is, that it spends much of its runningtime, bashing other superhero-movies for being repetitive and franchise-hungry, but in the end, Deadpool 2 becomes all the things, that it is simultaneously making fun off. Therefore it doesn't become clever or edgy satire. Instead it becomes ""lazy writing"".So, if you want to watch something relaxing and hilarious on a Sunday night, then by all means watch this movie.

Better than the original,"This film takes the core charm of the original Deadpool film and improves on it by taking it beyond a mere gimmick. Instead of relying so much on the same premise (hey look, I'm a superhero movie but I do R-rated things!), it actually rolls on forward and adds more scenes and characters to make the most of its unique style. The fast pace leads us through X-Men, a comic relief teenager, Cable the time travelling cyborg, the short-lived X-Force and lots of very unpredictable action scenes. The level of zany unpredictability is what makes the Deadpool style great, as we have absolutely no idea where the plot will go, who will live and die, and how time travel will be used, which makes it feel like a feature length, high budget YouTube skit. Not to mention the return of Dopinder, a fan favourite!",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Once Upon A Deadpool,"It's amazing how much of Deadpool 2 you can show with a PG13 rating simply by cutting out the worst swears and getting rid of the blood. Deadpool literally bleeps out any use of the F-word, the nudity is pixelated, & the graphic violence is trimmed. It's a great experiment into what makes film ratings what they are and how this character could be utilized in the Disney owned Marvel Cinematic Universe without losing who he is. Ryan Reynolds & Fred Savage are great together in the wrap around story segments, blurring the line between film & viewer while poking fun at the whole experience. All of the best stuff from Deadpool 2 is still there, in a somewhat cleaned up way, with great action & laughs throughout. The Stan Lee cameo has a nice little added touch since his passing. And don't forget to stay for the after credits scene, even when you think it's over give it another minute. It is well worth the wait for any Marvel fan.",,Anonymous,Comedy
"Like the man himself, occasionally limp.","One of the greatest strengths of the Deadpool character is his own self awareness and during the two hours of Deadpool 2, you get the feeling that the studio and writers are now all too aware of the marketability and bankability of this franchise, relying on a rehash of the greatest hits of the first movie coupled with a larger CGI spectacle that ultimately, whilst still being a riot, is as superficial as the Plastics from Mean Girls. 
Ryan Reynolds is still born to play the ""merc with a mouth"" and the supporting cast, particularly Julian Dennison and Zazie Beetz (great name), provide plenty of charm but for a movie that openly says it's about heart and family, it's strangely lacking either.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

An average laugh of a movie,"After being brutally separated from his girlfriend with whom he wanted to form a family, Deadpool seeks to fulfill a riddle of hers. Thus he's determined to help a young mutant who is threatened by a powerful character from the future.It's a movie with a good and apparently emotional premise which follows Deadpool in an attempt at redemption. Due to his flamboyant character, he ends up in a lot of trouble but his new team will be there to help him out whenever he needs.As you might expect, this movie is a joke and thus it should be treated as such. It's full of puns, jokes and references to other movies, characters and so on. It tries so much to be laughable that it somehow manages not to be as intended. Yes, it is funny but you won't get to laugh out loud or anything like that. It seems forced and this alters the overall experience.From my point of view, a good superhero movie needs to be serious in order to be good. It has to transmit emotion to the viewer, it has to be consistent in its decisions, it has to have likeable characters, ones for which the viewer to care about. Unfortunately, you don't get any of these with this movie. Just when you think you'll see something even remotely breathtaking, you're slammed by a misplaced joke which is not even funny enough to make it worth the turnover.It is an average movie as far as I'm concerned, with good special effects, but with average characters, an average plot, full of jokes which try too much to make it funny which end up failing. I'm not saying that it's a bad movie and I knew from the beginning what I was going to see, but unfortunately it failed to change my opinion regarding superhero movies, proving that going all out funny isn't always the right way to go.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A Really Funny Action-Comedy,"I didn't like the original Deadpool film as much as everyone else seemed to. I mostly didn't like that, for a film that mocks a lot of superhero films, it's plot was very generic. This film doesn't really fix that problem necessarily, but it did fix the other problem I had with the first film - the villain. Cable is a much more memorable villain than Ajax, and his story, whilst a bit derivative of Looper, is still pretty enjoyable. Reynolds is still as funny as ever, and the jokes are probably slightly better in this one too. I really like the addition of Domino - she brought a lot of great comedy with her - and the R rated action is once again used really effectively and enjoyably. The meta humour was fun and overall, this is a great example on how a sequel can build off what worked from the original to make something just as funny and enjoyable.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"More fun, fights & comic book jests","'Deadpool 2' comes only two years after the original and has just as many wisecracks, deaths, action scenes, pop-culture jokes and swear words as the first. Deadpool/Wade (Reynolds) is back as the ""merc with a mouth"" and the film kicks plenty of action as he takes down a syndicate, but also sets up the plot with something he has to atone for - and why he wants to try to save Russell (Dennison). Also, the Bond-rip off titles are excellent.The support cast is excellent, with Vanessa (Baccarin), Dopinder (Soni), Colossus (Kapicic), Negasonic (Hildebrand), Weasel (Miller) and Blind Al (Uggams) all back. The additions of X-Force are pretty hilarious - especially Peter (Delaney) - but Domino (Beetz) steals the show, with her ""lucky"" superpower. There's some great cameos, which I won't spoil, but they all bring laughs of recognition. Cable (Brolin) is a great tough guy, who's motivations are slowly revealed, but not in any great detail.While still a very fun film with plenty of laughs throughout, sometimes it's hard to keep up, since the pace is unrelenting. There does also seem to be a bit more darkness underneath (which is also poked fun at) which is why it maybe doesn't quite reach the heights of the first film. It's probably slightly too long & tries to fit a bit too much in. Stay for the credits scenes - some excellent call-backs/""alterations""!",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"Not quite the first Deadpool, but what is?","Everything here is a notch or too below the first film. Whereas the first made gags to mock lazy writing in other superhero stories this one mocks lazy writing to hide its own plot contrivances. In the first film Deadpool was delightfully queer and subversive; for example at times the camera the linger over his body the way women heroines have been film forever. Here the character is streamlined and made less queer. It is still subversive and funny. But it isn't the brilliance send up of the first film. I feel that more time should have been spent with Domino (and her luck) because that was the most inventive part of the film and the only thing that the sequel matched the first film on.Nonetheless, the story, a domestic drama filtered through the Deadpool parody of superheros, is engaging and actually touching. Good on the film for making the main antagonist a plus size kid. It is clever touch. Likewise, Reynolds is still absolutely perfect as Wade/Deadpool and he largely carries the film.Solid follow-up to a genre and ground breaking original.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Was the opening theme song bit done as a means for Mr. Reynolds to vent out his in-the-running-for-James-Bond fatigue?,"I'm the comic book idiot who don't know much of film adaptations of the other Marvel superhero franchise, and that is not necessarily due to snobbery. I just never had the chance. I only saw bits of the other superhero films in various places, never anything in its entirety, so all the Marvel universe references were totally lost on me. But after having seen the first DP movie that I have strayed upon on video and found it awe-spectacular, I made sure that I wouldn't miss watching the sequel in the theatrical big screen. And not to mention, I'm ga-ga for anything with a young, dashing Ryan Reynolds in it.Though the comparisons to the first of the series would be inevitable, DP2 I'd say is way a different creature. The first film took pains in introducing the comic book character to the audience (especially to the non-comic book readers like me because those damn comic books are just expensive and not to mention expansive), managed to flesh it out to showcase Reynold's comedic acting range, (kind of did a Charlize Theron 2003 Patty Jenkins film Monster transformation there), which gave the Mr. Ryan his well-deserved Golden Globe win.The second outing is more of just a means for upping the ante in Deadpool's horseplaying with numerous comedic references to instances that happened in DP1 that were hilarious. No, I don't think he's gonna be gunning for Academy Award votes for his acting on this one, but safest bet is for him nabbing another Golden Globe nom. But despite that, the movie still managed to be grounded in dealing with some exploitative topical issues, with DP's motives this time around pointing towards altruism to deflect his self-destructiveness.The tradition of using the sappy songs (which are on my karaoke playlist) to juxtapose it those violent scenes and playing it for laughs still works great, but by the time the DP2 final battle came, all with the heroic slow motion involving Wade, the gimmick seems to have petered out there, I have to say.
 
So does the opening theme song done a la James Bond (which is a lampooning gold and a way better opening credits than the DP1) meant that the suave and debonair Mr. Reynolds have given up in being in the running in playing the iconic 007 (if he ever was) and used humour to help him deal with the fact that he will never be regarded ever as that kind of a serious action star? (Or perhaps just an attempt to dismiss specs if he wasn't in the running and remove his name from those odds-betting sites.) But he sure did look like one smelly loathing drunken guy in that parody with the Celine Dion song in the background. Hopefully, the X-Force separate film gig consolidates and DP franchise expands to make R. Reynolds a richer irresistible man more than ever instead.My rating: A-minus.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Dead good too.,"Deadpool puts together his X-Force team, to help save a teenage boy from Cable (Josh Brolin) a time travelling super soldier, who has come back from the future to kill him before he can cause devastation in the future.""Deadpool 2"" is good, It is, . . . it's just not great. It's too similar to the first one, for me. In some ways, that's a positive. The returning characters are definitely welcome but there are a lot of gags from the first film that are reused, line by line in some cases and a lot of times I feel the writers assumed that swearing will be enough to be funny, when that's only sometimes true. Also sadly true - even though they sometimes used alternate takes - a lot of the funniest lines and references were in the trailers.Maybe part of the problem is that the MCU have stolen away some of Deadpool's gimmick. Self-referential humour is as prevalent in ""Thor: Ragnorok"" for example, as is was in ""Deadpool"". Deadpool is left with little except taking it to more of an extreme and repeated jokes about paedophilia can start to drag after a while.The new characters are welcome additions though, particularly Domino and Cable, and giving Reynolds a larger group to spark off is a good idea. I do hope that a proper ""X-Force"" film does come next. The action scenes have improved, as you might expect when switching to a director who worked on ""John Wick"".It's has its moments definitely, It's just that it somehow doesn't add up to a particularly memorable whole.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Not only was it hilarious and action-packed, but it had a lot of drama, emotion and an engaging story with lovable characters! This movie is pretty much the same, just with a bigger budget. You see a lot more locations with a lot more characters in this movie, and the action was improved as well! It was also a little funnier than the original, I think! It had a lot of heart as well.

DEADPOOL IS THE HEROI WE NEED,"In the midst of hundreds of superhero movies, we need a satire about this universe, as it always did in movie history, in the waves of terrors we had ""Todo Mundo em Panico"", ""Airplane"" did it for the blockbusters of the 70s , and now, Deadpool does this for the universe of superheroes, be it DC, or Marvel. With a somewhat confusing script that tries to create narrative parallels that do not work in such a slashed movie, we get a bit confused, the behavior of acts is terrible, the development of the story is completely confusing, it is difficult to know when we are in the middle, at the beginning or in the end, but luckily, the script jokes win us, and in some moments justify the holes of the same in a way didatico, plus hundreds of references and joke POP culture that end up amusing and pleasing the audience. Technically the film is almost impeccable, its special effects are simple but beautiful, we notice the chroma key but it gives a kind of charm to the film, besides the wonderful choreographies and use of cameras in the action scenes, David Leitch was impeccable again in the question "" Porradaria "", besides an absurdly sagacious soundtrack that travels between decades but establishes itself in the romantic classics of the 80s, Deadpool is a technical perfection, even better than other superproductions of Marvel and DC. The actors transpired charisma, Ryan Reynolds does well, Josh Brolin does very well, Morena Baccarin has little screen time, but when it does, it enchants everyone, but the biggest highlight of the film for me is for Zazie Beetz. Deaadpool 2 improves everything in relation to the first one, less the script, the long one has many problems, but nevertheless, it is exactly what we need, a film that guides a wave of films of hero, causing us reflections on everything that we have already seen and we continue to see, laughing, and breaking the fourth wall, it is a film that will become very popular over the years, but for our current time, it is essential, he shouts at the viewer ""WE ARE LIVING THE AGE OF ADAPTATIONS OF QUADRINHOS, PAY ATTENTION, THAT WILL END A TIME!

Deadpool's Formula Equals Hit for Summer Fun,"There's something about an opening scene, it either instantly grabs you or it doesn't. Some movies have a set up to an opening scene, but they still have an opening scene. Throw in a classic hit from your childhood and you find yourself already liking the movie. Its a cheap, simple formula, but it works.Deadpool 2 started out just that way. Cue the music Dolly! From there, Deadpool 2 never took itself serious, so it could mock itself, other movies and even its star. Incorporate lots of famous movie quotes and references throughout and you've created something people will talk about at the water coolers the next day. Or in my case, 4-O. Now, the only thing missing from the formula is will it be a hit. Mix in some comedy, action and a few Easter Eggs leaving us wanting more, and you have just that - a box office hit.Deadpool teased us enough with the expanded Marvel Universe but yet focused specifically on the lead's story. Running time of was just under 2 hours where realistically, they could have cut about 10-15 minutes to make run smoother with less slow points.Without spoiling the main film, you may leave after Cher completes her soundtrack as there is no final-final Easter Egg after the credits, like most Marvel films. I didn't expect Nick Fury to come to Deadpool saying he was putting together a team, but seeing Jean Gray and Cyclopes would have been awesome.

The Merc has still got it,"""Deadpool 2"" is a reminder that a movie coming out of the gate is completely different from one that comfortably falls back on characters and intentions.That first movie was a shocking blast of the profane, the crude, the gorey, and yeah just the all out mayhem of it brought to film with stunning energy.This feels like it's falling back; trying to do the same thing over again but as is the case with shock, it doesn't work as well the second time.I'm not saying this is a bad movie, in fact it's a perfectly entertaining one, but it does feel like a come down from the first.It sees Wade going through personal changes, becoming an X-Men trainee for a while, taking the fat kid from ""Hunt for the Wilder People"" under his wing, and dealing with a time traveler named Cable.You can't fault this movie for trying. It goes for something crude or edgy in every scene, a scene where Wade regrows legs is guaranteed laughter right there.Does it strain for laughs at times though? Absolutely. You can be edgy without telling 20 pedophile jokes. Five is more than enough.You can never go wrong with throwing movie and pop culture related gags at movie fans though and these movies roast better than most.Taking on Wolverine, Passion of the Christ, Batman vs. Superman, Star Wars, and Yentl this all works really well.Oddly the most surprising thing here is that the movie does try to touch upon subjects of grief and the power of love admidst all the rampant sarcasm.Ryan Reynolds is carrying most of the load and there's no doubt this will go down as his signature role at this point. From the fourth wall breaks, comedy, action, even a bit of drama, this is the most all-around comfortable we've seen someone in a super suit since Downey Jr. in ""Iron Man.""Josh Brolin is good here too in a villain role that is both lethal but also in the realm of world saving. After Thanos and then this, we can basically call Brolin a villain who cares. 
The new character Domino is really cool here. She's played by Zazie Beets, who you'll recognize if you watch the show ""Atlanta"".And Julian Dennison; I like this kid. He's got attitude well suited for comedy.And really that's what this is. I thought when the movie brought in ""John Wick"" and ""Atomic Blonde"" director David Leitch it would up the ante on the violence but it definitely stays within being a comedy with action in it.There's a lot of physical slapstick here, stuff he handles really well.This is a funny movie that the people behind it are really working their asses off on.It's also a funny movie that seems to be trying just a bit too hard to top what came before and in that you can see the seams straining at times.But action, comedy, Ryan Reynolds, the rest of this cast, it's a good time and so 3 out of 4 stars is what i'm going with guys.If you liked this, check out Craig James Review on Youtube for more.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Non spoiler review,"Deadpool 2 (2018, David Leitch)After the success of the first Deadpool after Fox gambled on an R rated super hero film with a lower budget in the X-universe, they have come back with another hard R rated chapter with only a slightly bigger budget. We see some old faces and some new characters with even some surprises.The film is well made and has amazing action and combat sequences that put the last couple of films in the MCU to shame.. take note Disney/Marvel... this is how you shoot combat. The film is also hilarious, for the most part matching the laugh hit-rate and almost the unexpected heart that the first film had. It is however a bloodier affair and that works well in this setting.I was worried that the change of director might negatively impact the film but it was a smooth transition to the new blood and this is most certainly the best superhero film of the year thus far and will be hard to beat.9/10",,Anonymous,Comedy
Deadpool fans rejoice! They did it again.,"I had a really good time with Deadpool 2. It continues with the humour, action and awareness of the original, while also taking all three to the extreme. Action scenes are bigger, more varied and incredibly entertaining. Whilst turning it up to 11 works well for the action, I feel like the meta references and crude humour was stretched to its absolute limit and took me out of the movie occasionally.One thing Deadpool had going for it was the heart, the love story/Wade's mortality elements of the narrative always felt earned. Sadly I do not feel the same way about Deadpool 2. This movie (like many other franchises) throws around the word ""family"" quite a lot. Whilst the old and new characters are all very entertaining and work well together, I didn't feel like a family was established.Overall I would recommend Deadpool 2 to anyone who enjoyed the original. I know I have my reservations overall, but I agree with my friends initial comment of ""I don't think I have giggled so much in the cinema since South Park"".",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

another generic superhero movie,"This is another generic superhero movie. The only difference is that deadpool is the lead for this one. It is a revenge flick. Predictable and still fun. The comedy still lands and the casting works.I dont know if after this, there will be another one, it was not great enough to merit a sequel, but deadpool is deadpool so there will probably be another. Let us home Marvel doesnt ruin the next one.I wouldnt recommend it, but i wouldnt discourage you from watching it.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Delivers the same laughs as the first + some fun action set-pieces,"Well, I laughed and I certainly did not cry. Which probably wasn't the point. The ""John Wick"" co-director David Leitch takes command of the direction after Tim Miller left. You can tell the action sequences have been geared into a better level with more interesting scenarios and set-pieces. What I love about the humor is how self-aware it is. Deadpool pokes fun and satirizes the X-Men films and the genre as a whole. At times it can go a little too far with them overplaying some jokes or making others really obvious. It's OK to play hard to get, you can hold back at some moments. But I get it, the character is foul-mouthed, unfiltered and loves to let the audience know he's in control of this movie. I know I enjoyed the full speed ahead farce that it was. But I'm gonna have to process weather I like it more than the first one. Some elements for sure, but the bigger picture? Hmm.. Perhaps the freshness was gone, but that doesn't mean it's bad.New characters were a well welcomed addition. And by that I mean welcomed with big open arms. Domino had lots of sympathy to bring but she was also a great fast thinking fighter. Josh Brolin is perfect for Cable. I liked the brutal intensity that transmitted across the screen whenever he busted through the walls. He made a great serious counterbalance to Ryan Reynolds' jokey, spandex, anti-hero man. It sort of felt like another ""Terminator""-like science-fiction movie when it was just a scene featuring Cable. Which reminds me that there are plenty of serious parts as well. By that I mean actual dramatic parts where there are no jokes. Which was a little problematic for me at first because it had been so full of jokes/meta-humor for the entirety of the run-time up until that point. So I wasn't sure how seriously I was to take a certain scene. Since I was sure it was gonna lead up to a joke that would ease out that tension. But, nope! The jokes didn't return until after they were done with the serious bit. A drastic tonal change from ""funny/poking fun at movies times"" to ""dead serious, no joke, drama where the hero cries"". So, there you go. My nitpick.The mid-credit scene is fantastic though, be sure to stick around for that. It's worth it and it only makes me believe that Reynolds was born to play the role even more than before. So that really elevated the entire movie for me. Lots of in-jokes, so I don't know if everyone's gonna get it. It's pretty much a crowd-pleasing movie that doesn't hold back with the references. But only really to those who have seen the other X-Men or Marvel movies. That's a reason why it might not be so funny to everyone. And to be honest I did laugh at plenty of things. Especially at what the X-Force storyline leads up to. Did not expect that... At all! Oh, and also, You know not to bring the kids. It's R-rated for a reason. If the first one didn't do it for you in the joke department and you prefer the more serious work in the comic book film catalogue; Then this will not be so funny to you. Even though I prefer a more emotional and motivational superhero tale, I do appreciate the weird variety of character traits that Deadpool brings to an already crowded genre.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A Righteous Sequel,"YES! A sequel that was actually better than the first installment. Now that's how you follow up a movie.Now, to be perfectly honest, I actually didn't even like the first Deadpool. I think I just wasn't prepared for how raunchy it was... well that and it wasn't all that funny. Part two is definitely as raunchy, but1.) It isn't as sex heavy. I didn't watch Deadpool for frequent sex scenes or sex references.
2.) It is funnier. They added some more visual humor which had me laughing-out-loud a lot more than the Ryan Reynolds' quips. 
3.) It has better action. By adding some other super powered characters we go to see some better action. 
4.) The story is so much better. Deadpool finds himself having to be selfless to save someone and it's not the bland save-the-girlfriend bit.I truly enjoyed this movie and I like the direction Deadpool is moving. It is trending upward.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Great Fun, Bigger and Better than its Predecessor,","Deadpool 2 is a fantastic movie with a very well developed plot and a tremendous cast that shine in both comedic and more dramatic moments. As much as I was looking forward to this, I really did not think it would manage to top the original, I was prepared to be entertained, but I did not give my hopes up on it being spectacular. I was blown away from just how thoroughly entertaining, funny and investing it really was, by far one of the best sequels that has been done in awhile, it manages to go bigger without getting carried away with itself.The only major issue I had with the film was the lack of development they put in to Cable. Despite Josh Brolin really bringing it to the part, they left a lot of details out about him, and being someone who was not previously aware of the character, I would like to have known a bit more, he needed a lot more scope.The cast is all around brilliant, Ryan Reynolds is as great as ever in the title role that we can see is still a dream come true for him to play, and it's immense fun just watching him having a ball. Brolin, who already wooed the hearts of Marvel fans as Thanos, annihilates it again in a major part, Zazie Beetz, whom I really admire from her work in Atlanta, had a terrific presence as Domino and manages to match up against two major actors playing well known characters, she was an absolute scene stealer.Pure fun, as well as an engaging story. Proving that sometimes, bigger is actually better, Deadpool 2 is a blast from beginning to end, I would recommend to all fans of the franchise, it is a must see.Wade Wilson seeks vengeance and works to protect a young mutant, along with new friends and foes.Best Performance: Ryan Reynolds",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Just good, nothing much.","Marvel is on the roll! After fantastic and super successful Avengers Infinity War, Deadpool is arrived to entertain public. With the solid comic elements, 1st installment of this franchise got fantastic response. And so do we all are expecting with the second edition.Ryan Raynolds as Deadpool is just become a part of X Men trainee. But, as you all know about his mischievousness, he tries to overdo things (to entertain us!) In the meantime, because of the biggest loss in his life, he changes a lot. Tries different things. But as we all know him, he changes accordingly but with the same behaviour. I am not telling anything about the storyline, because it will become spoiler. It is because of the simple story of this part.I have seen it in Hindi. As the first one was super cool in Hindi! Also, every superhero films have to be seen in Hindi language, for the extra amount of humour! As we were thrilled to see 1st part and its comic timing because it was natural and unexpected. Here, the problem is there are only punchlines, nothing else! Too much is also harmful for the cinematic experience. I felt that film and characters are speaking constantly non-sense! Hehehe. Yeah, may be because of poor dubbing. Or even unmatchable Ranveer Singh! There are some moments when the whole theatre split apart. But they were very few moments. Even it was stupid that he saying like Ranveer toh India ka best actor hai! Hahaha... He even tries to promote all his films with SLB! Ufff.... Having said that, I would like to say that usage of old Hindi songs in Hollywood films surely make you smile.Undoubtedly, post credit scene in this part was fantastic. Never seen like this before. I want to write about that part, but have to stop here! Hehe.Some slow motion scenes were fantabulous. But, if you want my honest review, I am not satisfied with this part. This happens many a times that in a franchise, mostly the least part has been the second one! I will put Deadpool in the same category. May be because I have seen it in Hindi, may be because I have seen the ultimate Avengers Infinity War just in last month, or the biggest reason is- May be because I'd seen the first installment just yesterday! These are the assumptions of mine for not getting the feel of Paisa Wasool! May be I am wrong, or may be not!Best scene is jumping from the plane with the entire X-Force team. I am eager to see what will they bring to us in the third part after watching the post credit scene here. So, on the whole, it is just a one time watch film for fans. 3/5.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Review for Deadpool 2 - Super Dup Cut/Extended,"This was a movie I originally saw in the theater. I liked the first one and figured we would get more of the same. That is exactly what is happening here. Jaime liked the original one and she's a fan of Ryan Reynolds, so we decided to check out my 4K copy.We start this off a bit after the original one. Wade Wilson aka Deadpool (Reynolds) has found his purpose killing bad guys. He lives with Vanessa (Morena Baccarin) and collaborates with Weasel (T. J. Miller) and Dopinder (Karan Soni). When tragedy strikes at home, he goes into a depression. The X-Men or at least Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand) and Colossus (Stefan Kapicic) take him in. Their goal is to get him to stop killing and be like them.Things take a turn when Cable (Josh Brolin) comes from the future to kill Firefist (Julian Dennison). He is only a boy who freaks out while at an orphanage. This isn't a good place though so it is hard to fault him. Deadpool's involvement land him and the boy in a mutant prison. Cable won't be stopped and the more we learn about the situation, the more complicated it is.Now as I was saying, we get more of what we got in the original and more. Reynolds was born to play this role and he does it amazingly. We also have a fun cast of characters around him that equally get annoyed and find humor in what he does. This is also quite self-referential. It doesn't take itself too seriously, knows exactly what it is doing in breaking the 4th wall. It also pokes fun at superhero movies and their motivations. I do think it goes a bit far and Jaime agreed there at times, but I still have fun.This is also well-made. We watched the unrated cut this time around. It runs long, but I can't fault it too much as this is the version that put more back into it. This is a CGI fest. We get the good and the bad. This loves to use slow-motion which got annoying at times. I like what they do with time travel here. That adds comedy. This movie can get quite brutal at times as well, so be prepared there. The last thing I'll say is that the soundtrack cost a lot of money but is amazing.My Rating: 7.5 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
It's impossible not to like these movies.,"Deadpool 2 (2018) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently rewatched on Hulu. The storyline follows our mercenary friend who discovers a young man with powers who is being hunted by time traveling mutant, Cable. Since Cable can be anywhere at any time Deadpool will need a team to fend off the mighty Cable...This movie is directed by David Leitch (John Wick) and stars Ryan Reynolds (Green Lantern), Josh Brolin (No Country for Old Men), Morena Baccarin (Gotham), T. J. Miller (Cloverfield), Brianna Hildebrand (Tragedy Girls) and Eddie Marsan (21 Grams).It's impossible not to like these movies. Once again the soundtrack and opening credits are awesome. Deadpool will always be Ryan Reynolds greatest character and he always does such a great job of pulling in the appropriate characters from the X-Men universe. Both Cable and Juggernaut are iconic characters in the X-men universe and are delivered superbly...I just wish we had more Juggernaut than we got. The comedic content remains gold, I'll just say the storyline and comedy wasn't as good as the first film.Overall this is another iconic addition to the super hero genre that's an absolutely must see. I would score this an 8/10 and strongly recommend it.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

More of the same with Cable a standout,"Simply put, if you loved Deadpool then Deadpool 2 is most certainly your newest must-see slice of crass language, over the top violence and more self-referential digs than you can poke a sword at.One of the biggest surprise smash-hits of the last decade, the first Deadpool had no real right to be as entertaining and amusing as it was and benefited greatly from an audience across the globe that didn't expect it to be nearly as proficient as it was, so in many ways Deadpool 2 has a lot more weight thrust upon its shoulders in today's climate, with many eager fans awaiting more of Ryan Reynolds playing Ryan Reynolds under the guise of a tight red gimp suit.It's safe to say that new director David Leitch (aka one of the guys that killed John Wick's dog) doesn't mess with the formula here, maybe a few less genitalia jokes, but by the by Wade Wilson's newest adventures being the world's most smart-mouthed anti-hero are going to play out exactly the way you thought they were going to.As was the case with the first film, Deadpool 2 doesn't try overly hard narrative wise, this new jaunt sees Wilson in a state of depression and in a situation where he finds himself trying to protect Hunt for the Wilderpeople star Julian Dennisen's mutant teenager from time travelling super-soldier Cable but it's all an excuse to give audiences more of what they came to love in the first outing.Along with the to be expected there are some truly funny and standout scenes in play in Deadpool 2, such as an imaginative sequence demonstrating new mutant Domino's luck (played fantastically by newcomer to the series Zazie Beetz) and the first mission for Wilson and his new X-Force squad that includes standouts Peter and Vanisher, while the introduction of Josh Brolin as Cable is the films biggest win, with Brolin rolling on with that good Thanos form.So good is Cable that you wish the film would've allowed more room for growth with his inclusion into the story and while he plays a key role in proceedings, you still can't escape the feeling that the film would've grown as a whole had Brolin been allowed more spotlight, ditto for Dennisen and Reynolds budding mateship, that despite forming the core of the narrative thrust is never properly built up, making Wilson's mission as a whole less engaging than it could've been.These misses narratively combined with other elements of Deadpool 2 make it feel like a backwards step or at the very least of a stalling of the series from the first, there's a sense here that everything's a little auto-pilot, the action too taking a backwards step from the imaginative sequences of the first film and while perfectly entertaining, this is an experience filled with nothing that would suggest Deadpool 2 is going to be a film you'll be going back to anytime soon.Final Say -Serving up more of the same but without the surprise element of the first, Deadpool 2 is going to be another box-office smash and introduces us to one of the Marvel universes most exciting new characters in the form of Cable but there's the feeling that this franchise as a standalone entity has already spent a fair portion of its blood-soaked and pop-culture infused fuel tickets.3 Green Lantern scripts out of 5",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Deadpool 2: A Hilariously Violent Sequel,"Deadpool 2 is a worthy successor to the original film, delivering a non-stop barrage of humor, violence, and heart. Ryan Reynolds reprises his role as the fourth-wall-breaking anti-hero with even more energy and charisma. The film's R-rated nature allows for a level of irreverence and vulgarity that is both shocking and hilarious.The story follows Deadpool as he tries to protect a mutant child from the villainous Cable, played by Josh Brolin. The dynamic between the two characters is a highlight of the film, with their contrasting personalities leading to some hilarious confrontations. The film's supporting cast, including Zazie Beetz as Domino and Julian Dennison as Russell, also deliver strong performances.This is a visual spectacle, with stunning action sequences and creative CGI effects. The film's soundtrack is also excellent, featuring a mix of classic rock and pop songs that perfectly complement the tone of the movie. Overall, Deadpool 2 is a must-watch for fans of the original film and anyone looking for a fun and entertaining action-comedy.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
snarky and irreverent redux,"Greetings again from the darkness. We couldn't help but ask ""why?"" when the sequel was announced, even though we knew the answer was money. There was little hope in improving on the first DEADPOOL (2016), and since that film's director, Tim Miller, was tied up with upcoming projects for X-Men and Terminator, there was understandable concern that changing the recipe could result in huge disappointment. While it may not be an improvement on the first, only those with unrealistic expectations are likely to be disappointed ... the rest of us will spend most of two hours laughing and enjoying the spectacle.Director David Leitch exploded onto the scene with last year's surprise action hit ATOMIC BLONDE, and his stuntman experience is once again on display with even more frenzied action and fight sequences this time out. As you might expect, there is no easing into the comedy routine here. The Opening Credits are laugh out loud funny and the only thing better may be the closing credits sequence, which is an instant classic.No punchlines will be spoiled here, and it's an obvious statement, but clearly no topic or subject, or at least very few, are off-limits. Targets of barbs include LinkedIn, YENTL, FROZEN, Fox & Friends, and well, the list goes on and on. You'll likely miss 20 percent of the dialogue whilst laughing. The ""Merc with a Mouth"" breaks the 4th wall in atypical fashion - blurring the line through dialogue incorporated into the story. The self-awareness is comical in its own right.Some familiar faces are back. Wade's main squeeze Vanessa (Marina Baccarin) kicks off the ""kids"" discussion (Yikes!) and the couple seems to have settled into cohabitant bliss - never a good sign in a superhero movie. TJ Miller (despite his recent headlines) is back running Sister Margaret's Bar, though his minimal presence is noted. Also back is Colossus (voiced by Stefan Kapicic), and his expanded role finds him turning Deadpool into an X-Men trainee at Professor Xavier's School for the gifted. This occurs after tragedy strikes and we are introduced to some new players. Julian Dennison (so good in HUNT FOR THE WILDERBEAST) plays FireFist, and of course, the arrival of Cable (Josh Brolin) shows us what happens when a time-travelling Terminator type is out for revenge.Snarking, mocking and irreverence remain in full force throughout, but if you happen to pay attention to the story, you'll notice a (not-so) subtle transition taking place. The renegade superhero shifts from loner to team player, and even picks up some life lessons along the way - mostly related to loss and collaboration. Deadpool even forms his own team called X-Force, and one of the more interesting members is Domino (Zazie Beetz), whose superpower is luck (yep). We do get a surprise cameo, and there's even a shot of Deadpool with no pants ... and it's markedly unsexy. The music selections are inspired, however, if you are unsure whether this movie is for you ... it probably isn't.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Hilarious as expected,"Deadpool fans have been waiting for this sequel, and yes , there is no deviation from the foul language, parody, cheesy one liners, hilarious one liners, action, laughter, tears and yes, drama! As a side note, it is interesting to see how Josh Brolin, so in demand as he is, tries to differentiate one Marvel character of his from another Marvel character of his. There are some tints but maybe that's the entire point as this is not the glossy, intense superhero like the first one , which many of the lead actors already portrayed in the past so there will be some mild confusion at one point. Indeed a new group of oddballs anti super anti super super anti heroes, it is entertaining and childish fun.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

More touching and funnier than the last,"Deadpool's wife is killed in retaliation after he tries and fails to kill a gang leader. Stripped of his only love yet unable to kill himself, Deadpool becomes an X-Men trainee, whereby he comes to care for a boy with a troubled past and an even more troubled future. Which will Deadpool secure first: a new family that makes life worth living or a way to end it all?This movie has two advantages over its predecessor. Firstly, it's funnier. Where the first one did rapid-fire jokes with a poor hit rate, this one seems to have reduced the quantity in favor of quality. Certainly, the hit rate is higher. Secondly, this movie is quite touching. I enjoy fantasies where people can commune with dead loved ones, which happens a bit here. And the quest to save the kid is just touching.I like it a lot.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Pretty consistently entertaining despite a few bumps,"The first film did more than enough to make me look forward to the sequel, even if the film itself was not as good as the promotional work ahead of it. So it is again here, as very funny adverts and promos got me excited but at the same time meant that the film didn't quite deliver in the same way. To be fair, this is because it is a two-hour film, so not easy to do the same as a few minute spot or bit. This can be seen in a few bumps along the way of the film - plot points which need to be delivered but do take the film away from joking or doing action, which is really where it works best.Outside of these bumps though, the film gets the mood right, with irreverent humor and solid action sequences. It is pretty polished and professional, which does take away from its attempts to appear to have rough edges, but it works nonetheless. The comedy is broad and knowing; mostly this is at a level which is amusing but it does periodically have plenty of good laughs or clever moments. Likewise the action sequences are rarely thrilling, but they do have enough about them to inject energy and plenty of noise.All told, a pretty consistent and enjoyable film which steps up from the first film while still keeping what made it work.",,Anonymous,Comedy
David Leitch from John Wick ruined this movie,"I already pre-ordered my tickets and would have backed out had I realized who was directing this movie. David Leitch is on my blacklist because he is, plain and simple, a hack director. I know Chad Stahelski co-directed John Wick with him, but given that 2 was better without Leitch and Atomic Blonde was terrible with just him, I'm going to guess he's the guy to blame.The word was this movie was a mess when shown to test audiences and subjected to reshoots. I can see how it was a lot worse before the reshoots. Deadpool is a shadow of his former self. He's way too serious, the plot is way too serious, he actually cares about people. Some scenes go on way too long to the point where you're just like, ok, we get it, move on.Worst of all, Deadpool is simply upstaged by everyone in the film. Zazie Beatz and Josh Brolin were fantastic, as was the New Zealand kid playing Russell. Juggernaut was amazing and left me wanting more, definitely did the character justice. It definitely made the movie worth it just to see him.Hopefully the movie gets a better director next time and recovers from this mistake.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

DP2 Brings It Again,"It has been said that ""Deadpool 2"" is even better than the original film, and I agree. ""2"" has the best elements of the first film, but taken to a greater degree. You still get the running, machine-gun comedy riffs, like Jim Carrey on speed. You still get the fourth-wall breaking asides. And the same irreverence, the same self-referential comments, the same darkness, the same gore, the plethora of cinematic references. And more of it.Some reviewers didn't find enough comedy in the film. Almost every line was a punch line, so were they not catching certain references? Possibly. Some complained that the film's POV was too far to the left. Yes, there were anti-rightwing insults, but there were also numerous lampoons of P.C. platitudes.The best things about the Deadpool films are the level of originality and creativity, the willingness to take risks. Fortunately, the second installment does not back away from that formula.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Loved It,"I really enjoyed the first film so I was looking forward to this. I would say it's better than the first...but maybe I'm not remembering my enjoyment of the first one, so, maybe they're equal. The humor was on-point, and I loved the addition of all the new mutants. And, I think my enjoyment is saying a lot because I thought the X-Force comic sucked, and particularly Cable, but I really enjoy the movie adaptation. I was a fan of all the X comic book titles except X-Force. I'm sure I don't need to name names but he also ruined the end of The New Mutants. And can't draw feet. Or hands. I loved that insertion into the film.I really liked the addition of Domino, and like what the Atlanta actress brought to the role. Cable was surprisingly cool. I normally don't like Cable or the grunty tough guy, but he's a great straight man to Deadpool's humor. And Teenage Warhead, the teen with an attitude is just as fun in this film as the last. I also loved the cab driver. I don't remember him as much in the last film but he had some really funny moments in this one. Ha, and Paul or Peter was great. I was surprised by what happened to Shatter Star, but, in hindsight, his costume was ridiculous in the comic and he's got the whole two sword thing, Deadpool has the whole two sword thing, so, maybe for the best that he's paste.Looking on the X-Force Wikipedia page I notice a lot of the team is comprised of New Mutants. With that film coming out not sure what their plan is on that for the upcoming X-Force film franchise. As long as they have Magick and Danielle Moonstar in The New Mutants, I won't riot. Personally, I think they should have all of the original team. And they should fight The Hellions at some point. And the Demon Bear. And bring Legion in and off that lame show.There were one or two moments where I felt like a part of the film was missing, but, whatever, it quickly made up for it. I would say this is probably may favorite of all the superhero movies thus far. I have heart feels for the original Supermans, like all the X-Men films (except the garbage #3), and like Guardians, but Deadpool, a character I don't know if I ever read in the comics, is quickly becoming one of my faves. So, I eagerly await the next installment.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

A-HA!,"Two hours of trash talkin' the Marvel Universe makes for irresistible cinema. The bloated comic book film industry deserves the potty-mouthed, anti-hero attack that only Deadpool can deliver. And yes, tis a hard act to follow after the hilarious shock treatment of the original, but lo and behold, there's enough fresh funny for a sweet sequel.As our leading disfigured man, Ryan Reynolds riffs profanity puns at machine gun fire pace, wooing the audience by repeatedly smashing the fourth wall. A crowded cast of secondary characters pop up, but it is on Deadpool that this vehicle depends. And he delivers.Not as great as the original, but then what could be? #2 is still irresistible eye candy for Marvel fans, and casual thrill seekers in search of something fresh.This is not grand movie making, various plot lines exist solely for the punch lines, but who can complain when they are this good?

"""Deadpool 2"" Review: Pools in a Few Improvements","""Deadpool 2"" improves upon the previous film by providing a better narrative, a worthy villain, and well-staged action scenes to go along with all of the shock meta-humor from the first entry.Wade Wilson, aka Deadpool, (Ryan Reynolds) is enjoying the life of being an immortal merc with the mouth until this lifestyle leads to the death of his girlfriend (Morena Baccarin). To redeem himself, he takes it upon himself to save a tortured mutant child named Russell, aka Firefist, (Julian Dennison) from the law and the vengeance of a time-traveling soldier named Cable (Josh Brolin).I liked the first Deadpool film well enough, but I was far from a fan of it. Everything about the Deadpool character was well handled and Ryan Reynolds was perfect casting. Not all of the humor worked with me, but most of it did. All of those same points carry over into the sequel just as equally. My major issue with the first film was the fact that if you took away all the humor being pushed into your face, the superhero story being presented was just kind of by the numbers outside of the cancer aspect. A man gets superpowers at a cost, seeks revenge, and has his girlfriend kidnapped for the final. It was fun, but there was just something about it that didn't make me love it. Perhaps the humor was too much? I tend to prefer subtlety more. Outside of that, the film had a lame villain and little to no action scenes. Luckily, number two fixes those things.The story here seems to find more serious ground than the first and made some effort to give the Deadpool character a little heart. All the humor is still there, but things do feel more balanced. That's not to say every joke landed, but most of them did. The film is still a lampoon, but that feels like an extension of the character's behavior and not at the expense of the narrative.Josh Brolin's Cable is a big assist to this. Just in appearances alone, he crushes the first film's attempt at an antagonist. A half-human, half-robot super soldier with a metal arm and multifunction gun that makes the Winter Soldier look like a wimp, even with a burnt teddy bear strapped to his belt. His character is very similar to that of a Terminator, sent back to eliminate Firefist in the past before he becomes a threat later. Actually, the whole plot is like ""Terminator 2"", considering the use of child and a seemingly immortal protector.An invincible hero can often be a problem since we as an audience know that there is no real danger. This can make action scenes rather pointless from a dramatic standpoint. Maybe that's why the first film didn't do much in the way of creative comic book fights (aside from the highway scene). In any case, ""Deadpool 2"" ups the ante by providing more superhero action this time around, and it's all done very well, thanks in large part to the new director, David Leitch. He is known best for his choreography involvement in some of the best fights in American film and co-director of ""John Wick"" (aka 'one of the men that killed John Wick's dog' as the credits say). The film sports some good set pieces, with the raid on a prison convey being the highlight.Outside of those three points, everything is basically the same as the last film. If you really enjoyed that one, you are likely to enjoy this one around the same level. Personally, I still think some of the humor does fall flat and tries too hard to be funny. The Deadpool films like to throw in everything and the kitchen sink, as the saying goes. (Ironically, as one of the posters LITERALLY acknowledges a kitchen sink). Either way, there is just an odd feeling when a film is constantly trying to get you to laugh at everything. I say it works at least 75% of the time. For me, a better example of a humorous superhero film was ""Thor: Ragnarok"" from last year. Still, to each their own. I definitely felt ""Deadpool 2"" was an improvement.There are plenty of post-credit scenes to wait for with great payoffs. I should note that there isn't one at the very end. So, you don't have to wait around.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Funny,"Deadpool 2 is less beholden to convention than the climax of the first film. Ryan Reynolds' Wade Wilson/Deadpool is roughly where you'd expect him to be two years after the first movie. If it's less sexy, that doesn't mean you're not going to see the protagonist walking around with no pants. There's action aplenty throughout the film, but Deadpool 2 doesn't bog down in it. With Reynolds' charismatic irreverence at its core, the pic moves from bloody mayhem to lewd comedy fluidly. After one surprisingly moving version of A-ha's ""Take on Me,"" it manages just that.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

I feel like I need to get this off my chest to anybody who hasn't seen this movie and is reading these reviews to see if it's worth it... PLEASE, DO NOT even bother reading ANY of these idiots who gave this movie ONLY ONE star!! These are the type of people who would win a free trip to Hawaii, all expensive paid, travel on a private jet, eat amazing food AND STILL find much to complain about! There is NO pleasing these type of people! Seriously... what more do they want with this type of movie?!? The ONLY gripe they have that I could maybe say ""OK"" (and that is if I'm splitting hairs) is that it did use a lot of CGI... but didn't Avengers: Infinity War?? (And last I checked that movie was amazing!) For what it's selling, it AT LEAST meets expectations (or IMO) blew them out of the water, again!!!HOWEVER, YOU SHOULD DEFINITLY know a few things before going into this movie.

The cinema wasn't as laughing out load as I thought it would be not like Ragnarok or Infinity Wars. There was some moments that got a few chuckles and I liked some of the gags but most of it felt forced and we'd seen it all before especially the intro albeit more of a James Bond theme this time round.
The Indian taxi driver was just dead weight and really didn't want to see his part expanded, there was no need really.

Far better than its predecessor,"I really have no clue why people think this movie is worse than Deadpool 1. It has a much better story, better jokes, better action and better characters too. It tops the first one on almost every category. Now, I'm not saying Deadpool 1 was bad, but if you saw my review of it I only gave it a 6The plot of Deadpool 2 is the perfect example of a ""side quest"" kind of plot done right. There are many sequels that struggle with creating a new storyline for the protagonist, and just send them on a ""side quest"" or ""side tangent"" story where they kind of just stumble upon a new place or villain but there isn't much of a reason for this to happen *ahem* The Wolverine *ahem*. This movie follows that trope, but the story here is genuinely still captivating. It's nothing special and I'm not going to pretend it is masterful, but it's good enough. More complex, varied and less generic than Deadpool 1. Also, time travel. We love time travel, even if it's just a small amount.Action is also a big improvement over the first with many memorable scenes. Side Characters, in the first one you had Dopinder (funny), Colossus (okay) and NTW (mid). Here, there's the whole X-Force thing which leads to a very memorable spoiler sequence, Cable and Domino. Cable is well acted by Josh Brolin, but he can be a bit stiff. The real star is Domino because I love luck based powers, and this movie does that really well.There are also a few actually emotional moments towards the end too, loved those. And the post credits is just a banger.In terms of humor, yeah I don't really know why one would find the first one funnier. I love all the jokes and meta commentaries of this one, and thankfully it leans more towards actually funny jokes and meta stuff instead of unfunny sexual jokes like the first one (It still has some, but they are less frequent than they were in Deadpool 1)Now, it's not all perfection. You may have heard that this movie struggles with its antagonists, and it's kind of true, though I think this particular story didn't really need a central villain, since it's not that kind of story so I don't hold that against this movie. The main reason it doesn't get higher score is because the pacing in the first half is a bit iffy, especially since you don't really know what's happening or what's the point of all you're seeing on screen until Cable comes in and explains everything. But it still doesn't detract much from an otherwise great movie. In fact, it actually got better with rewatches for me, initially I gave it a 7.5 but now I give it considerably higher than thatScore: 8.5/10 (Great)",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"a movie where a lot of people are having a good time laughing together from the very start to the end, with a lot of bad cgi","First thing first, I thought this movie was gonna be pretty freakin' awesome, which turned out to be a little bit less than my definition of ""awesome"", but hey it's still good and as usual, deadpool is still unlike any other super/anti-hero we've ever faced so far from the silver screen (same goes for ever movie that stars the merc with a mouth). Unfortunately, the high level of comedy that bounds audiences to their seats for a full two hours was not achieved properly by the cgi which made me almost thinking I was watching a non-disney/pixar movie produced by a startup animation company. Another downgrade form Deadpool 2 also come from an underused character that has so much potential to be interesting and well-received by all DP fans but she was just proving her own worthiness at the very end of the movie. Despite all of that, this is the first time, in the history of a comicbook cinematic universe, where we see deadpool acts as a real hero instead of an anti-hero (the role he plays most of the time in the comic book) without changing his fourth-wall-breaking-with-a-lot-of-adult-jokes attitude which makes us love him even more. I surely can't wait to see his other adventures in the future with deadpool 3, 4, 5, or X-Force 1, 2, 3, 4 etc.P.s.

"A Hilarious, Action-Packed Sequel Done Right","I recently re-watched Deadpool 2, and I must say, the movie still holds up brilliantly. From the direction to the special effects, everything about this film is crafted with precision, making it one of the most entertaining superhero movies to date. This time around, I paid closer attention to various aspects of filmmaking, and I was genuinely impressed by how well-executed it was. Here's my detailed review breaking down why Deadpool 2 is a masterpiece in its genre.Direction: AmazingDavid Leitch, known for his exceptional work in action films, did a phenomenal job directing Deadpool 2. He managed to balance the over-the-top humor with the emotional depth of the story, giving us a film that not only entertained but also resonated on a deeper level. Leitch's direction captured the essence of Deadpool - the crass, sarcastic, and hilarious anti-hero - while also bringing heart to the narrative. His ability to handle intense action sequences with clarity and precision was outstanding. Every scene felt purposeful, whether it was an explosive fight or a heartfelt moment.The pacing was spot-on, ensuring the audience never felt bored. Leitch's direction also allowed the humor to flow naturally without it ever feeling forced. It's a tough task to keep the humor fresh in a sequel, but he managed to do it perfectly. The blend of chaos and emotion in Deadpool 2 is what makes it a standout sequel.---Writing: GoodThe writing in Deadpool 2 was sharp, witty, and full of meta-humor, exactly what you'd expect from a Deadpool movie. Rhett Reese, Paul Wernick, and Ryan Reynolds did an excellent job in crafting a story that didn't just feel like a cash-grab sequel. They managed to build on the first film's success while introducing new elements that kept it fresh and exciting.The screenplay cleverly balanced humor, action, and emotion. The film didn't shy away from breaking the fourth wall, and those moments were among the funniest. The jokes about the X-Men universe, other superhero franchises, and pop culture references were brilliant. However, the most impressive part was how the writers seamlessly introduced heavy emotions, especially in Deadpool's personal journey of loss and redemption.The dialogue was incredibly clever, and Deadpool's sarcastic humor never got old. The banter between Deadpool and Cable, Deadpool and Domino, and the whole X-Force team was gold. It's rare to find a script that makes you laugh, cry, and cheer all at the same time, but Deadpool 2 nailed it.---Acting by Cast: GreatThe casting in Deadpool 2 was impeccable, and the performances were equally impressive. Ryan Reynolds once again proved that he was born to play Deadpool. His charisma, comedic timing, and ability to make the audience emotionally invested in his character were incredible. Reynolds didn't just play Deadpool; he was Deadpool.Josh Brolin as Cable was another highlight of the film. His portrayal of the time-traveling, no-nonsense soldier was intense and grounded. Brolin brought depth to Cable, making him a relatable character despite his tough exterior. His chemistry with Reynolds was off the charts, and their contrasting personalities made for some of the film's funniest and most intense moments.Zazie Beetz as Domino was a scene-stealer. Her cool, laid-back approach to the role and her chemistry with the rest of the cast were fantastic. Her character's superpower - luck - was hilariously and brilliantly portrayed, adding a unique dynamic to the action scenes. The supporting cast, including Julian Dennison as Firefist and Morena Baccarin as Vanessa, also delivered strong performances.---Original Music: GoodThe original music in Deadpool 2 was surprisingly effective. While the film leaned heavily on popular songs for comedic effect, the original score by Tyler Bates provided the necessary intensity and emotion in the right moments. The music complemented the film's tone, shifting from humorous to serious without feeling jarring.The use of music in action sequences was particularly clever. For instance, the ironic use of Celine Dion's Ashes in the opening credits was both hilarious and strangely fitting. The soundtrack kept the energy high throughout the film and added another layer of entertainment.---Cinematography: GoodJonathan Sela's cinematography in Deadpool 2 was remarkable. The visual style of the film was sharp, colorful, and immersive. The camera work during action sequences was fluid, making the combat scenes easy to follow while still delivering high-impact action.Sela captured the essence of Deadpool's world perfectly - gritty yet vibrant. The use of dynamic camera angles during fight scenes, slow-motion shots, and creative framing for comedic moments showcased Sela's mastery. The film's visual language was a significant contributor to its overall entertainment value.---Editing: GoodThe editing by Dirk Westervelt, Craig Alpert, and Elísabet Ronaldsdóttir was tight and effective. Given the film's fast-paced nature, the editing had to be sharp to keep the energy flowing, and it certainly delivered. The comedic timing in Deadpool 2 relied heavily on the editing, and the team managed to hit the mark every time.The action sequences were cut in a way that maximized the impact without causing visual confusion. The transitions between humor and drama were seamless, ensuring the audience stayed engaged throughout the runtime. The editing team deserves immense credit for maintaining the film's momentum from start to finish.---Casting: GoodThe casting department did an excellent job in assembling a diverse and talented cast. Bringing in Josh Brolin as Cable and Zazie Beetz as Domino was a stroke of genius. Both actors fit their roles perfectly and added significant value to the overall story.The choice to expand the X-Force team, albeit briefly, was also brilliant. Each character brought a unique dynamic to the group, making their brief but hilarious existence memorable. The casting team ensured that the chemistry between actors was natural, which elevated the overall quality of the film.---Costume Design: GoodThe costume design in Deadpool 2 was on point. Deadpool's suit retained its iconic look while being slightly upgraded for better functionality. Cable's futuristic armor looked incredible and added to his menacing persona. Domino's sleek and stylish costume perfectly complemented her character's laid-back nature.The team also did a great job with the X-Force members' costumes, ensuring each character looked unique and memorable. The attention to detail in costume design was evident and contributed to the overall visual appeal of the film.---Sound Department: GoodThe sound design in Deadpool 2 was excellent. The film's high-octane action required precise sound effects, and the sound department delivered. Every punch, explosion, and gunshot felt impactful. Additionally, the sound design for Deadpool's healing process and Cable's futuristic technology was particularly impressive.The dialogue was crisp and clear, allowing the comedic timing to land perfectly. The sound mix maintained a perfect balance between dialogue, background score, and sound effects, ensuring a seamless viewing experience.---Special Effects and Visual Effects: AmazingThe special and visual effects in Deadpool 2 were nothing short of phenomenal. The action sequences were packed with high-quality VFX, especially during the scenes involving Cable's technology, Domino's luck-based powers, and Deadpool's healing abilities.The CGI for Colossus was also incredibly detailed, making him feel like a real, tangible character rather than just a visual effect. The visual effects team did a commendable job in enhancing the film's over-the-top action while maintaining a grounded visual style.---Stunts: GreatThe stunt work in Deadpool 2 was mind-blowing. David Leitch, with his background in stunt coordination, ensured the action sequences were top-tier. The hand-to-hand combat, gunfights, and large-scale action set-pieces were all executed with incredible precision.The film's stunt team deserves major praise for creating thrilling and memorable action sequences that elevated the film's overall impact. Deadpool's chaotic fighting style, Cable's tactical combat, and Domino's effortless action all stood out.---ConclusionRewatching Deadpool 2 reminded me why I loved it so much the first time. It's rare to find a superhero film that perfectly blends humor, action, and heart without compromising any aspect. David Leitch's direction, Ryan Reynolds' charismatic performance, and the film's sharp writing made it an unforgettable experience.From the flawless special effects to the brilliant stunt work, Deadpool 2 stands as a prime example of how a sequel should be made. It expanded the story, introduced compelling new characters, and maintained the spirit of its predecessor.For anyone who enjoys a mix of gut-busting humor, intense action, and genuine emotion, Deadpool 2 is an absolute must-watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Deadpool 2 is fantastically hilarious!,"Deadpool 2 is my favorite Marvel movie. One of the funniest movies I've seen, as a Comedy is better than a superhero movie. Deadpool 2 was totally of my taste, completely loved it. Too bad it has to be called ""Deadpool 2"" just generically but people should know it is the superior movie. This movie could just be the original no problem, ""Deadpool"" the part 1 could easily not exist and nothing would be lost. I didn't even feel like watching Deadpool 1 for a second time when it came out. Instead I can watch Deadpool 2 two times in a row so I can pause it to laugh out loud aplenty and I've done that, it is just absolutely fascinating. Sooooooo funny, very few jokes didn't appeal to me, overall it cracks me up pretty bad. The part of the X-Force is the best, hands down, love the humor.
Cable and Domino are standouts. Josh Brolin, in real life he is just as a jokester as Ryan Reynolds. They get along so well.See in Deadpool 1 there is a bad guy and he has no motivation whatsoever to antagonize Wade to the death the way that he did and I didn't like that, didn't convince me. To me that is weak, unlike this movie's plot. In Deadpool 2 is a lot more complex than just one bad guy, I'm not going deeper into that if you haven't seen it, but the theme of ""the bad guy"" is the central topic of the movie. That's why it surpasses Deadpool 1 which is said to be, according to Wade, a Love film. Deadpool 2 is a Family film.The movie is HILARIOUS and this website is too bitter about it. A lot of negative reviews to knock it down from the 8/10. Childish users. Why aren't you happy that part 2 surpassed the 1st?",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
I think the studio got involved,"The first Deadpool was great. It was not the first superhero film rated R, despite what people claimed, but it was a breath of fresh air nonetheless. It was foulmouthed, uncompromising, gory beyond belief and aimed purely at adults. Immature adults, admittedly, but still adults.So, does the sequel hold up? Well, yes and no. It has several good things going for it, but at the same time it feels a lot safer, a lot more meticulous, a lot less pure in its approach.The good things first. Ryan Reynolds is still living his dream with this character and it shows. Deadpool might not be as unleashed as he was in the first film, but he's still a blast to be around and a constant source of laughs. In fact, the cast in general is very good in my opinion. Josh Brolin as Cable, especially. Intimidating, scary and a total badass, yet fitting in perfectly with the rest of the characters, who for the most part are more about quips and body part jokes.Though I will say that the movie did not have enough Domino (Zazie Beetz) in it. Huge missed opportunity. Hopefully she will return in the next film.The action scenes were also good, although lacking that flair seen in the original. The humour worked, the dialogues were fun and the plot was not bad.And yet it is the plot, or rather the story, that's the biggest problem. Mainly the fact that there's too much of it. And that's not usually something to complain about. But let's be honest here. We go into a Deadpool movie for the gore, for the fourth-wall breaking, for the adult humour, for the utter disregard for cinema conventions. And this thing has all of those, but nowhere near as much as the original. Instead it actually tries to make us care, to get emotionally invested. It succeeds, funnily enough, but it's still questionable that it even tried in the first place.So, is the film worth a watch? Sure, if you liked the first one. This will give you your fix, no problems. And who knows, perhaps you'll even like the fact that the Merc with the Mouth makes you have the feels.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

The jokes were hilarious; The acting was goofy; The things that was done in the movie were unimaginable before; The forth wall break!! And that is why the first one(Deadpool 1) was so amazing, and memorable.It is not possible to give even basic synopsis without spoiling anything.

Return of the Merc,"Deadpool 2 is a 2018 dark comedy action sequel with Ryan Reynolds returning to the fan favourite character with old and new faces showing up, including the broody Cable (Josh Brolin who also voiced Thanos in the MCU) and the feisty Domino (Zazie Beetz).While it's a hard burden to carry such a great predecessor, Deadpool 2 manages to just squeeze in the gory boundaries of the original while keeping the (fairly) light tone the first one held. All the while gluing all the similarities the fans are familiar with, but with a time travel aspect and recognizable character's from the comics and the X-Men movie franchise.As it ventures into an extra 10 minutes than the original, it starts to slowly slip away from it's razor sharp charm, but with the help of quotable characters and a brilliant end credits makes Deadpool 2 reinstates itself as a sequel to live up to.Overall if you are expecting the protagonist to be a lot less enjoyable with a different director, it's certainly not. As a enjoyable franchise that has held well with the weight of fans alike, Deadpool 2 is certainly a worthy addition to it's already good first outing and I hope we can expect the same for Deadpool And Wolverine.Grade: ADeadpool And Wolverine review out tomorrow.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

A Dead On Sequel,"Deadpool movies are so hard to review. It's not because their super complex, thought provoking, or even artistic symbolism, but it's more due to the fact of balancing ridiculous antics with serious hero quality. With the first movie being a breath of fresh air to the massively stuffed superhero movie genre, the sequel had a lot to live up to for pleasing the fanbase once more. After one of the most amazing advertisement campaigns to date, did this movie break the fourth wall of entertainment once again? Robbie K here to do his best to help you with your movie viewing pleasures. Let's go!Movie: Deadpool 2Director:
 David Leitch
Writers:
 Rhett Reese, Paul Wernick 
Stars:
 Josh Brolin, Ryan Reynolds, Morena BaccarinLIKES:Acting: Given all of Ryan Reynolds ups and downs, the young actor shines so well in the reboot version of Deadpool. His sass from previous comedy stunts (like Two Guys and A Girl) mixed with his physique/delivery of superhero, leads to a well-developed lead who carries the movie heavily on his costume equipped shoulders. Brolin comes in again as the villain, bringing his grit to a less CGI rendered height that works well to offset the hyper, ADHD like energy of Deadpool and with it comes great comedic banter. Much of the supporting cast nails their roles well too, capable of dropping lines and rocking CGI stunts.Domino: Of all of these though, Domino was my favorite character. In the age of rising female heroes, Domino is a well-developed character who brings so much to the weird table this film sets. Zazie Beetz really shines in this movie as a female partner in crime to counter the crazy of Deadpool. A great character who has a quirky power, this ""lucky"" girl brings bite to fight Deadpool's humor, decent skills with a weapon, and surprisingly some enlightened looks at life that bring some zing to the movie. This character was a fantastic addition to the movie that should help expand the audience.Story: A Deadpool comic is often not the most developed in the story department, and given the direction of the cinema... one never knows how a sequel story will end up. Happily, I can report that this sequel did a nice job in the story department, managing to bring a decent plot that helps our characters evolve yet sticking close to the humor vibe of the movie. It's nice to see a ridiculous character grow, but still stick to the core qualities and Deadpool 2 did a much better job than I could imagine.Special Effects: Deadpool's ridiculous stunts means needing to find some way to make the impossible, possible on the screen. Hat's off, or in this case masks off, to the department who made all the bouts, mutants, and futuristic technology come roaring to full force to immerse you into the action. Speaking of which,Action: The action of Deadpool 2 is a mixed bag for me, but there are plenty of components that worked well with me. At the front line, are a number of bouts that have that chaotic, adrenaline fueled themes to it, mixed with snarky comments and unrelenting jokes that keep things fun, exciting, and a great opener. Seeing the moves, they choreographed/crafted, showed promise for some epic finales to come, always a good idea to cast the net and get them caught up early right. More on that later.Comedy: In truth, the strongest weapon in Deadpool's arsenal is the comedy that this film is drenched in, and by drenched I mean caught in a deluge. This sequel picks up where the last left off and with it comes a cornucopia of styles all hectically crashing together in a giant abstract masterpiece. Nothing is safe from Deadpool's adulteration, as the red garmented maniac brings vulgarity, ridiculous finishes, pokes at stories, comics, movies (including the franchise itself), and of course slapstick that transitions to so much more. I kept laughing my head off in this movie and loved the writing, cleverness, and of course mid-credit scene that victoriously finishes the movie off and delivers the answer to the wishes and prayers of the fan base. So, so good.DISLIKES:Over the top moments: Deadpool I know is all about breaking the 4th wall on just about everything he can. And certainly, in this installment, the writers did their best to break that mold as often and intense as possible. Given the laxer ratings, Deadpool 2 shows no qualms with crossing the line. Primarily the cursing, Deadpool 2 doesn't know when to quit in terms of vulgar cursing and certainly goes down inappropriate avenues I didn't particularly enjoy. A minor one at best, be warned that anything is possible with a mad mercenary.Comedic Stints Go on and on: Like this review, Deadpool's comedic banter sometimes treks on for too long. Those liking to see two smart alecks duke it out in a battle of insults, fake outs, and sarcasm for minutes on end will be delighted with the writing of this movie. I admit I did like it at first, but near the end this ploy had soon started to wrinkle like Wade's face.Action: While I certainly liked the action for much of the movie, I can't help but admit I was a little disappointed as well. Sure, the humor is awesome, the inappropriate battle moves fit well, and it felt like a Deadpool sequence come to life with little to no punches pulled. Yet, I'm still spoiled on some of Marvel's glorious cinema wars and had hoped we'd get some match ups to give them a run for its money. The epic climactic fight didn't quite have the on the edge, clap in your seat, scream in excitement epic fights that the trailers had hinted at. Those moments were fly-overs in an extended montage.Predictable: My buddy is right in saying that the movie certainly goes a different route than presented in the trailers. However,... the movie (perhaps as a stunt itself), dropped too many hints to lead you down the path to the answers that awaited. I was able to figure out all the twists with ease, and not have my mind blown as I thought it would. Another small dislike, but hey got to be honest at times.Character use: The trailers promoted the heck out of X-Force, making sure that we got our eye fill on just about every angle of Deadpool's own team to rival the goody two shoes X-men. And while the characters got their time to shine in comedy moves, their overall contribution to the film was cheated out in my opinion. Maybe that's what the comics have done, or perhaps it was a brilliant comedic ploy. However, don't promote characters so heavily if you are going to dilute them so much. Even his fellow mutants from Xavier's got a bit of underplay, another example of too many pieces leading to sacrifices being required to not make the film too long.The Verdict:Truth is I loved Deadpool 2 and while I had some issues, (which are pickiness of course), the movie accomplishes the goals of being a comedic spoof of superhumans that brings that bite to eat we hungered for. It's fast paced, it's witty, and it still keeps the story going on a level I didn't expect and this provides the breath of fresh air again that the first one did. Still, it's not a perfect movie for me and I still hope to get some more action and character usage in the next installment should Disney not limit Fox's creativity on it. Worth a trip to the theater? Absolutely, though be warned that the movie is not designed for younger audience members, those with weak constitutions to blood, violence, and vulgarity, or those not ready to step over the abyss into craziness.My scores are:Action/Adventure/Comedy: 9.0
Movie Overall: 8.5",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Better than the original,"After buying the first Deadpool on disc, I discoverd that the jokes got stale and the pacing felt uneven on repeat viewings. The sequel excels in almost every way. From Julian Dennison, whom we loved in Hunt for the Wilderpeople, to Josh Brolin's hilarious deadpans, to Zazie Beetz, who is charismatic and beautiful even when sitting on a tree stump, Deadpool 2 just works on every level. It is genuinely funny even on repeated viewings. The zero nudity rating was a bonus that allowed us to bring our teenagers to the movies.

"See it for yourself, great time at the cinema","So I held off from watching Deadpool 2 for a number of weeks having read all these negative reviews. But decided,what the heck let's go for it, as I've been mislead many times by these reviews and ratings before.I loved the first movie, so that being said I wanted something as zany and to watch the anti-hero do he's thing true to the Deadpool character. This movie does not disappoint in this regard. If you liked the first movie and liked the Deadpool character -- why would you hate on this. You will have a great time at the cinema, there will be tons of laughs and wow moments. Is it better than the first --- that's a tough question --- its on par and a true sequel in that it continues with the looney over the top character that was introduced but this time stretches out the plot to appeal to your various emotions. Are the jokes over the top, yeah, are there some jokes that seem recycled -- maybe but they worked and i dare you not to laugh, is it a fun time at the cinema, for sure, do you feel robbed in terms of plot and development, nope.Surprisingly good time had at the cinema. which is a heck of a lot more I can say for so many movies that were rated so highly coupled with positive reviews jumping out of the IMDB web page.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

The plot seemed mostly like an excuse for fun music, cool action sequences, and a ton of sarcasm. I knew that going in, so no complaints. But this formula is gonna run out of steam fairly soon.

It is fun for a while, but not for two+ hours.

"Funnier, filthier, and a crotch riot","Ok let's start off with the fact Deadpool 2 takes too long to get to the meaty bits and adolescent bathroom humor , but once it does, it gets its 9 stars. 
After the slow rocky start, you will be served up heaping piles of melodrama. Self-discovery. Trippy sequences, and Josh Brolin skulking in the background. All of this topped with a dash of some X-Men, and as an added bonus there's an extended joke that ends with a fatal attraction crotch shot that you will never be able to unsee. Oh and a teddy bear. Just focus on the teddy bear and you'll be alrightAs a superhero movie, Deadpool 2 is a sequel that is not better than the original but it does builds on the original in the expected ways.

Of course you will get the obligatory end-credits sequences. They're not essential to move the franchise along, but they are hilarious and worth the wait.As a comedy, is were Deadpool 2 surpasses the original, dispelling the curse of sequels being god awful and ultimately so terrible they are forgotten.

The Vidiot Reviews...,"Deadpool 2The upside to regenerative superpowers is that you can finally work that threshing machine without fear of amputation.Mind you, the immortal in this action-comedy chose a cooler profession than farmhand.After losing someone close to him, the mouthy mercenary Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) finds solace in a young mutant whom he takes under his wing. When a cybernetic mutant (Josh Brolin) travels back through time to kill his protégé for his future crimes, DP must assemble a super-team (Zazie Beetz, Bill Skarsgård, Terry Crews) to protect his partner. But can Deadpool also keep his sidekick from fulfilling his destiny?While the overall plot to this obligatory sequel is simplistic, the final product is overstuffed with overdone action sequences, endless cameos and gags that miss the mark. Although the new characters are commendable, they lack depth and screen time.Fortunately, once mutants start messing with timelines we all get new hairstyles.

A decent sequel to an amazing movie.,"I wanna start of by saying I don't hate this movie, I just didn't enjoy it as much as the first movie. I went into this movie with incredibly high expectations because of the first movie and it didn't deliver to what I was expecting. However, I still had fun watching the movie; the action sequences were cool, Ryan Reynolds was as quippy as ever with Deadpool and it was just an overall good time. The jokes are no way as good as the first movie's jokes but I still laughed now and then while watching. I enjoyed the little cameos from people like Brad Pitt; I thought that was pretty cool. If you're looking for a decent comedy movie and you've already seen the first Deadpool, give this movie a shot.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Deadpool 2,"Sadly, this ""Deadpool"" adventure finds itself just a little too closely drawn into the ""X-Men"" franchise, and as such is not a patch on the first film. That said, there is still plenty of action and irreverent humour. ""Wade"" (Ryan Reynolds) messes up a hit and the survivor tracks him down and does for his love ""Vanessa"" (Morena Baccarin). He is now desperate and even has a go at suicide before ""Colossus"" puts Humpty Dumpty together again and takes him to the X-mansion to recuperate. Meantime, things are getting quite lively at a mutant re-education centre and it falls to ""Wade"" to try and keep the irascible young mutant ""Firefist"" (Julian Dennison) from the grasp of the pursuing ""Cable"" - a time travelling cyborg creation (Josh Brolin) who has the kid firmly in his sights. There are plenty of set piece, and amusing, scenarios but somehow this just isn't so funny as the first film. The originality has been subsumed into, and largely cuckolded by, the Marvel-verse and there are far too many other characters distracting from the potency of the ""Deadpool"" persona. It's becoming just a little too conformist and that defeats the purpose. Still, it's entertaining and Reynolds delivers some really pithy and observational one liners; makes several swipes at the social media generation and of course, makes sure that Brolin's mother-in-law features regularly as ""Yentl"". I really hope ""Deadpool 3"" reverts back to the stand-alone format, I would hate for this to just become another ""X-men"" adjunct.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"Somewhat Annoying, But Some Good One- Liners","Unlike the first one I came into this knowing what to expect and perhaps that is why I enjoyed it a little more. Like the first there is a lot of it that is a bit overkill and can drag on needlessly and start to become annoying, especially if Ryan Reynolds isn't your cup of tea. However some of the jokes hit me a little better in this one than the first. It nicely ripped off pieces from other non Marvel movies and if you have viewed them the jokes are solid.I would also say that the plot had me a little more interested than the first Deadpool. That one it was just too obvious what was going to happen and the villain just way too standard. This one I was a little more interested in what they were going to do with Cable (Josh Brolin), Russell , and the abusive headmaster. Not sure the addition of the juggernaut was needed or was exciting as they hoped, but wasn't overly distracting either . The conclusion of this movie also left it open for Marvel to fix all the confusing timelines and potentially get the franchise on track with the new upcoming Deadpool & Wolverine movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Clever script turns the breaking of the fourth wall into a story,"Lets go back to the 1st Deadpool. What we had there was lots of fun, lots of wit, but actually very little story development. I still liked it a lot, but it felt like the script writers were given a new toy - lets imagin the famous 4th wall is broken to smithereens and see what happens. And they loved this broken 4th wall toy so much all else became insignificant. But since Ryan Reynolds has tons of charisma, and Morena Baccarin isn't short on the stuff too, it worked.We could say this is mostly true of the sequel, but it's done in a much more deliberate manner. It's as if the kids learned how to play with this toy. So despite of the fact that we rarely come across any real character in this movie. That is, we do see many cartoons passing by on the screen, most of them don't really matter, at least not in Deadpool's mind, and since the entire story is being told through his eyes we only see them as cartoons, even if Colossus gets a fair amount of screen time, he never grows into a fully developed character, others don't even get that much, passing as another short gag in the script. In fact only the talent of Josh Brolin and Zazie Beetz creates a character where very little character is really written for them. And still it works. And it works better than it did in the original installment. Because it's done thoughtfully, it shows what one can do with complete creative freedom if one keeps his sense of boundries and limitations, and understands the nature of the media.I only wish the writers of Avengers Infinity War had half the sense of Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick who wrote this with Ryan Reynolds. It would've made it into a much better movie too.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Good movie with some lazy writing,"This movie was good because the plot was original and there were some truly funny scenes and some pretty cool action scenes as well. That being said, I lost track of how many times they referenced the original movie. Every time I heard a joke that was from the original movie, I always thought ""wow these writers really don't know what the fans want"". I never heard a copied joke and thought ""oh haha it reminds me of the first one because it's the same line from the first one"". This happened way way WAY too many times for a marvel movie, considering they basically own hollywood at this point. Again, the rest of the movie was good enough to overshadow the laziness in writing, but it's still there and it makes me mad. The best way for a sequel to pay homage to the original is by leaving it the hell alone, not by leaching off the funny parts of it in an attempt to get some cheap easy laughs that the other writers already got the first time. Worst part of this situation: it probably will only get worse in the next one. Still a good movie, 8/10 stars is still good! But lazy writing.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Second verse, same as the first... for better, and occasionally, for worse","Deadpool(Reynolds, in the party was born to play) continues to struggle with the idea of him being a hero. Will he try to be there for Firefist(Dennison, struggling with his powers and temper), or not? Things come to a head when the kid is targeted by the time travelling Cable(Brolin, badass and motivated). What reason does he have to kill a teenager?Other than ditching the flashback aspect of the structure(the rest remains in place), and obviously the origin story, since that's out of the way, this is the same movie as we got the first time. Except it's bigger, and somewhat different in a few other necessary ways. As much as I love the 2016 film, in most ways, this is an improvement. Obviously the action and scope are increased, since the budget is. But in other areas, more is a good, not bad, thing. This time around, quipping isn't limited to the title character and Weasel(Miller, admittedly funny, despite, as we now know, being a scumbag), rather, basically every major character gets to(adding to the overall world having that flavor, which it already did to some extent). And they all get to be memorable in other ways as well. While I'll admit that the larger cast worried me, they gave everyone the right amount of screen time. With nearly all major scenes and jokes revisited or redone in some way(since they worked the first time), it's noteworthy and impressive that they're greater here. With few exceptions. The franchise building, though the marketing can make it seem obtrusive and excessive, is handled well. I can't wait to see more of Domino(Beetz, an inspired choice).This has a lot of strong language and bloody, gory violence. It's also frequently offensive, crossing the lines of what's politically correct. I recommend this to any fan of DP. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Wait. We Still Have Cable in the Future?,"Usually I save this to the end, but just like the two Deadpool movies, we must operate all over the timeline: DON'T WAIT UNTIL THE END OF THE CREDITS; THERE IS NOTHING THERE.Now, the beginning of the end credits, absolutely. In fact, you MUST see those final scenes as the credits just begin as they (kinda 2) are thee best end credits scenes in any marvel movie EVER. They were absolutely the icing on the already best cake a Deadpool follow-up could've been.Admittedly, I was worried this would suffer from sequelitis and almost didn't see it despite loving the first one wholeheartedly. Mercifully, I woke up in enough time to catch a Dolby® screening and let me say this: Not as great as the original, but pretty damn close and extremely worth seeing.(Even) better soundtrack, absolutely hilarious jokes, inventive new ideas on the original's setup and excellent use of each character and their individual features are just a few of the many positives here. I was rolling in laughter for a grand majority and in awe on how they began with the same thread as the original and broke off with clever writing and directions - totally expanded the singular R-Rated Deadpool universe as if this was his own Avenger movie.Deadpool's on top of the world, or at least all-around it, with fighting ""worse bad guys"" with more maximum effort and maintaining his love life until tragedy strikes sending him on a journey of self-discovery, love and family. F that. It's just a fun kick-A adventure.The one thing that irked me though, was the pacing and length. Several scenes went on far too long even though some of those were meant for comedy and others were just poor choices. And you will feel every one of those 119 minutes. It's almost as if they felt this would bomb and they could never make another Deadpool movie. Hogwash. Of course, there'll be a third, fourth, etc.Can't wait to see this again and with the (now) knowledge that the movie feels too long at times, I'll probably enjoy it tons more the second time. There is so much in here to love and so many jokes I *know* I missed. Heck, I re-watched the original last night for the xxx'th time and caught one hilarious joke I must've missed the many times I've seen it before.ABSOLUTE recommendation. Really need to see the first one, but...nope, you must see the first one. But, hey, I gave that one 4½/5 stars so you really can't go wrong.***Final thoughts: While I began with the warning not to stay to the very end credits as there's nothing there, I will say the music choices all the way to the very end were worth it. I already loved the soundtrack, but it actually improved with the songs they played while the credits rolled.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"A fun movie, but a step down from the original and the third","Deadpool 2, especially now after the mega success of Deadpool & Wolverine and the ground breaking nature of the first Deadpool, is naturally, the red headed step child of the franchise. It's definitely not as good as either of those movies, and it's not one I'd honestly find myself coming back to, but it's certainly not a bad movie.I think it expands pretty well upon the Deadpool universe in fun and exciting ways, giving us way more characters and finally touching upon the ""human-mutant conflict"" that the X-Men series is known so well for. The new cast of characters we meet are overall pretty good; especially Zazie Beets as Domino and Josh Brolin as Cable (although, as a big fan of the character, I couldn't help but feel they copped out a bit with his look).There are - surprisingly - quite a lot of story threads here. We have the loss of Vanessa, the ""evil"" version of the School for Gifted Children, the prison for mutants, Cable and time travel, X-Force, Colossus trying to get Deadpool to join the X-Men. Unfortunately, they don't all receive enough attention and it does lead to the film feeling a bit rushed in the end.I honestly think this movie is funnier than the original Deadpool, especially as I feel Reynolds' take on the character works the best when he's playing off of other people, and there's less cringe inducing pop culture references and 2010s era improv riffing than in the original.But, there is something special about that FIRST appearance of the character and the low budget nature of the movie; that is was scaled back and more character focused, that I think works better, overall.(The original was not low budget by any objective means, just compared to the superhero movie extravaganzas we'd become used to in 2016, it felt a little cheap in comparison)The action sequences are also pretty enjoyable, especially the chase involving Cable and Domino, but I can't help but feel the ending was also a bit of a letdown given the promise of Juggernaut being involved. (Also, we need to acknowledge a fully CG version of the character just did not work as well as Vinnie Jones, could they not have brought him back?)This isn't a bad movie by any means, it's quite a lot of fun, but something about it just screams ""interregnum"" you know? Not that we were aware of it at the time, but it's pretty clear that the X-Men as a franchise were a bit directionless in 2018 (and especially so after X-Men: Dark Phoenix), and this movie feels a bit of the same as well.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Bad-ass crazy kick-ass action sequel I ever saw,"Deadpool 2 the sequel to the smash hit ""Deadpool (2016)"" is an crazy insane bad-ass action I have ever saw. Ryan Reynolds, Josh Brolin and Zazie Beetz did make this movie work for me and they kick-ass in this movie. The action in this movie is so insanely crazy. Those 3 guys battling each other while Deadpool try's to protect a kid a mutant who will become a next monster he is a Russell Collins / Firefist (Julian Dennison). The movie is fantastic, funny it has action, humor and sci-fi. It is an pair and equally damn good film as the original the first film is: I love this film to death it is equally too the original film.I told you it is better than Avengers: Infinity War, Ant-Man and the Wasp, Black Panther, Thor Ragnarok and Guardian of the Galaxy 1 and 2 those movies suck. Deadpool 2 is a good action movie I have enjoy it and I love it. This time directed by David Leitch and not Tm Miller which David Leitch directed perfectly this masterpiece. Josh Brolin is a bad-ass as Cable a cybernetic soldier from the future who has one mission to kill the men who killed his family now he goes in too past to kill a young boy Russell Collins / Firefist (Julian Dennison). Josh Brolin is awesome as Cable I liked him much more in this movie than in Avengers: Infinity War as Thanos who sucked ass. In this movie he was likeable and great. His customize rifle is one powerful weapon, he has such a great weapons. Zazie Beetz is Domino a mercenary with the mutant ability to manipulate luck. I love her performance she is such a bad-ass team mate to Deadpool's X-Force. She saved Deadpool and she helped him out. Ryan Reynolds as Wade Wilson / Deadpool is a bad-ass mercenary with accelerated healing but severe scarring over his body. His performance as Deadpool is bad-ass in this movie I enjoy his performance so much. He even shot him self on the end of the credits for Green Lantern.Ryan Reynolds returns as Wade Wilson, aka ""Deadpool"", who forms a special team X-Force to stop an assassin Cable who has arrived from the future to eliminate a young boy with supernatural abilities.The film has a good, story, good written, good decent acting from everyone, great special effects. Has tons of action. Fights between Deadpool and Cable is bad-ass great chorography. Deadpool's team X-Force saves all the wise and tortured children in the orphanage and bring them to X-Men mansion. That is why I am saying the film is decent. Yes it has jokes but that doesn't make this movie bad it makes it good. Deadpool lost his girlfriend Vanessa (Morena Baccarin), but he decide to never gave up on that kid (Julian Dennison) before he kills the headmaster I love that in that movie. He saved that kid and make sure he didn't become an assassin going on a dark path, I thought that was decent in the film and not selfish! :PI love the dialogue's in which Deadpool mentions Bucky Barnes The Winter Soldier, Black Widow and of course he mentions the lines for ""the Hulk"" in which Black Widow calm down ""the Hulk."" in (Avengers: Age of Ultron.) He mentions the Avengers and I respect Ryan Reynolds for that. Juggernaut was also voiced by Ryan Reynolds him self. Juggernaut was a good villain character portrayed in the movie I have seen. Thunderstruck from AC/DC is also in this movie a bad-ass soundtrack that I love it so much.My favorite action sequence will be the fight with Domino and Cableon a Convoy in which Domino fire with a gun at him and fights him off. The score for me is 9 it is an equal film with the original first Deadpool film. It is decent, bad-ass action MARVEL film and it is rated R like the first film. If you don't understand the film or you don't like it for the action and jokes that's fine. I have completely enjoyed Josh Brolin, Zazie Beetz and Ryan Reynolds in the film. P.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Less is more,"Let's start by saying that I loved the first Deadpool when it came out in theatres! I went to watch it with a whole bunch of friends and laughed more times than I could count. After seeing it a few more times, and of course also as a result of growing up, I could say that some things about the film where a little childish maybe (the overdose of sexual humor) but it was still a fun and original movie none the less! So naturally I was excited for the second one...and beyond all expectations...I really didn't like it that much.Let's start off positive, pretty much all the characters are great. Ryan Reynolds is great as Deadpool, Colossus is a fun presence as well as Cable and Domino are two very nice additions to this universe. There's one big twist somewhere in the middle that I LOVED, the action is very well done, the acting is good, the movie has a great tempo behind it and last but not least, the credits scenes are hilarious!So what happened? Well let's start by saying that it tries way too much at being as good as the first one. The method of narration is pretty much exactly the same, so it comes of as repetitive. The humor is once again good, but there are WAY too many times that it just doesn't work. I usualy don't mind pop culture references when they're done well, but here they just come out of nowhere and don't always fit in the moment. Another thing about the humor that didn't always work is that way too much of it is in your face. There's a scene where one person continiously says that a certain power of another person is absolutely useless while cette person is actually demonstrating to us that that power isn't useless. It was way too obvious what they where trying to do and I didn't find it funny.
The character of Cable is very cool and played well, but his introduction in this movie is extremely rushed, it almost felt like a bad Terminator movie at times, but luckily his character did improve. Another thing is the character of Firefist who is extremely inconsistent. This person changes his mind constantly during the movie that I found it very difficult to care for him, and the fact that this person plays a major part in the movie isn't that good.This movie was a mixed bag for me.
The action is great, the cinematography is very good, most of the acting is good, there are some very fun references and a good portion of the humor is well done.
On the other hand it does try way too hard at being like the first one, it feels very rushed at times, some characters are pretty difficult to follow and the other half of the humor is either way too much in your face or it just doesn't fit in the moment.It's a fun movie to go and see with your friends on a Saturday night, but nothing more.

Me neither, but I can imagine the effects that cocaine have on a person is similar to the same psychological and bodily reaction one gets while watching ""Deadpool 2."" Imagine buying a nice bag of 100%, pure, unadulterated, Colombian ""sugar,"" and you can already feel the rush through your body as you're walking home with it. Your hands are shaking with excitement, your heart is racing, and your brain is flooded with dopamine. Then you get home, ready to press your face against that sweet, sweet angel dust and breath in, and then the real rush hits you. Adrenaline, endorphins, it's like an orgasm times one million. You laugh, you cry, you feel your brain coursing with pleasure.The process of going to watch ""Deadpool 2"" is like that, but better. First you buy the ticket, and you can feel a slight tingling in your groin area. Then you buy your popcorn, get a large soda because it's only 75 cents more than the medium and who could resist a deal like that, and as your wallet gets lighter because you just spent a week's pay in 15 minutes, the tingling increases, and you feel a slight sense of moisture (I'm trying to make this applicable to both sexes okay? This is 2018). Then you actually step inside of the theatre and you're basically a lake. Everyone around you is avoiding you because EVERY part of your body is dripping some form of liquid, and you're breathing heavily even though you didn't even snort any coke, at least, not the good kind. And then the trailers start and your excitement is almost unbearable. If you were having a sexual experience, which is practically what ""Deadpool 2"" is, you would have no doubt already finished and disappointed your lover. But then, finally, sweet release rushes over you as the movie finally starts, and it's as if you've taken a page from Paul Finch's book and studied the art of sexual tantric meditation because for the duration of the entire run time you feel pure, radiating sexual pleasure.I'm not even exaggerating, but I am narcissistically stroking my own ego by overindulging in my own mediocre writing abilities, but that's how you get the A's kids, you write a bunch of fluff and make it sound professional, and now I'm making slightly above minimum wage in an insurance office doing work I did not go to college for so it looks like all my hard work paid off. Did I mention I made $160 in the stock market by selling a stock I owned when it rose a few bucks, but I could've made much more if I had any patience and waited only 3 hours later, at which point my stock would've rose to a number so astronomically large that I am currently considering checking myself into a psych ward because of how much I regret my decision?Don't worry though, because ""Deadpool 2"" is funnier and more entertaining than my poorly written review. I laughed so hard that I have no doubt I made my girlfriend uncomfortable. My girlfriend, she didn't laugh that much, she chuckled, shook her head, farted a few times, but me, I couldn't stop. I was stroking my girlfriend's thigh slowly and suggestively during this movie because she's thicc and was wearing short shorts, but the stroking turned into iron-tight grips because I needed something to hold on to because I was laughing so hard. Seriously, my girlfriend now has bruises on her thighs and officer, I swear, it's Deadpool's fault. I really feel stupid because of how hard this movie made me laugh.And if you're a killjoy and don't find anything funny, then you shouldn't go see this movie but if you do, at the least the action will definitely entertain you. The action is slick and clean and gory and bloody and very high-energy, and really reminded me of ""Kick-Ass.""

Believing his fiancé wanted him to join the X-Men, he agrees to become a member.14-Year old mutant Russell aka Firefist causes major chaos and destruction at an orphanage owned by the X-Men. Russell accuses the Headmaster of abusing him, and wants revenge. Wade and Russell are taken to prison for their antics, and soon after mayhem ensues when a soldier from the future, Cable, is in pursuit of Russell.What follows, is plenty of over-the-top action and destruction. With the Deadpool movies being pure satire, I believe these overblown scenes are intentional as it mocks other superhero movies. The rude dialogue actually makes these over-the-top sequences funnier than it ought to be. There's also clever reference to other movies and actors. The action sequences are incredibly well done, and the fight sequences are fast and brutal.'Deadpool 2' definitely looks a lot more like part of the 'X-Men' franchise than 'Deadpool' did. Although more entertaining than expected, I still enjoyed 'Deadpool' more. The crazy credits at the beginning and end of the movie are hilarious!",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Good Balance between Trailer vs Movie,"I want to start by saying having watched all trailers for DP2 as they came out over the past few months, I was starting to worry a little bit of trailers spoiling the movie but was happy with final trailer still not revealing much. To my joy it turned out they managed to strike a very good balance in terms of trailer fulfilling their teaser function without making me feel ""yea we can skip this part of the movie, trailers got it covered"".It is not a masterpiece of a movie, but going to Deadpool with that expectation is no different than riding merry-go-round for adrenaline. Deadpool 2 successfully delivers its promise of being an action packed mockery of superhero genre.The way it can go the lengths regular superhero movies can not dare go allowed the movie to accomplish some unique story twists and action scenes.Without spoiling anything there is a particular scene where Deadpool and Cable handshake, and that scene alone is worth the movie ticket.Plus kudos to Reynolds for the after credits scene.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"A crude, visually appealing sequal.","This movie was the sequal that we didn't need, but needed. Alot of laughs and dramatic moments, doesn't gelo the really off pacing.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Just as good, if not better, than the first","I'll keep it short and sweet. If you liked the original Deadpool movie, then you'll love this. I was laughing almost the entire time and the rest of the people in my theater were, too.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Joke is on us,"For every 10 min of ""jocular"" conversation, there is 2 min of story. And the story is nothing which you haven't seen before. Few jokes bring out a smile or laughter, but eventually the biggest the joke is made by director on us, with this lazy writing and weak story.If you care for your time, just watch DP 1",4.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Movie was outstanding as it should be but......,Took my kids cause well the love Deadpool anyway they didn't get some of the jokes especially one eyed willy and my 13 year old left wanting more. He said the last part was his favorite and adding in the larger kids was crazy. So hopefully next time they can fix the punch lines and the old school jokes. Other then that I'm 36 and I loved it.,10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Better then the first! & that's saying something!,This movie has heart and pain and anger and redemption and it's funny as hell! It really made me think about all these kids shooting up these schools because of all the pain their carrying! And how one person could save them if someone just cared enough! I walked out of the theater and there was just 10 students shot in a Texas high school and it's weird to get hope from a DeadPool movie but that's what it gave me! I loved this film it's deeper and smarter then they want you to think it is! And that Celine dion song kicks ass! See this film!,10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
it was ok,I gave it a 7 because they put a lot of effort/money into production value but other than that this movie is forgettable. I doubt it will me anymore memorable than most of the other marv/DC comic movies.,7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Funny but not annoying.,"Deadpool 2 is exactly what you've expected it to be from watching the first film. The jokes are great, they're original, funny but most importantly, not annoying. Most films with this much jokes are too annoying because they are trying too hard to fit a joke into every scene.
The music is also great as expected, most of them being classic songs that everyone should know like: ""Take On Me"" and others.
Story-wise however, the story is definitely lacking and doesn't make sense at some points, but what did you expect? I went to the cinema knowing that I just want the attitude and sarcasm of Wade Wilson and the music.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Good sequal,"Good film as even if you don't get the movie references (like myself), it's still funny!",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Worth the wait,"I went into the movie hoping it wouldn't be a lame attempt to cash in on the popularity of the first one. It definitely wasn't. As Reynolds himself said, the solo formula isn't good for more than a couple movies. Though they pushed it on the sequel it still worked. Mainly because there were so many twists in the movie.
Every time I thought it was getting too serious (I mean really, are looking for serious in a Deadpool movie), they threw a little twist and left you thinking, Ok, what's next?
The action was good, the humor was just as raunchy, and actually pretty topical without being to hipster.
Lots of making fun of himself, and others, throughout the movie.
In short, it was exactly what I expected, and wanted, from a Deadpool sequel.
The post credits scene was almost worth the price of admission by itself.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Not as good a DP1,I felt this was just a series of jokes strung together to make a movie. There was no gripping underlying story like the first one had. Most of the jokes were funny. I've never been a fan of TJ Miller and found nothing he did in the movie very funny. Reynolds was great as usual and Josh Brolin was good as well. But the lack of a story really set this apart from the first one for me.,6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Boring,"I was laughing so hard with the first Deadpool. But this one, I was finding myself wanting to take a nap. Wasn't funny at all. Save your money, and just take a nap at home. I gave it 2 stars because I laughed once.",2.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Best movie of 2018,"When I saw this film, I had high hopes that it would be good and it was! The only problems that I had with this film are that it gets a little bit slow at times but then it almost imeaditly bounces back and gets great! Some things that I love about this movie are that it is VERY meta and self-aware and the writers are excelent.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Better than the first one,"Better than the first one. Really funny, dark humor, lots of action sequences, gore, romance, drama and the most sad moments i've watched in a lot of time. Many references to pop culture (OST as well) and Marvel, and it mocks on DC Comics and Warner Bros at least 4 times. The opening credits are a tribute to James Bond, really well done and performed by Celine Dion. Good performances of Domino, Rusell (the kid) and Cable.There are 2 mid-credit scenes; the second one is the best mid-credit scene of all times in cinema history.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Nothing new. I like what they did at end.,"It's a good movie. Same stuff, funny, rude stupid jokes and crazy mad action. Story could have been a lot better. No spoilers but I like the ending. Overall not a bad movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Insanely clever,"The script and storyline was made in a way that is impossible to get bored. Is an experimental way of a linear narrative, by going back and forth because he's dying all the time. Is so clever. Plus all the references of movies, music and pop culture that just makes it more relatable to the everyday life. And the diversity of the cast and the black humor made the movie so pleasent to watch. The actions are aggressive and it can get very explicit but that's the spark about Deadpool. Very good job.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
all i can say is hes back,I went to see this not exactly knowing what to expect besides a whole lot of fun but let me tell ya it was fantastic maybe even better then before there was plenty of slick humor loads of action heart and humor one of the best movies of the year with a good message we can all take away from it see it,10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
I must concur the obvious.. It sucked some.,"I try not to get my hopes up on sequels, as most sequels really fall short of their original. But I hoped this would be different. The opening minutes set the pace of the rest of the movie, just minus some humor, story line and the ability to keep you with the movie. I will say they tried a new angle to the character and gave him a heart. But this is a man who has looked death in the face and laughed and had a snide comment for those near him.We were packed into a theater with 8 other viewers, and the lack of laughter says it all. If you are a diehard DP fan, then go see your guy. But if you have an option, wait till this is on TV or your favorite streaming system. I do not feel too bad as I got a free ticket to see it, but wish it could have been for another movie.Do not get me wrong, I enjoy DP and how he was brought to the screen by Ryan and Co. But this episode fell really short of its mark. Unless its mark was to just ride the tails of the first movie. The hype did not meet the expectations put out there, and I for 1, and probably not the last, was bummed about the story.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Not very good,"Deadpool 2 has its share of funny moments and action but there is so little in the way of plot that it's impossible to care what happens to anyone. What plot there is doesn't even really start until about 45 minutes into the movie. The first 45 minutes is like an extended prologue that should have been cut to a montage in the opening credits.
The best thing in this film was Domino, the female character whose superpower is that she's lucky. The other new characters are totally forgettable. Even the kid from Hunt for the Wilderpeople is wasted here. His character isn't likeable and doesn't even have any funny lines that I can remember.
There were lots of moments that were meant to be serious, but with the lack of any conflict these parts were just boring. And whenever it did get funny, it usually had nothing to do with the plot.
Overall this film is badly paced and structured, with a plot that's barely there.",4.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Makes the original movie look like ""The Room"" by comparison.","This movie is absolutely fantastic. I was consistently entertained throughout the whole thing. The story is hilarious and clever. The characters are all well-acted and portrayed (except for Weasel). My only complaint is that the end credits scenes (while being some of the funniest scenes in the entire movie) kinda create some plot holes. I don't care because its really really funny, but I wanted to point it out.Every problem from the first movie is fixed. There is better action and effects and the plot is much better. There are a lot of strange camera angles and editing decisions, but nothing too bad.If you liked the first movie, you'll love this one.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

just fine,"I admit I was attracted by the trailer that was so funny and its good box office. the scenes weren't incredibly interesting yet still okay. I knew there'll be Deadpool 3 in the future, not offensive, but then I won't go watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
SO GOOD!!!!!,"In this film Deadpool puts together a team to protect a teenage mutant from the time travelling cyborg Cable.This film is directed by David Leitch (Atomic Blonde). It stars Ryan Reynolds (Deadpool), Josh Brolin (No country for old men) and Julian Dennison (Hunt for the wilderpeople).First of all, this film is so watchable, typing up this review right now, I just want to go a nd watch it again. Secondly, Leitch brings his considerable talents to the franchise and was such a good choice to direct, after Tim Miller left. Leitch adds these almost effortless one shot fight scenes, that I simply couldn't get enough of. This film is laugh out loud hilarious, even funnier than the first film in my opinion. Ryan Reynolds never lets me down with his performance. But to me Domino (Zazie Beetz) and Cable (Josh Brolin) are the stand out characters of this film.However, the story is nonexistent, and the CGI, especially at the end was really noticeable. Yes, I know it was made on a lower budget than other superhero films. But if you think about it Deadpool 2 was made on a budget of about $110,000,000, that is at least twice as much as the original Deadpools budget and yet the CGI still looks the same even with twice the budget.In my opinion, this film is better than the original. I personally believe that the first Deadpool film is ok, but this film is great and a must watch.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
