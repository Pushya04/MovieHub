District 9 NEEDS a sequel,"But don't let that stop you from jumping into it.
It's an excellent film. Funny, suspenseful & engaging. Highly recommended for lovers of science fiction.
Definately worthy of repeat viewing.
C'mon though gang, WHERE'S THE SEQUEL!?",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Brilliant World-building and Social Commentary,"""District 9"" is a film I was lucky enough to see in the theater when it first released. The marketing for the movie was remarkably good, posters everywhere meant that before you even entered the theater, you had already been primed to see the ""Prawns"" as a nuisance, larger and stronger than humans, and probably best kept at a distance. The film's opening and narrative bookends being from the perspective of a documentary of news crew meant that everything felt very lifelike when you saw ads running on TV. As a Sci-fi lover, my interest was primed and pumping as I bought my ticket.Now, 10 years later, my love for this movie is not as strong and has shifted from my previous reasons for liking it, but nevertheless, this is a film I expect will remain on my shelf for years to come.""District 9"" wowed me in the beginning for many reasons. The first one out of the gate that grabs you is the world building. There are hosts of movies that take similar tacks when it comes to informing the audience about the history or rules of a fantasy, sci-fi, or just slightly left of real, world. Relate everything through news stories that play in the background or are featured in scenes that inform everyone as to what is going on. In fact, this approach is so common that it is considered a crutch by many filmmakers and is classically made fun of in the brilliant ""Shaun of the Dead""It is truly rare to find films which spin a tried and maybe tired device into something fresh and even featured as a part of their film but Neill Blomkamp delivers a fresh look at documentary news coverage as exposition that simply stunned. Not only does the footage seem real, immersive, and present important concepts to audiences, it does so in a way that they are used to receiving information so that when they are presented with personal stories that contradict the news coverage, it causes them to ask questions about those same sorts of stories in their own lives, but more about that later.The next thing that stood out about the film was the performance of Sharlto Copley (""Chappie"") which, essentially, launched his international career. One of the most difficult tasks that a writer, director, or actor faces is to make relatable that which is unrelatable. Taking a character like Wikus, who is blind to his prejudice, complicit activities, and general willful ignorance and turn him into someone for whom we have genuine empathy is the essential role of an artist. To not hide from the way that Wikus allows himself to be stupidly used in the beginning of the film and give him a journey which confronts him with the horrific results of his apathy in a way that leaves us hoping for better for him is the essence of good acting and I say Bravura to Copley for his performance.The reason that I highlight these two aspects of the film is because they are what I find to be essentially brilliant about the film, yet also what was lost on me about it ten years ago. With the way the film tells its story in two ways: through high level news; stories, documentary footage, and interviews with family and friends of Wikus; as well as on the ground personal interactions; between Wikus and his coworkers, the company, his family, and the Prawns; we end up getting the story from two perspectives.As a young man, I wasn't asking myself the questions I now ask myself so I only saw the interesting story, the horror of realizing something alien is happening to you, and the thrill of some impressive action sequences especially considering the budget. As an older man I realize that while the film is about these things on the surface, it is also about the difference between what we receive through screens, second hand accounts, and media outlets, as opposed to that which we experience personally.The film is about perception, propaganda, prejudice, and personal connection. It is about what is real and what is not. Questions like this continue to be begged more and more as our world becomes more saturated, debate if you will for good or ill, with screens, vlogs, stories, commercials, news stories, reality shows, and everything in between. ""District 9"" is a reminder that while our world has gotten wider with the advent of new technologies there is always the threat that it may not get deeper as it grows in breadth. We must remember that the tactile person to person contact which is the enemy of prejudice requires us to seek specifically for the individual and to see them for who they are as an individual and not just what group they belong to.The Prawn in this film is a stand in for all of the things we fear at a knee's jerk whether it is the immigrant, refugee, Muslim, Jew, Christian, Communist, Fascist, Snowflake, or Boomer. May we all seek to understand each other more despite the efforts of the powerful to shape our understanding through media.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
This is mind-blowing!,"This is such an incredibly weird movie that I am not even sure if I can adequately describe it, but I'll try. The film is, through the first half, a mockumentary about a problematic alien problem that will supposedly be happening in the near future. In 2010, an alien ship appears over Johannesburg and just hovers there. When humans eventually decide to cut through the hull, they find the ship packed with over a million aliens--aliens that are starving and look like giant bugs. Well, there seems to be no one in charge and they all are apparently workers who have no real purpose other than to work. When the UN decides to finally do something about it, the aliens are herded into a giant ghetto like those used during apartheid. And, for the most part, they are reviled or exploited--and kept as a permanent underclass.The film mostly centers around a rather dim civil servant, Wikus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Copley). He is the leader of an organization sent in to move the bugs to a new facility that also totally sucks--but is away from the humans--who have come to totally distrust and hate them. But, in the process he accidentally infects himself...and where this goes next is just amazingly weird! And, once infected, the film stops being a mockumentary and follows his new life as a wanted man. Why is he wanted, who wants him and what this is all about is just too much for this short review--really.So let's talk about the film. I used to think that movies like ""Happiness of the Katakuris"", ""Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World"" and ""Delicatessen"" were weird films, but ""District 9"" clearly sets a new standard for weird and creative. You simply cannot find anything like it--and it's wonderful to find a film that is this unique. Plus, like good sci-fi, this one is a great allegory with deeper contemporary meaning--with a lot to say about us screwed up humans! By the way, this movie is rated-R and it clearly deserves this. The language is very, very rough but the film is also very gross--with lots of blood, guys, vomiting and the like. It is NOT for a person with a weak stomach or children...seriously...do NOT let the kids see this one! Because of this, although I loved this film and was blown away by it, I also cannot see it as a perfect film--hence my not giving it a 10. It's just unnecessarily adult when it could have been a great film for a much wider audience.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The first science fiction masterpiece in years,"I do not give out ratings of 10 lightly, but here it is - the first film in years that has been deserving of the rating.Neill Blomkamp brings to screens a fantastic, gritty, realistic piece of science fiction with District 9. Not since Ridley Scott's ""Blade Runner"", John Carpenter's ""The Thing"", or James Cameron's ""Aliens"" have we seen a science fiction film with a vision of this caliber. After viewing District 9, it will be clear to one and all why Peter Jackson put so much faith in Blomkamp and took him under his wing as protégé.Abandoning the usual settings of Hollywood sci-fi and placing us in the harsh slums of South Africa, we are given an original piece of work which takes risks in the way it tells its story. Not only does it go against the expectations of audiences who have been trained to expect mediocrity from their sci-fi, it goes above and beyond the call of duty to provide us with spectacle as well as something to ponder after we've downed our popcorn.There is, thankfully, not an overused, overexposed celebrity in sight, and every unknown face in the film gives a solid performance. The aliens themselves, brilliantly realized with top notch CGI even manage to make us feel something, only rivaled by Gollum from ""Lord of the Rings"".District 9 has so much to like. It's spectacular, darkly funny, entertaining and thoughtful all at the same time, and it's all done on a meager $30m budget. There is true talent on show here. If only there were more films like this, the world of cinema would be a more interesting place.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
This should not be missed!,"Just got home from a preview of District 9. We had seen the previews and were intrigued to see just what the film would be like.The film style was very much documentary like with lots of sound byte style comments settings the scenes and giving commentary all through the film. These in my opinion took it from being what could have been just another ""aliens vs humans"" film and elevated into the realms of social commentary. The aliens are presented almost as animals yet you rapidly start to sympathize with them and tune into their desperation.If it wasn't for the alien space ship in the background and the poor being alien in every sense, you would think this was a movie about any slum and the people who prey on the inhabitants.Like other films which cover the worst that humans can do, there is a brutal violence present and the directory has not shied away from depicting it. This is not a film you want to watch after a big meal. Just ask my girlfriend. She thought she would have to leave half way through.In all, this is a film we worth every cent to see. Right up until the end you are never sure what's going to happen next. The characters are believable and the style of the film just adds to it. This could have happened, and in fact may happen.For a first effort, Neill Blomkamp has created one of the best SciFi for a while, his future work will be well worth paying attention to.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A Sociological Sci Fi Thriller,"I have to admit I was sucked in by the TV commercials for this movie. I wasn't disappointed. It didn't take long to link the events of this film with the realities of many parts of our world. The aliens are the oppressed, and, realistically, the earthlings have interned them in camps and allowed them to create a dystopic society. They feast and are feasted upon by the exploiters. Like the Native-Americans and many other disenfranchised creatures, they have become a nuisance, and the society that is treating them so badly is now going to move them to a ""more convenient"" place. An overzealous public official, the central figure in the movie, gets his jollies by treating the aliens as if they were non-sentient creatures. He does a Steve Irwin kind of commentary as he invades their homes and tries to get them to agree to their relocation. He is so cocky that he doesn't realize that swipe from one these beings could cut him in half. In his stupid recklessness, he infects himself with an alien canister and begins to transform into one of them. The strength of this movie, however, is the ""humanity"" of the aliens. They have personalities. They are not bugs, though they look like them. They love, they fight, they survive in horrid conditions. This is a very complex movie that doesn't go for the cheap thrill, although it does occasionally go too much to the special effects and predictable battle scenes.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Nice!,I watched this again after 9 years. Still as impressive as it was back then visually and otherwise. The soundtrack was great. Reminded of how good South African films can be. Check it out if you haven't already,8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Wow,"I caught an early screening of this movie last night. I went into it with high expectations considering the high ratings it has been getting already. My expectations were not high enough however because this film exceeded my them in every way possible.I will not go far into detail because I would prefer to not spoil anything. This is unlike any sci-fi we have seen in years. Forget Terminator 3 and 4, forget the AVP movies, forget all those laughable sci-fi movies, this film is what we have been waiting for. An original idea, an original concept, brilliantly executed, great CGI, good acting, it just has it all. We have seen many aliens come to earth movies, but this is different, I will not say why though. That is for you to find out when you see it, which I HIGHLY recommend you do.This movie, quality-wise, matches up with the popular Sci-Fi films we love. The original Alien, the original Predator, The Matrix, Star Wars, etc. While I enjoyed those ones more because they are classics, this one clearly meets the standards we expect today when it comes to quality. A big driving force behind this, in my opinion, is the fact that high esteemed Peter Jackson is behind this project as the producer. After seeing his masterful Lord of the Rings saga, anyone can see that he knows what he is doing.As far as movies for this year, this is definitely top 5 so far on my list (Up, Star Trek, 500 Days of Summer, HP6, and District 9). Thank you Jackson and Hollywood for finally producing the best Sci-Fi in years. If this movie does not make its way to IMDb top 250 then I will be in awe.See this movie!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Not what I expected,"I attended a promotional screening for this with a pretty good attitude towards all the hype that surrounded it. It was not what I expected, it was much better.Not only were the CGI top notch, but the narrative is driven through a believable plot. Watching this film made me believe that a situation as such had occurred on Earth, and therefore the far fetched notion of an extra terrestrial race visiting us becomes so close to a reality through a story that is so realistically depicted.District 9 is a beautifully crafted film which shows signs of great promise for being around for a while, a subject talked about by many people. Can't wait to watch this again with my friends = )",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Weirdly mindblowing,"This movie different from the rest of the Alien movies. Though the gross awful looking aliens creeps me out most of the time at but that doesn't distract me from enjoying this the unique story. It kept at the edge of the seat whole time.

Great original sci-fi,"In 1982 a spaceship appears over Johannesburg, South Africa. They find an alien population of ""Prawns"" and put them in a concentration camp called District 9. After 20 years, the local population has had enough of the aliens and plan to relocate the aliens to a location far away. Wikus van der Merwe is a meek bureaucrat who is given charge to organize the relocation plan by private corporation MNU. District 9 has become a vast lawless place with alien technologies. While rounding up the Prawns and getting signatures on paperwork, Wikus is infected with something that is slowly morphing him into the alien.What an amazing debut effort from director/writer Neill Blomkamp. It is richly original and so very human. It uses the documentary style to elevate its realism. The CGI Prawns are brilliantly grotesque without being a ridiculous horror. Wikus is such a wonderful comedic character. It is a scathing indictment of the treatment of the disenfranchised. The movie works on so many different levels. It is audacious beyond anything a big Hollywood blockbuster should be.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Excellent no-nonsense sci-fi actioner...,"Going into the cinema I had mixed expectations as I only saw a handful (yet interesting) posters and only one trailer. I only heard a handful of reviews yet all of them came from this site. Well, I decided to hedge my bets and walk in anyway. And I'm glad I did.""District 9"" is a wallop of a film that is also one of the year's very best films. It perfectly presents the balance of human emotions and CGI mastery. The acting is top notch and believable, and the characters are so realistically presented; even the protagonist is deeply flawed, and during some scenes I wonder who should I root for.The story is well told; a refreshing, unique and somewhat original scenario, one that we've never experienced for quite some time. The atmosphere is bleak, dark and realistic, actually making me believe this thing can actually happen here on Earth.The special effects are excellently rendered, and actually give more than their money's worth (Only US$ 30 million! And the effects were amazing, as great as anything WETA has done before!). The creature effects are so realistic we could not tell the difference. Thanks to none other than WETA for this amazing feat, and I hope they get an Oscar for visual effects. But the practical effects are believable too, as per the engaging and thrilling (and also non-stop) action sequences in the film's second half. And boy, those weapons are awesome! Special mention goes out to the fluid editing. Example, first half of the film works like a docu-drama, and the second half becomes a hybrid of Black Hawk Down, and we don't notice the change of pace. It's that brilliant.Peter Jackson really knows how to pick a good story and director when he sees one. And I want to shake Neill Blommkamp's hand if I meet him. He is certainly a talented director, and one to look out for in the future. (P.S. If that Halo movie is still going on, Blommkamp has proved that he is the man for the job) In short, it's an excellent science fiction action film, but not without it's intelligence. It may have a few flaws and very few clichés (these happen near the end of the film) but it is still very solid nonetheless. If there is a sequel, I'll be first in line to see it.Overall value: 8.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Most overrated film of 2009.,"After hitting 9.0 for the weekend, I broke down and saw it. There are certainly some things to recommend it - excellent CGI, and some fantastic acting by Sharlto Copley in the lead role. It's possible worth seeing if you don't mind watching some splatter-happy violence.That being said - the story is a complete and utter mess. If you've seen the trailers or viral marketing pieces you know that it's about a bunch of aliens ""refugees"" stuck in a ghetto called District 9. Basically, it's a thinly-veiled apartheid movie with aliens. Expect to be beaten over the head by this through the entire length of the film. You see, it's about how evil people are and how much they hate people errr... things (remember... thinly veiled) that are different from them. People are especially evil if the get together and form large paramilitary corporations that are inexplicably allowed to flaunt every known or imagined law, ethic, and moral code with complete impunity. People are so evil and stupid that they'll concentrate all of their efforts into beating down ""the others"" and completely give up on deciphering the massive amounts of technology the others happen to have. There's no point in trying to integrate them into society, no National Geographic teams in there studying them. Nope, nope, nope, we're just too busy, as a species, being evil. Even though the aliens are very easily bribed into doing whatever, we don't even try to persuade them to use their technology for us. We don't even want to use them as slaves. Target practice, maybe. We're just too darned committed to being evil. The politicians are in on it. The media's in on it. The father-in-law's in on it. It's serious work being this evil.Does this sound like a ridiculous and over-the-top description? It's not. There's no human in this movie who's not a complete jerk. The hero? He's really a jerk. Everyone around him is an even bigger jerk. There's no human character in this movie that doesn't deserve to be fed through a wood chipper (the alien characters that get any development are, of course, noble, peaceful, and loving). Let's just be honest. There's a certain mindset that just gets off on this mentality - these people will see this movie and say ""Oh yes! yes! yes! We're all jerks! Show us how bad we are!"" It's species-level self-flagellation at its finest if you're into that sort of thing. Otherwise you'll spend quite a bit of time rolling your eyes.One final word - shakeycam. Yes, it's supposed to be ""documentary-style,"" but this is was just overboard. Think ""camera being held by a person with an inner ear infection having a seizure."" 6 / 10 stars",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
It is just THAT good.,"Saying this movie is good would be an understatement. The movie has it all, a very intriguing deep plot, good acting and great action. If I was to find a flaw in this movie, it would be the shaky cam technique employed at the beginning part of the movie and also at the very end. The shaky parts are supposedly documentary clips telling the story of Wikus, the protagonist. But rather than add to the feel of it, the shakiness is just nauseating. They just over did it. But after a while into the movie, they got out of the documentary mode and things couldn't be any better. And the special effects in his movie will have you believing that these aliens are real.It's better that you go into this movie not knowing the deeper plot as a big part of the movie's entertainment value for me is the parts when things look hopeless and you really feel the despair and hopelessness of the characters. The only thing you need to know going in is that there are aliens stranded on earth and they are put in slums.This is one of those movies that teases you that it's nearing its end, but inside, you go ""No, I want more. It can't end like this"", and the movie hears you and gives you more. And it's primed for a great sequel. The potential that this franchise has is just enormous. The way they can expand the story is just limitless and all of them can add to it's lore. This is a classic franchise in the making.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Quite good , despite bad writing","The best thing about ""District 9"" are obviously the special effects. They are VERY impressive and help you forget that your just watching a movie. The idea for this movie isn't exactly new (""Alien nation"" from the 80's was first) , but still makes for an interesting and quite original movie . The action scenes are done well and entertaining. The acting is decent.The movie is obvious allegory for apartheid /racism. We see peoples lack of empathy , ignorance and sometimes pure cruelty (the scene with burning house with alien eggs). It's even quite frightening to see black people being hostile towards aliens. The vision of humanity's reaction to aliens is pessimistic , but unfortunately realistic one. This is no ""Independence day"" or ""Close encounters of third kind"". The movie works best when it concentrates on human's nature. It's too bad that ""District 9"" very quickly concentrates on special effects and action. It too easily becomes another ""innocent man on the run"" movie , only with aliens. More depth , less action please.The screenplay is rather mediocre. The story is really simple and after 5 minutes you can easily guess what will happen and who will be important. The characters are terribly thin . The main hero is one-dimensional unlikable asshole . His change of heart isn't one bit convincing. We have also awfully cliché characters like evil father in law , evil soldier/mercenary (who is strong and stupid) or evil gang lord. Even the main alien characters are lame – kid alien is basically a sweet child , while the big alien is 100% boy scout.What is worse there is some stupidity here . The main hero doesn't seem to understand what ""hiding in plain sight"" means and is acting VERY irresponsible . Anybody with half of brain wouldn't make the same stupid mistakes he did. There is also one quite big plot hole involving entering the city.""District 9"" is quite good movie , but overrated. The idea begs for something more complicated than simple action movie. It begs for something like ""Blade runner"" or ""Brazil"". The authors of this movie had good idea , but in my opinion they wasted it a little bit. It's a good movie , but could have been a LOT better. I give it 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A South African Futuristic Greek Tragedy,"After ""District 9"" was over, I had to run from the theater to the hotel and take a long, long shower. ""District 9"" is a first. We've never seen anything quite like it. A metaphor for a world that's becoming faster and faster a huge melting pot where nothing truly melts. The have and the have not. New ghettos, new forms of life and we have to learn to live with it or, or what? Neill Blomkamp, the 30 year old director, is someone who's exploded into the film scene and I'm sure he'll stay for a long time to come. A commercial director with a refined artistic mind.

Worst RomCom ever!,"I attended a preview screening of District 9 last night, and I am in absolute awe of this film and its director Neill Blomkamp.Thanksfully, I knew relatively little about the story going into the film. I had a rough idea of the concept and had seen a few TV spots, but thankfully the film delivered so much more than I was led to expect.What I like most about the film is that it increasingly gains momentum throughout its runtime, starting out as a mockumentary (and thinly veiled social commentary), but then delves into more mainstream thriller territory, before culminating in some thoroughly entertaining action set pieces. If action is your thing, be sure to stick it out through to the latter half of the film. As I was leaving the cinema, I overheard many other patrons saying exactly that... ""I wasn't too sure for the first hour, but I'm glad I stayed"" (personally, I have never walked out of a film at the cinema).That is not to say that the first half is any less impressive. I am a big fan of realism in films such as this, and as such, I really enjoyed the documentary feel. I think the intention was for the entire film to be in the mockumentary style, but for me the style changes and takes on a more mainstream look (albeit hand-held)... which I think is important to know going in. There are also a few areas where it couldn't be believed that a documentary crew could still be filming (or even alive). But I think the film is much better for this, and definitely more memorable.If there is one thing that irks me about this film, its that the story moves at an incredible pace... particularly in the earlier scenes in the film, which feel rather rushed, and seemingly at odds with the realistic documentary feel it was going for. Things just seem to happen so quickly, leaving little time to digest the premise and characters. I would love to see a version of the movie that extends the first half to allow a greater look into the reality presented to us.SFX-wise, there are no complaints. There is the odd bit of artificial blurring on some alien movement, but overall we are presented with a very low-key, realistic CGI presentation that could teach Hollywood a thing or two.One other aspect that I must mention is the performance of the lead character. Seeing a film of this caliber that has no recognisable actors, with foreign (to an Aussie!) accents just adds to the authenticity... but Sharlto Copley (in his debut performance) is a revelation and one of the most memorable aspects of the movie.I cannot recommend this movie enough, and the wait until the weekend so I can see this film again is just too long!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Unlike Anything Before,"With some fascinating and wildly realistic worldbuilding, and some well given direction, District 9 is a modern day sci-fi classic that will not soon be forgotten. The film does have its fair share of problems from time to time, whether it is its struggle to find an appropriate pacing, burdening on cliches, or mimicking around plot holes in its story. However, District 9 offers some of the best realistic sci-fi films have had to offer in quite some time, with some splendid performances, mostly good CGI and a harsh but entertaining nature. Highest praise goes to Neill Blomkamp, whose vision for the films shines more than anything, with its gritty and sole picture being the backbone of the film entirely. The writing can vary from strange and complex, to weak and illogical, but it's shining moments are what sticks through the longest. The performances are all well given, although there isn't quite any standouts, as it just feels so lifelike, it's hard to quite pick what actor is truly giving the best work. In the end, District 9 is an unforeseen gem that is not to be missed, and not to be forgotten.

Take it for what it is district 9 is a actual masterpiece and I wish they would do a prequel or sequel . The director did elysium which was also good but didn't come close to d9.

a great film,"Short, it is a film who must see it. For so many reasons than it escapes of any explanation. It is a Sci. Fi. and an action film and it propose a touching story. But it has, as basic virtue, the science to present the near reality in the most inspired manner. That defines it as one of films who are , in same measure, bitter and gentle and impecable work. It is a pledge. Foor a lot of causes. But, more important, it is a simple story of an ordinary man changing everything. A film about noble courage. Almost, wise use of an old fashion recipe.

"You will not be disappointed, unless......",".....you believe the best of the genre is embodied in epic stories involving transformational encounters with an advanced (or otherwise terrifying) species who has a specific goal in mind with regard to the human race.The kind of movie where aliens are magnificently different than their human counterparts.This is not that kind of movie.If you believe, however, that the best science fiction is allegorical...that it is at its best when it reduces the close encounter to an intelligent and emotional story of what is ""alien"" in each of us, you won't be disappointed.Critics of District 9 do have their points: it does demand that you suspend disbelief and ""buy"" the storyline.....that you accept the alternative world created by the opening segment. And in demanding that, it does color some of that world with a broad brush that undeniably leaves those infamous ""plot holes"": though in fairness, many of them are simply the result of the immensity of the backstory, and will linger because the storyline works, and your imagination has been piqued.So you'll have to get passed the validity of the criticisms. But -hey- it's a movie, and all movies share them to some degree. The point being that the movie is not formulaic....if that's what you're looking for when you put down your money, then this movie is not for you.It's more challenging that most for that reason. Accept the challenge, and you will discover an intriguing and entertaining story, gritty in its realism, with a good blend of ""movie magic"" and subtle character motivations.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
We need more films like this.,"District 9 is a 2009 science fiction mockumentary film directed by Neill Blomkamp.

A Nice Analogy About Racism and Oppression,"An alien mothership hovers over South Africa, and millions of aliens, starving and weak, spill out. They are put into camps in District 9, a section of shacks that is poor and largely run by gang members. Weapons and food get traded on the black market. What is to be done? As I type this (January 2010), this film is ranked #102 of all time. It's a fine film, but really? Almost top 100 of all time? That seems a little fishy to me, and I suspect if I ever revise this review, it will drop to 200 or lower.Writer and director Neill Blomkamp has taken some good science fiction -- aliens, genetic manipulation, advanced weaponry -- and combined it with a subtle, or maybe not so subtle, message about racism and South African apartheid. While there is clearly a difference between aliens and people, is it that much different from the divide amongst races? After all, the prawns in this film clearly operate on at least our level.The apartheid analogy gets a bit muddled with the genetic aspect... I don't see white South Africans turning black, especially after ingesting fuel. But it's a story, and a well-written one at that, with no predecessors that come to mind. Blomkamp has really unleashed a unique piece of film here. Thank you, Peter Jackson, for producing this one.If you haven't seen it, I recommend you do. Science fiction fans will obviously enjoy it, but it goes beyond that. One friend of mine, who I would not suspect is a sci-fi fan, really loved it for the message of family. Even aliens have families in District 9. I would gladly watch this one again, though I'm still confused about the interspecies prostitution.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
This alien movie is one of a kind. It belongs undoubtedly to the best of its genre.,"''District 9'' is a unique South African movie consisting of a mix between mockumentary, action-alien movie and social commentary/allegory. The thing that impressed me the most here, (I wouldn't have really thought about that, being used to associate non-earthlings with spaceships), is: aliens in a slum/ghetto. I think it's a truly original element, or maybe the first successful story involving such a setting.The film is both really entertaining & funny in a dark way (or even atrocious when there is a baby alien scene towards the beginning) and at the same time the movie subtly encourages you to think, not only about the relations between people in South Africa, but generally about those who we consider different, ''alien'' from us and thus imposing a threat on us. It also possesses a certain dramatic aspect that arises from the humanity of Cristopher and his son (two characters who are ''prawns'' - a slur given by humans).I wonder if ''District 9'' was influenced by David Cronenberg's ''The Fly'', because there is one aspect of the movie that slightly resembles something else from the classic '86 movie, but I'm not going to spoil it here.In the end, the film gets a 9 out of 10 from me.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A breath of fresh air in a time of bloated sequels and rip-offs!,"Ever since Neill Blomkamp was lined to do the film version of the ""Halo"" video game, he's become a household name with the fanboys. But as we all know, that project stalled and Blomkamp is no longer on board as a director. After that happened, Peter Jackson gave Blomkamp $30 million to make whatever movie he wanted. Blomkamp made this film, and it is a stunning debut.Normally I despise remakes, but after viewing Blomkamp's short film, ""Alive in Joburg,"" which served as the inspiration for this movie, I can say that calling ""District 9"" a remake of the short film is about as untrue as it is unfair. Even saying that Blomkamp used the short film as a jumping off point is pushing it (a lot). ""District 9"" takes the idea and runs with it, not even remembering to pass ""Go"" and collect 200 dollars.South Africa, present day. A spaceship has been hovering over Johannesburg, South Africa, for the past 20 or so years. The aliens were brought down and nourished back to health, but people's apprehension with the new beings caused major clashes, and the visitors, known as ""prawns"" were moved into a slum called District 9. Today, the shady corporation Multi-National United has decided to move the prawns to District 10, and to make sure that it's handled legally, they enlist Wikus Van Der Merwe (Sharlto Copley) to oversee it. Suffice it to say, things don't go as planned.""District 9"" is not flawless, but it's so good that I'm more than willing to look the other way at any of its ""flaws."" But the best part of it is that it takes chances. In broad strokes, the story is familiar, but the details and execution are completely new.One of the best things that I liked is how Blomkamp portrays people reacting to the aliens. Everything that the people do in response to them is completely credible. I don't want to give anything away, but the way that the people ""acted"" in response to the coming of the prawns is so believable it's almost chilling. ""Interviews"" with people who worked with Wikus and were involved in the story enhance this effect.Meanwhile, we have Wikus guiding us through the story. Wikus is eager, but he's not the brightest bulb in the bunch. Sharlto Copley is excellent as Wikus. Copley does a great job playing a poster boy for MNU, but Wikus is also likable, and that's important.""District 9"" is a mixture of a million ideas all thrown together at once. Past movies have done this and sunk because of it, but ""District 9"" succeeds because they're competently explained and portrayed. A few technical things cause this to get an 8 instead of a 10 (for example, one scene is interesting, but it's out of place, and the film's big transition doesn't go very well), but it's still a highly recommendable film. And for once, the shaking camera is used effectively.Do I think that Blomkamp should direct ""Halo?"" While there's no question that he could do it, and make a great movie out of the game, I don't think he's the right man for the job. I don't think ""Halo"" would look good as a grainy documentary. But that's just me.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A very fun and unique sci-fi film,"I have been holding off on this movie for a long time now. Years as a matter of fact and I still don't know to this day why... I guess I just expected to be a boring mockumentary type film but it turned out to be really fun with some fun black humor here and there but managed to keep it serious at the same time which mixed up real good in my eyes.The characters: Christopher (the alien), the kid alien and Wikus Van De Merwe were brilliant. I liked the story of De Merwe especially and the evolution of his character. The story was great with the whole immigration thing which kinda resembles real life a bit. It was a interesting twist on the whole alien trope in movies and very unique. I am glad that I finally came around to ""District 9"". Definitely a recommended movie no matter if you love sci-fi or not.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Extraordinary Surprise,"I have to say in advance, that I didn't hear anything about this movie, there was no hype for me, I'm simply interested in good SciFi. D9 is in a way a SciFi Slumdog Millionaire; if you allow yourself being caught you are totally in. Some months ago I hated Cloverfield for making my head aching and boring me. I hated Star Trek for disappointing me with being more childish (and thereby being so seriously) than Star Wars. Now I love District 9 for surprising me with a good idea and a subversive view. SciFi is rare, because it's expensive. Good SciFi is one of the rarest things, because the massive amounts of money spent must flow back to the investors with profit, and they think, that only mainstream and infantile movies work in that way. D9 was cheap, compared to other top movies of the genre, and so the producer had not many risks to bear.So the author had the opportunity to use his plot to show us some of the uglier sides of us, by unmasking common accepted behavior, preoccupation, condemnation and greed as essential (and damnable) parts of our daily life.There is one key scene (for me) where Witus, the main character, describes how Alien fetuses are destroyed resp. burned with flamethrowers and make noises like popcorn during this process. It is obvious that those people don't think that the ""Shrimps"" are worthy beings, despite - or because - they live with them since more than two decades. In this moment you see how easy it is to treat somebody as sub-human.Another key scene is at the beginning, when they learn that the Aliens are poor and weak (and dumb) beings. After the first amazement there is no benefit from the encounter, no wonders are coming from them, they simply have to be fed. They are a burden and primarily useless. So there is no need to try to understand and treat them in an appropriate way ?But i don't want to over-interpret this movie. It's definitively not only for ""intelligent people"", but for people who are bored from predictable US mainstream SciFi.And yes, D9 is political incorrect. The Nigerians are shown like real Idiots who actually think, eating Aliens could make them mighty and powerful, even after this didn't work during the past 20 years. They are villains, cat food dealers like drug dealers, there is no positive aspect in their appearance. It's a cliché, and maybe the author worked up some personal reluctance. But the story needed a color equation for the badness of all those white guys.I admit that the part which is critical of society is not the real main part of the movie. The movie wants to suggest that, but the main part is the action shootout in the MNU center and the slums. Although this is a bit too long and too tension (= box office) oriented, it intensifies the impression of the rest of the movie.I for myself rated back from 10 to 9 because of the 90% happy end, according to my mom who always said ""good movie, bad ending"" ;-)",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Disappointing,"I had high expectations for this movie, and I've been looking forward to it for a long time, but I was a little disappointed once the credits started to roll.I'm glad to see that a movie like this even got made with a decent budget, a wide release, and good marketing. I'm thrilled that it came in first place at the box office on its opening weekend and is getting good press. Having grown up in the 90s, I miss the former place of prominence aliens had in the popular culture. Hopefully the financial success of this movie will encourage the studios to green light more films in the same genre.Overall, District 9 is creative and entertaining, but not as original or intelligent as I'd hoped. The trailers seemed to promise the film's main storyline would explore the societal impact of the aliens' arrival and the rich history that preceded the film's main action.But the story that emerges from its great premise is pretty standard. It hardly develops the aliens' history or psychology. What little development we do get is uninspired, incomplete, and self-contradictory. It also doesn't explore the cultural impact of their arrival with the kind of depth that I'd hoped it would.And none of the characters are particularly well-developed. Read a synopsis of the movie, and you'll have about as deep of an understanding of the main characters as you would if you'd have watched the whole film. Aside from a unique name and a slightly amusing quirkiness, the main character is relatively forgettable.My other main criticism is that the narrative isn't as cohesive as I would've preferred. The story jumps from one scene to the next with little or no effort to establish the setting or the purpose of the action. It all ends up feeling less deliberate and focused than it ought to, and I couldn't shake the feeling that there was something essential missing from the mix. The faux-documentary style seemed arbitrary and without a clear purpose. I wanted to be able to forget that this was the director's feature film debut, but this thought kept popping into my head again and again.District 9 does have a great premise, and its presentation is pretty solid. The first few minutes of the film do an excellent job of making this fictional world feel believable and realistic. But since the filmmakers did an excellent job in some departments, it makes the film's shortcomings in certain crucial areas that much harder to forgive.Overall, it's a worthwhile use of two hours' time and the price of admission, and it's certainly more deserving of success than most other films currently in theaters. However, it's not the intelligent, insightful, engaging, allegorical story I'd hoped it would be. Instead, it comes off as an ambitious misfire: an entertaining-but-simple story with a handful of interesting ideas.Hopefully, though, District 9's critical and commercial success will help pave the way for a resurgence of well-funded, high-concept sci-fi films (especially alien invasion ones).",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Gritty, real, and very entertaining.","I have never been a huge supporter of South African based movies (this one written & directed by Neill Blomkamp) as I tend to find them a bit cheesy, but this movie was definitely the exception to the rule. Initially, the first 5 to 10 minutes were a bit difficult as my Hollywood brainwashed brain, battled to get past the thick ""Souf Afrikan"" accents and the really gritty & realistic local setting. But my efforts were well rewarded with a fine performance from a truly brilliant cast, and a direction equivalent to even better than what Hollywood can churn out. Neill Blomkamp can a be very, very proud man.At it's core, I would classify District 9 as a Science Fiction Action/Drama. And without spoiling to much, the movie takes place in a slum in Johannesburg, where a group of aliens (often referred to as prawns!) have been segregated from the rest of the populous after their mother ship breaks down and leaves them stranded on earth. 20 years later the story picks up where Wikus vd Merwe, a field agent for the MSU, is tasked with relocating the aliens to a ""better"" place - 200km's away from Joburg - where they can live in peace and without fear of conflict, confrontation and intimidation by the rather hostile locals. Thats the basic premise, however there is far more to the story than that and I definitely am not going to spoil it.Wikus vd Merwe, the main protagonist, was brilliantly played by Sharlto Copely. Really, I was most impressed. His character was rich and complex and was played out with sincerity and passion. However, just when you think you have him all figured out, he goes and says (or does) something that changes your perception of him altogether as he alters his behaviored pattern based on the current situation. This depth in character is not often seen in movies, and came as a welcome surprise. Hats off to Mr. Blomkamp for focusing on this through his filming and writing.Visually, the movie is a real treat as well. The setting is gritty, grimy & dirty and really showcased slum life realistically. The special effects present was also exceptional but never over used. The first part (or half?) of the movie was done in the style of a documentary, with interviews and news pieces glued together to enable the viewer to catch up on what has transpired, and with some liberal use of the ""shaky cam"" style. This really adds to the realism but is only prevalent in the first half as the second half tends to settle down on a more stable style of filming.The movie has a 16 age restriction, and justly so. There is plenty of swearing, and enough gory splats that i found myself going ""yuck"" on one or two occasions. So you have been warned. But if you can handle this kind of thing, you are in for a treat as it's never really gratuitous, but justified most of the time because of the reality that the movie portrays.After leaving the movie, I was still chewing over the whole concept which clearly indicates this is not the kind of in-one-ear-out-the-other kind of movie. I wouldn't go as far as to say its a thinking man's science fiction, but it definitely does leave some food for thought. Another great thing is that you don't have to be a Science Fiction fan to enjoy it, as my wife who is more into drama's, thoroughly enjoyed as well (she gave it a 10!).So does it deserve your money for a ticket? Most definitely yes. Niell Blomkamp hit a home run with this movie, and we need to show our support. Go out and see it as soon as you can. I give it a strong 9.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
That'll teach me to only read the first 2 pages of reviews on IMDb,"After seeing this movie last night I had originally intended to write a long review stating just how overrated this movie is and list the gazzilion things wrong with it that I saw. However, after reading user comments for the last hour I see other people have beat me to the punch.This movie is disturbingly overrated. I'm not saying it's bad, it isn't. In fact, its kinda cool on many levels and I would be more than willing to see it again. What I am saying is that I believe we have moved into a time where you can flood the internet with so many false reviews that not only will people, but film critics (huge accusation I know)start to believe it. Remember what Goebbels taught us....repeat a lie enough...etc.The last 10 minutes of this movie is a how-to on how to set-up a film for an obvious sequel.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Surprisingly overrated,"District 9 is a buddy movie about a human and a space alien. The human has prejudices against space aliens, which he has to overcome, and then they become best of friends. The human is a hysterical egocentric asshole in most of the movie. This makes it a bit hard to relate to him. The space alien, on the other hand, has no personality whatsoever.The action? There is a lot of high-tech weapons. And people are shooting at each other. I find it boring, but some might like it. Some reviewers has criticized the movie for having too much gore. Which should be a good thing, right? I truly love gore, but the CGI blood in this movie is so uninspired that it hurts. Toribash clips on youtube have higher production value.I don't mind that a story is predictable and linear. Tim Burtons movies are great, despite their uninspired story lines. However, District 9 has nothing to distract your attention from the lack of story.So, this is a scifi-action-gore-buddy-movie, with main characters you don't care about, a stupid story line and boring action sequences.Is that it?No. They also tries to do social commentary! Not that there's anything wrong with movies about serious subjects. But when I want to deal with heavy stuff like apartheid or refugee camps, I don't want it to be in a cheap action flick.At one point, the wife of the protagonist accuse him of having had sexual relations with a space alien! He denies it, arguing that they are far too disgusting for that.One would assume that the space aliens would feel the same way about humans: That the humans would be too far from the space alien norm to be a likely lay. Not so. The space aliens are doing the nasty with human prostitutes. No, there's no footage. It sounds quite much like ""Black Men are after our Women 2.0""This would be cool in a Troma movie. But not in a movie that aims for social commentary.Now to the positive side:1) I love 'body horror' transformations. 2) The movie has lots of plot holes, and counting them would make watching it slightly interesting. 3) The space aliens are addicted to cat food!",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

A New Species of Sci Fi,"Aliens come to Earth. Which means they're here to attack and destroy us right? Usually, that's the case. We've seen it in countless film, like Independence Day, Alien Vs Predator, and even Mars Attacks. However, Peter Jackson and first time director Neil Blomkamp take us in a different direction with their film District 9. Blomkamp avoids all the alien movie clichés, including an all star cast and a major American city.Instead of a hostile alien species, the aliens in District 9 are leaderless drones who make an emergency landing over the city of Johannesburg, South Africa (rather than New York or LA). The aliens are malnourished and leaderless, so the South African government places them in District 9, which quickly becomes a slum crawling with aliens and South African gangsters who demand to learn how to use the aliens' supercool weapons. The aliens begin causing trouble within the city, sparking a relocation effort led by the evil MNU (Multi National United) Corporation. All MNU really cares about is learning how the alien weapons work, much like the gangsters. However, neither side has learned anything.Leading the eviction cause is Wikus van der Merwe (Sharlto Copley), a enthusiastic MNU agent who passes through District 9 with glee, happily evicting the aliens (who will do anything for a can of cat food) and burning down houses with their unborn young inside. The eviction sequences are what JJ Abram's Cloverfield should've been. Copley ad-libbed all his lines during the ""documentary"" sequence of the film, and he makes feel as if we're watching an actual documentary. Wikus' world goes to hell, however, when he sprays himself with some alien liquid. On the plus (or minus, depending on how you look at it) side, he can operate the supercool alien weapons. He becomes the most wanted man in the world, and hides with a friendly alien (and the alien's cute son) in District 9.It's refreshing to see a new sci fi flick after so many clichéd failures (the recent Star Wars Episodes I and II). A native South African, Blomcamp casts mainly his fellow countrymen into his film. Copley, who helped Blomkamp create Alive in Joburg, the short film D9 is based off of, is destined to be a star some day. It's also good to see a sci fi movie set in another major city in another country. And, finally, the aliens are not the bad guys in the film. As lame as it sounds, District 9 may make you embarrassed to be a human.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Phenomenally astonishing,"This film is a film about a man's struggle to survive after being infected by an alien substance.""District 9"" is phenomenally astonishing, even to a person who does not like science fiction films. The perspective of the viewers from a camera or from the news conveys the sense of urgency and excitement, as if I am getting the scenes as soon as it happens. The quick pacing also heightens the sense of urgency and thrill. The amazing story kept me engrossed and captivated by the last one hour of the movie. Computer animations are so perfectly real. Acting is excellent by Sharlto Copley. He brings his character to life, effectively showing his pain, scare and determination to survive. I am amazed by ""District 9"", and I strongly recommend it to anyone.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A different take,"In most alien invasion films, the aliens are often seen as hostile, senseless beings out to destroy mankind. Conversely, this film brings the age old concept in a different light, showing that sometimes things aren't so black and white. With the film drawing parallels to our actual world, it stands to show some of the issues faced by us in a way that least offends and provide the first step for change: Knowledge of the issues.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A very unique Sci-Fi movie.,"What I expected from DISTRICT 9 was miles off, the film painted an interesting picture of aliens that have not invaded the U.S as you might expect but have invaded the city of Johannesburg in South Africa and have taken refuge in the city's slums.The film was different in terms of the setting, where instead of another major American city we have the capital of South Africa, where you get a completely different culture of people that are your typical South African and that along with the setting is what sets this film way apart from other Sci-Fi films.Being a resident of South Africa myself and I'm also familiar with a lot of South African films and actors, I have never seen any of the actors in this film before but they give stellar performances throughout.However, I have spoken to people that didn't like this film and I've spoken to people that did like it, which almost makes it difficult for me to recommend to others, I did like the film of course but my expectations were different, but overall I thought the direction was great the story was also great as well as the acting and the action scenes were thoroughly entertaining but if I was to recommend it I would say lower your expectations because this is the kind of film that will get mixed reactions, so it will be best to watch it with an open mind.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

The movie has a lot of different elements that make it work. I think the way Peter Jackson messes with the idea of empathy is genius. I fought with myself through the movie, trying to decide what emotions to feel--or what emotions were ""right"" to feel. This movie messes with you in a very powerful way.

"Political sci-fi, how often do you see that?","Watched it for a second time after a couple of years and it's one I'll rewatch a few times more. Everything about this film is deeply satisfying if you have a political mind but also like a healthy dollop of action, splatter and great storytelling with your politics and sociology.Don't believe the occasional poor reviews, they're written by idiots who were probably hoping for yet another visually spectacular but morally vacuous comic book Hollywood epic. District 9 is genuinely intelligent, thought-provoking sci-fi as all the very best sci-fi is. And for a low budget the CGI and action scenes are simply fantastic. Yes it's pretty pottymouthed and very violent but given the storyline, it has to be. If you like your violence sanitised, look elsewhere. This is red in tooth and claw and all the better for it.Basically it's a balls to the wall and very exciting action film with the thoughtfulness of a Tarkovsky, the visual audacity of a Cameron, the weirdness of a Lynch or Carpenter and the emotional and intellectual honesty of a Kieslowski.

Bean Encounters,"This was on the positive side of science fiction for me, if only because not everything was extreme. There was no flawless babe, no effortless superhero nonsense. It was obvious that there were efforts to have some distinction.But we are still stuck with your run of the mill evil megaweapons corporation with secret labs and thoroughly compliant technicians. An alien society that has superior technology but all of which looks like something we already have or have ""invented"" for our prior movies. A set of social and human commentaries that I encountered in pulps fifty years ago. And gosh, we must, must, must have anthropomorphic aliens, right? With nerdy, precocious kids?The narrative stance was strange. It is cast in the form of an investigative journalism report about two years after the events. Much of it is clearly meant to be read as found or stolen footage from surveillance cameras. Some of the scenes which clearly cannot be, are still treated as if they were with annotations. Interwoven with this is conventional observation, though often with human or creature blood spattered on ""lenses."" I assumed that with Jackson's sponsorship, WETA would do its most amazing stuff. They did not. The compositing and creature animation is fine, but that WETA ethic of advanced spatial camera movement is gone.Perhaps it was just too hard with all the production players. That's the usual barrier. But it may also have been the knowledge that too novel a camera would have messed with the faux documentary feel.So we are left with holding tight to a few of the amplified strokes. The main character is true enough, ordinary and klutzy in a way that works. It would have been better for me if we had been given more than the trivial connections he has with his environment. The wife, father in law, coworkers are stereotypes albeit with a South Africa twist. The technology is highlighted, but never explored. There is a balance among mystery, novelty and comprehension that ""Alien"" got so right they defined that balance. A new balance is not justified here and I am left unsatisfied.In particular: the heads up computer displays were pretty cool animations. But here was the place where we could have had some hints of organization, some coherence. This, I believe, if done well could have spawned a subculture of fans, like those who pore over plans of the Enterprise, or who map plot implications of Memento. What we get is what we have seen before and roughly promised from lumbering technology companies like MNU.So like the hero, it is good enough, but it leaves us on Earth while the interesting promise sails away.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

An extraterrestrial population is confined and  forced to live in  concentration camp,"This spectacular science fiction movie begins in 1982, when appears a large aircraft bearing excessive alien population , nicknamed ""The Prawns,"" flying over Johannesburg, South Africa . Twenty-eight years later, the initial mirth welcome by the human population has been forgotten and they are housed in a squalorous government camp. The concentration camp where the extraterrestrial were located has deteriorated into a militarized ghetto called District 9, where they are confined and exploited in dirty slums by the Nigerians who negotiate with them . A great black market is set up between the aliens and a group of Nigerians commanded by Mumbo, a paralyzed warlord . In 2010, the giant corporation, Multi-National United, is hired to forcibly evict the refugee camp with recently appointed chief named Wikus van Der Merwe (Sharlto Copley) in charge of the operation. In this mission , Wikus is contaminated to a rare alien liquid and must rely on the only help of a father Prawn and his son .The picture deals with the survival of an alien specie ,the basic issue is the humanity fighting an extraordinary event like is a pacific invasion and it opens with a documentary-style series of interviews that introduce the tale . The yarn is developed in the ordinary world, out of Pentagon and White House , as it refers about issues that didn't include : none famous buildings , no Manhattan shots , neither generals reunited on a map with miniature figures . It is proceeded in documentary style with camera over shoulders and using Steadycam . The casting is unknown but efficient with special mention to main starring Sharlto Copley who subsequently would play to Murdock in the recent version of ¨A team¨ . The motion picture is spectacular but also has a thought-provoking story in which there is a merciless criticism to exploitation . It's an awesome treatment of the science fiction's classic theme about Alien invasion but from another point of view realizing fulfilment justice to the nightmare observations of a massive super-population , being his direction stylish and well paced . Overwhelming and impressive visual effects and FX of Aliens and machines are made by Weta Digital that won deservedly Academy Award . This Sci-fi flick is well directed buy Neill Blomkamp in his first movie. However , being his producer Peter Jackson with his companies Weta Workshorp and Weta Digital that steal the show by means of the breathtaking visual effects, creatures , makeup , Animatrix design make the film results to be a groundbreaking spectacle.

Still a masterpiece!,"Won't say more about the movie than it's still to this day still a unique movie that is wonderfully made.When reading the negative reviews though I guess some people don't know how life or humanity works.

Check different parts of the world today and you'll see the same behavior in humans where they're poor, exploited and suppressed. When treated like an animal sometimes that's what you become.Second I see is the questions why would a race with superior technology not try to just conquer earth?They came starved. Nothing of their history is really explained. They just might not WANT to conquer? They can themselves have escaped a tyrant?But the main problem here is peoples lack of understanding the difference in better technology and the difference between million and billion.They are million(s) aliens with a better technology against billions humans with with technology that still would have wiped them. AND even if they'd win, they would have been decimated.They just not be into ""war"" as much as humans and not see conquering as a choice.Why are people in countries with dictators that don't care about lives not just standing up and remove the dictator? I mean, they could. No leader could stand against a whole country. But they don't. Ask yourself why, read up on phsychology and you just might understand how this movie is rated as high as it is.People question the aliens for being both smart and acting like ""stupid animals"". Just checking the different parts of the world would give an answer to how realistic this really is.Check countries in some kind of war right now. (not gonna give you any names) If you check a country and you think ""They behave like animals and they're so dumb"" or whatever. Congratulations! I can assure you those countries have educated doctors and every other ""smart and educated"" eductaion you can think of, but when broken down that doesn't show.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Could have been better,"Like many other sci-fi films before, District 9 starts with a fascinating premise and great story and concept, that unfortunately are only enough to hold about thirty or forty minutes of film. A sci-fi mockumentary is a great idea and for the first half hour it holds great. Then, sadly, District 9 turns into a pretty standard sci-fi/action affair with a pretty standard story arc about an anti-hero who starts out as a villain, then learns the error of his ways and goes through a process of redemption. Really not much to write home about. Still - the story is more original than that of Avatar, and even the action scenes are more well-paced. It's just a shame that it could have been a great film and instead it's just okay.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A masterpeace,"This movie is so original and nice, that I am not going to take points off for some over the top action sequences that take a bit from its genre and concept cutting nature. Like all sci fi master-peaces, this movie poses quite a few questions, gives us new perspective, that has not been explored enough if at all. And the frightening comments about aliens are even better when you learn that they were genuine, made about the human aliens i.e. refugees. But there is much more going on. This is a must see movie and a defining movie of the 21st century sci fi genre.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
a ruthless satire and a (mostly) kick-ass blockbuster,"District 9 doesn't f*** around, mostly. It's a harsh look at a harsh people, mainly us. It asks a question posed countless times before: what would happen if ""they"" came ""here"" and how would we respond and they act. By the end of District 9, a movie where we see an alien ship stalled over Johannesburg and the million or so ""prawn"" aliens taken and put into a slum of the movie's title, you'll wonder deeply about our own ethical state of being. You might wonder also why Neill Blomkamp, the director (first time feature by the way), didn't show more of the aliens, at least until the second half of the film. This is intentional on his part because it's about drawing specific parallels in how human beings will look at a culture that is the ""other"", and I do mean ""other"".And it doesn't have to be a parallel specifically to South Africa and the Apartheid, though that comparison can certainly be made if one seeks to. What about immigration in America, or even going back to how the US treated Indians? Or how about looking in the movie at the whole vicious cycle of taking a displaced people (without their leaders, by the way, which is why the ""prawns"" are so despondent to do anything on their stranded ship) who are put into a ghetto and basically put there to eventually be just 'eh, whatever, they can go somewhere else, they can die for all I care.' That the humans just shuffle the aliens around- as early on in the eviction scenes with Wilkus Van Der Merwe- lack understanding of them, and it's through these humans (and sometimes through a documentary-lens perspective) we have our point of view. That and, you know, the aliens just want to go home and all of that.It gives us the story of Mr. Van Der Merwe, a bureaucrat at the MNU, the government group that oversees alien affairs in District 9 and after 20 years makes the decision to do a mass eviction to what is an even more cramped quarter a few miles away. But Van Der Merwe (a very common name in South Africa I'm told) gets infected by some spray in a can that one of the aliens named ""Christopher"" has been using for some special project, and soon poor Wilkus becomes the first human to be fused with alien DNA, growing fingers that can also operate the firearms the aliens brought and that no humans can really operate. A first-time movie actor Sharlto Copley is also revealed to us by Blomkamp in a fantastic performance for any actor; what my friend compared to Michael Scott from the Office turning into Cronenberg's Fly.Blomkamp said that originally the film was going to have a final third that would have been ""more cerebral"" as opposed to the shoot-em-up that is now in the film. I'm not sure who will agree, but considering that he took the popcorn movie direction, it's not at all a bad course to have taken given the results. Blomkamp isn't the best action direction ever, but he does know something important with this type of story (and having Peter Jackson as producer doesn't hurt and only helps in this regard): visual effects matter. The aliens and their whole world, so to speak, that is brought to Earth looks wholly believable, and we're even given that contradiction of human eyes and a disgusting face (save for the child prawn) that makes it hard to really accept them as something living and thinking but they are. And the ship and its things look much better than other things in terms of crazy-CGI technology from this summer. Just compare, if you will, to last week's GI Joe and get a kick in the nuts as to what can be possible in stunning visual effects. It's here, really.I can't say District 9 is perfect or even a great movie. It's hard to follow entirely with seeing the humans as being three-dimensional since they're either seen as military hard-heads or one-sided bureaucrats... and, of course, Wilkus the only human who has a transformation over the course of the film from mouse to man-mouse. But what intrigues is intriguing, and the satire is wicked-hot, much like a Romero film. We see an ugly side to nature, and maybe a sliver of hope, but mostly District 9 digs into us to make us ask what we think and feel about these creatures from another world. Would we do the same? Maybe we already have to our own fellow species? 8.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
District 9,"In recent times, an original idea for a science-fiction movie is a rare thing. With little more than the endless rehashes of the classics and outrageous, over-elaborate nature-docs courtesy of M. Night Shyamalan to quieten our inner geek in 2008, it seemed the genre could be beginning to die out, leaving the comic-book hero sub-genre to hit its stride and take the helm for a while. However, with the throwback to classic sci-fi in the form of Moon, a brand new Star Trek movie, and the success of District 9 having since emerged, 2009 looks set to see an unprecedented resurgence in the genre.In 1982, an alien spaceship arrived over Johannesberg, bringing one million alien lifeforms to earth with it. Leaderless and malnourished, the aliens were initially offered asylum, but were quickly overpowered and crowded into District 9, a segregated and highly-policed slum. After receiving public pressure, the Multi-National United Corporation are forced to relocate the aliens – dubbed 'prawns' due to their similar appearance – to a new camp further afield and we follow Wikus (Sharlto Copley) as he enters the town to hand out eviction notices. After encountering a mysterious black liquid in one of the shacks, he discovers his superiors' desire to examine him for use of alien technology and is forced to become a fugitive, befriending prawn Christopher Johnson along the way.At first glance, District 9 is a straight-forward man on the run film, an updated version of North by Northwest or a hybrid form of Alien Nation/The Fly. On closer inspection however, it attempts to form an allegory for the events of 1970s Africa, combining the events of apartheid with an otherworldly spin for a modern western audience. When the visuals are good, they are outstanding. The state of the art special effects are simply beautiful, effortlessly merging the real with the unreal, and rooting the story within a world that will seem as real to a post-reality TV audience as anything you'll see in a documentary; posing the unsettling idea that this could all too likely happen. Its unique visual style is fast-paced and exciting, taking us along for the ride and delicately crafting every scene to enhance the story. Protagonist Wikus is a wonderful concoction of flawed personality and skewed moral judgement, with a driving force of panic and desperation still managing to capture the audience along with him.While the film achieves in many areas, the first time director's success seems hit and miss at times. An engrossing documentary set-up introduces the film, only to be abandoned and picked up at various points, creating a jarring effect and hence losing a great sense of the realism it so painstakingly strives for. Thrilling, thought-provoking and oh so much fun, District 9 is nonetheless destined to become a sci-fi cult classic and, judging by Blomkamp's recent comments, a long and successful franchise. Although a flawed film in many ways, its sheer ambition cannot be faulted and the director seems to be one to watch in the future. The game has changed, playing with our expectations in an unwavering dedication to real world issues, and leaving us with the feeling that, in times of panic in the face of the unknown, we may just revert back to the mistakes of our past.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A film that never reached its potential,"I am going to have to disagree with the rave reviews that I have been reading. The first twenty minutes of the film, seen largely though the eyes of the media coverage, sets up something wonderfully original. It is the story of first contact that happened by accident, leaving the human world, particularly Johannesburg, faced with a humanitarian crisis. It shows corporations taking control of the shelters for the Alien populations and exploiting them, it shows the conflict that comes from different cultures clashing and it shows how callus humanity can be. Then there is a twist early in the film and from that point forward the film is about showing the audience one futuristic way of killing people after another that does include a friendship between a human and an alien but is nothing we haven't seen before. From this point onwards almost every crossroad where the story could either get lost in a Hitchcockien riddle surrounded by suspense or explode a person with a gun so that blood hits the camera, it takes option two. Although it does come to a worthy conclusion I can't help but feel that there were forty-five minute to an hour of killing people with lightning guns and other futuristic weapons, while awesome in an overly gritty kind of way, could have been better spent on the promised, ""Many secrets in District Nine,"" while still providing a violent, action packed thrill for the audience.The film is very realistic until you look closely at certain things. I will give one example: cat food is like drugs to the aliens. While this is a funny scene there is nothing in cat food that isn't someplace else and the chemical components of cat foods very as much as from one cat food to another as from cat food to dog food but dog food is not dealt like drugs. The fact that I was thinking about the chemical components of cat food during this film says that there is something a little wrong with me, but it also says something about the film.On a positive note both the rookie director and the rookie star did phenomenal jobs for their first time out and we should all be watching to see where they go from here. The story of the film got lost in mostly senseless violence but Blomkamp's direction, coupled with great production values, keeps the film interesting. It is a great conversation starter and worth a viewing if you don't mind gore but is not at the level of greatness it has been proscribed.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Typically absurd,"This film can be used as a primer on how to produce typically bad contemporary movies.First, take a script from an old TV show (in this case, episodes from The Outer Limits) and fancy it up a little to fill out 2 hours. Next, add a few million dollars of state of the art special effects. Film much of the story using a hand-held camera, and be sure to bounce and jerk it around so everything gets really confusing. Lastly, produce an interesting trailer that misleads audiences into thinking this might be a half way intelligent film.This is a typically absurd modern movie, just as bad as all the rest that have been produced for the short attention set. Any attempt at a meaningful story degenerates into explosions, robots, and machine gun fire. An absolute waste of time.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

"District 9: Prawns, Guns, and Broken Hearts","In District 9, aliens don't show up ready to conquer-they land as galactic hobos. These poor, lost prawns, instead of torching everything à la Independence Day, end up squatting in a massive, open-air slum. If you've ever seen campers set up in the wrong place, imagine the alien version with a giant ""Welcome to Earth, please stay away from humans"" sign. The movie hits you hard from the start, making you think: what if these aliens were just interstellar refugees looking for a peaceful spot?Then there's Wikus, the most random hero in sci-fi history. He's a low-level bureaucrat, the kind of guy who reminds you of your tax-collecting cousin, only here, he ends up turning into an alien because of a careless mistake. Yep, you read that right: he starts mutating into a giant prawn. From that point on, chaos reigns. Wikus becomes the most wanted fugitive, and you realize he's kind of like Spider-Man, but without the cool powers-just a dude getting dragged into a nightmare, turning into an alien hybrid who no longer knows where he belongs. It's a mix of The Fly and E. T. on LSD.Blomkamp hits you with a solid dose of social commentary, especially through the MNU (Multi-National United), the corporation treating aliens like sacks of potatoes. The humans? As trustworthy as a Bond villain. Money, power, and alien tech-that's all they care about. The film makes it crystal clear: when faced with the unknown, humans only look out for number one, even if it means sacrificing extraterrestrial lives. The prawns didn't ask for this, but as always, humans prove they can be impressively stupid.You've seen blockbusters, you've seen battles, but Blomkamp takes it to another level. The final act of District 9 is an all-out orgy of violence: exosuits smashing everything, aliens rising up, and Wikus fighting for his life. And yet, under all that action, the film has heart. The relationship between Wikus and Christopher (yep, a prawn with a surprisingly human name) turns out to be genuinely moving. By the end, you might even shed a tear for these mistreated aliens. It's like Call of Duty meets Schindler's List... minus the black and white, but with prawns.Blomkamp nailed the formula: shoot the first half like a gritty docu-style report, something out of Envoyé Spécial, then shift into full-blown action. The transition is jarring, but it works. It shows you that horror is both human and alien. And the special effects? Sure, they've aged a bit, but back in the day, they were groundbreaking. They hit your eyeballs like an old-school Doom playthrough.District 9 isn't just about aliens getting wrecked. It's a sharp critique of humanity's darker sides, but without turning into a boring philosophy lecture. Blomkamp manages to hit you with a visual gut punch while making you reflect on human nature. It's one of the best sci-fi films where prawns aren't just something you dip in mayo, but victims of a broken system.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Not as insightful or intelligent as some claim but makes for an entertaining summer blockbuster,"There is a tendency for critics to do things to extremes. If you watch enough films you will find that, like most things, there is a massive quality bell-curve with the vast majority falling into the middle ""it was OK"" section of that curve. When big blockbuster films shift one way or the other in that spectrum critics take the opportunity to put the boot into it or lavish it with praise depending on which side it is on, making it seem like it is further to the end of the scale than it is. This should be kept in mind when coming to District 9 because while it is a very good film indeed, it is still a blockbuster sci-fi with all the action, plot holes and noise that they come with.It is built on an interesting idea though, with political parallels and a setting that is for once not a major US city with landmarks and it does make it more intriguing and interesting than the obvious comparison of the summer which is the pointless Transformers 2. However this is not the same as saying it is as insightful or intelligent as some have claimed. Like the short film that I watched a few years ago, the metaphor is not really worked with as a subject but rather used as a base. There is nothing wrong with this but let's not pretend that the film is this wonderfully clever allegory that makes for the most intelligent subtext and discussion that we have ever seen – it most certainly does not.What it does do though is provide more in the way of involvement in the focused story that makes up the film. This is the story of Wikus joining with one of the Prawns to try to save himself and, along the way, seeing them on a moral level for the first time. It is not earth-shatteringly insightful but it is smart and it makes of a good base for a thriller/action plot that delivers for everyone. Amazingly made for $30 million this film has a great look and everything looks ""real"" like it is really in the shot - unlike the technically impressive effects of Transformers. Like Empire Magazine said, Michael Bay has dreams that cost more than $30million! There isn't really a bit ""money shot"" here and indeed it is easy not to be impressed by the effects simply because they don't feel like CGI in the way too many action films these days impress technically but don't grip. It is surprisingly graphic for the rating but it is not unpleasantly violent because the characters are engaging enough and the action thrilling enough for you to be carried along rather than focus on the gore.The film is delivered in a range of ways. It starts out as a documentary looking back but then starts to throw in dramatic scenes where no camera would have been there, before giving up on the idea and going dramatic with only bits of news footage etc thrown in to provide another camera angle and add to the realism of the scene (the action sequences at the end). This is not as jarring as some would suggest and, while it does feel a bit odd, it does mostly work because I don't think it has to be ""one thing"" throughout the film. What works particularly well are the performances – or rather the lead one. Copley is not an actor but yet he is able to improvise a character that is convincing as a dorky bureaucrat and as a man fighting for survival. He isn't dropping one-liners and he doesn't have a total change from his ""anti-prawn"" views during the majority of the film but yet he feels very real and not like someone giving a good performance. Likewise the Prawns feel real on the screen and the effects are more than good enough to allow convincing interaction with the human actors and also make them be characters rather than effects. This doesn't extend much further than that though and the head of MNU, the head mercenary and the head gangster are all fairly obvious pantomime villains – although to be fair this is what is required of them and they produce the thriller aspect. Speaking of the gangsters I will say that, while not a massive problem, it is a shame that Nigerians are portrayed 100% as they are in this film – it would have been just as easy to have a criminal gang in the role of criminal gang, there is no narrative reason for them being Nigerian in particular.District 9 is a great summer blockbuster. Like the short film it builds on a base of an interesting idea to deliver effects and thrills that are amazing considering the (comparative) shoestring budget. It isn't as smart or as insightful as some have said but the film never claims to be and it is just the critics and those expecting something that isn't there that have said this. Engaging and thrilling with an engagingly interesting idea at its core, this is well worth seeing and I hope that the sequel will be as good (which will surely happen as the numbers more than make sense – which is normally all that matters).",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Good first half, terrible conclusion","""District 9"" was one of the ten nominated movies for best picture in the last Oscar. Produced by Peter Jackson (director of the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy) and directed by the out comer Neill Blomkamp, the movie got a lot of good reviews and became the most surprising film of the season, not only in USA, but also in Brazil.The plot of the film is very interesting: an alien starship stops over Johannesburg, South African capital. Instead of attacking the humans or trying to colonize Earth, the aliens are moved by humans to a district (named ""nine""), which is protected from human invasions. Global leaders decide to invest money and time in taking care of the aliens, what causes diplomatic problems. The district expands to a slum as chaotic as some of Rio De Janeiro's slums. Because of that, the humans decide to move the aliens to a new district (named ""ten""), away from the urban centers.The special effects of ""District 9"" are stunning, specially when we consider the cost of production (US$ 30 million). The aliens never seem full or unbelievable and the have their own developed language. The first part of the film is very exciting because the director decides to tell the story in a documentary form. Besides, there's not an obvious chronological order, which makes the spectator think and try to understand/predict what's coming next. The sound editing is brilliant, mixing the aliens' voice and the sounds of their weapons with the dialogs and a sad soundtrack.However, the second half is disappointing. The film follows the main character in his survival journey, becoming an ordinary and predictable action movie. The discussions that the district 9 itself could make are overlooked by a boring character and his adventure - that is sometimes over-exaggerated, even dealing with a sci-fi movie.To sum up, ""District 9"" could be much better if the story had taken the intelligent way and not the standardized one. In spite of it, I recommend it to sci-fi fans, specially because of the form the aliens are shown (not only visually, but also psychologically).",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Good but disappointing,"I had read many of the critics reviews prior to seeing this. My expectations were set very high based on that. I was expecting a blade runner, the thing, pick a sci-fi classic, and it was supposed to rank with those. Unfortunately, this didn't quite make it in my mind. It was a good movie. The lead actor did a very good job. The CGI and special effects were excellent, and the story line was overall good. But for some reason, the one thing that the movie failed to do was to get me emotionally involved. I don't know why. It could have been the format of the film which had a lot of news clip type coverage. Heck, Starship Troopers had that but it was very good in a quirky way. I'm just having a hard time putting my finger on it. I also had trouble suspending disbelief at times and thought that parts of the movie were too implausible to buy into. I know a lot of people have raved about it. This may just be a case of some people not liking vanilla ice cream. I wouldn't discourage someone from seeing it.

The Best Film of 2009,"A not-so-subtle science fiction parable on South African apartheid infusing stranded aliens known as the derogatory ""prawns"" trying to get home. I'm no fan of science fiction and I do not think I'd call the genre beautiful, but District 9 defies the genre in that way. It embodies horror, comedy, drama, and romance under this science fiction saga.Blomkamp crafts a brilliant story and manipulates its viewer throughout the film. At first, these prawns look like animals and are almost revolting to look at. Yet, at the end of the film they become human, both in their actions and in their physical appearance. No longer do they look repulsive at sight. Furthermore, while the apartheid theme is not subtle at all, the viewer still realizes the horror of the movement.The journey, presented wonderfully as a documentary, of Wikus Van de Merwe, our main character, is though provoking and thrilling (and Copely portrays his struggle perfectly).

Interesting and intense.,"It is not as good as a masterpiece as what others have said and definitely not a bad movie as some die-hard sci-fi fans said. It is good but not a masterpiece, it manages to keep you engage to the screen with its raw intensity and realistic feel. I was afraid that it will become Cloverfield, with its shaky hand-held camera. But I was proved wrong. This is far more interesting and intense than Cloverfield. This has different views of different characters unlike Cloverfield-it is filmed with only one hand-held video camera.The story: Humans disrespect the new aliens that came to Earth. The aliens live in slums in South Africa. The aliens have emotions, their faces express their emotions. The acting is natural and it adds to the overall realistic feeling in this adventure movie. The adventure may not be that unique but the raw intensity will keep you on the seat and makes it more watchable. The effects are good, better than Dragonball Evolution with a budget of 45 million.Overall: Though it may not be an unique adventure, it is an unique experience. Those who want an unique experience and raw intensity, this is worth the money.

A stretched short film,"I had very high expectations for District 9, but sadly it's just one of those films that have a very small story to tell and everything else is filled with special effects and long action scenes. It's a pity, because the story itself had immense potential - aliens stranded on Earth and forced to live in slum-like concentration camps, human ignorance, violence, etc. Sadly, the story never gets more complex than that - pretty much the entire plot line, except the ending, is told in the trailer. The film has so many plot holes, that you eventually get used to not asking questions. I'm disappointed that so little has been done with such a promising story, but well - another opportunity missed by profit-conscious movie studios.

"Not bad, but not a masterpiece","If you prefer ""intelligent"" Sci-Fi (2001, Blade Runner, Moon etc.) then this isn't going to push all your buttons. It's more akin to the fast-paced, action and FX-heavy movies like Transformers, the latest Terminator movies and J.J Abrams' Star Trek.So why all the hype? One reason might be the cinematography. It's extremely effective; set against the dusty Johannesburg backdrop of ghettos and garbage, one can almost feel the heat and smell the decay. Another reason might be the originality. Despite the heavy nod to Alien Nation, the idea of a segregated society of aliens living in human-imposed exile, while their seemingly broken-down mother-ship hangs uselessly above the city, is presented in a novel and darkly humorous way. And, finally, the CGI is the best I've seen. There's so much to like here, in a Cloverfield kind of way.But there's also so much missing. While the lead character is well developed and the acting solid throughout, there's a real lack of support from everyone else. It's pretty much a one man show. The shaky, hand-held camera work in the first reel becomes tedious and unnecessary. The editing in places is surprisingly abrupt and the whole film suffers from 'political metaphor overload'.Had the pace been slower at the start of the film to allow the supporting characters to establish themselves and the alien back story given a chance to breathe, the frantic final third would have been more in balance.But life isn't perfect and Sci-Fi is a difficult genre to get exactly right. Striking the balance between slow, introspective intelligence and explosive CGI action has eluded all but the best directors; lessons can be learned from Spielberg, Lucas and Scott. But, such movies are rare - so ""District 9"" gives us something to watch while we wait for the next 'classic' to come along.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
We've been here before . . .,"I think it was trying to be Children of Men. with aliens. My complaints are too much graphic violence and too long.

It's more a comment on how humans treat large groups of refugees, minorities, and immigrants settled in their midst (I told you it was trying to be Children of Men). Similar ground (using aliens as a metaphor) was covered before, albeit differently, in Alien Nation. The story is set in South Africa, and the country's pre-Mandela history resonates throughout the film.The most interesting thing in the movie is its lead, Sharlto Copley, whom I suspect will be the next big international actor everyone wants for their upcoming production. He turns in a helluva fine performance as a dorky stooge in the beginning, but a true hero in the end.

Just WHO are the REAL Humans Here???,"FIRST: Let us FOCUS on the Title's Content and Context.....If ever there were a Cinematic ""ONION"".... DISTRICT 9 is it!Let's begin with the obvious:
A very well constructed and engineered Film. Exquistite Cinematography.... So much TEXTURE!Can You name any other Sci-Fi Movie that has been awarded a statuette for BEST PICTURE!?!?!?!? I would BET Your answer is ""Hmmmmm.... SORRY! NO.... I CAN'T!""Another rather obvious choice would be for SPECIAL EFFECTS. Of course... Chalk up another Academy Award!What an outstnding example of inspired film editing! It is NO WONDER DISTRICT 9 was also also awarded an OSCAR in that category!And... to top off the impressive LIST of GOLDEN STATUETTES... Best Writing Adapted from Another Source!What is the Bottom Line?... All of this truly awesome backdrop prompts me to obesrve....
If Franz Kafka were alive today, District 9 would have most certainly been HIS Oscar pick for best picture!In fact, it would be, unequivocally, his all-time favorite movie! Regrettably, Mr. Kafka is unable to make the case for himself... So, I will try to make it for him! How do you say ""WOW!"" in Czech???Let's touch upon another very obvious reality.... Hollywood says, ""100 million, bargain basement, to make an epic film!"" The country that brought You the textbook case of APARTHEID... South Africa says, ""30 million!"".District 9 is an intricately woven, intensely hypnotic, cinematic collage of numerous disparate elements. The film itself seems to metamorphosize through several different stages. Initial minutes of the movie have an authoritative narrative, documentary or docudrama feel.Gradually, District 9 transitions into a textured socio-cultural Sci-Fi drama, lending a new dimension to the term ""Apartheid"". Next, it's more of a gripping, police thriller. The last 10 or 15 minutes are adrenaline-pumping action! None of these shifts are awkward or contrived in the least; they flow together quite seamlessly and naturally.District 9 is most certainly made to order for those of us who crave Sci-Fi epics with unique, original, character driven stories; it is ""All of the above"", something light-years removed from same old, same old contrivances and clichéd conventions.Mr. Kafka himself just might ask us, ""What is one of the key questions asked by many of the best movies?"" How about, ""Exactly what qualities make a human being HUMAN?""Solidarity, loyalty, respect for others and other sentient creatures, empathy, sympathy and the ability to suppress personal short-term goals for long term ones beneficial to the group! Think, ""2001"", ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" and ""The Elephant Man"". Each film frames and poses the question with its own signature spin. In ""2001"" it was HAL who most exhibited these traits. After seeing District 9, you must decide for yourself just who the REAL humans are!10***********",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Poignant Themes, Values, & Aesthetics","What critics are calling a ""scathing social satire"" in conjunction with what I will call a culturally well-informed platform, District 9 is an extremely intelligent vision that no doubt will spawn many intelligent conversations. The film surprisingly comes to us from first time director, Neill Blomkamp, who, despite his limited short-film repertoire, will most likely attract many eyes in future years.Blomkamp gracefully employs a very raw, very visceral, docudrama style not much unlike the dust bowl feel of cinéma vérité. He takes it, however, several steps further by combining photorealistic CGI to gain the film's expressionistic quality, with shaky, hand-held documentary edges to expose more of its naturalistic elements. In this way, the film is uplifted with a highly chimerical imagination while simultaneously grounded in the grime of worldliness. Poetically speaking, it is both real and fake at the same time, or, as McKee puts it, it's a ""fantasy-reality hybrid"" of a film, which, in my view, makes the best of films. Also, as an added benefit, the form (though definitely not content) of the film was reminiscent of Tom Tykwer's Lola Rennt for those who deem themselves internationally savvy.There's lots to consider in this one: xenophobic attitudes, government consolidation, immigration laws, unabridged intolerance, atoning foreign cultures and ideas, reconciling ""separate but equal"" amendments, scapegoating the many faces of otherness, the physics of entropy, war inebriation, evolutionary mutations, media manipulation, and the role reversals of friends and enemies to name a few. Though the film is not strictly immersed in philosophical thought—indeed, much of the action-packed sequences resemble an astronomically greater version of Transformers meets Starship Troopers—I will focus on a few of the film's subtextual philosophies that I found particularly timely.Blomkamp plays the role of what I will call the ""revelatory manipulator"" quite flawlessly. He cleverly crafts the revelation—the drawing back of the curtain so to speak—of information to the audience that forces them into an ironic, self-reflective state of mind. For instance, the film opens with viewers most likely on the side of the humans as they infiltrate the negatively perceived, alien project homes. No doubt to this media spun projection, viewers will identify with their own kind: humans as the good guys, aliens as the bad guys. If we aren't careful though, we fall easily into this trap and are later reminded of the danger of segregated, binary thinking.Using the ancient Greek logos and pathos storytelling devices, Blomkamp works on the audiences sensitivities by evoking sympathy for the aliens, much of which I believe worked. The tables turn and it is the human participants—those watching the film—who slowly begin to side with the alien paradigm, despising now their own kind. Another way of saying this is that those who watch the film are confronted with their own ugliness and self-destructive behaviors. To grasp this, however, we must sacrifice our need to be right simply because we're human, focus on being kind, and look beyond the sci-fi alien spectacle. Ironically, we're just as much alien as is the flower to the rock (intelligence not included of course).The use of the concept 'alien,' not as some Ridley Scott, galactic creature, but as that which is foreign, weird, strange or scary, pervades the story, allowing us to ponder upon our own aliens in the attic. Blomkamp exposes our human frailties in such a remarkable way, essentially showing us that we don't have to build walls of separation, let alone fear the strange, if only we would seek understanding via candid communication and welcome that which is alien with loving, forgiving hands. Much of the film is riddled with politically charged atoms and secret mysteries of the human condition, and I believe it will best serve the public by being thoroughly talked about immediately after watching.Spread the word.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Don't believe the hype,"The fact that this movie is already on IMDb's top 250 and on such a high position is surreal.It goes to show you what hype can do for a movie and unfortunately it also shows that IMDb is losing credibility. District 9 tells the story of an extraterrestrial race that arrived at our planet in the 80's.These aliens are since then forced to live in slums and they have to withstand terrible conditions of living. Man have named this place District 9 and it holds more then a million aliens.The movie starts in a documentary-style showing what is happening in the slums and what is the opinion of several individuals about this aliens.Then the film focus on a government agent who was exposed to the aliens biotechnology...First of all, there are a ton of plot-holes,and I'm not talking about little things,these are major aspects of the plot that affect the story in a large scale. I do like the science fiction genre and I always go into these movies with an open-mind but when things just don't make sense its hard to enjoy a movie. Even Sci fi movies have to have some coherence and logic. District 9 is also filled with clichés. From the mother ship who looks exactly like the ship in Independence day to the aliens who look like insectoids.I mean, this has been done so many times.Break the mold already.Also the storyline of the government agent helping one of the aliens, so that he can help him in return isn't really that interesting to be honest....I think that if the director had chosen to focus on the coexistence of humans and aliens for instance and the possible struggle between the two races this movie could have been somewhat interesting and more importantly, original. Don't believe the hype,District 9 is just another summer blockbuster, lots of explosions, noise and gci but little interest,no substance and no originality whatsoever.6/10",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

"Original Ideas, Terrible Execution","Judging from the reviews given, I am surprised how easily people are intrigued by special effects and cinematography. Sure, the movie is quality due to the realness of the aliens and how natural they belonged on set, but the movie itself left so much to be asked for. Each scene was rushed, leaving the main character any real obstacles to overcome (basically, it was a series of action scenes in which the main character manages to succeed without too much effort), and each scene felt as if it was simply there to lead the way for the next scene; there was no real brilliance or flair or meaning in any of the scenes itself.As an intellectual viewer, I thought a lot of the film was rushed and lacked any real quality or depth in meaning. Just another action flick but with aliens I suppose (one with a poor progression in storyline). I would have given this film a four rather than a five, but I was amazed by its effects and how natural the aliens looked. But Im not a sucker for special effects and mindless action, and the sooner people begin to realise that movies are not made of special effects alone, the sooner people will get good movies in their cinemas.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Amazing,"This comment might have a tiny bit of spoilers...First off this movie is pretty incredible. It is a sci-fi movie, but at the same time its sort of a mockumentary with documentary parts to it, but most of the film is in normal present time...footage..The movie is very fast paced and intense..there really aren't really any ""slow"" moments in the movie, there isn't a whole lot of character development I guess you could say, but for this film I don't think it was really necessary.I'll tell you what this film isn't though, because I think the trailers were a little misleading...the movie isn't about a huge alien revolt where all the aliens fight back and rebel against the humans. The trailers also make you think that the humans are just evil people doing horrible things to the aliens and so forth which is kinda true but not completely true..The humans do have greedy and bad intentions for the aliens, wanting to harness their technology and weaponry and what not, but in the film there isn't a huge focus on the humans mistreating the aliens...its not like what you would see in a film about the Holocaust or something like that.Since the film dosen't use any Hollywood big shots it feels very realistic..the CGI effects are fantastic and the aliens are very realistic and the interaction with them and the human characters is very convincing and well done..This movie isn't for everybody though. Like I said it is pretty intense and there is a good amount of gore in and painful to watch imagery...I wouldn't say the movie is absolutely PERFECT so I didn't give it a full 10 starts but it is pretty damn good.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

"Clever Viral Marketing Aside, The Film Isn't Very Good","I am tired of hearing about the clever marketing campaign, and how cool the preview showings were.Objectively, this movie was not very good.The first half of the movie is a political allegory, and the second half of the movie is an action movie. The whole movie is told with a hand-held camera in a documentary style, that works for a while, and then gets annoying.The character development is awful, and Wikus Van De Merwe played by Sharlto Copley, is creepy and unlikeable. Copley is competent enough, but he is played as simply nerdy and the performance did not have enough depth. The only alien with a personality was the baby alien. The rest are just targets for abuse.On the bright side, the art direction was solid, and the initial premise of the story is interesting. I don't know how they animated the aliens, but that seemed realistic throughout. They were pretty ugly, and they spent a lot of time wiggling their facial appendages at the camera.This is a Sci-Fi, and it does not need to make sense, but this movie makes less sense then most. There are too many plot twists that have no purpose except to advance the story.There is a tradition of Sci-Fi that is darker and scarier than recent Sci-Fi films. This film is trying to channel that tradition, and maybe it succeeds in bringing Sci-Fi back to its roots -- on the other hand, better dialog, more character development, and more attention to the plot would have helped.I ordinarily give a extra points for taking on a tough political or moral issue, but this was a heavy-handed morality play. The messages of this movie -- something like, ""People are terrible,"" and ""Be nice or the aliens will get revenge,"" -- do not seem worth the effort.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A Nutshell Review: District 9,"South African director Neill Blomkamp, who co-wrote this film with Terri Tatchell, and an extension to his short film Alive in Joburg, will be someone on my radar for this thrilling roller coaster ride that blew my expectations many times over with its concept and slick delivery of an action piece with plenty of social commentary about the negative human conditions that easily plague the best of us, especially when it comes to self-preservation where we are likely to go on autopilot to ensure our interests and survival over and above others. Not forgetting too that the aliens portrayed here are rather peace loving, perfectly fine with living within the confines of their assigned territory and not take advantage of their weapons, to say, take over our world.For someone who had grown up during the apartheid, it is easy to notice how Blomkamp had included elements of those conditions into his narrative. From a bigger picture perspective as well, the extreme negativity in humanity's flaws stemming from fear, also got itself a place in its criticism, which Blomkamp intelligently crafted into the underlying narrative passage. We fear the unknown and what we do not know, and often name-call others whom we don't understand just to stand on a perceived moral high ground, as well as constantly looking for avenues to exploit any situation for money or power.As a concept though, Blomkamp adopted from the best of science fiction, and put them all together in an eclectic mix containing the best of the best. One can't deny that homage to The Fly, where a character through his own complacent doing, gets to see himself turn into something he despise initially. Then there's this overgrown conglomerate in MNU (someone say OCP?) which has its finger in many pies, such as the provision of security contractors and mercenaries and interests in high-tech weaponry, with corrupt bosses who would sell out their own children to make that extra penny.But what I felt to me was familiar ground in the setting up of its basic introductory premise, is that of the 1988 film Alien Nation. In that film, USA got visited by a mega spaceship which hovered in the air, and as my memory of the story goes, the aliens on the ship, slaves in their own planet, got welcomed to live on Earth and integrate with everyone, quite unlike the segregation in District 9. The Newcomers have a penchant for fanciful names which give rise to some comedy, and while they don't boast powerful weapons, they are in many ways stronger in intellect and in physical aspects than the average human, which allows for fear and prejudicial behaviour towards the new citizens of Earth.The distrust in District 9 is more pronounced of course, which consists of setting up concentration camps within which the aliens are forced to live in. Sharlto Copley stars as Wikus, a newly promoted employee of MNU (and son-in-law to the company's head honcho) to take charge of evicting the aliens from their current District 9 compound, to a supposedly better District 10 hundreds of miles away from Johannesburg, where the city folks are getting increasingly frustrated in their attempts to move the aliens out of their backyard. Excited by his appointment, we follow Wikus around in the first act, which is about something similar to the original short film in treatment, providing the basis in which we learn more of their environment the characters all operate within, with interesting nuggets thrown up that is testament to a science fiction world carefully created.This documentary feel soon dissolved into an action-adventure that's pretty much expected, if not for how the story made you feel for Wikus as a hunted man desperate to escape from the clutches of scientists and board room stiffs who see him not as a human, but as a commodity to be mined for research and weaponization. And it is in this desperation that perhaps a sliver of hope and humanity could arise from his rather arrogant yet timid outlook and self, which Copley portrayed with the experience akin to a veteran thespian, shuttling between various emotions over a wide spectrum.In fact, Copley's performance provided that extra push almost single-handedly in engaging you to the character and the premise that Fate has thrown him into, as we journey with him on a strange ride involving the symbiotic relationship he has to strike up with one of the ""Prawns"", and through this interaction which involves everything from family to an eye- popping, edge of your seat action sequence that seem to continuously top its own earlier scenes as it charges toward the finale, we see the change in Wikus from despair, to one coming to grips with, and eventually learning to respect differences. Like Alien Nation's cops of different cultures who learn to compromise and even fight for each other, District 9 also evokes those same sentiments, which Copley aces perfectly.Adopting the kind of Cloverfield and REC concept as well with the fourth wall periodically broken, I thought the cinematography here was extremely subtle in its transition to and from that documentary feel of unsteady cam, to the steady tripod shots for the more traditional capture of big action up close. WETA is responsible for the wonderful looking creature and technological designs, and once again proves itself as a premier effects and creature creator.District 9 brings plenty of fresh perspectives, narrative maturity and teaches contemporary filmmakers a thing or two about shooting exciting action sequences, building of tension, and just about what makes a film so awesome that it just begs for a rewatch. Definitely highly recommended stuff that you cannot afford to miss, and if you're planning to view just one film in this noisy blockbuster season, then look no further than Districct 9, which gets my vote as one of the worthy favourites of the year!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Suspenseful satire on human behavior,"I went into this movie knowing nothing and expecting something different. In this respect, I was mostly disappointed. Although there was some really great satire, (many of the scenes bordered on Saturday Night Live sketches), the overall plot was cliché. Too many times have we seen this same general theme. The last hour The storyline jumped round so many times, like 'let's do this' and then 'well that didn't work, let's do this'. It just felt a bit too loosely woven, without giving the viewer any sense of what the ultimate goal was for the protagonists. My other critique concerns suspension of belief. I don't mind suspending my belief to a certain extent, I think that is a necessary component of enjoying sci-fi. But there were several things that, unless you suspend your disbelief to the point of becoming a goldfish, you will ultimately attribute to poor story-editing.I actually enjoyed a lot of the shaky cam work, and the characters, acting, casting, it was all Bang On. Obviously, the effects were great.In retrospect, it was the first half of this movie that made it great- it mockingly, lightheartedly, displayed the most disturbing parts of human character and conduct.

Are you serious??,"How is District 9 getting such critical acclaim? Out of all the big science fiction movies to come out in the last 10 years this has the biggest plot holes, yet no one seems to care...Let me first start off by saying that I had very high hopes for this movie and was one of the most anticipated films of the year for me.Yes, the CG is great, the action is intense, but the story falls flat.Going into this movie you must suspend all disbelief. Apparently I was one of the few people who wasn't able to accept the fact that the human race would allow an alien civilization to be treated so poorly....20 years on this earth they spent in a slum with humanity's only interest being in their weapons. I find it a little hard to believe that, the aliens would be so compliant on giving up their weapons only be to treated like animals. Throughout the film they definitely show aggression, so they aren't entirely peaceful. Yet they don't start any uprising with their advanced technology. Why? Your guess is as good as mine as we're giving no clear insight on any previous background into the past 20 years of their containment.When i mentioned you must suspend all disbelief I truly meant it. Here you have these incredibly intelligent aliens forming gangs... having sex with human prostitutes, craving cat food, and otherwise acting anything like you might expect an alien race to behave.On to the meat and bones of the story.... We don't know why they landed here, we just know they've been here for 20 years and came to earth barely alive. The part that kills me is that in that 20 years they were able to extract enough ""fluid"" from their technology to fly a command vessel (which previously detached for no apparent reason) back into the Mother ship. Meanwhile the fuel that was extracted was apparently also enough to power the entire Mother ship up and then fly away. How the hell? Furthermore, if they were able to extract fuel from their own parts why didn't they do that in the first place before landing on earth? If all that was required was a small canister of black fluid, why wasn't this done prior to landing on this planet, when they could have just flown home.None of the story makes any sense whatsoever. We're never told why they landed here, why they couldn't just fly home, why they never chose to fight back our oppression. The entire story was horrible.

Very Disturbing But Some of the Best Science Fiction I Have Ever Seen!!!,"District 9, science-fiction at its absolute BEST, revolves around the attempts to relocate aliens, currently living in slum conditions in Johannesburg, South Africa, to a more suitable place - living alongside humans has obviously deteriorated. A bureaucrat, Wikus, appointed by his father-in-law, is tapped to lead the relocation efforts. Unfortunately, in the process, he becomes infected with the DNA of the aliens. (oh you KNOW the South African government has been performing ""tests"" to study the aliens!) Of course, Wikus will eventually turn into one of the aliens and the government wants/needs to ""harvest"" his body parts all, of course, for the sake of science.The movie is intense, gritty, and disgusting. It pretty much evokes the same emotions in the viewer which is where the power of the movie lies. It takes the viewer on a VERY uncomfortable review of one's own biases/prejudices/apprehensions. In the beginning I was horrified watching the amount of firepower humans enlisted to implement the relocation policy thus making me dislike Wikus almost immediately - especially since he benefited (for lack of a better word) solely because of nepotism. I was immediately moved to support the aliens but, GEEZ, they're so ugly!!! Then Wikus becomes infected, becoming of intense interest to the South African scientific community, and becomes the hunted rather than the hunter. Now Wikus is as sympathetic as the aliens and thank god, not NEARLY so ugly.It was INDEED startling to be reduced to making assumptions about someone SOLELY on the basis of how they looked. The aliens here are quite intelligent. Moreover, they only want to get back to their own planet and have no ill-will toward humans, unless, of course, provoked. So in most cases they do NOT deserve the inhuman (no pun intended) treatment they are often subjected to.Their just god-awful ugly!! And it is disconcerting to have to admit AND deal with this. Compound this with a language barrier and we find ourselves looking at some veeeeeeeeeery similar situations we find ourselves in in our everyday lives.The special effects are mind-boggling and the interactions between aliens and humans recalls social conditions we are all entirely too familiar with. Yes, it uncomfortably evokes the reasonings behind immigration, integration, segregation, minorities, cultures/situations we are unfamiliar with, and forces us to take an historical perspective of just how well (or how badly) we have dealt with similar situations.The movie is fast-paced, action-packed, gross, poignant, revolting, and THOROUGHLY entertaining. It is reminiscent of the best that the Twilight Zone and Outer Limits had to offer and quite frankly, trying to categorize the movie not only is difficult but ultimately unfair.Hands down - one of the BEST movies of ANY genre I have ever seen.Oooooooh yeah.....I INDEED recommend!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A brilliant science fiction/action film.,"I had very strange expectations for this film. It was originally shown in the trailer to be a documentary or mockumentary. Generally, I don't see those types of movies but in this case it was a very interesting way to tell the story. It also looked like there was going to be a lot of shaky-cam which I feel got old after Cloverfield. There wasn't as much of that as I expected. Now the trailers gave very little information as far as the plot goes.The story is basically about an alien spacecraft that lands in South Africa and after a few decades the people decide to send them away to a concentration camp known as District 9 because of their hostile behaviours. There's a lot more to the story, but that shouldn't be revealed before you see the film.The main star of the film is a complete unknown. Sharlto Copley from South Africa. I don't think it matters that District 9 has no major stars, these people are all South African and give great performances. It's directed by Neill Blomkamp who is a first time director and produced by Peter Jackson.The reason I thought District 9 was an effective film was because it was going a different direction with the alien movie. In all alien themed movies in the past, the aliens have been the enemies. In District 9, we are the enemies. I refused to believe that I would actually be rooting for the aliens in this movie, but District 9 achieved it. In my theater, there was applause when a group of aliens ripped a human apart. That's another thing. It's actually a surprisingly gory movie. It's not too bad but it could be quite bloody at times and you should be aware of that.The special effects were amazing on this film. It's hard to believe that they made the aliens look completely realistic on a 30 million budget. That was just incredible.My major complaint with the movie was that the first half hour was strictly a documentary and then after that it suddenly becomes more about the characters. It's too sudden when the documentary ends and it changes the tone because I was really enjoying the documentary. Also in a way, I'm glad it ended because it became it became a very entertaining action movie at that point.To conclude my review, I think you should see District 9. It's definitely the best summer blockbuster because it even has a few things to say about xenophobia and racism. I saw it twice, but I don't think it's necessary, once is enough to absorb all the information in the movie. Although, the final shot of the film completely flew over my head both times, but once I figured it out, the movie was so much better in my mind. I give District 9 a 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
District 9: Hug an alien today,"A science fiction movie that makes one relate more to the aliens which remain mysterious from beginning to end, still should have explained why the aliens were on Earth in the first place. Not knowing that bugs the heck out of me. But in the end, as it was in the beginning, my attention was never lost.My admiration for this movie is unexplainable to say the least. I can truthfully say that this movie has the realism that sci-fi often understandably lacks. A spaceship from outer space? Yeah, its there! Why? Who knows? We just accept it because the real story is going on all around it and us. We get to see the documentary build its tale of ""truth"", which is one dimensional because the truth is only what we humans know. When one of ours is forced into a life never expected and inconceivable to everyone(including aliens), we then become involved by trying to relate to what we do not understand and understand what we cannot deny.The action is not a big part of this movie because this movie has too much going on for any one aspect to get all of the attention. But what action there is, will keep you engrossed and distract you from reason as I am sure it was intended. But, action or not, I was seat-bound in hope for resolution. Watching one man trying to remain a part of his heritage but forced to accept an unforeseen destiny was, for me, the biggest part of this movie.These aliens did not seem so foreign to me which is why I loved their look and the way they moved. I think the creators of this movie did a great job of making them ""?loveable?"".There is nothing wrong with this movie that I can think of other than the one point I made earlier - I don't know why they were here. Maybe that will come up in the prequel or sequel if there is one or the other.I gave it a 9 because it deserved more than an 8 and because a 10 would be pointless without a certain explanation. I really hope to see a continuance.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Gritty sci-fi action at it's coolest.,"When it comes down to things alien, I'm on board.Well, most things involving aliens.During the previews for 'District 9' some alien abduction flick with Milla Jovovich came on, 'The Fourth Sign' - and it looked like total crap. Not because I dislike the idea of alien abduction but because it was a stylized and over-done looking piece of Hollywood hogwash. With screeching sound effects, manic editing, and ridiculous over-acting, said Jovovich sci-fi flick appears to be a lame attempt to cash in on this possible booming genre.Funny, 'District 9' had two of those attributes, yet it still managed to turn them into positives instead of negatives.As you know by now, 'District 9' revolves around aliens landing and subsequently becoming trapped on Earth. They're eventually sectioned off and forced to live in slum-like conditions. After 20 years of this, the people of surrounding Johannesburg are fed up with the aliens and want them out. So MNU (Multi-National United) hatches a plan to move the alien species hundreds of miles south. But that's easier said than done. While during a preliminary phase, our lead character is delt an unfortunate hand and is treading in deep water that encompasses shady corporations and alien welfare.Neil Blommkamp is, without a doubt, a bright spot in the world of cinema. If you've seen any of his previous work there should be zero doubt of this man's imagination and his talent to wield such creativity. From a simple sneaker commercial that dazzles the eyes; to a short about a robot who's dealing with human emotions; or to an action-packed short movie which was made for Halo 3, everything he seems to touch is special. And with District 9, it's no different.Blending social commentary, action-packed fire-fights, ingenious weaponry, slimy and awesome special effects, he is everything a fan of sci-fi/action movies should be waiting for. And when it comes down to the special effects, they truly are a spectacle. He uses this somewhat out-of-focus approach of CGI, fused with remarkable make-up effects to create scenes of tremendous impact.The movie isn't perfect, obviously, but what it does do, it does well. Very well.I would have loved a more in-depth story, with more answers (concerning the aliens), but I can easily settle for this, as it ended on a note that I was very content with. The acting was all pretty good for the most part as everyone involved was obviously very dedicated and gung-ho to be apart of this film. But the characters themselves and some parts of the dialogue felt a tad cliché at times.Overall, 'District 9' delivered a true cinematic experience that I haven't seen in a long time. It felt like an awesome mix of 'Starship Troopers' and 'City of God'. Now how cool is that?With Neil talking about creating a scifi epic next, the sky is truly the limit for this dude.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Exceptional film,"Saw it last night and understand some of the critiques about the handi-cam footage. I don't think it was overdone or too shaky but I did have a moment of doubt at the beginning on how long it would continue -- setting mood is one thing, a whole movie would have been overkill. I feel bad for the folks that gave up on that and walked out early; once it transitioned into mainstream shooting style the story really took off.The plot was easy to follow, and was much deeper and darker than I had even hoped. The main character, much more like a real person than a Hollywood character, had a wide range of emotions and his personality wasn't clear-cut or overly predictable. The film gives you the feeling of someone really making decisions on the fly and reacting to the events in the best way he knows how (not THE best way). That might be the best aspect of the film (cookie cutters belong in the kitchen, not the cinema).The CGI effects were done well enough to let me suspend disbelief and enjoy the story. The alien weapons impacts were definitely intense. Folks will either detest the gore or be awed by it... I was definitely awed and most of the audience at my screening seemed to be also.Overall, it was thoroughly enjoyable sci-fi, with a lot more story than the average summer shoot'em up. Highly recommend to anyone looking for something fresh and intense.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Newcomer Neill Blomkamp is a force to be reckoned with,"A sensational and monumental genre-bending film that does everything right, throwing all the Sci Fi stereotypes out the window and keeps the plot smart and thrilling. The design of the ships and prawns are all very original and creative. District 9 also features themes that are horrifyingly familiar but are dealt with in new and inventive ways. Featuring a breakout performance from powerhouse Sharlto Copley, phenomenal CGI and an amazing sense of realism, District 9 is an unrivaled slice of brilliance and originality. It's one of my favorite films of all time, because it dares to do something truly unique and succeeds incredibly well at everything it sets out to do.

Fantastic!,"I had high expectations for this film, and they were surpassed. The acting by the no name lead Sharlto Copley is tremendous, and the film is shot in a way that you never lose focus on what's going on. Films that have a budget of 5 or 6 times of this film are not as convincing. The special effects are top notch, and the writing/screenplay leaves no holes. The 30 million dollar budget is used more efficiently than any film in recent memory. Finally a sci-fi film that doesn't shy away from violence to achieve a PG-13 rating to fill the seats. If this film were made to achieve a PG-13 rating it wouldn't have been as good, war is violent, gunshots are bloody, and you see plenty of each in this film.

"Action movie, video game, yes.  Social commentary, not really.","This movie is technically impressive. It has some solid performances. It is not subtle, and it is wildly implausible. I assumed I wasn't getting the whole story from the trailers on how an advanced race capable of intergalactic travel could become refugee camp squatters to a less advanced race. Nope. That's pretty much it. I had a number of ""Why?""s floating in my brain afterward, but they were beaten down by the sheer brutality of the film. This is basically a buddy cop film, with as thin a veneer of plot as most of them have. What sets it apart, again, is the technical execution. It looks amazingly real.

District 9 - Review,"In recent years, the majority of films from the science-fiction genre have showcased advancements in visual technology. Fuelled with massive budgets, many of these blockbuster films display stunning imagery, however they can often suffer from a lack of substance. Over bloated style, with a Hollywood star cast into the mix makes for a passable summer screening, but hardly one that will last the test of time.District 9, on the other hand, completely breaches this predictable trend and offers a fantastic revival to the genre. Neil Blomkamp's feature debut has an array of qualities that had gone missing in science-fiction films, whilst also maintaining a terrific caliber of CGI and visual effects. Here we have a film that has a cutting dramatic edge with an embedded sense of reality at its core. An extremely clever version of an extra-terrestrial encounter, that's layered with subtext which appears familiar to the human history.The story engages from the beginning with documentary style footage, which effectively creates this raw sense of reality surrounding the alien invasion. Through this we are brought up to pace with the developments between the humans and aliens. The outcome being that the humans enclose the aliens into an area labelled District 9, to bide time to learn about them. However developments evolve poorly resulting in the brutal and derogatory treatment to the aliens.What's truly captivating is the layers of subtext that ensue from this action. The aliens are the misunderstood minority on earth, and are brutally treated by the humans. This terrifying depiction of the human behaviour displays man in his cruellest form. What's especially unnerving about this is how it reflects the treatment humankind has inflicted on one another throughout time. The aliens are not fearsome entity's but instead victims, who are dwarfed under the powerful human regime.The unique script, adapted by Neil Blomkamp and Terri Tatchell, is a fantastic triumph. The story takes an original, ingenious approach to alien-human relations. Rather than the aliens dominating their new environment, they are instead imprisoned by its inhabitants. Sharlto Copley does a terrific job as the lead man, whose transition is both tormenting and frightening, whilst always remaining endearing.District 9 is a terrific film by Blomkamp – an incredible debut feature. It is most certainly one of the best science-fiction films in recent years and without doubt will remain a genre gem as the years pass by.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Watch this movie for the first time,"Just after watching District 9 , tell us two things.The first : communication is very important, even with aliens.The second : trust is also very important, even with aliens.Humans should not be too selfish and self-righteous, aliens say one is very promise-keeping.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
High marks given to this film that has eliminated the ET stereotype,"Pretty interesting that a candidate from a genre where I would normally not consider adding in my favourite list, actually made it.This movie impressed me with its originality and a different point of view - I have not felt so much for the aliens! This is probably the first film that eliminates 'stereotypes' towards aliens. Although it does have uncertainties and loopholes here and there, District 9 is one step closer towards a highly probably outcome if the situation actually takes place in real life, and is likely to form a good base for future movies to come that I hope will create a new market intended for viewers who demand something alien, but closer to reality than being imaginary.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Incredibly overrated,"I'm flabbergasted by the amount of positive feedback this film has received. It's more of a straight-up action movie than anything resembling science fiction, and while it has plenty of explosions and lots of splattering blood & guts, DISTRICT 9 is severely deficient in story, characters, ideas, and surprises.In fact, you could argue that it doesn't have any characters at all, just a few types: the nerdy Accidental Protagonist, the Inscrutable Alien, the Executive Villain, the oddly unkillable Grunt Villain. Everybody else is just an intermittent talking head.There's almost no story, and what plot developments do emerge are predictable way in advance.Without giving too much away, I can say that the basic premise is a lot like that Outer Limits episode starring Robert Culp, with a slight twist. To that slender premise the script adds various clichés from recent SF films and series. But the movie never does what good SF does best: it never presents or explores big ideas, it never portrays alien worlds, and despite its CGI creatures, it never explores extraterrestrial psychology or culture.DISTRICT 9 is also lacking in internal logic. As in the Star Wars series, aliens speak Alienese (with subtitles) and humans speak English, yet each species easily understands the other's language (even though the humans can't even read the subtitles!). Now I might buy into the notion that the aliens have special senses or faculties that enable them to understand English without speaking it, but I really can't believe that the humans somehow learned fluent Alienese without also learning SOMETHING about their biology, culture, technology, etc.The aliens' physical appearance is strictly Motorized Action Figure. They are humanoid bipeds, yet they have bug-like or mollusc-like features. Somehow they are perfectly capable of breathing the Earth's atmosphere and eating terrestrial food. It's even suggested that they can have sex with humans.Now when is the last time you had sex with an octopus or a cockroach, y'all?At one point we are told that all the aliens we see are members of a worker caste, without any intelligence, yet we quickly learn that this isn't true. But if it isn't, why do the aliens usually behave as if they aren't sentient?If I'm supposed to trust that the sequel clears all this up, well, you've already lost me. No way do I spend another dime on this franchise!The film's portrayal of the aliens is somewhat less xenophobic than the handling of the bugs in STARSHIP TROOPERS or the scary creatures in INDEPENDENCE DAY, but its portrayal of black Africans seems downright racist. I'm a bit surprised that there hasn't been any noise about that.The movie that DISTRICT NINE most closely resembles is BLACKHAWK DOWN. If you loved that one, you might get a little out of this one. But even then, you'll find yourself wondering -- why don't the aliens just shoot down those darn helicopters? They get plenty of opportunities!In a word: yuck.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Different, but Good","OK, let's pretend that aliens arrive on earth, and for some strange reason don't immediately want to destroy us. what would most likely happen then? the answer is: probably what happened in this movie.despite the fact that this movie was about aliens, i found it extremely realistic. the entire time i was watching, i never found a single moment that made me think: ""oh that'd never happen in real life..."" that, in addition to the almost 'documentary' type style of filming, made the entire situation seem highly believable. in my opinion, the movie accurately portrayed the anger, fear, and prejudice that people tend to show when they don't properly understand something, as well as the politics and manipulation used by others to gain influence in rough situations like these.On that note, despite the movie's focus on sending a message, the action was still plentiful, and very well done at that.(and let's just say it was rated R for a reason). But while most movies are remembered either for their special effects OR their plot, this movie managed to pull off both. In the end, it was definitely more than just another sci-fi flick.(unfortunately, as i was leaving the theater, i heard too many ignorant people criticize the movie's attempt to show them something more than just mindless action and violence. hopefully that was just the group i ran into, and not what most people were thinking)",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

"The prawns may be ugly, but the action is really good","District 9 tries to do a few interesting things, and it largely succeeds. However, I think it also demonstrates the director's, Neill Blomkamp's, flaws that would come out more fully in his next two films, Elysium and Chappie.In an alternate reality where a huge alien ship floats derelict over Johannesburg, South Africa, the country has been trying to deal with the over one million, essentially, refugees that have suddenly arrived. Initial hope led to conflict led to strife led to separation, keeping the aliens in a new district of the city that quickly turned into a slum with every problem therein. All of this is done while introducing our main character, Wikus Van De Merwe, a bureaucrat at MNU, the giant corporation in charge of security for District 9, and how he's preparing an operation to deliver eviction notices to all 1.8 million alien residents before the company removes them to a far more remote camp, District 10. This opening 20 minutes is the movie and its stylistic choices at their best.The movie has a documentary style that uses handheld cameras and interviews with experts and locals to make the events feel very grounded in reality despite the presence of aliens. It grounds it in a tangible reality that evokes events of South Africa's past, mostly Apartheid, and the overall effect is quite strong. As Wikus moves into District 9, though, the documentary style begins to flag and break out of narrative necessity. We start getting images from no known in universe source. This didn't really both me until my third or fourth viewing, but now that I see it I can't unsee it. It's not a big thing, as it tries to keep the visual aesthetic pretty consistent throughout, but it just kind of bugged me.Anyway, Wikus goes from hovel to hovel, almost gleefully as he takes advantage of the dumber creatures, even going to the point of having a shack filled with alien eggs burned down, until he comes to the shock where Christopher Johnson is collecting a mysterious black fluid distilled from alien technology that he hides in a tube. Wikus finds the tube, gets sprayed in the face, and his life just begins to get worse. His arms becomes an alien arm, he gets kidnapped by MNU and forced to participate in experiments with alien weapons which can only be fired by the aliens themselves. He escapes, hides in District 9, and finds Christopher again. They decide to work together, Wikus getting Christopher into MNU to retrieve the tube and Christopher promises to reverse the changes to Wikus' body. The movie then becomes an extended action scene for the rest of the film.I remember this movie blowing me away when it first came out. Now, more than ten years after its release, I had a more muted reaction. I still enjoy it, think it's good, and was happy that I revisited it. However, I felt like there was something a bit off about it that I hadn't noticed before. The movie's inability to keep with its documentary conceit was small and understandable (can't have a dude with a camera following Wikus when he's on the run), but it was when I realized the obviousness of some of his characters, especially the antagonists, and how they repeat in both Elysium and especially Chappie that I began to squirm a bit. The idea of a giant multinational corporation being bad guys doesn't bother me, but every single aspect of them are just so uniformly awful that it ends up feeling like a cheap dodge, undermining the potential drama a bit. I also ended up finding the structure of the second half a little off as Wikus has to go back and forth from MNU to District 9 to MNU again and then back to District 9 which feels unnecessary to a certain extent.But these are relatively minor complaints. Sharlto Copley is remarkable as Wikus, especially when you realize that he had no serious acting experience beforehand. The way he takes Wikus from blithely unaware at the beginning to a completely broken man by the end is fantastic. The special effects are rather remarkable as well when you consider the movie's shockingly small $30 million budget. The aliens look great most of the time even in direct sunlight. It's the sort of work I would expect from a much more expensive movie.It's easy to see why the studio would love Neill Blomkamp after this. Not only was it hugely financially successful considering its budget, but it was also nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars. No wonder they threw $115 million at him for Elysium, however I think the signs were there that Blomkamp needed more time being a hungry filmmaker, or at least the kind of guy who needed a serious writing partner, someone to give Blomkamp's ideas the kind of depth everyone assumed was there. As it is, though, District 9 is a solid action movie with a different aesthetic and a great central performance.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

"Good, But Not For Everyone.","District 9, in my opinion, is Avatar done right. Both movies deal with themes of discrimination involving aliens and the main character eventually siding with the aliens and having to fight against his own people. The story and themes in both films has been done to death, but District 9 manages to do it in a way that does not feel so cliché. They both have amazing special effects. However, District 9 produced great effects with a much smaller budget.The main character, Wikus (Sharlto Copley), while I do not like him much at first, does not feel like the stereotypical hero like Sam Worthington's character in Avatar does and he feels more real. I bought his plight more and his transition from a naïve person to liking the aliens feels natural.Plus the film is very violent which makes the action more exciting for me. When I first saw it I was jarred at how dark it was so I didn't like it. However, I saw it again and enjoy much more. I still think the dark nature of the film is a bit extreme but it didn't bother me a lot once I got used to it. I definitely recommend this film, but I would caution in letting your children view it.

Solid science fiction with a message,"It's not hard to spot the commentary on the cruelty of mankind, and in how these aliens are treated, to recognize how we treat each other, be it during apartheid in South Africa, or more recently, refugee camps along the southern U.S. border. There is no sign of an attempt to understand the alien culture or what intelligence they have by scholars, it's all about making sure they're subordinated, their weapon technology harvested, and anything of value monetized. The speed with which this occurs is devastating, but the film is lightened up a little bit by the humor of the naïve agent (Sharlto Copley) who bumbles through rounding the aliens up for relocation. When he's accidentally sprayed with some form of alien fuel, he begins morphing into one of them, and in the absurdity of it all, I thought of Gregor Samsa waking up to find he was a bug. It's all madness, and yet, the militaristic, inhuman response of the earthlings has disturbing elements of truth. It's unfortunate that the back half of the film becomes increasingly filled with action film clichés and concentrates mostly on special effects, plot holes be damned, losing its way from what was such a strong start.

It is a continuum that catches you off guard,"Seeing that it's a sci-fi alien movie, I thought it would be somewhat along the lines of Predator or other such alien horror movies. However, the genre and subgenres of the movie did not include ""Horror"", and seeing that the movie had a high rating, I became curious.The first 30-40 minutes of the movie were bizarre, interesting and light-hearted, and kept me guessing where the story is headed. The alien species that abruptly showed up in a UFO above Johannesburg is accommodated in a slum-like containment zone called District 9 after it is established that it's not feasible to keep them as a part of the human civilization due to their incompatible nature, language barrier and lack of understanding about human societal norms. For the majority of the first half, you don't really know what to make of the alien species because not much is disclosed about them apart from some basic information. You feel like you're supposed to be disgusted or threatened by them. However, the second half of the movie gives you a deeper insight into what these aliens really are.Due to people's complains about the aliens interfering with their daily lives, the decision to move the aliens to a different location, farther away from the populated regions goes through. However, since certain civil rights are given to the aliens, Wikus is assigned with the task to get the aliens to sign the eviction notice (yes, you read that right).During the whole ordeal, when Wikus accidentally gets infected, he becomes an invaluable biotechnological asset to MNU, a powerful organization that manufactures weapons. This is where the tone of the movie changes completely. With them on his tail, he is forced to fend for himself. Despite his hopeless and bleak circumstances, his bid to become normal and reunite with his wife makes for a perfect sci-fi thriller story, that has not concluded with this movie.Sharlto Copley absolutely nailed his role with his incredible performance.Although it's a sci-fi movie, the environment, action, dialogues, reactions of the key characters to events, etc. Are quite realistic.At the time of writing this review, District 10 is in development.

It is currently in my Top 5 of 2009,"If you are a person who sees some social commentary in NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, then you will dig DISTRICT-9. It is a story full of action on the screen, and full of thoughtful context to contemplate later.After years of reading IMDb reviews, this is the movie that inspired me to sign up to post a review. I walked out of the theater today and started calling people I know who might see a SciFi movie. Almost every conversation started with me saying, ""Without a doubt, DISTRICT 9 is the best SciFi move so far in 2009."" At least, it is my favorite. (GOODBYE SOLO, LEMON TREE and LET THE RIGHT ONE IN are other current non-SciFi raves of 09.) I might go see it again before opening weekend is over! Before seeing D-9, I enjoyed ""Live in Joberg"" and the on-line advertising, all work with great detail that is interesting in itself. I also appreciate how the trailers and web-based features compliment the movie, contributing to the world of the movie without giving away spoilers from the movie itself.I understand the people who do not like camera techniques that use interviews, hand-held ""news"" footage and security cams to build up the story. Before going, I was worried the movie would be in ""fake documentary"" style. It is not, at least not from beginning to end. The style should be very familiar to most people. Try flipping through your TV channels at home, particularly the ""news"" channels, and you might be surprised to see other stories about non-Humans that involve neither science nor fiction.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
District 9 More than Entertainment,"District 9 takes place in South Africa where an alien space ship suddenly appeared in the skies above Johannesburg almost thirty years ago. The aliens didn't attack nor did they offer technology or trade. In fact, there was little contact at all until humanity took the initiative. But first contact isn't all it's cracked up to be, especially not if you're an alien. Humans ""rescued"" the aliens from their ailing ship, but segregated them into a gigantic shantytown known as District 9 where they remain, monitored by a constant police presence.Wikus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Copley) works for MNU, a corporation that oversees much of District 9 and engages in most of what the rest of the world sees as alien relations. MNU has ulterior motives, of course. It wants desperately to get some version of alien weapons technology up and running. In part because humans are fearful of the aliens, MNU undertakes to move the entire population from District 9 to a location well outside Johannesburg. Van De Merwe is put in charge of the relocation effort, and that's when things suddenly get complicated.District 9 is presented as a documentary film. Some footage appears to come from news organizations while other snippets are apparently culled from security cameras. There's also video of various persons who are interviewed—of the anonymous ""man on the street"" variety, MNU employees, and friends and family of Van De Merwe—and their comments woven into the rest of the material. Though there are obviously some scenes that couldn't have come from the aforementioned sources, those are also skillfully edited into the plot line here and there. Taken as a whole, the delivery is striking to say the least.Director Neill Blomkamp grew up in South Africa, and I suspect his intimate knowledge of the country during apartheid contributed greatly to District 9 (which is based on a 2005 short made by Blomkamp). Famed director Peter Jackson had originally tapped Blomkamp to direct a movie version of the video game, Halo. When that didn't pan out, Jackson gave Blomkamp $30 million to make whatever he liked. He expanded on his earlier idea, and co-wrote and directed District 9; Jackson is credited as a producer.I was surprised to learn that leading man Sharlto Copley hadn't acted before this, but I figured I'd give him the benefit of the doubt. After all, in a documentary-style film, he could probably get away with not being very good. The reality, however, is that Copley had to be far more than just another interviewee. He had to portray a variety of very strong emotions under a number of extraordinary circumstances. Copley wasn't adequate to the role. No, he was positively fantastic. I feared for him, I cheered for him, I loathed him, and frankly, I wept over him. He may not have acted before, but I sure hope he does again!It's painful to type the word ""only"" in front of ""$30 million,"" but that kind of money for this kind of movie is a pittance. I fully expected mediocre special effects and other shortcuts which, in a film relying on at least some effects, could very well have resulted in dragging the movie down. Once again, I was delighted to see that Blomkamp (and Jackson's own WETA Workshop, which handled everything from special effects to props, and from vehicles to make-up effects) came through, and in a major way. The CGI (by Image Engine, a company in Vancouver, Canada where Blomkamp attended and graduated Vancouver Film School) is flawless, and the integration with live action is just terrific. I wasn't merely satisfied by the depiction of these aliens, I was awed. I never doubted for a moment that they were real.From a somewhat lower tech standpoint, I loved the cinematography. Some scenes were filmed with hand-held cameras, and the jouncing and jiggling were perfect touches and added genuine realism. Other shots with broader scopes were awesome, beautiful, and horrifying by turns. I credit excellent direction combined with talented cinematographers, good editing, and some more of that superlative CGI work for the cohesive and dramatic end product.BOTTOM LINE: It's obvious I recommend District 9 to movie goers as a unique new action movie. But I must confess something else as well: When the movie was over and the audience making its way out, I was still in my seat. I sat there, alone, in the dark, weeping. I've talked about movies before as ""entertaining"" or ""exciting,"" and this one is both. It was also, to my lingering amazement, profoundly moving. Good for Mr. Blomkamp, and good for movie fans, too.FAMILY SUITABILITY: District 9 is rated R for bloody violence and pervasive language. Because this is science fiction, though, I don't see that the violence would be too much or too graphic for kids of about 13 or 14 and up. The language (and plenty of it) is going to have to be your own call.POLITICAL NOTES: I didn't know it before I saw the movie, but the shantytown filled with shacks occupied by aliens is real. Its human population was in the process of being relocated to government housing, but people still lived there when the movie was being made. Even had it been a product of set decorators, the living conditions there were appalling. That it's real is almost unfathomable. While there are the all too obvious lessons here where poverty and apartheid is concerned, I also think it's important to point out the motives of MNU, motives which echo those of many governments, up to and including a ""the ends justify the means"" attitude. The notion that some lives are considered less valuable than others is also brought home, sometimes in particularly graphic and horrific fashion. That's another lesson some could do with learning, particularly by those currently considering health care reform in this country.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
This movie is an instant Sci-Fi classic!!!,"Attention potential viewers, I don't regularly give out the 10 stars but this time I did. Just like Phil Jackson's touch that wins NBA championships for the Lakers, Producer Peter Jackson puts his golden stamp on this movie ensuring an epic film and an Oscar for something.Of course, hats off to Neill Blomkamp for directing and co-writing this science fiction masterpiece.This movie has the perfect balance of action, comedy, drama, sci-fi, plus a touch of human (and alien) emotion. What you see on screen is believable. None of that Transformer crap where a technically advanced robot can't kill a human running on foot.You get the feeling you are on location watching everything unfold. You are engrossed in the movie from the start. Not one audience member made a sound in the theater I saw it in.

Excellent! Whatever you do just decide for yourself!,"This film does not break from the stalls immediately with explosions and small arms fire which cause cars to explode and flip as if it MUST appeal to your raging blood lust straight away or you will turn in disgust to write a hate review with your favourite crayon; In the first five minutes it does not have a two dimensional central protagonist with generic GQ and Mens Fitness characteristics explain in passing to a second similar, but not quite so striking, supporting role character the premise, backstory, present situation and limited requisite developments needed in order for a suitably consumable path to resolution at the necessarily predictable end of the film in order for the poor retarded viewer to engage and enjoy it; It is an earth bound sci-fi not set near Central Perk, Beverly Hills High or any other comfortingly familiar sight... so unfortunately you cannot at any point gawp, elbow the person next to you and blubberingly enthuse, ""Look, it's the (Add familiar landmark here)!""; It's underlying message is fairly latent but has no equivalent of Charlton Heston screaming to the heavens- or more accurately you the viewer- ""We were the apes!"", or anything even reminiscent of a James Tiberius Kirk soliloquy.

Being Human,"Many of the ideas of the celebrated film 'Alien' are reinterpreted in Neill Blomkamp's movie 'District 9' in the context of a parable about Apartheid South Africa; and rather more surprisingly, there are also shades of 'The Office', as an un-self aware bureaucrat becomes an unlikely hero. It's nicely done, and the political parallels don't seem wholly limited to the past either, but the film's weakness, rather like that of Orwell's 'Animal Farm', is that the parable is perhaps just a little too obvious: it's hard to care too much about the plot when it's so obviously constructed to make a point. But there's skill in the telling: we're encouraged to see the aliens in progressively more humanised form (although the film perhaps also suggested that being human is nothing particularly to be proud of). 'District 9' may not be a masterpiece, but it's certainly more interesting than the average piece of celluloid sci-fi.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Hands down, the finest sci-fi film since ""Children of Men"" (2006); also, it's what ""Alien Nation"" (1988) could have been...","You read my summary correct, folks: ""District 9"" is the finest sci-fi film I've seen since ""Children of Men"" (2006). Now why is that astounding? Because the genre of science fiction, while well-known for its occasional brilliance, is also rife with movies that are just flat-out terrible. Science fiction is a genre that takes both intelligence and originality combined with some impeccable skill to truly master. Of course, not every sci-fi film can be ""Star Wars"" (1977) or ""Blade Runner"" (1982). Likewise, not everybody can be George Lucas or Ridley Scott.That is where ""District 9"" comes in, so far the best movie I've seen this year.Since ""Children of Men"" depicted a future in which mankind was on the verge of extinction due to a worldwide infertility pandemic, the movie skillfully made a case for humanity to survive despite our past atrocities against each other. Here in ""District 9,"" humanity is again seen at its absolute worst, because we have reverted back to one of our most basic, cruelest instincts: our ability to hate.What I just typed means to suggest that ""District 9,"" as a science fiction/action film, may very well be one of the most socially conscious sci-fi pictures ever made. ""Alien Nation"" (1988) had almost the exact same set-up as this film; I DID like that film, BTW. But where it went wrong was in the way it backtracked on its principles of how we treat each other just when things started getting interesting. What started out as a sly social commentary on how human beings will react to an extraterrestrial race's integration into the human populace, devolved into a standard buddy-cop movie with a slight, slight hint of social commentary.In ""District 9,"" it's been over 20 years since an alien ship washed ashore on Earth, settling over the skies of Johannesburg, South Africa. Now for all of us history buffs, the significance of South Africa as this film's setting is not a random, isolated incident: South Africa has one of the worst civil-rights histories of any nation in the industrialized world, due largely to their government's apartheid policies that kept the native majority black African population oppressed under a white minority for over 40 years and those policies were only just abolished 15 years ago (as of this writing).The alien creatures, derisively nicknamed ""prawns"" due to their appearance which is a combination of insect-iod and sea crustacean, in ""District 9"" could of course be seen as a stand-in for any oppressed people or immigration population. What's most disturbing about this set-up is that formerly oppressed black South Africans are amongst those speaking negatively against the prawns, that they live like animals and that they should go home (how they're supposed to do that exactly is never explained by the South African people) - they're partial to eating cat food - in District 9's crowded, run-down slums, of which could very easily be seen as any ghetto - from South Central L.A. to the Bronx to, well, Johannesburg, South Africa - which is of course ruled by a strong military/police presence.Things get underway in a mock-u-mentary-/documentary-style fashion involving the promotion of a hapless tool named Wikus van de Merwe (newcomer Sharlto Copley) from corporate office drone to field manager overseeing the relocation of the prawns from District 9 to a new home 240 kilometers away. Wikus is not your typical action movie hero; he demonstrates fairly early in the picture during the raids that he is in fact a coward, and only with his newfound status as relocation manager does he really seem to have any sense of power and authority over another life, human or alien. Without giving away too much of the plot, Wikus comes into contact with some potent alien bio-technology that quickly makes him an enemy of the state, and he is forced to go on the run into District 9 to evade his captors. It is here that he soon comes to discover, much to his horror, that he may very well be the only thing stopping a full-scale Earthbound intergalactic conflict between Us and Them, but more accurately, Their systematic annihilation by the powers-that-be in Johannesburg. And only then does he seem to make a gradual transition from coward to (marginal) hero.Peter Jackson (""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy) produced it, but the real strength of this picture lies within the watchful, socially conscious eye of director Neill Blomkamp. Blomkamp makes no attempt to hide the strong parallels between the events of ""District 9"" and human society. The allegory is pretty in-your-face, but the movie does not bog itself down too much in its real-life parallels. Instead, he plays on our emotions - he makes us feel for the prawns, no matter how disgusting they may appear to be, and their conditions, and to a lesser extent Wikus - and also lets us have it with some explosively violent action sequences in the last quarter of the film, all undercut with some sly, and pretty damn funny, social satire.Just as I wrote two years ago about ""Children of Men,"" ""District 9"" may yet be another link in the chain that will pull science fiction out of the gutter. This is by far the must-see sci-fi movie to see so far this century. I was genuinely moved by this picture, not just by its action sequences, but by the message, about our cruelest, basest instincts, and it's these qualities that makes Them far more sympathetic than Us. All I can say is that I'm glad I had the opportunity to see this film today, of all days.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
You are not welcome here.,"Just like last year's CLOVERFIELD, TriStar Pictures have surprisingly managed to avoid giving away too much of the film in the trailers and TV spots. This is fortunate, because this is one of those films that is better the less you know about it, like ORPHAN, A PERFECT GETAWAY, and KNOWING. To continue this trend, I'll try to give little to no information about the movie in this review. The movie is about an extraterrestrial race being forced to live in slum conditions in District 9. That may give you a very vague idea of what's in this film and that's all I'll reveal.I must also add that this is nothing like CLOVERFIELD nor BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. The film is shot documentary style for most of the first few minutes of the film, but, overall, it's a straightforward narrative. What makes this such a great film is that it's fresh and original in its approach. It's an effects-heavy flick, yes, but it has a heart and soul. It's not a dumb action flick like TRANSFORMERS 2 or G.I. JOE and, on top of that, it deals with themes like prejudice, apartheid, greed, and several others that is too numerous to list here.However, if you're not that kind of a person who likes themes or allegory in their action movies, the film can be seen as an entertaining action flick with a plot and characters. Newcomer Sharlto Copley certainly does a swell job playing a quite multi-layered character. He's our protagonist in this film. The visual effects are surprisingly seamless, considering the fact that it has a relatively low budget ($30 million to be exact). I also liked the unique design of the aliens.The length for this review is shorter than most of my other's because I want you to walk into this movie with a clean slate. This is one of the most inventive movies I've ever seen this year and it's a fresh and unique take with aliens coming to Earth. After all, they didn't land in New York. The film is carried by a strong performance by Copley as well as a fantastic directorial debut by Neill Blomkamp. It also deals with some heavy subject matter, unusual for a summer flick, but it also has all the action that will satisfy your needs.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
First Rate Science Fiction,"Science fiction is often perceived as a genre dominated by explosions and spacecraft chases strung together by mere whispers of plot. However, there are some science fiction films that transcend this stereotype and use the genre as a forum to discuss a larger issue. District 9 belongs to this upper echelon of science fiction movies.Written and directed by Neill Blomkamp, District 9 transports us to world where aliens referred to as Prawns have landed on earth some twenty years ago and after the tension between the two races escalates to violence, the slum District 9 is created to house the Prawns. This is the backdrop of this incredibly well crafted story. The actual plot I will not discuss, as it is better to walk into District 9 knowing as little as possible. District 9 achieves an incredible balancing act that few blockbusters even attempt. It is blends science fiction and political drama flawlessly, fusing them together with a healthy does of in your face action and violence.Blomkamp's script does not shy away from the complex and deep themes that drive the film. Running just under two hours, the film has a brisk pace but is by no means in a hurry. Blomkamp takes the time to set up a believable political and social backdrop for the mayhem to ensue. And even as the bullets fly and spectacular action sequences unfold, it still never loses sight of it's original intentions. That being said, District 9 is no pensive drama, it's a solid action film. It just so happens to have something to say as well.Filmed for an amazingly cheap 30 million dollars, District 9 is a sight to behold. The film looks and sounds amazing. The films star, first time actor Sharlto Copley does an outstanding job as the film's hero Wikus. The performances are strong and fill out this completely convincing reality.District 9 is both exciting and thought provoking. Something few blockbusters can manage. It is without a doubt, a must see film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Exciting concept and committed storytelling triumph,"Alien invasion stories can often seem a bit far-fetched, but making a great action movie with a compelling story for just $30 million shouldn't. If ""District 9"" scores at the box office, maybe it will drive home to Hollywood that eternal message that great films come from great stories. ""District 9"" is a sci-fi movie that takes a great concept and runs with it behind committed visionaries who believe completely in what they're doing. If carefree producers with fat checkbooks had been involved, this story of aliens stranded in Johannesburg, South Africa, forced by the government to live in slums would feel about as hokey as ""Starship Troopers."" Instead, it's a gripping action blockbuster accompanied by a running social commentary.The only big name attached to ""District 9"" is producer Peter Jackson (""Lord of the Rings""). South-African born Director Neill Blomkamp makes his debut based on a script he wrote with friend Terri Tatchell. The star is Sharlto Copley, who you've also never heard of before. So aside from Jackson, what's the draw? Blomkamp's premise will simply capture your imagination and glue your interest. Most people can't sell a film with just that, but Blomkamp is so firmly in control of this fictional scenario that anyone can easily believe it for just a couple hours. If you think you can tell that from the trailers, just wait, there's more.Starting out as a fictional documentary, ""District 9"" explains how the aliens, termed ""prawns"" for their shrimp-like appearance, showed up hovering over Johannesburg in their mothership and were eventually forced to relocate to Earth. The South African government gave policing permission to Multi-National United, a corp that claimed it wanted to study the species scientifically, when it was chiefly interested in decoding its incredible weapons technology.Eventually the film shifts gears into full-out action mode as Wikus van de Merwe (Copley), who was put in charge of a new operation to relocate the prawns 200 kilometers outside of the city in new refugee-type camps for MNU, becomes infected by an alien substance, making him a walking piece of scientific research.Carrying the historical weight of Apartheid in South Africa, ""District 9"" essentially plays out a social drama in many aspects, wondering exactly how things might turn out if aliens came to Earth without the goal of taking over our planet. How would we treat them? Segregate them? Kill them without just cause? There are several bumps on the road to fully realizing this concept, but the idea of it and the details Blomkamp gives the aliens -- such as an affinity for rubber and an almost drug-like addiction to cat food -- cover up the mistakes with ease, keeping you interested in what's going to happen next or what else you might learn about the aliens and their circumstances.As an action film, ""District 9"" picks up halfway through, giving plenty of blood-soaring body- dismembering gore (sometimes to a comical degree) to those viewers that bought tickets just to get what they expected from the genre. It does not cheat those looking for just entertainment. But ""District 9"" clearly strives to earn more respect with its audience. The movie doesn't flaunt its weapons inventions, for example, but incorporates them naturally into the plot in order to generate intrigue, then pulling the trigger and giving us the long- awaited spectacle.It's the kind of respect that a serious storyteller has for his or her audience, and Blomkamp has it. Many plot points and dialogue exchanges are predictable, but the presentation is highly original and the concept is fresh, modern and head-smart compared to the '90s garbage of ""Independence Day"" and ""Men in Black,"" as wildly popular as those films were. The documentary feel and the hand-held camera action might be the trappings of low budget, but they really tell this story in unique riveting fashion.It amazes me that Michael Bay can take $200 million and make the dizzying piece of scrap metal that was ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen,"" yet an unknown pal of Peter Jackson can take less than a quarter of that money and make thought-provoking and exciting science-fiction with some of 2009's most original storytelling.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Profound. Breathtaking. Flawless.,"I've seen many good movies lately, with a breath-taking effect and with well written stories. I've seen them many but I never lived one myself.Not until today.Watching District 9 turned out to be more than enjoying a show at the cinema. More than making your heart pump the blood times faster. Even more than believing what you see. Watching District 9 means living it to the point where you have no doubt that what is happening there is an absolute imminent reality, even though you never saw an alien before. And this is just the beginning -- what really makes your stomach freeze is the idea that while you hate those people in the movie, you realize that they're so much like you. At times the movie might be depressing, but the counterweight of this, which is much more important, is its purpose: to make you think.Thumbs up, hats down, amazing work, beautiful actors, perfect screenplay, I love this movie.Slavic",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Forget Phoning Home,"Honestly, when I first saw the trailer for 'District 9' in the theatre I thought it was either one of those commercials for people to cease calling/texting during the theatre (I half expected the somewhat fake looking alien to pull out a cell or bash someone making a call) or an advertisement for the upcoming 'V' reboot. I was surprised that it was an actual movie, and since it looked fake and definitively unoriginal, I was going to skip it. I decided to give it a chance due to the very high ratings. Boy, I couldn't have been anymore wrong on all points. Fake looking? Not when you watch the movie and learn to see them as living beings. Unoriginal? Sure, it was part 'Cloverfield,' 'The Fly' (1986), 'Diary of the Dead,' and, not surprisingly, a lot of Jackson's previous involvements, such as 'Dead Alive.' But it took all the right ingredients and wonderfully spliced them together. Overall, it's an extreme human story, albeit the negative side, from either the aliens (or prawns) or human's POV. So negative, in fact, you honestly yearn to hope for something good to happen, but alas, it's based solely on human's dark side and history. If anyone leaves this and thinks this would never happen, good luck. Prejudices and hate are part of our nature, unfortunately, and unlike fictional tales such as 'Star Trek,' though entertaining and positive, 'District 9' truly showed honesty in how selfish and small we are. Despite some flaws (such as why a wanted man's security codes weren't revoked) it was truly a great movie: action, suspense, creativity – it never felt small budgeted; in fact, it was enormously realistic and horror/gore (it certainly earned its 'R' rating.) Certainly one of the best I've seen in 2009.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Alien Nation,"The film is an allegory of Apartheid in South Africa. District 9 is inspired by events in District 6, Cape Town during the apartheid era.District 9 has a mockumentary setting with interviews, news footage, and video from surveillance cameras.In a dystopian Johannesburg in South Africa; humans and aliens called 'prawns' live amongst each other.The 'prawns' live in government camps but a private security company is hired to move them to an internment camp.Neither humans or prawns are happy living with the other on the same ground and the prawns live in poor conditions and suffer intense discrimination and treated like third class people.Sharlto Copley plays the well meaning but dim bureaucrat and son in law of the boss of the private security firm.He has been the patsy appointed to handle the relocation to the internment camp but is sprayed by some fluid in a canister that the prawns were hiding which alters his DNA. Now the person who was the oppressor experiences life as the oppressed.The mockumentary format works very well in this film and it's Copley's performance that carries this film.Copley was unknown before this film, he really grabs the role and also fills it with a lot of humour. If it was not for him, it may had failed or just remain an obscure movie.The setting in South Africa is refreshing and the special effects are very good. Not everything in the story grabbed me, some of the characters were rather two dimensional.The parallel to the events of South Africa are obvious to older people outside of South Africa as it was a daily news story up to the early 1990s.However it is not entirely original as the film Alien Nation in 1988 had a similar theme regarding discrimination against aliens.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

District 9-Going to see it again,"""District 9"" is a science fiction film that clearly states a message in it's arc of story. Producer Peter Jackson and first time director Neil Blomkamp takes a documentary/mock""u""mentary approach that we should understand other unknown species, we should protect strange lifeforms that come in our science laboratories and we should envict, protect and care for illegal human aliens who get a free ride into the country without being a licensed citizen and can't find a way to live on money because their jobless , that is the reality we have to face.The fantasy of this movie is the fictional South African character Wikus Van De Merwe played by Sharlto Copley who gets picked upon as the head of the Department of Alien Affairs at Multi-National United Environmental Corporation in Johannesburg, South Africa to do a job. Wikus and his G-Men are going to drive out to the District 9 colony where these so called aliens nicknamed ""prawns"" have been living there for the last 28 years and now all the general population people want them out of the city, but MNU is buildung a facility called District 10 to keep these aliens away from the busy day lives of Earthlings. MNU has these big over-sized motor vehicles to keep them safe. The District 9 Colony is a junkyard and I mean a junkyard. These aliens who look like grasshoppers, shrimp and lobster tails with a over-sized tunic on their bodies need a reality check but they also need protection and possibly death. Some of them have children. While Wikus is their he finds a Nigerian soldier who is guarding the District 9 colony and only asks for money and aims a weapon at him. The third act of this movie is a action-packed thrill ride. Wikus transports himself with the alien spacecraft to the mother ship but does not succeed.With all the hype out their and all the fanboyism ""movies"" this summer, ""District 9"" is a film that will be understood by the general population if you the moviegoer ""tells them what I just explained to you"".Peter Jackson is a genius. Him as a producer is going to be what really sells this movie. Move over ""Lord of the Rings""(joking because I'm a fan of that movie) because there's a newbie in town. Director Neil Blomkamp is also the genius storywriter.

"Mud, blood, crud, and genius","District 9 (R, 1:52) — 9 — SF, 2nd string, originalYears ago I read a story by Joan D. Vinge (possibly ""The Outcasts of Heaven Belt""?) that was set on a decrepit old space station. Metal was rusted. Walkways were worn. Things were broken. Stuff didn't work. ""Yessss!"", I said to myself, ""this is the way things would really be, not all shiny and efficient the way they're usually portrayed."" And, when it comes to SF movies, by ""usually"" I mean ""always"".Until now.District 9 is grittily realistic. It's smeared with mud, covered with blood, and littered with crud. It's set in a slum and totally looks it. This alone would make it stand out from a crowd sufficiently to be remembered distinctly a decade from now, which is the minimal requirement I have for a 9 rating.But it gets better. While the slum is on the outskirts of Johannesburg, South Africa, it's occupied not by the traditionally oppressed black people of that nation but by an alien race that undoubtedly has a name for itself but which is known to the humans as prawns, based on their appearance — human-sized and bipedal, but with features like a cross between a shrimp and a cockroach. The humans speak nothing but Afrikaans-accented English, and the prawns speak in their own guttural, croaking tongue (with subtitles), but we focus on characters of both races who have previously interacted with each other, so they're mutually intelligible.The prawns are a desperate lot. Their gargantuan starship is parked above Joburg, where it's been stranded since 1982. It came to rest there and, after months of inactivity, humans had to cut their way in, where they discovered about a million starving, sickly aliens, apparently workers (or maybe slaves) on their way to someplace else, none of whom has the vaguest idea of where they are or how to run a spaceship. Out of humanitarian concern, the international community moves them into a refugee camp in the shadow of their spacecraft.We advance to 2010, by which time most of humanity has turned its attention elsewhere but the South Africans haven't been able to, since District 9 and its now 1.8 million alien refugees are a constant presence — and possible threat. The government hires international megacorp MNU (Multi-National United) to relocate them to District 10, a much more comfortable 240 km away.We see most of this in what appears to be documentary film and video clips, and that style continues as we follow MNU's Wikus Van De Merwe, head of the relocation team, as he begins the bureaucratic process of serving eviction notices. Things do not go well. Wikus is separated from the rest of his team and (without giving too much away) ends up in personal possession of the secret behind the aliens' weaponry, something that had baffled Earth scientists since they 1st tried to decipher the highly effective technology decades earlier. This makes Wikus a marked man, wanted by MNU, the government, the Nigerian crime lords who control commerce within District 9, and the prawns anxious to get their secrets back. Left with nowhere to run, Wikus finds an unlikely ally in ""Christopher"", a prawn with a bright, curious tagalong offspring. (Wikus refers to them both as male, but it's not at all clear that the term is either applicable or relevant.)The video-clip style continues with the use of surveillance cameras and TV newscopter footage, but eventually that style fades out in favor of straight filming, albeit with a continuing hand-held style that's highly effective for the chaotic events depicted.Again, the movie goes for a look and feel that are totally realistic, and it achieves those goals. It's riveting. It meets John W. Campbell's challenge to ""describe to me an alien that thinks as well as a man but not like a man"". The prawns are as memorable as Niven and Pournelle's moties.While you've undoubtedly never heard of writer-director Neill Blomkamp before, nor any of the highly effective actors (notably Sharlto Copley as Wikus), the names of the producers and FX house may ring some bells: Philippa Boyens, Peter Jackson, and Weta Digital. Yes, just as good as you'd expect.This is an absolute mustn't-miss film for SF fans and is likely to redefine our expectations for future SF films at least as much as The Matrix did.

District 9,"Ever since I saw Elysium last year, I have been obsessed with its director, Neill Blomkamp, and one of its lead actors, Sharlto Copley. Once I found out they did another film together I was thrilled. I immediately bought it and watched it. The film was District 9. District 9 takes place in a post alien arrival in Johannesburg. This film was better than all of the other Neill Blomkamp's movies and other sci- fi movies I have seen. Through the use of different camera styles, sounds, and lighting, District 9 has unique scenes that make a marvelous film.A quick synopsis of the film is aliens arrived in Johannesburg in the early 80's. They were stuck on their ship and became refugees in South Africa. Fast forward 20 years, the aliens and human population are at war with one another. The film focuses on a Multi-National United (MNU) worker, Wikus Van de Merwe (Copley), and his day evicting the aliens from their refugee camp, District 9. District 9 uses a variety of camera perspectives to produce a unique feel to different scenes. For example, there are many scenes of family members, co-workers, and professionals describing events that occurred throughout the film. The interviews are similar to a documentary that you would see on the History Channel. There are also scenes that are shot like surveillance footage. The surveillance scenes provides a live action feel which makes the audience believe it is in the moment and there is no time for the main character to think. The interviews and raw footage set the stage for District 9 and bestows a powerful element on the film. Sound was another key element that created such a miraculous film. The use of sound was used very wisely. Instead of having the typical shrieking noise to build up to the intense scene, District 9 has background noise and drum beats. The background noise and drumbeats would increase steadily, giving the viewer the feeling that something bad was about to happen. After building up a scene with sound, District 9 changed the sound completely by changing its tempo once it reached the climax of the scene. A common sound used was loud helicopter noise. The helicopter noise made you feel the intensity of the chase that Wikus was experiencing. Sound is a technique that is often used the same way in films but District 9 brings a whole new level to sound in cinema.Sound was not the only component used to develop this alien infested world, the use of lighting created a very dramatic mood throughout the film. There is ominous lighting through the introduction, giving a feel that something is about to go drastically wrong. It is very dark and eerie. However, the lighting changes in a blink of an eye. An illustration of this is after Wikus is attacked; the film has bright lights showing Wikus' disorientation. The scene also includes the sound of ringing in your ears which also demonstrates how disoriented he is.District 9 uses a fantastic combination of cinematic techniques that make it a masterpiece. It will change your view point on sci-fi films. District 9 has brought sci-fi films in to a new era of sophistication. You will want to watch this film over and over again –hoping that the sequel comes soon. District 9 has created a new level of sci-fi cinema.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
One of the better Sci-Fi Movies lately,"District 9 is the story of what happens when aliens come to South Africa and become refugees. The story picks up 20 years after the aliens have arrived on Earth and the movie can be divided into two sections. The first section is shot like a documentary, which is where we are given all the background information we need to understand the story. The second half of the movie is more like your typical Action Sci-Fi movie with documentary scenes laced into the action.Over all the film aspires to do two things. One is to comment on how man kind is capable of severely inhumane treatment of others. The aliens are used in the film to reflect the way that Apartheid effected South Africa, and on a larger scale how segregation and ignorance is practiced by man on a wide scale. The other thing that appears to be what they wanted to do was to show off their skills with special effects. This film has some of the best CGI I've seen in years! It is seamless how it blends images created on a computer and real life. This brings me to my first of three problems with the movie. There was more gore in this movie than in most Sci-Fi movies. Now, I'm not squeamish about gore one bit, but there was no reason for it in the movie. The only purpose it served was to show off their skills with CGI. My second problem with the movie was that while he kind of is a bumbling corporate drone, Wikus is not a character you care about. He's constantly abusive to the aliens in the film, and never is motivated by anything but his own selfishness until the very end of the movie. Now, I didn't hate Wikus, but I didn't really feel a deep connection to the character or his plight. The third problem was that the movie never fulfills it's goal from the beginning of the movie to talk about social issues like Apartheid, and instead switches tracks into an Action movie.In the end District 9 is entertaining and probably one of the better Sci-Fi films to come out recently. However, there are a few problems within the film that weaken its overall impact. The idea of the film and the way it was made is excellently done, but that fails to push the movie over the edge. It's absolutely one of the better films to come out this summer, and worth a look, but be prepared because it's not what you would expect. After all, there are a lot of secrets in District 9.Review Written by Josh for http://www.overcranked.net Visit us for more movie and video game reviews!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"The explosions, the slimy bugs, the mechanical battle suits, the laser beams — well, they all look good, but we've seen the like before","There is nothing wrong with making an alien movie. There's nothing wrong with making an action movie either. And there's most certainly nothing wrong with combining these two elements togetherunless you stress the wrong points too much and the good points not enough. And that was the case, for me anyway, with ""District 9."" This is by no means a bad movie, but it contains too much of a been-there, done-that feeling and it's a real shame because the movie's premise contains some strong imagination and a surefire promise, but it doesn't quite deliver. As an action movie, it fulfills its purpose, but as a science-fiction original, it struggles a bit.I loved the plot of ""District 9."" Twenty years ago, an alien spaceship the size of a city descended over a city in Nigeria and then suspends there for two decades. Scientists manage to get onboard the ship and discover a civilization of intelligent, but helpless insect-like creatures. After the local Nigerians refuse to live with the creatures in peace, they are moved to District 9, sort of their alien ghetto, I guess you could say. The man in charge of District 9 (Sharlto Copley), while trying to serve an eviction notice on the aliens, becomes infected by one of their chemicals and very slowly begins to transform into one of them and thus becomes the subject of a vicious manhunt led by a bug-hating colonel played by David James.Unfortunately, the promise of the premise amplifies the disappointment, I'm afraid, of ""District 9."" From this plot, we expect a strong, original, imagination-packed modern-day science-fiction classic. And during some parts, it displays those qualities. But the filmmakers made a mistake. Instead of developing these truly fascinating elements, they decided to in the end just degenerate the movie into a standard action movie where blood is sprayed and things blow up with no point and with no purpose. And as a result, we get that been there, done that feeling. The special effects? They're as good as they could be. This is just the sort of movie to see with surround sound. The pyrotechnics and CGI are absolutely fabulous with very few faults. But then again, good special effects in Hollywood is simply a package order. The explosions, the slimy bugs, the mechanical battle suits, the laser beams—well, they all look good, but we've seen the like before.What would have really made this movie wonderful would have been to explore the nature of these aliens, for they are a lot more interesting (and a lot more likable) than the stereotypical characters that populate the cast. The movie does take the liberty of giving them some development, but not nearly enough I'm afraid. It just tends to resort to blowing things up and painting more CGI on the screen.Another thing that bothered me was that there were no interesting characters. Sharlto Copley does a fine job playing the protagonist, but he's left to moan, weep, and curse instead of fleshing out what could have been a fascinating character. He doesn't have any real connection to his wife or to the aliens or to the bad guys, who I'm afraid, are so stereotypical that they might even be insulting. There was one character in particular, a Nigerian played by Eugene Khumbanyiwa who simply drove me crazy. And it's okay, I suppose, to have a menacing-looking Australian play the bad colonel, but to have everybody in his command be vulgar-happy Australians might also generate some disappointment in the audience.Once again, ""District 9"" is not a bad movie. It has some strong action scenes and if that's all you're looking for, you won't be disappointed. Me, I was wanting something a little more powerful with a little more imagination. I want Hollywood to realize that although audiences can enjoy an action movie, they can enjoy one more if it focuses on more than just blowing things up and showing off the latest special effects package in ILM.Rating: 2.5/4",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Thoughtful, violent, awesome sci-fi flick","This movie starts off in a bit of a jarring style, like an episode of ""COPS"" meets ""the X-Files"" meets CNN as it fills in the background of the story: Alien ship hovers over Johannesburg, earth people eventually decide to intercept it, finding scores of malnourished and sick aliens aboard. These aliens are taken to the planet surface and interred at a fenced in area known as District 9. Twenty years go by, the aliens live among the trash in what has grown into a crowded slum. Enter the new head of the ""eviction"" process, Wikus Van De Merwe. This eviction is designed to move all these cat-food eating trash-dwelling aliens into a facilitywell, a little further away from the city. What follows is then a terrifying story about transformation, violence, intolerance, and ultimately, salvation. At times this is a hard movie to watch, with all the vomiting and noise and very jarring narrative style. It settles in to a more conventional story about halfway through, as we see the main character and an alien named ""Christopher"" working together, and then we see the horror inflicted upon the aliens in District 9. There is a lot to like here. This is a visually interesting movie with a lot of real-world parallels, and it has many elements of other sci-fi: Alien Nation, Aliens, Transformers, The X-Files, and maybe any number of Outer Limits episodes come to mind. I wouldn't recommend it to everyone, but anyone who is into thoughtful science-fiction should definitely check it out.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Could of been more,"I gave this movie a 6 out of 10 because 60% of the movie was fantastic and after that the movie kinda just dropped a good idea. I watched the movie and was falling in love from the atmosphere of the movie. The whole concept was really cool. Right up to about the 40-50 min marker I started to lose it. It seemed like they went to high up with a good idea and tried to hit the ground as fast as they could in a certain time frame to reach a conclusion. The fact they had the soldier that never died, the indecisive save him or not save him, the ridiculous battle scenes and just the obvious visual that the end of the movie was meant to be ostentatious. It seemed the director spent a huge pretty penny just to, ""ooo and ah"" people right at the end. Who knows, maybe just wanted to use Peter Jackson's pretty toys.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

A classic in the making.,"Modern warfare is a tough genre to master in terms of film. There's no doubt about it. What's even tougher is futuristic warfare, especially when dealing with aliens. When it comes to that, it's easy to make mistakes and make your film extremely cheesy, unrealistic, and boring. Fortunately, Neill Blomkamp's ""District 9"" is none of those things, and may be one of the most innovative and genre defining films of all time. I might even go as far to say that it's the most innovative and potentially classic science fiction film of the decade. ""District 9"" is immersing and absorbing in the beginning, and once Neill Blomkamp firmly grounds us in his reality, he takes us on one of the most exciting action packed rides I've ever been through.I think one of the major selling points of this one is the extreme realism. Like ""Cloverfield"", it starts out as a documentary style film, however, the interviewed subjects tell the story in retrospect, as the events of the movie have already occurred when they are being interviewed. The hand-held camera is always present, though the film doesn't rely on it for cheap effects, nor does it remain a pure ""day in the life"" type of film that ""Cloverfield"" did. It tells a compelling story that is never cliché, and the narrative is what ultimately drives the film, not the action...which is more than I can say for most of the recent science fiction ""films"".The story here is more than just about the alien presence on Earth. It's a common story: a fight for survival, on both sides. Both the humans and the aliens are unfamiliar with each other, therefore it results in the more powerful of the races (the humans), almost enslaving the aliens into a pseudo-prison, District 9. Rather than taking the cliché action movie approach, Blomkamp's incredible storytelling ability allows him to focus on a select story within this massive existence. ""District 9"" is so immersed in an alternate reality that Blomkamp could easily tell numerous stories from within this world he has constructed, but he chose the most human and natural of stories to connect to the audience with. It is because of this that the audience not only becomes totally pulled in by the story, but is able to connect with the characters on a different level, especially the non-humans. There are clever parallels between this and modern racism, apartheid, and of course, World War II, but the similarities are never broadcast right into the viewers face, so it is acceptable.It really is rare to find a film that tells such an immersing story that ensnares the viewer in addition to providing top of the line entertainment. If you're looking for the most thrilling action of the year, look no further. Forget about mutant humans, transforming alien robots, Skynet, or teenage wizards. Blomkamp's simply stellar direction makes the last 40 minutes of the movie one of the most riveting 40 minutes of any movie I have ever seen. While the film is a bit slow in the beginning as Blomkamp sets the foundation for his immersing reality, the final act of the film is almost non-stop action that will have you on the edge of your seat.""District 9"" is definitely amongst the most well made movies I've ever seen. The aliens, while they might look like colorful ripoffs of the main villain from Men In Black, are incredibly detailed and meticulously put together. You really can't tell if it's CGI or a guy in a very well made suit. The set decoration and art direction...wow. You want to see what a slum looks like, forget about ""Slumdog Millionaire"", it's this one. The titular District is part of what makes the film so realistic, and the look of everything in it is simply stellar. Makeup also plays a large role in the film, and it is very well done. ""District 9"" also has an incredible sound mix and edit going on. To put it simple, it's definitely one you need to catch in the theater. I'm not really going to discuss the acting in the film, though I will say the film's protagonist and antagonists were all very good, well written characters with very human and realistic actions running through them. In the end, however, despite all these other great benefits it has, ""District 9"" is driven by the story to the very end.I really believe that I watched a classic tonight. It's a film that will revolutionize everything we know about the classic ""alien invasion"" story, and carve out its place amongst the all time action classics like ""The Terminator"". In fact, in the end, I felt like ""District 9"" was a ""Terminator"" for the modern age (I'm not talking about the two post-2000 entries in the series). The film is a can't miss for anyone who enjoys science fiction, or the art of film-making. I really can't find a flaw in this incredible work from Neill Blomkamp.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A Gritty Commentary. And Much More.,"What a choice to pick Johannseburg as the setting. It really set the stage for a very poignant film on society, while incorporating lots of actions, especially towards the end. It's obviously a statement on apartheid in South Africa, with the aliens playing the role of the discriminated race. It's about how in any society slums develop, how crime explodes, how certain people take power over others and control them (in this case, the Nigerians over the aliens). It's about government corruption and how we have no power to stop it sometimes. It's all about that. And what a backdrop to put it in.But there's so much more than that. It's also about betrayal, loyalty, trust, relationships, and sheer kickassness. It's about doing what is best for everyone, and not just yourself. The whole movie had a thread about selfishness, which I found extremely affecting. District 9 is about capturing the raw grittiness of all these elements (it frequently uses security camera footage, camcorders, and more), about the aliens, about the humans, about how we're not all that different. Just look at the aliens' eyes. They show just as much emotion.But don't overlook the action part. It is full of great action sequences, though it builds slowly. I love how the blood splurts on the camera. Yes, it is quite violent, but it's a good for a kick. Some of the death scenes are quite awesome and pretty funny, actually. The war scenes are very well shot. There are many tender and emotional scenes as well, particularly the end. There are father-son overtones as well, and brother-brother too. My favorite aspect of the movie is the grand, epic sense/feel I get when we see the mothership, how it completely dwarfs the helicopters that fly to it. I love the endearing bass we hear ... and feel... when it moves. Great direction. The movie has a little bit of everything, with some very funny humour and a fantastic ending, as I mentioned earlier.Yes, it's a commentary. But the director offers so much more. A fantastic viewing experience.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A metaphor of our society that represents the immorality of humans.,"This movie is a metaphor of our society that represents the immorality of humans with their prejudice, racism, concentration camps & inhumane experiments. Since the film has no stars, it's based entirely in South Africa, it contains a huge amount of graphic violence and it's shot in a documentary style; I find only a very selective audience will actually enjoy this movie.The visual effects were mind-boggling with its seamless interactions between the aliens & humans. The movie has some similarities to the 1986's film ""The Fly"" and your generic plot line of that specific lone humanistic alien that the audiences are rooting for. His son adds the sympathetic role so that we can easily relate to them.This film has parts that are unique & brilliant, but within a metaphorical story that we're all too familiar with; which at sometimes, runs as being unoriginal. The 2nd half of the movie is flooded with action sequences, where the visuals are very similar to watching a live-action video game; that at times, becomes a little too disoriented and messy.Even though I enjoyed this film and I was in awe in specific scenes, I don't find myself eager to be watching this movie again on home video.

The story shows some early promise of exploring deeper issues, such as the conditions of refugees around the world but then the movie turns into a fairly predictable action/drama. I did appreciate the lack of ridiculous dialog. It never felt like they created a scene just to insert a one-liner that could then become a trailer.

"A Visually Captivating Exploration of Humanity, Xenophobia, and Social Segregation","District 9 is a cinematic masterpiece that not only challenges the boundaries of storytelling but also delves deep into the heart of pertinent real-world issues. Directed by Neill Blomkamp, this visually stunning film seamlessly weaves together found footage, fictional interviews, news clips, and surveillance footage to deliver a thought-provoking narrative that leaves no stone unturned.Set in an alternate 1982 Johannesburg, South Africa, the film opens with the arrival of an otherworldly spaceship, triggering a chain of events that explore the complex themes of humanity, xenophobia, and social segregation. When a population of sick and malnourished insectoid aliens is discovered on the ship, the South African government takes action by confining them to an internment camp named District 9.Fast forward twenty years, and we find ourselves in the midst of the government's relocation effort for the aliens, now residing in another camp. This is where the story takes a fascinating twist as we meet Christopher Johnson, one of the confined aliens, who is desperately trying to escape Earth with his son and return to their home planet. Christopher's path crosses with Wikus van de Merwe, a bureaucrat leading the relocation efforts, leading to a collision of worlds and ideologies.The brilliance of District 9 lies not just in its captivating storytelling but in its ability to mirror real-world problems with astonishing clarity. The film's portrayal of segregation and xenophobia is deeply rooted in the historical context of apartheid-era South Africa, particularly inspired by the events in Cape Town's District Six. This connection adds layers of meaning to the narrative, making it a compelling commentary on the harsh realities faced by marginalized communities.Visually, District 9 is a triumph. The found footage format lends an air of authenticity to the storytelling, immersing viewers in a world that feels both familiar and eerily foreign. The use of CGI to bring the alien creatures to life is nothing short of breathtaking, making them more than just extraterrestrial entities but symbols of the ""other"" in our society.District 9 is not merely a film; it's a cinematic journey that forces us to confront uncomfortable truths about our own world. Its visual storytelling is a testament to the power of filmmaking as a medium for addressing pressing societal issues. Neill Blomkamp's creation is a work of art that will continue to resonate with audiences for generations, a reminder that cinema can be a mirror reflecting the best and worst of humanity. District 9 is a must-see, an unforgettable experience that will leave you questioning the boundaries of compassion and understanding.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Best movie experience ever. (No Spoilers),"I'd been following along keenly to all the news stories about this movie leading up to its release. I'd seen the trailers and advertising that teased something would be special about this film. And being a sci-fi fan it looked like someone was finally going to make an amazing 'what if...' style flick that was acted and filmed in a realistic manner.So I excitedly popped along to the New Zealand preview screening tonight in Wellington. All the while hoping some special guest like Richard Taylor from Weta would pop along. The head of Sony NZ pops out and says he'd like to introduce a special guest, and Peter Jackson walks out to spend about 10 minutes talking about the making of the film and how it came about due to the demise of Halo. He talked in depth about how they'd felt so bad for Neil that Halo had been canned by the studios and that they'd like to help him make another film.I am sad that Halo never came to fruition, but am over the moon that this movie was made instead. Never would Halo have been as raw and gritty as this. With a $100,000,000 plus budget the studios would never have allowed it. It would have been too much of a risk.This movie is an unflinching look at ourselves and speaks volumes about all the things that are wrong and right about being human. If you are in to science fiction that is really intelligent and entertains you with more than just amazing special effects and weapons (which this movie has in spades) you will be blown away by this. Go see it this weekend and show these corporations that this is the way to make movies, and they made a huge mistake to pull out on Neil and Peter.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

And a bigger ship hanging over the city streets of Johannesburg- the movie then showcases the local media asking reasons why they couldn't go back! As the movie progresses one of it's reporters Wikus played brilliantly by Sharlto Copley accidentally consumed some of it's liquid which turns his life completely around! Some of the obvious allegories or metaphors that are being shown here are the depiction of the rebels who want to cannibal the aliens to possess the aliens abilities so that they can operate their much advance weapons against the gov't and it's army in which the aliens can use. That scene reflects on an particular impoverished suburban area which impoverished doctors would make unproven claims that by eating the aliens arms or such would consist some of the aliens capabilities! The other obvious metaphor are the scientists using gov't money conducting experiments since the aliens intentions were not to attack any of the humans with the scientists exploiting that by conducting experiments on them just like Hitler and his doctors during WWII! But to write about all of the movies allegories and metaphors of this film would require a 3 page essay which is totally not necessary except to say that the idea of genocide has been spoken here.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Hilarious!,"This movie is a tongue-in-cheek comedy. I thought the opening scenes of the politically correct documentary approach to the ""nice"" aliens (ignoring their revolting appearance and table manners and their foul tempers) were hilarious. The Nigerian gangsters were gross caricatures of some very real personalities: I suppose they were operating the equivalent of a convenience store. The special effects and the aliens themselves looked pretty low budget but it didn't matter so long as you got into the spirit of the thing. The humour appeared to flag as the story progressed and it seemed that, contrary to many movies which, in desperation, mutate into comedy when the director realizes he is just not going to make it otherwise; this one becomes increasingly serious.The vast space-ship concept was impressive and quite credible.This is an utterly different genre from Alien or Blade-runner - bears no comparison.It's probably a little too long but is highly original and quite entertaining.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Hard-core prawn action.,"In a plot designed to mirror apartheid, a race of extraterrestrials arrive in Jo'burg where they are segregated from the humans in a ramshackle slum known as District 9. After 20 years, with tension rising between the races, it is decided that the aliens (known derisively as 'prawns') should be relocated further away from the city; city official Wikus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Copley) is given the task of overseeing the operation, but things go awry after he is exposed to alien biotechnology that slowly mutates his body.Writer/director Neill Blomkamp's first full length feature is such a technically slick film that it's is easy to forgive its glaring plot holes. The story can be picked apart like a king prawn, but Blomkamp's assured storytelling and expertise in visual effects ensure that, even though certain elements make little sense when given too much thought, the film is a thoroughly entertaining experience from start to finish. Solid performances (anyone who lets the South African accent bother them should stick to mainstream Hollywood films) and superb CGI (especially when considering the budget) go a long way to making this a hugely enjoyable piece of popcorn fun despite the obvious flaws.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
IMHO this movie doesn't live up to its hype,"I don't understand why so many have rated this film a 10 out of 10. I love good sci-fi, I think Jackson is a genius, but this is certainly not his best work. This film barely deserves a 7.There are many problems with this film but I don't wish to reveal any spoilers, so I will attempt to limit my words to non-specific elements.Clearly an allegory for apartheid/racism, this movie is so obvious with both location and the many absurd situations, it was almost shouting to the audience that they were too stupid to 'get it' and needed to be told or shown over and over throughout this film. But then, beyond belief, the very people for whom this allegory represent, are made to look repugnant or savage and unworthy of our sympathy.In terms of overall character development, it was poorly done. The lead character has no redeeming qualities, there are the stereotypical Rambo types, betrayals, and just a glimmer of real emotion in two of the many aliens.I also had a big problem with some very unrealistic depictions of these aliens and giving them too many negative human character traits to the point of absurdity.The acting was superb but unfortunately the story was illogical, incomplete, lazy plot devices, and too many plot holes.Questions or comments: 1. Why were there alien components scattered throughout the garbage? Why wouldn't the humans have collected their components first?; 2. Clearly, the aliens are more intelligent than humans. Yet they allowed the humans to take their weapons and subjugate them?; 3. The aliens preferred food sources are so ridiculous, it's comical. 4. The aliens reminded me too much of a certain video game character (this was unfortunately and apparently intentional).I am pretty sure Peter Jackson has also shot and will soon release District 10. I'm waiting Mr. Jackson.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Multi-culti disguised as sci-fi,"This film rather transparently deals with the apartheid era in South Africa, with a wider message on immigration today, only blacks/immigrants/whoever are portrayed as aliens. The living conditions of the aliens, forced on them by the human population, is so accurately modeled on the living conditions of blacks under apartheid as to leave no room for confusion. This message is largely delivered through the main 'alien' character, who serves to remind that despite a group's manifest loutish behaviour, said group is nevertheless composed of intelligent and noble individuals. Also, inevitably, it is revealed that the master race (humans) are much worse than the downtrodden louts (aliens). The final message, the possibility of a declaration of war on the human race by the alien race in retaliation for mistreatment is again a rather transparent multiculti social message: Treat us well or when we are in the driving seat we are going to treat you badly - or alternately this can be construed as justification for what is happening in post-apartheid South Africa.The film is fast paced and exciting, and no doubt thoroughly enjoyable for anyone able to ignore or stay unconscious of the film's political message. It would be much more enjoyable (and original) if the film had left multicultural politics behind it and accurately focused on the issues that would arise between humans and aliens. In this respect 'Mars Attacks' achieves more - which is saying something.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Original sci-fi flick,Refreshing sci-fi. Sharlto Copley is awesome as Wikus.,9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Some amazing 45 minutes of film-making.,"A terribly smart idea turned a terrible cliché after half of its running time, while having masterfully avoided that for almost an hour.The movie's historical references are crystal clear since the very first seconds and they never start being forced on the characters : all of the period-1 scenes feel incredibly genuine thanks to the outstanding perfomances (especially valid for Sharlto's), the revolutionary visual and special effects and, maybe most importantly, the writing, which gets completely thrown in the dumpster when the movie surprisingly turns into everything it was strongly trying to avoid in its beggining : being something that people had already seen.Overall, however, this is an important piece of art and an easily-comprehendable lesson on the various exploitations perpetuated throughout history and, in my opinion, needs to be seen.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
An underrated classic!,"I have seen dozens of alien invasion thrillers, but this still stands out as one distinctively unique affair even after fourteen years since its theatrical release.Unlike almost every Alien feature, it does not show the creatures in a one-dimensional light. The script instead emphasised giving them human-like persona so that they could conduct and express themselves like human beings. That, in my opinion, made this whole story, as well as the entire setup, more intriguing.Furthermore, the way Neill Blomkamp (the director) handled the intricacies is commendable, to say the very least-the 'Crowning Jewel' in his filmography.P. S. I would love to see a sequel. Make it happen.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Looked great but a bit boring,"District 9 is a film that is shot incredibly well and it does look amazing. The action towards the end is quite good but on the whole it was just a bit boring. I thought the film was supposed to be full of violence and gore? Well the blood from the 'prawns' just didn't look realistic at all. The human characters weren't that great but I really liked Christoper and the baby prawn.The plot was solid and the potential was there. I just think it could've been executed better. It was shot a bit 'documentary style' which I didn't really like and the camera seemed shaky. The film did get better when it got into the main story but I feel it could've been so much more, I wanted more action. The story did seem a bit mixed up as well. It was one of them films that I wanted to love, but it just didn't hit the spot for me.Overall it was quite a disappointment, although it did look amazing. It isn't something I would watch again but I can appreciate why others rate it so highly.5/10.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Great trailers,dull movie","I loved the trailers for this movie and really made an effort to go see it when it the first weekend it came out.I rarely go see movies at theaters and almost never try to go the first weekend one opens but this one looked cool so I gave up a Saturday night to go see it.A huge alien spacecraft becomes disabled and its one million occupants ,yes one million,are put in camps,sort of like the camps where human refugees are put now.The big mother craft just hangs up in the sky low to the ground unable to move.Soon the camps become like any other camp where beings are forced to live in squalid conditions--crime ridden and violence filled hell holes.The aliens are sort of big insect looking things.Most of the movie is told from the viewpoint of the man who was put in charge of relocating the aliens when the camp becomes too much of a problem being located near a large human population.I didn't really understand why a million of these things would be flying around in space and how you would get a million in the spacecraft they came to Earth with.Their home planet apparently wasn't destroyed because some of the more industrious aliens were trying to get back to the mother ship and fix it so they could get back home.And they can build this incredible massive flying craft then they appear stupid and lazy when the are in the camps....eating cans of cat food which were used as currency in some cases,and also eating old tires.The whole cat food business was just stupid and silly and distracting.I think I would have liked the movie better had the aliens been more menacing,instead of the dullards they were.The film is done in a sort of documentary type although it doesn't hold too strictly to this style.The action is good when it finally starts and the special effects are pretty cool with space guns that explode people and stuff like that.And the big space craft looked cool hanging in the sky.But overall the movie was rather bland and boring in dealing with this problem of space alien refugees.Maybe the whole point was to deal with these aliens like we humans deal with other human refugees but if you are going to do that why use space aliens? This wasn't a bad film.It just didn't live up to it's potential and certainly not to it's trailers.I wish I had my $8.25 back I paid to see this movie.That would rent me 4 DVDs of movies that would be at least,if not more,interesting than this movie was.I gave this movie a six which to me means a decent watchable film but nothing that you'll remember as being extraordinary enough to go out and buy when it's released to DVD.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"""District 9""","""District 9"" has all the subtlety of an exploding carcass. Neil Blomkamp's UFO apartheid metaphor sounds in theory like the sort of relevant, sophisticated shot in the arm the science fiction blockbuster needs, and addresses some very important issues beneath the laser shoot-outs and gooey, extrapolating body matter, but suffers from ham-fisted pretension when digging below its surface.The film has smart people behind the lens but condescendingly assumes the other side their antithesis. The characters, especially our protagonist, government operative Wilkus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Copley), lack dimension and rationale, presented as either broad caricatures of racist idealism or doe-eyed alien innocents. The audience, however, is guessed simpler still. The movie's humans have inexplicably learned to comprehend the alien tongue (and vice versa) but we're not even trusted to follow an English conversation with South African dialect without the aid of subtitles.The movie's delusions of grandeur are its greatest flaw, and like ""Paper Heart,"" the documentary elements of the film supplement a thoroughly average narrative. Blomkamp's intentions may be nobler than those of comparable popcorn flicks, but the execution is just as forgettable, its impression just as transient. And though ""District 9"" was advertised heavily as a documentary, the film itself is a mixed media experiment, unmotivated camera placement and all. Conventional action is shot in a hand-held documentary style, and any insightful social commentary is relegated to the back burner when things blow up, and they frequently do.""District 9"" is not without its merits, however. The visuals are (usually) impressive, with the foggy, leering mother ship subtly creeping into the edges of shots, and convincing facial detail for the prawns. The effects falter only occasionally (in a ""Star Wars: Special Edition"" kind of way) in wider shots where the aliens occupy the same space as the humans or we see their narrow, multi-jointed legs: they don't quite exist on the same plane as the rest of the world.Blomkamp's direction is stronger than his pretentious writing, and individual sequences excel at creating excitement and suspense. However, the oversimplification of the underlying message and the on-the-nose symbolism make most scenes too generic to be profound, and when an investigatory mistake begins transforming Wilkus into a prawn (a derogatory term for the other-worlders), the plot becomes less a detailed examination of an intriguing supposition than a hodgepodge of schlocky action sequences and allusions to John Howard Griffin's ""Black Like Me"" and David Cronenberg's ""The Fly.""Based on the director's six minute 2005 short ""Alive in Joburg,"" ""District 9"" ultimately gasps for identity over the nearly two hour running time. With its smattering of documentary-esquire interview footage, conventional narrative sequences, and gory action, there's not a want for material so much as there is for thematic singularity. Employing a foundation more relevant than Campbell's mono-myth is a welcome template for a modern science fiction film, but ""District 9"" brings as many clichés to the table as innovations.The film is by no means a poor way to spend a few hours at the multiplex, but is hardly the poignant masterpiece others have hailed it as.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
An unexpected delight,"I'm not a sci-fi buff,in fact I normally avoid films of the genre, but Icame to it after catching just a few minutes of a failed TV recording. By sheer coincidence I found it the next day in a charity shop at a give-away price, The best money I've ever spent.It benefits enormously by not being American; this would have been awful if produced by an American file studio. Instead, its documentary style, with all kinds of political and moral undertones, manages to be both brutal and humane at the same time.

Humanity's intolerance emerges after the arrival of an alien spaceship,"Just saw this in a two-thirds full screening, and while it was very enjoyable I don't think it's quite the masterpiece some are saying it is(as it's not as impeccable as it could be on all levels) and here's my reasons why:Acting: Copley is very believable as a oblivious worker then desperate, reluctant anti-hero later on. His raw emotions were really well done, though his accent, especially when swearing might leave some people in fits of giggles, as it does sound somewhat Scottish and a few other British accents. It's a perfectly authentic South African accent, though.Unfortunately, Haywood, who plays his wife, is unconvincing. Her emotional scenes merely look contrived, as if she's very much out of her depth and can't deliver the feelings required.Plot: Because this moves at such a breakneck place, I'm sure keen-eyed viewers will spot plot holes aplenty. It's too rushed in places, and I actually got slight headache from the shaky cam in the doc segments and the speed of some shots. Slowing down to appreciate in the non-doc segments where appropriate would've helped maybe. Most of the fast pacing did give it a sense of heightened urgency, though.The doc segments feel jarring as well, in their transition. Maybe book ending the film with them would've worked better. This structure could be hit or miss with audiences.There's your clichéd MNU soldiers (especially a particularly wicked, merciless one) and a Nigerian criminal overlord, obsessed with voodoo. They're archetypes. Stock villains. Stereotypical antagonists that feel too banal and one-note for a film that aims for realism.The main character could split opinions as some may route for him after his personality transforms, and others not. He's morally grey and not as clear cut as we initially think.Conversely, it's good points are how emotive these aliens seem yet they're completely not from this world. The main one, Christopher especially is the 'prawn' I completely emotionally invested in.The aliens have a strong sense of realism about them and humanity so that side of the plot, the political and social commentary side of it works quite well.I liked how visceral, tense and explosive the action scenes were and how engrossing Wikus' tale is.SFX and Cinematography: For a low budget film, the effects are great. The CGI looks solid and has a physicality about it, especially up close. Does what effects are expected to do.I noticed just how much depth of feelings the eyes of the aliens conveyed, especially Christopher. Heartbreaking at times, just how sad and how deep in despair this creature was.The grimy South African look effectively grounds the sci-fi elements in reality in a stylistic way.Score: Dramatic and touching when it needed to be. Really good, but shame it's not available to buy as of the time of writing this review.Overall: A solid attempt at something fresh, from a different angle in a genre that has become over-familiar. Flawed, yes, but it's exciting, compelling and has parallels in today's world. Interesting if not great on all levels but a very good film indeed. A definite must-see at the cinema.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Must See Movie of the Summer!,"Honestly, though, I went last night to a midnight showing-and I couldn't have been more happy with this movie.To start off, the entire movie, beginning to end, was completely original. For one, the movie was filmed in a ""mockumentary"", which I have never experienced in any sci-fi movie before. Also, the brilliant film-makers involved in this great film actually gave the aliens some human emotion without allowing them to seem too human-they still had alien characteristics.In addition, the plot was especially great, too. I went in knowing that some new alien race had stopped their ship over a city and were kept in captivity. Really, though, it was so much more, and it kept me on the end of my seat (clishe, I know, but very true to this movie).

District 9 and It's Very Realistic Setting Will Surprise You,"I went into this movie, not thinking much about it, since there really wasn't all that much hype for it. As I sat down in my seat, and the film started, I knew I was watching something new.It starts off with a cloverfield-esquire to it. Documenting various people and their thoughts on the aliens etc. The main actor, Sharlto Copley, has a great breakthrough performance, it being his first in a feature film. I do not want to give too much away because this film needs to be watched the whole way through for complete satisfaction. From start to finish it is a wonderful ride that dives through every emotion. During this movie, you will feel sad for the aliens. You will want them to succeed. This is an outstanding movie, that made me angry when something created from a computer was killed. This movie is a journey through the corrupt humans and their desires for power. Peter Jackson's name comes with the movie because it is on par with one of his.

best SF I have ever seen,"I was really surprised by this film. I was expecting something much less but I think this has got to be the best SF film I have ever seen. Excellent makeup work and 'mis en scene' makes this a very believable movie. Just too bad the cinema I saw it in had kind of tattered seats and kind of smelled of sweat, and a fly kept flying in front of the screen in front of me, just beyond my reach. The movie was not overly short or overly long, and the acting was perfect for what it was about. I recommend this film highly to fans of SF, the summers best one, bar none. It is interesting to see the progression in terms of SF film making from when the film Alien came out in 1979, to the Hollywood blitz of Arnie does SF films in the 1990s, to the land of endless rehashes of the concept of monster aliens that is supposedly a nod to Alien post 2000, but is really a nod to nothing. This film adds to the work that will be called classic SF in years to come. Up with it!",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
OK but...,"Don't get me wrong - this is a good movie in many ways. The special effects are great, it is grittily realistic, mostly good acting especially from the main character, yadda yadda. The semi documentary thing works well enough, and blends OK with the 'real' action. But in many respects it is quite predictable and not saying much that we don't already know. Indeed in many ways it is rehearsing some well worn clichés about how we react to outsiders. Worse it seems to fall back on Hollywood formulae towards the end - references to every American Marine movie may well have been unintentional I suppose, but at one point I was also thinking of ET.It's a difficult movie from the point of view of the shear number of murders and vapourisations that occur - it must be well over 100. It means I left the theatre feeling more numb than anything else - other emotions regarding the ending (which I anxious not to give away) were drowned out by the gunfire and flying blood. The film showcases the emotion of anger, hard and bitter anger. Ironically the callousness of some of the characters must be fostered by a movie which numbs us to the reality of violence, so in a sense the movie is participating in the problem rather than offering a vision of another way of doing things.I think we have to treat this movie as entertainment of the gruesome kind (that I associate with Peter Jackson), certainly not a horror film, though horrific in parts; but we should not treat it as saying anything new or insightful about prejudice because it doesn't. And what it does say is not at all subtle - perhaps this was the point, but I'm not sure anyone on the wrong end of a bludgeon was ever truly convinced of anything - isn't this what the story of South Africa has really shown us? So why bludgeon us with a film?",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
I was Blown Away,"District 9 is a masterpiece in every sense of the word.It's been years since i've walked out of the theatre giddy like a little child (i'm 23) from what i had just bared witness too on the screen.I went to the midnight release and was so captivated but this film that i've come out of hiding to write a semi film review.This film deserves it.District 9 is the story of an alien mothership containing a very high number of populace of alien beings that appear to have fallen on hard times and had to make a stop over earth..and us humans make a decision that we have to ""help"" the aliens to we move all of them off of their mothership and down to earth into slums, pretty much how we treated the Japanese Americans during world war 2.it's a horrible treatment but everyone has there own reasons and they all come to light during the film.Now the plot goes much deeper then this and it would be a shame to ruin anything else for you.You really have to see it to believe it.As far as actors chances are you wont recognize anyone on screen. Which is a blessing, leaving us able to focus on the brilliant story and not wondering what's the latest will smith alien film like. With the screenplay and the directors work we are pulled right in and you find yourself quickly siding with the aliens (or at least i did)The treatment bestowed upon them is just horrid. And seeing it makes your question how much of this is based on the things that are really happening in this world. The camera work is top notch, at times a bit shaky but i felt like it added realism to the picture. it wasn't so much that i felt myself growing queasy so don't fret. you get some great panning shots and some POV shots.But the films greatest strength is going to be the story and the action..of course one only strengthens the other..cause the film is a complete work of genius.but they has never been so many times in a film that i found myself thinking ""wow did i just see that""...""oh shi*t that's amazing""..were giving the most flawless CG i've seen yet..it's not a single standout character like smeagol or autobots but all the aliens look so realistic which makes it that much easier to believe what i'm seeing.The film starts out so strong and never lets up..when i walked out of the theatre my 1st thought was when can i see this again. Finally a film that deserves all the credit and the money that it earns. Not seeing this film would be a huge mistake on anyones part. Of course the violence is extreme at parts when said weapons our used on said humans but it's to be expected on a science fiction films. I haven't been this pleased with a Sci-fi action film since the late great Aliens, and i do believe that District 9 is better.

The story is engaging on many levels, and provides a social commentary on interracial relations.The special effects are awesome! The best thing about the alien effects-- from the creatures, to the weapons, to the vehicles-- is that they don't have a fake feeling about them. Too many SFX heavy movies nowadays look good but they just aren't very convincing. The SFX artists of District 9 did a fantastic job of making everything look gritty and real. One of the highlights of the movie for me is the part where they feature an alien robotic suit/vehicle that is armed to the teeth with alien weaponry. That was definitely a treat! Mecha/robot fans like me will love it for sure. District 9's robot shows that a Votoms, Armored Core, or Robotech/Macross-type movie is possible! The actors in the movie did an impressive job, especially Sharlto Copley, who played Wikus, the lead character in the story. He doesn't come across as your action-hero type leading man, but he did a really great job coming across as the unwitting hero in story.Now I understand why Peter Jackson got involved with this project. Although he is not the director (Neill Blomkamp is), he must have been impressed by the story and the ideas behind District 9. I'm glad he did, because it is clear that in the production of this movie, money was spent on its polished look and feel.I really hope this movie does well in the box-office, because it really is a great movie. It would be nice to see where they take the story if they ever do a sequel. I recommend to everyone to go see this...you will not be disappointed!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Sure it's a SciFi film, yet it has little in common with the typical movie we are used to,","After reading favorable reviews I dragged my wife to the nearest movie theater for the 2nd day of introduction. Well... this movie started out as a documentary with shaky hand-held cameras and then takes off in a complete other direction. It starts with the main star Wikus having been selected by his father in law to head the group that is to relocate aliens that landed in the area about 20 years before and are now undesirable and must be forced to move away. Wikus is a by the book type of person and does his best to retain his composure as the man that does the job. He is accompanied by men with guns that are to enforce and protect him from any aliens that don't behave. Wikus comes across as a nice guy, a bit naive and somewhat dorky and certainly not a hunk. As the movie progresses we are shown how the confined aliens are mistreated by the humans. It somewhat parallels the treating of the black citizens by whites years before and that is not well. Wikus gets into deeper trouble with the aliens and then his own people throughout the film and without divulging the plot suffice it to say he's got his Hand full. I don't know how he understood the weird gibberish the aliens uttered, but without his perception and interpretation,the movie could not function as it did. The aliens are really nothing we can identify with as humans. Let's say they are every bit as handsome as the Predator character, once he removed his mask. I do not recommend eating shrimps during this movie. As a matter of fact it reminds me of Gallagher, the physical comedian, where fruits and vegetables flew towards the audience during the show,...here we have other parts flying. I never understood how the aliens built what they had, because with their claw hands they couldn't even hold a cigarette. The film is certainly fast paced and keeps one entertained throughout. The sound and stereo is phenomenal and in our theater it was somewhat loud, yet that depends were one attends. The graphics are realistic and that gives credibility to the whole genre. The actor that portrays Wikus is in almost every scene and carries the movie. His performance in my humble opinions deserves recognition. As for the other actors I can't identify them - for they are unknowns... at least here in the US and that eliminates any distractions. For a budget of $30 million it is quite a film. I recommend seeing this for any and all that appreciate a good Sfi-Fi film with the exception of younger children because of them being exposed to the excessive violence.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Fantastic movie,"I believe the greatest damage to this film was made by the people who promoted it, the trailers showing aliens and explosions and all that crap. The movie is actually about something else entirely and the ""movie"" violent moments are few at the end. There is real violence in the everyday actions and behaviour of the people involved, though, the status quo that lets you be a smiling bureaucrat doing his job killing children and dispossessing helpless people.What I think is worth mentioning is that Peter Jackson did not direct this movie, he was only the producer. The director and writer of the movie is Neill Blomkamp, who I was surprised to see, directs and writes for the first time. I look forward to see any of his movies, provided there are courageous people like Jackson to back him up financially.Back to the movie, another review talked about kindred spirits. I disagree. When people get together out of necessity, that is not kinship, but rather pure selfishness. And if at the end there were clear moments of sacrifice and valor, it is a mistake to forget the smiling baby burner from the beginning of the movie.The script wasn't perfect, but everything else bloody was. The music was nice, the actors played very well, the camera work was great (in fact, it is the only movie I've seen after Battlestar Galactica that uses cam motion in a useful, not irritating way) and the story was just wonderful. I changed my mind just now and marked it with a 10, rather than a 9. The movie deserves it.Bottom line: an unlikely combination of Enemy Mine and The Constant Gardener (or at least this is like what it felt to me) that can't possibly not be liked. I highly recommend it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
District 9 is one of the best this summer. Do NOT skip out on seeing this movie,"District 9 is a good movie. District 9 is also a movie that didn't let very much info out to reveal its plot during the trailer. So District 9 is going to make this a movie very hard to review, without me spoiling anything (and I won't). The movie plays as a documentary of District 9, but don't worry there's no shaky cam. It goes into what the District actually does, and how the aliens got on earth. The movie is very gritty and realistic. Honestly, if events in this movie were to happen in real life; I wouldn't be surprised much of what the government was doing in this movie they would do in real life (and yes it is f#*&^d up). Also, because it's realistic, the action is gritty and some scenes are slightly gross, so weak stomach people watch out. The story also has some elements of slight horror and torture. While the movie stands on it's own it is also an analogy to illegal aliens in the country and also racism, but in this case I would more say ""species-ism"" or some other made up word. In my humble opinion the aliens were definitely more likable then the humans in this movie, even the main character at some points (who was a good character) but I have a feeling the movie was made for me to respond like that.Another great thing about the movie is that it does not run too long; it ends ""naturally."" It wasn't forced, or cliché, the ending really made the movie for me. The CGI is really nice as well; the aliens didn't look fake like they did in the movie ""I Am Legend."" It reminded me of the early summer blockbuster Star Trek in the special effects department because it looked so real and top notch the whole way through. The aliens fit perfectly with the District 9 environment, which looks slightly dull and sick ridden, picture Resident Evil 5.There is more I want to say about this movie but if I do, I will spoil stuff. So to wrap it up, see District 9 in theaters as soon as you can! But be aware, this is an actual story, that doesn't sell itself short, it is not action action action all the time. District 9 reminded me much of the movie The Dark Knight in that retrospect— Damnit, see I'm about to go off on a tangent again. Just see the movie.There is also another spoiler free review that goes more in detail, you can find it here if you are interested: http://comichaven.net/?p=458",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A Different Type of Sci-Fi,"District 9 (2009)*** (out of 4)A sci-fi film with brains is somewhat rare especially when it's released during the Summer Blockbuster era but this one here actually works on both the brains and action. In 1982 a spaceship comes to Earth and hovers over South Africa. Over the years the aliens take refuge in District 9, which becomes a run down slum so a group (MNU) goes in to evict them but soon the main guy (Sharlto Copley) is facing tensions from both sides as well as himself beginning to change. I really wasn't sure what to expect from this film but it turned to be rather impressive, although I'd stop well short of calling it some sort of masterpiece. I think the film does manage to bring its political message without being too preachy and I enjoyed the fact that the alien race pretty much fills in for countless races that could have been used in a non sci-fi film. I also liked the fact that these aliens didn't attack New York, Chicago or various other large cities as we quite often see. Setting the film in South Africa makes for a certain look and atmosphere that the movie picks up and runs with. The scenes of the ghetto filth the aliens live in can certainly be viewed a couple different ways as could all the angry hatred being thrown at them. For the most part this movie tries to thrill you with its smart writing, although you know you're going to have to eventually get to the action. When the action does come it's quite impressive in its over-the-top, gory nature that has countless bodies being blown up and other carnage. The film also has a rather dark sense of humor that comes across quite well. The CGI effects are never overbearing and they never take center stage over the story, which is a major plus as is the fact that the overall look of the film is very impressive and realistic. I think another strong aspect of the story is the fact that we can believe everything we're seeing. Performances aren't too bad, the direction very solid and we get a nice music score. A very impressive little gem, although I would argue it runs a bit too long in the end.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Surprisingly good!,"The first 20 minutes were boring as hell. I almost stopped the movie, but I decided to go on and it got much better. I'm glad I didn't stop, I would have missed a pretty good movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Not what I expected, but...","District 9 was astonishing. Do not expect a preachy social commentary, a conspiracy film or a mock documentary. District 9 is none of these. District 9 is an action film. And extremely gritty, creative, and even touching, action film. One might compare it to last month's Hurt Locker, but this is so much more than that film was. You will feel for all of the characters on the screen, more so for digital ones. The prawns are amazing. The creatures are never presented as purely defenseless victims. They are different, in the worst way. They are gross in every sense of the word. Yet, as the film goes on you accept them, and really feel for them. They never feel like cgi, simply because they constantly interact with real world objects and people. They are rude, and sometimes funny, but in a way it's their differences that make them, dare I say, cute, and to the audiences, very likable.I will avoid spoilers, but the film is epic. Very gritty, very real, very intense. It is one of the most unique movies you will see this summer, and trust me, you will want to see it again.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Good...yup, just ""good""","I read a lot of reviews before burning our gift certificates to see this movie on the big screen. It looked like people either loved it or hated it; post-teen gamers and sci-fi lovers thought it was lame, and film buffs loved it. I had to see for myself, and now I know what was up with the reviews. If you want a CG extravaganza a la or ""G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra"" or even ""Starship Troopers"", forget it. If you want the rich sci-fi texture of ""Aliens"" or ""Blade Runner"", you'll be disappointed. But if you want a fun good-vs-evil thrill ride like ""T2"" or ""Total Recall"" (with a modern cinema twist), it's worth a few bucks for the in-theater experience.Mind you, it's way more ""indie"" than any of those movies, but it's an indie movie with mind-blowing CG. The story and the sci-fi do not bear close examination, but the CG does. The trailers do not mislead in that respect. The lead actor is terrific, too.I came to the movie half expecting it to be social allegory, what with the South African shanty town and legacy of apartheid and all, but they left that alone and let the movie speak for itself. They were smart enough not to be at all preachy with it, which would indeed have made it suck. My only complaint is the same complaint I have about all movies I like: it was about an hour too short.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
This movie just saved the 09' summer blockbuster series,"Peter Jackson.....director of one of the greatest trilogies of all time ""Lord of the Rings"", has finally taken a step outside of the directors circle. Numerous movies have been thrown his way.....""The Hobbit"", even a Halo movie. He finally settled on directing ""The Lovely Bones""......but before doing any of that, he took a liking to a small time directors short film. He loved the concept so much, that he gave this director all the funds he needed to make it a full length feature........this is Peter Jackson people, he doesn't put money into something unless its good.......especially if its coming from a director that has done virtually nothing. Needless to say, i had to see what all this was about. Everyone dreams of the idea.....aliens coming to earth. But the question that everyone always ask is ""What would we actually do?""......this movie finally answers that question. Im sure everyone would like to believe that it would somewhat resemble ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"".....but we all know thats not true. No no no.....this movie zero's in on just how crude mankind can actually be. Now i must admit.....the first 30 minutes had me a little in-different.....because it creates this alternate reality for you, so at first, it was a little hard to swallow, because they are throwing so much at you, and you want so many questions answered.......but thats the beauty of it......you only see it from a media standpoint.....which we all know is somewhat corrupt. But once the plot outline is established, and the characters are in place, the movie just takes off.....and this alternate universe is now incredible. But it just doesn't stop there......once you sort of figure out what is really going on, and you are actually rooting for the 2 main characters, that is when the movie has you by the balls. I don't want to say too much without giving the movie away......but by the end of this film, i was in complete awe. Almost every aspect of this film was done to perfection.......every angle was covered, which is key to a movie like this. The story was not only original, but brilliant at the same time, and told just as such. I must tip my hat to the director Neil Blomkamp......because this was his first big production, and he went above and beyond. Bottom Line......oh my god, this is easily the best movie i have seen this summer, and easily one of the 5 best movies of the year so far. If your looking for a deep story with your action, which i have been for a long time now.......you will certainly find it here. This film brings such a different idea to the table, and it has so many levels to it........this movie has just brought life back to the summer blockbusters.....thank you god. Im sick and tired of everyone saying how ""You just have to let go, and enjoy the movie for what it is"".......NO.....YOU Don't......i don't want to pay money just to watch crap blow up all the time, i want depth damn it. And up until now, that is all i have seen this summer. Finally, an action movie with heart, humor, awesome action, and a brilliantly told story. Not only one of the best movies of the year, but one of the best Sci-Fi movies ever made.......yeah, i said it.....because its true. Don't waste your time, go and see it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Definitely worth staying up to see,"Saw the 12 o'clock showing of this film tonight and was glad I did. You can read other reviews for more specifics on the film, but I wanted to add a couple of bits of relevant info: On the way out of the theater I heard two different comments. 1) The way the cameras were used gives an almost ""handheld"" effect throughout much of the movie. Several young men seated near me complained they felt queasy from the effect of the camera movement. You may want to consider this when choosing where you sit or whether or not to see it in theaters. and 2) it was gory. I agree, the movie was gory. When considering whether or not to allow kids to see you should know that everything from the content of the POV (the ""moral of the story"", if you will) to the gore and the very free use of f-bombs all throughout definitely make the movie an ""R"" all the way through. It was not even CLOSE to a PG13. Some of you won't mind that, some of you will.Still - with those things in mind, I think the movie was fantastic. The story didn't skulk about trying to slip its moral center in undetected. It was quite in-your-face. I appreciated the direct approach, though I've read some people calling it heavy-handed. Quite frankly I appreciate a movie that isn't afraid to delve into the grotesque behavior of which humans are capable. This movie does that unapologetically.A very fine send-off for the '09 summer movie season.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Original, entertaining, visually fantastic and overall excellent","This movie is different from anything ever made before, and it's brilliant! District 9 brings a lot to the table; a lot of action, a bit of drama, great special effects and a very good plot kinda based on true events. Its good to see a Hollywood movie about district 6, were a similar event that happens to aliens happened to Non-Caucasians (won't spoil anything), although a lot is changed (the whole alien thing). District 9 is brilliant from the beginning to the end and you should find it great unless you're five years old or just retarded. The documentary style that is used throughout the movie is genius and the aliens and their weapons are just look amazing and are generally awesome. The acting is great, along with the characters, Witkus is a great main character and its easier to like him as the story develops. Overall district 9 is an original, entertaining, visually fantastic and overall excellent 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Deep, gripping, original and so much more","As an avid movie goer, I keep all of my ticket stubs for personal records. I had to go back through all of the movies I'd seen in theatres for the past few years to find one as riveting as District 9. The only movie that even came close was The Dark Knight.I am glad Peter Jackson has moved from directing to solely producing films. I don't want to imagine what this movie would have been like had Jackson been calling all of the shots. However, by bringing District 9 into the limelight, he has done a great service to the world of entertainment.The way the perspective switched from mock documentary to standard third person left me feeling totally immersed into the points being made and the action unfolding. There are several absolutely engrossing scenes that really set the theme of this movie. This world created in District 9 seems so parallel to ours, that you never feel like you're watching something that is a complete fantasy.In no way is this film your traditional cookie cutter alien vs human story. In fact, most of the fighting that takes place in this movie is human vs human. The aliens are as much a part of the background as the slums in which they live in. Blomkamp gives us a lot of deep levels in this film that you can only dwell on just a few during the first viewing. There are just so many different themes being thrown at you that you almost feel overwhelmed. What you really benefit from in District 9 are the questions it leaves you with afterwards. All of which have nothing to do with plot holes, for there are none.Blomkamp has created a new standard for Sci-Fi movies. I have heard comparisons between District 9 and last year's Cloverfield. The latter doesn't even come close in terms of: substance, action, and drama. Do yourself a favour, and pay a visit to District 9.10/10, baby.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
District 9 Falls Apart at the End,"Like all good science fiction District 9 gleans real-world implications from the allegory on screen. If the conflict captured verite between aliens and humans seems reminiscent of the apartheid director Neill Blomkamp witnessed as a child it is no small coincidence.District 9 is unusual, in its approach of siding with the aliens. Sure E.T. was also pro-alien, but not to the extent that you actively rooted for the destruction of man.Sharlto Copley plays Wikus van der Merwe, who contracts a mysterious virus that begins changing his DNA. Wikus quickly becomes the most hunted man in the world, as well as the most valuable - he is the key to unlocking the secrets of alien technology. Fighting for his life, there is only one place left for him to hide: District 9.Very quickly we discover that in the quest for gaining unimaginable sources of wealth from selling the ""prawns"" technology that we have become less human than the beings we are trying to exterminate. It's too bad that Blomkamp didn't continue along the lines of this and instead ventured into Bay territory with Pig shooting robots.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Simply incredible. Best 0f 2009 so far.,"2009 has been a really cool year for movies. We've gone into space and seen Captain Kirk get beaten like he owed people money in Star Trek. We've seen an angry old man use balloons to abduct a short little fat kid in Disney's Up. We've seen giant blue wangs in Watchmen. We've - well, not me, but apparently a lot of you - saw the Jonas Bros. sing inoffensive, diabetically sweet pop music in the Jonas Brothers: The 3D Concert Experience. We even saw Optimus Prime beat the crap out of Shia LeBeouf in Transformers 2. And yet, none of those memorable moments mean anything compared to a single minute of District 9.District 9, for those who don't know, is a film dealing with the arrival of aliens over Johannesburg, South Africa. They find themselves soon wardened into a segregated slum called District 9. What follows next is something I really can't address without spoiling the mystery of the film. This is one of those rare films that actually captures you way better if you have little idea of what it's about beforehand, and so, I won't address the story anymore than that.There is simply no element in this movie that falls short. The cinematography is simply beautiful, with an incredible background set piece of the alien mothership hovering quietly throughout. CG in this film is of such a high quality that you seriously doubt that its budget was only 30 million. Any one alien or robot in the film looks far more realistic than any transformer. Pacing is incredible, with a very interesting, very quick revelation soon in that carries the film to an incredibly violent, very engrossing climax. Don't downplay that last sentence; this film is VERY violent. Alien weaponry does a messy number on human bodies. And yet, the most gripping aspect of it all is how it was filmed. About half of the movie is done in a documentary style, meaning you see the film through the lens of a news-camera. Unlike Cloverfield, however, the person holding it is not having a 2 hour long seizure. With such an incredible amount of attention to detail, the film is proud to show you everything without a single shake. Everything feels quite visceral, dramatic, and most of all, real due to this style.Yes. District 9 feels like it could totally happen.No one acts in a way that people wouldn't. It is, at the center, about humanity at its best and its worst.And that, specifically, is something that you so rarely experience in films. Too many trips to the cinema lately are overly-escapist; even romantic comedies seem too...unlikely...nothing more than Hollywood magic. D9 places you in the center of the action and leaves you feeling as desperate and stressed as the main character. Every actor in the film melts into their role, feeling so honest and perfect. I sincerely hope that at least Sharlto Copley, playing Wikus, gets an Oscar nomination.Too few alien encounter films so blur the line between good and evil. Your sympathies go both ways; to the humans suddenly inconvenienced by odd visitors, and to the aliens, hoarded away into ghastly, dirty slums. The ending of the film highlights that point perfectly, and will certainly have you leaving the theater in an enjoyable argument with someone else.Who was right?Who was wrong?What will happen next?Can we see this again?I sure will.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A classic,"Neil Blompkamp and the team have really delivered a great film here, in my opinion. One of the things I love is that it has obvious connections to other features with similar themes and settings -- notably the (soon-to-be-remade) '80s miniseries ""V"" and the excellent ""Alien Nation"" -- and yet it has a startlingly fresh and exciting approach all of its own.Just about everything here appeals to me -- an intriguing story with powerful allegorical elements, and it's VERY political; it's skilfully told, with a good balance of action, drama and humour, excellent SFX (the aliens are terrific), strong performances and it's such a pleasure to see a film in this genre that doesn't regard all its viewers as uncritical clones of Comic Book Guy. It's quite gripping throughout and the final showdown between the hero and the security forces is tremendously exciting. The documentary style really works here and the hand-held camera work is for once a very effective tool, with Blomkamp very cleverly weaving us you in and out of the 'actuality' style.The choice of setting is a brilliant touch in itself and it's good to hear Sarth Effrican accents right up front. It's terrific to see such an accomplished and thoughtful work coming from a country that was for a long time best known in films terms for the execrable 'The Gods Must Be Crazy'.Unusually for a high-concept sci-fi flick, the plot elements are sparingly revealed, and many are left unexplained. It's also those rare movies with an ending wide open for a sequel ... but one that I'd really like to see. So many questions left deliciously unanswered ... what IS the story with the aliens? Why are they so seemingly so passive? Are they -- as it appears -- merely a degraded worker caste, or is there more to it than meets the eye? Will our hero be redeemed?Sharlto Copley gives an amazing performance in the lead role and it's part of what sets this movie apart from prefabbed Hollywood dross like 'Aramgeddon' or '2012'. In the hands of Michael Mann or Roland Emmerich, the role would have gone to an obvious 'everyday hero' type like (urgh) Russell Crowe, but Copley fearlessly plays Wikus with such an amazingly convincing nebbish persona that it at first left me wondering whether the whole thing was heading for 'Scary Movie' territory. But fear not -- it rocks. I was blown away to discover that Copley was not a career actor and indeed had never acted until he appeared in the original short-film version. Incredible -- I predict big things for this guy.I have no doubt that (at least in artistic terms) Blomkamp is going to be very glad indeed that he didn't end up directing Halo. This will undoubtedly come to be seen as one of the great sci-fi films of its time and I sincerely hope there is a sequel. A no-brainer for any serious sci-fi fan -- just go and see it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Something Different... in the beginning! (MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS),"OK, did anyone else notice, all or most of the reviews on here are from Australia, and from ""early"" screenings of the movie, AND they are all praising how great it is?! Well, OK, it is NOT a bad movie, it is ""different"" in the beginning. However, the plot is so full of holes, they could've called it ""Swiss Cheese"". I had reservations when I saw the blurb ""Peter Jackson Presents"" as opposed to a Peter Jackson Film. The holes come from a lot of unanswered questions about the aliens, they've been on the Earth for 20 years, but nobody seems interested in the huge spacecraft hovering in the sky, or who or where the aliens come from. South Africa seems to be an isolated country, they took on the burden of looking after these alien ""prawns"" all by themselves. Where is the international community, all the scientists, why aren't they studying the technology of the ship, obviously, they knew how to get into it. There appears to be no communication with the aliens, where did they come from, and why? The interrogation seen in the preview was cut from the movie.Like I said, it started out good, but what was a seemingly intelligent approach to the Sci-Fi movie, slowly developed into the usual action/chase/explosion movie halfway thru. Leaving us with all the unanswered questions about the creatures and the ship.So, hopefully there will be a sequel that answers all these questions, however all these misleading reviews by people promoting their own film can only hurt it in the long run, and the chances of us getting our questions answered. Maybe the DVD extras will tell! To the producers, thank you for trying something different, but next time, keep it different all the way thru.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
One Of This Years Best.,"District 9 has been getting a lot of hype and praise to equal that hype. Not many films can do this. I decided that I would try my best to go into this film not knowing much about it. I've seen the teaser and a couple TV spots and knew the basic premise. What I did not know was what a balls to the wall film this is.Neill Blomkamp has mixed great sci/fi with themes and issues plaguing our society. A blend that works so well in this film that it plays out in two different styles. The first half of the film is told through a documentary style footage, with people talking directly to the camera explaining the backstory of the mothership and basically setting up the rest of the film. Half way through the film Blomkamp switches the style to a more conventional style of film-making, yet it isn't a jarring switch. The two styles bleed into each other and both feel the same.The film is set in South Africa, the aliens are sequestered into these slums and blocked off away from humans. This segregation is reminiscent of our own history and it works well here, making the film more believable than a film like Independence Day. While watching this film I got a sense of Cloverfield and some Slumdog Millionaire. I wouldn't say it's a mix of the two, but I just got the feeling from it. I saw Cloverfield because this is a sci/fi that we haven't seen before. It's not based on anything and the creators have free range to do what they want. This was apparent in all the awesome weaponry they had. Cloverfield was new, fresh and a monster that we had no idea what it could do. I had no idea what this film was about to do, which was blow me away.The second half, which is the more conventional film-making style, is action-packed and bloody violent. I had no idea what I was in for, but once I saw that the lead got his hands on the weapon technology, I had a huge smile on my face. What he did with it, made me smile even more. There were plenty of ""Holy Sh*t"" moments on my end. The most fun I've had at the movies this year, even more than the other sci/fi entertainer Star Trek.The film is gritty, dirty and everything that it needs to be to sell this idea. The special effects look marvelous, especially when placed on such a desolate and depressing backdrop. The slums are dirty and turn into a warzone. A warzone that goes on for a long time and you never get tired of. You end up wanting more, craving more.For a film with no star names attached and a lead who hasn't acted in anything before, I was surprised in the depth and emotion that these characters had and what Sharlto Copley had to offer. He's between a rock and a hard place. His character transformation from beginning to end is real and saddening. It's not easy to get me to care for CGI creatures, George Lucas failed, Peter Jackson succeeds, again. The alien creatures look great and I was surprised at how well I was able to connect to the Christopher character.The film is original, fresh and unexpected. I was never bored and had no idea what was going to happen next. In all this action and drama, is there any room for some sweet romantic moments? The answer is yes and it ends on a beautiful note.Go see this one in theatres.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Best science fiction movie in years.,"It would be easy to poke holes in the story. What would be considered the most momentous event in human history, the arrival of aliens in a space ship, is reduced to the level of caricature as the aliens are portrayed as pests that have to be controlled and relocated. However, there is nothing implausible about that. Once the novelty had worn off, the presence of aliens probably would become something that would be taken for granted, especially if there were no way for them to leave. And furthermore, which country in the world would want to be responsible for having to deal with them? Hence, in the movie one country is stuck with having to deal with them, and that is not far-fetched at all. This movie is the best science fiction project produced by Hollywood in many years. The movie has an offbeat original story, great acting, lots of action, continuity and an actual beginning, middle and end. The plot is clearly spelled out and grabs and maintains audience interest. Also, the movie offers an innovative and sympathetic treatment of the aliens which further enriches the story. The movie inspires a short but profound question: what would we do if millions of aliens from who-knows-where showed up at earth and could not leave? Furthermore, the movie is without any pretentiousness and is presented in a straightforward, semi-documentary format which gives it an air of authenticity. The story may seem far-fetched but anything can happen and remember, what was once considered fiction in the past, such as devices allowing for instantaneous communication over huge distances and vehicles that can travel through space to other planets, is now reality today.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
not bad,"firstly this movie does not deserve it 9+ marks out of 10. It started off bad. it was boring, I was cringing through the whole first 35 mins. he parallels to racial apartheid aren't exactly subtle, the acting was bad too, esp the lead actor. it uses this faux documentary style that is so cliché. It was just disappointing, shame really. wait to see it on cable or DVD.It's mainly a compost of other sci-fi movies, as old as ""RoboCop,"" ""Aliens"" and ""The Fly"" and as recent as ""Cloverfield"" and ""Transformers."" It's a bad joke that ""District 9"" will be hailed for its ""originality."" The movie's main fun comes from wondering what coin of the pop realm Blomkamp will pluck out from his memory bank next.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"An over-hyped, manipulative, and clichéd wasted opportunity","Over-hyped, overrated, badly written, badly shot, badly acted, and badly directed. The writing is manipulative, clichéd, and relies on dues ex machina and coincidence. The first 20 minutes is ""documentary"" footage and interviews, which starts off interestingly with thought- provoking social commentary, even though the shaky camera-work is very annoying (it doesn't improve). What could've been a compelling and intelligent science fiction classic turns into a dumb, ridiculous, laughable action flick that has plenty of crowd-pleasing mayhem. Once the action starts and the MacGuffin is introduced the social commentary is thrown out the window and becomes generic and stereotypical. The action is done well, though. It's entertaining, gory, and satisfying. This is pure nerd-fantasy, with cool weapons, tough guy shouting, and a kickass robot suit. In an effort to obtain realism apparently, none of the actors are recognizable. This could've worked if they hadn't have been terrible (except for the lead). The characters are shallow and one-dimensional. The antihero is entirely unlikeable which makes for low suspense because you don't care if he lives or dies. The only sympathetic characters are (predictably) the aliens, who are more human than the humans. I was hoping they ended up destroying all humans. The story is somewhat unpredictable and original, so it deserves credit for that. But don't expect a masterpiece like the critics and fans are raving about.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Very good but one nagging problem,"I just got back from watching it (Was only $2.25 for matinée, cheapest that I know of. My drink cost me $1.50 more than the movie did.) I'll try to not write anything that is a spoiler but I have to mention some plot points in order to express my opinion of it.The movie has two different feels, the first half has a lot of docudrama stuff and more comedy than I would have guessed. The second half is action packed and is a real nail biter. I didn't find it as depressing as some people have described to me. Because of what they'd said I was expecting it to be a real tear jerker. But really it wasn't. Sure, it does tug at your emotions and you find yourself rooting for the aliens (It's hard not to cheer for the guy getting kicked around.) but there are much, much more depressing movies out there.There were some things about it that seemed a little odd. For one thing with the exception of one of the aliens and his son most of them behave as though they are barely intelligent. It kinda' left me wondering how in the heck this race was able to build a spaceship and travel to other star systems. Many of them parade around beating their chests and behaving like gullible children when presented with cat food, etc. The movie never really explained why the one alien seemed so much more intelligent than the majority of them so I found myself imagining my own reasons, like maybe most of the smarter, more scientific ones were killed off in the ship when they started starving to death. Perhaps it was mostly physically strong but not very well educated workers that survived. Or maybe the aliens have never been presented with deception before, perhaps don't even understand the concept of it, and that's why it is so easy to take advantage of them. Beats me, but I wish the movie would have given me something to explain their ignorance and naivety. It didn't even try to. Instead I'm left making guesses as to the cause of it. Basically it comes down to you look at them and you look at what they've built and it doesn't appear to add up. It seems like oil and water.So my biggest problem with this film is that it seemed to me that the aliens presented in it didn't seem smart enough to be able to travel here in the first place. Humans have total control of the situation and bully around these space travelers as easily as they would a colony of monkeys. The aliens are armed to the teeth with sophisticated weaponry that blows ours away but instead of using or at least threatening to use it to demand better treatment of themselves they sell them...for cat food! I don't know, this part of the movie just really didn't wash with me. Seems to me that if aliens capable of space travel are no smarter than that then when mankind develops similar technology it would be able to take over the entire galaxy with ease.What I did like about the film is the portrayal of humanity's reaction to the aliens. I think this is presented quite realistically. It is expected that the aliens' appearance would revolt them and the behavior of the visitors doesn't help their cause either. As mentioned before they spend most of their time carrying on like animals rather than sentient beings so people not wanting them around them makes perfect sense to me. In fact, the film actually depicts people as being quite patient with them. After all, it takes two decades before the humans in the area start demanding that they be moved. The military is shown to act in a comically evil way towards them but bare in mind that it took many years to escalate into that. At first people, even the government and military, embrace them with open arms. But because of the aliens' behavior I don't see how things could have ended up any other way. Over time I think people kept getting a lower and lower opinion of them, a feeling that they were dealing with something barely intelligent (Hey, that's the way I was feeling so it was pretty easy for me to identify with them thinking the same thing.). And this probably led them to start viewing them as animals and we know how we treat animals. Once a feeling of superiority was achieved it isn't hard to imagine that exploitation, hard treatment, experimentation, killing without feeling remorse, etc., would follow.I suppose the aliens' apparent brainlessness was necessary for the director to tell the kind of story he wanted to. After all, if the aliens were carrying on in a brilliant manner how could he portray humanity abusing them with such relative ease? But I just can't see how a race like that could build such amazing technology. It just didn't seem to make sense. Yes, there is one alien and his son who appear appropriately intelligent but all the others act as though they've been lobotomized. They can speak, but that's about it.I did like this movie despite the one major criticism I have of it. The second half is especially fun, like a roller coaster ride. I recommend it. I'll give it an 8 out of 10. Btw, I think a sequel is very likely. It had the type of ending that left a lot of questions unanswered and plot points unresolved. Hopefully a part 2 will explain why most of them were so freakin' stupid!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Cat food for the ""prawns"" and caviar to the general","How odd to set a sci-fi horror movie in and around Johannesburg, South Africa. That's where a big fuzzy looking space ship has been hovering in the air for twenty years, we're told during the mocumentary footage at the outset of Neill Blomkamp's 'District 9' explaining how a gang of terminator-torso creatures would up here by accident, starving, and were settled in a compound on the edge of the city called District 9 that's become a hideous slum. District 9 is now a place despised by all South Africans, black and white. The unfortunate outer space refugees confined there, whose insect-reptilian look and proclivity for feeding on rubbish, bad meat, and cat food has led to their being called ""prawns"" by the general, are to be relocated to a tent camp 200 miles out by a wealthy independent contractor called MNU (Multi-National United).By the time all this has been laid out for us, of course, it's obvious Johannesburg isn't so ""odd"" as a setting for the story at all, just heavy-handed. The location chosen by South African director Blomkamp is a blatant way of making this a sort of allegory about man's inhumanity to those he considers his inferiors, like the blacks in the Bantustans of apartheid South Africa. The only trouble is, the film thus begins with a creakily obvious story device.Another trouble with this unholy combination of bits from 'Black Hawk Down,' 'RoboCop,' 'Transformers,' 'Aliens,' 'The Fly,' etc., etc, is that it points to how aliens are being cruelly treated and then presents them as disgusting. Some pleasure comes out of how that disgust is milked, however, because the interiors of the ""prawns'"" shacks, a riot of technology and degraded junk, show the designers had a lot of fun with them, as they do with the exteriors of the shantytown, a kind of sci-fi Mogadishu (actually, in the Ridley Scott's film, recreated in the suburbs of Rabat, Morocco). Even when it descends into actioner schlock, District 9 does make ingenious use of its low budget and limited locations. And even if its characters are mostly clichés, the degenerating relationships in the protagonist's life are poignant enough.'District 9' is a conversion story, because Wikus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Copley), the goofy bureaucrat put in charge of the relocation, who's the son-in-law of MNU's owner, starts out with contempt for the aliens but ends up being, sort of, their ally. More than that. When invading the house of one of them, he spills some black fluid from a vial onto his face and starts sprouting a ""prawn"" claw where his left hand used to be. Then, the whites want to use him to kill aliens, because his new DNA allows him to fire alien weapons that are the only thing that can finish them off. And a Nigerian gangster, who preys off the aliens, stockpiling their special weaponry and extorting enormous sums from them for tinned cat food, wants to consume Wikus' arm because he thinks it will make him superhuman. Anyway, Wikus is forced to befriend the ""prawn"" whose shack contained the fluid, because he (or it) may be able to help him. And so he who was to have been the aliens' concentration camp director now becomes their protector.But if the ""prawns"" are vulnerable only to their own weapons which only they can fire, it seems easy enough to hurt them in other ways. This movie just isn't very well thought out. There's no further back story for the aliens either. Where do they get money? What do they do all day? These things we never learn. Nor, unlike the flawed but superior 'Children of Men,' are local events put in the context of global ones.Copley is (perhaps intentionally?) a wooden actor when he first appears being ""filmed' at his desk as publicity for the eviction and relocation project. He livens up when he gets involved in the violent action in the ""prawns'"" ghetto. For a while, he seems a complex hero, morphing from doofus into bigot, then pariah, then cross-over, then selfless savior. But during this interesting progress the movie unfortunately descends just as rapidly from its allegorical sci-fi setup into more and more crude levels of B-picture action and horror.And this crudity only reminds us of how clumsy the fake TV news, surveillance footage, documentary interviews with academics or technicians and other bits of hack ""realism"" have been, and highlights how crudely drawn the MNU operatives and Wikus' family members are. And how utterly derivative the aliens' body shapes are. And how inexplicable it is that the ""prawns"" speak in the usual sci-fi movie guttural backwards-tape alien language, which is subtitled for us, but the white men all understand it, and the aliens all understand English. By the time you get to the end of District 9, however intense its sometimes George Romero-worthy yuck scenes have been along the way, it has just become an utter, irredeemable mess. And that's too bad because there are some ingenious ideas buried here, and the first half lets you think instead of just watch people and critters bang into each other.The final insult is to find that this movie is being heralded as ""original"" and ""smart."" Only mavericks like Armond White and Michael Sragow are unimpressed. (To liven things up, Ebert even supported White's right to pan this -- then withdrew his support.) Sragow points to the film's ""derivative"" quality. A black man himself, White points to how 'District 9' trivializes the South African liberation struggle, and is offensive to Nigerians. But viewers and critics see the movie they want to see, and since this one pushes the right liberal buttons and gives the superficial appearance of being an ""original"" sci-fi movie, it's making a big noise and doing good box office.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"One of the greatest films I have ever watched, and the best of recent years by light years","I had immensely high expectations for this. To have them met and repeatedly exceeded was astonishing. It's been so long since I was last so affected by something I saw that I can't remember when it was, if it has ever happened at all. This touches upon some deep and unpleasant aspects of humanity and science, with countless sequences and ideas that imitate real life occurrences. I urge anyone who comes out from this saying ""nothing like that would actually happen"" to read up on history, and frankly, you sadly don't have to look that far back. The acting is flawless, every single performance. Not casting anyone well-known was the exact right choice. The CGI is beyond reproach, such intricate detail, so imaginative, always believable, everything had a weight to it, and everything living was expressive. I did not feel like I was looking at something animated(in general, you can't tell that this had a relatively low budget). The word ""cartoony"" doesn't apply in the least. This is gritty and strong. Not everyone is going to have the stomach for this, there is a lot of very disturbing content. The style is spot-on, with a marvelous mix of a professionally shot documentary(that introduces the audience to the world of this) and the classic story-telling of a movie. You find yourself completely engrossed. The cinematography is magnificent. There is a lot of hand-held, without it at all being headache-inducing or distracting. This is superior to Cloverfield and Quarantine, to the point that it is just about beyond describing. Do yourself a favor, do not let anyone spoil anything about this to you before your viewing. The plot is excellent, and develops masterfully, and not always in the anticipated direction. This is one of the most original concepts I have witnessed in a long time. I found the growth, the characters and the events entirely credible, not to mention amazingly powerful. The drama is engaging throughout. This is epic, they managed to put such a massive amount into it, and it all works and has an impact, nothing comes up short. I am so impressed it's difficult to put into words. The action is awesome and creative, though it obviously is not the focus of this. There is humor in this, and it's funny without the serious tone suffering. They also don't go over the line for laughs, if there are arguably a few exceptions to that. The pace is perfect. Editing is sharp and skillful. There is a moderate amount of bloody violence and gore, as well as language in this. I warmly recommend this to anyone who enjoys intelligent, satirical and challenging sci-fi, in any medium. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Not that good,"This movie seems to be very well liked by most of the folks who've left comments. I, however, was disappointed. Now, I should say, my only a priori to this flick was a trailer I saw a couple of weeks ago at another film. I got the impression, incorrectly, that Peter Jackson DIRECTED this project. Boy, was I wrong (he was producer.) Jackson knows how to tell a story. This guy doesn't.What the director of ""DISTRICT 9"" DID do well was create a string of very tense moments, many presented in a somewhat unpredictable fashion, but that's not necessarily a story. And I don't care HOW much social commentary is infused into it (and there was plenty.) Here's where I think the WRITERS failed.Social commentary has been used so much over the past few decades that it should be filed under ""Predictable Hollywood Theatrical Device #37."" It's like salt on movie theater popcorn, there IS such a thing as TOO MUCH, whether the general public realizes it or not. It comes across especially heavy handed in this film, with the South African locale and evil military commanders. I guess I feel social statements are most effective when you let the AUDIENCE connect all the dots, and don't try to do all the mental heavy lifting for them.Then there was the typical modern sci-fi excessive gross out violence (Predictable Hollywood Theatrical device #23.) My wife had to leave.I eventually did too, but it was mostly because I didn't like the style of the film. After awhile, the documentary approach came across as inadequate, eventually having to rely on surveillance cameras in the restroom, and other unlikely places, in order to maintain continuity. And when that didn't work, it started morphing into a different style of film, just so it could tell the story.As I said...disappointing. Can't recommend it.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
This is unique,"Amen, this is NOT just another alien movie! Thank god. It absolutely blew me away! The one thing I think that made this movie such a success is the fact that it was filmed (for a good chunk of it) from a documentary point of view. That is what brought this film down to Earth, believable, suspenseful, intriguing, and most importantly current. The fact that the cast was unknown, to me at least, was a help. I certainly could not have had the same effect if any non-South African Hollywood superstar played the role.The perfectly chosen location of Johannesburg, South Africa allowed the film to play homage to Earth's past conflicts, from your well known African civil wars and arms dealers, to forced relocation of a society and segregation of African-Americans (to name a few). Essentially, these creatures behaved as we would have under similar circumstances, except with this story our roles are reversed - we are the aggressors.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

The perfect cast in such a film is where you know none of the cast. And it worked out perfectly - I can't attest to a much more realistic science fiction than this one!

Every Summer has One,"There are always a few movies, every summer, where one cannot help but be thoroughly pleased after exiting the theater. Last summer it was hands down The Dark Knight and this summer, after a lot of waiting around and disappointment (The Hangover excluded) we were finally given 'District 9'.I did not know what to expect from this movie. I feel like the allure for me came from the allure of the director's fledgling career. He only has a few films under his belt and the majority of his work has been done in other aspects of film making. With such a clever idea he had a lot to live up to. Neill Blomkamp appears to have done much in the way of visual effects in his film career. And for this reason the film soars. His expertise becomes crystal clear in the opening sequence of the film. The creatures, or Prawns as they are called, meld seamlessly into the set. The CGI is evident but close to flawless.The story itself is interesting for a number of reasons. I found myself coming back to the setting, Johannesburg South Africa, over and over again. This is in no way an American movie, and for it to be received so well by American audiences is great. There are a lot of political undertones and a plethora of sociological statements to be made in this film. It is gritty but beautiful. The creatures and their technologies are inventive but slightly familiar and this is never once a detrimental aspect that is the down fall for similar films.My complaints are few. As any ignorant American, I found their accents to be a bit much at times. Also, there is a a bit too much in the way of shaky camera work. I do understand that this had to be done but it is still very hard to keep track of everything that is happening while the camera shakes violently. I felt the main character, Wikus, has a lot of morality issues hat could have been either explored more or toned down a bit. In addition, I wanted to more about the Prawns- why did they come here? Who sent them? etc.Regardless of minuscule short comings all movie goers will find something in this film. There is a healthy serving of blood, gore and explosions and this mixes nicely with the allusions to historical events and provocative statements made about society and human nature. The film is also a study of relationships and the nature of trust. For lack of a better term: if you possess any kind of pulse you will find something in this movie. It will both excite and incite in you some kind of deep thought.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Ground breaking,"District 9 succeeds because it takes you through the full range of human emotion: rage, disgust, fear, friendship and unity. And believe me, you WILL feel them because this film is THAT good.Perhaps one of the stronger themes is selfishness: Wikus makes some stupid decisions which cost him time...something he manifestly lacks. These actions hurt himself and those around him, causing the viewer to wonder if this story is REALLY going to unravel.Leaving aside the special effects I think the film stands alone as a commentary on division, hate, and oppression. And more disturbingly a real expose on the darkness of the human heart. It's shocking because we treat each other this way now.There is a real moment in this film when Wikus has to abandon his fear and loathing and do what is right--even if it costs him everything. The choice that seems impossible is the one he must take, and thankfully does.District 9 is a real thought-provoker and probably needs to be seen more than once.Congratulations to all involved and I look forward to more films of this calibre!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Nine reasons to watch ""District 9""","Peter Jackson and aliens did not make the list, but here are nine other reasons to go see the Jackson-produced movie ""District 9."" 1. Action. Lots of it. ""District 9"" hosts massive and impressive firefights on several occasions, and watching the gunplay alone might be enough of a draw for some testosterone-driven viewers.2. It is faux-documentary film-making at its finest. Director and writer Neill Blomkamp has created a story that, at moments, reeks of realism. The ""news"" footage and interviews give parts of the movie a sense of grounding in the actual world that is sometimes hard to shake.3. It is an original story with a unique personality. Kudos to Blomkamp and co-writer Terri Tatchell for their fascinating and quirky screenplay about the results of an alien ship settling above Johannesburg, South Africa.4. Sharlto Copley might become your favorite new actor. With the awkward charm of Michael Scott and the determination of Rambo, Copley's character Wikus Van De Merwe takes viewers with him through the danger and emotion of ""District 9"" with refreshing poignancy.5. Everyone else is talking about it. You should be too. ""District 9"" grossed almost $40 million at the box office its opening weekend, and the film has already jumped to the upper echelons of the IMDb Top 250 at #31 (while the film's ranking will most certainly drop after it's initial fan boost, it could easily stay on the list for some time).6. The movie actually has something to say, a surprising accomplishment for an action-oriented movie in the Michael Bay era. Combine an ethical dilemma about the inhumane treatment of non-humans with the moral principle of walking a mile in someone else's shoes and you have the thought-provoking idea ""District 9"" presents.7. Excellent visual effects. Blomkamp didn't have the advantage M. Night Shyamalan had in ""Signs"" of only showing his aliens for a few scenes, so the aliens in ""District 9"" had to be able to be on screen for the majority of the film without being a distraction. He and his design team succeeded, as the ""District 9"" aliens are unique but familiar enough to evoke empathy from the audience.8. Creative (and cool) alien technology. The alien weapons play a large part in the film, and a robotic alien suit (ala ""Bioshock"") gives a fresh feel to familiar action sequences.9. It is a fascinating movie which has achieved the rare feat of being as thrilling and interesting as its marketing campaign. The widely distributed alien-clad posters promoting the film suggest ""District 9"" is unfamiliar territory. The work of Blomkamp and his crew ensure it's like nothing else you've ever seen.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Very over rated Alien / human adventure,"I have seen this movie several times. It's in my opinion a good, but not great movie.IMHO, the script is quite weak which makes it all feel amateur.Acting is definitely good and special effects excellent, the production values are also very good!.For me, this movie suffers badly from a weak script, which makes the movie feel extremely long. There are times during the movie when I went off to make coffee, something I never do.I have watched this movie several times, usually because friends were watching it as I visited them.It's a good movie which could have easily been great, though sadly easily forgotten.I have given it 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Jackson and Blomkamp invent a rich and engaging action drama,"With the teaser at Comic-Con '09, inventive ad campaigns on bus stops, billboards, train stations, public restrooms and some effective viral marketing, District 9 had already created quite a stir among the underground world of sci-fi geeks who waited with sheer excitement for the Ring Master (Peter Jackson)'s latest wizardry. Jackson entrusted Neill Blomkamp with District 9 after the duo first attempted a movie version of of the popular video game 'Halo' (which did not see the light of day) and being inspired by Blomkamp's own short film, 'Alive in Joburg' (2005). Thus, Blomkamp's big directorial debut is not only a manifestation of his affinity for science fiction and his South African background in the wake of apartheid, but is an exemplary sci-fi action-drama that ruthlessly supersedes its hype.An alien ship arrived over Johannesberg 20 years ago and the entire population of the ugly tentacled shrimp like creatures, whom the humans nicknamed 'prawns', were moved into District 9 which grew into a massive, uncontrollable ghetto area of the city that humans could not control anymore. The discontent among the citizens of Jo'berg is expressed through the eyes of news cameras that interview people who demand segregation and alienation of the prawns outside city limits. When black people say this in South Africa, the images turn potent. Those who are interviewed in the beginning are talking about Wikus, an employee of MNU (Multi-national United), with an assumption out there that something went wrong with him and the alien camp. The mystery surrounding these interviews haunts one throughout the movie.Wikus is assigned the task of resettlement of the prawns to another camp outside the city. Sharlto Copley plays this role remarkably well for a novice especially since his character sees high voltage emotions that are only compounded by his physical and mental change. Something goes wrong while he is serving evacuation notices and this leads to a dramatic turn of events that involve a revolutionary gang of Nigerian thugs, an opportunity for a prawn to re-power the mother ship, a chance for MNU to finally enable the usage of the alien weaponary they've acquired and Wikus' very existence as himself.Blomkamp's story telling has a lot of thrills and twists to keep one engaged but at the same time, he gives the thoughtful mind some delectable bits to chew on while he stirs the emotions to make one realize that humans are indeed a flawed species. District 9 has all the ingredients for a summer thriller – grotesque aliens, a robot suit that turns Wikus into Iron Man, space ships, 'Halo' type explosive battle sequences, gory scenes of exploding bodies and at the same time, a hard- hitting docu-drama about the prejudice, hypocrisy and savagery inflicted by humans on the otherwise helpless and sympathetic aliens. Blomkamp makes you care about Wikus as he is alienated from his own people. He makes you care about Christopher, the prawn who found the means to re-power the mother ship and his little whiz-kid who is ever so curious about going back home awww!...On the other hand, Blomkamp throws the reality in your face. Aliens are not the invading type that we have seen so far and they do not appear in the darkness with muted special effects. The prawns in District 9 are out in the sun, with CGI so sophisticated that it's hard to believe that Weta did not have any alien suits. Hand-held cinematography is used only when needed for a natural effect (way better than Cloverfield) but the real action is left explicitly adorned for all to enjoy. He even throws our cruel intentions, selfishness, hypocrisy, innate villainy and physical limitations at our face for us to rather take the side of the aliens. How would you not feel excited when the savage aliens rip apart the leader of the MNU Mercenaries??!District 9 does what true science fiction does—it makes you think about the world you live in. The world where man's path of righteousness is in direct conflict with his opposing actions. There are numerous instances of real-life parallels in the movie as depicted in the savage and gangster life in the slum, prejudice against certain sects and money-minded corporations that turn against their own. Although, the film gives a bleak view of our world, it proves the undying fact that humans can truly become who they are upon complete alienation.9.22 on a scale of 1-10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Best scifi satire since Starship Troopers,"There have been a few great scifi satires in the history of cinema: Robocop, Starship Troopers, Alphaville, Zardoz, Frankenhooker. The scifi genre is perfect for satire because it inherently brings a degree of fantasy and surrealism, setting the stage for anything-goes.You can choose to view District 9 as a straightforward action story. But I think its beauty lies in its social commentary which is done through hilarious satire, just like the aforementioned films. For starters, the ""hero"" of the story is a sweater-vest-wearing nerd, not a musclebound, stone-jawed stud. This should be a tipoff that the presentation isn't meant to be taken literally; it's tongue-in-cheek. Next, we see that the movie takes on a ""mockumentary"" feel, a lot like the great comedies Spinal Tap or Waiting for Guffman. Again this catches us off guard and encourages us to laugh at things that would otherwise be shocking.That's a good thing because the story, if seen beneath its thinly veiled metaphor for racial segregation and government sponsored apartheid in South Africa, would be pretty damn depressing. Enter the satire: the storytelling device through which we can tolerate such disturbing and shocking themes and still be entertained. Archie Bunker taught us this.Like I said, you can ignore everything I'm saying and instead enjoy this as an action flick; it has plenty of hair-raising, seat-gripping tension for that (and who couldn't love guns that make people explode like bloated sacks of ketchup?). But what sets this film above the average is its ability to combine its futuristic action & story with a very contemporary social problem. And it does this while giving us a fun ride.I have 2 minor gripes. One is that the nonstop barrage of sarcasm & dark satire can be very taxing after a while, like watching a 2-hour marathon of ""Everybody Loves Raymond"", you eventually want to punch someone. My other gripe is that the shaky camera, while adding an interesting sense of realism, can eventually induce dizziness, vertigo and vomiting, especially when you're watching scenes of a guy acting dizzy, vertiginous and vomitous. Also, the scenes of meat lockers and hunks of putrid, unidentifiable flesh on the chopping block are enough to turn anyone vegetarian for an evening. Overall it can be an exhausting experience, definitely not your shiny, happy Spielberg fare (E.T. would crap his pants in this world), but I guess it was the director's intent to convey the disturbing conditions he himself was intimately acquainted with, having grown up in Johannesburg in the 80s. I do recommend that you familiarize yourself with South Africa's history if you really want to get the most out of this movie. Then you will see, as with Starship Troopers, that this is not a fantasy about spaceships and bug-eyed aliens, but rather, it's a very contemporary allegory about our own human fears & prejudices.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The best movie you will see this year!,I saw District 9 with my friends i didn't want to see it but they pushed me into it. After i walked out of the theater i was shocked Neil Blomkamps first movie and he knocks it out of the park. The Documentary style they made it in really makes you believe this happened. The CGI in this movie is perfect probably the best ever. I don't want to say much about the film because i want you to experience what i did. Sharlto Copleys performance was great.Overall this movie is fantastic you would never believe it was made with a budget of 30 million dollars. If you didn't see it go see today it will blow your mind.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Visually startling and interesting, but I wasn't entirely involved","For me District 9 is neither a masterpiece or a bad movie, instead it is an interesting but not entirely successful kind of movie.For a low budget movie, District 9 does look excellent. The cinematography, editing and effects are very, very good, and I did accept the aliens appearance wise. The soundtrack and sound also create a sense of foreboding and genuine atmosphere, the concept is amazing and the film does start off brilliantly. The acting overall by a largely unknown cast is good, as is the direction, and the lead characters are likable.What didn't impress me so much, is that while District 9 does have heart, that I could see from how it was made and the enthusiasm of the actors and director, I wasn't entirely involved. As I've said, the film starts off with no problem, but the final third with plot points that were either rushed and underdeveloped or silly or clichéd wasn't so good. The story doesn't quite live up to the concept for me, it was intriguing and thoughtfully handled but thin, the support characters aren't as well-thought out or as likable as the leads, the dialogue has some sketchiness that is particularly evident in the slower parts and final third and the pace does get sluggish sometimes.Overall, I did like it and was intrigued by it, but sorry it isn't a movie I would see again in a hurry. 6/10 Bethany Cox",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A work of genius!,"District 9 is inspired film-making. In some ways, I suppose, it is an allegorical tale, but it is NOT a Message Movie. Thank heavens for that because I detest most such films. Although I feared that this film might be a heavy handed anti-Apartheid drama, I saw instead a brilliant sci-fi film, in a class with Ridley Scott's classic ""Alien.""The protagonist of the film is Wikus Van De Werne, played brilliantly by Sharlto Copley from whom I hope to see more in the future. Wikus is alternately, stupid, naive, and funny, but ultimately loyal and brave. The movie traces his assignment as the man in charge of an operation to remove aliens from a squalid camp near Johannesburg and resettle them in a remote location. How all of this is developed and plays out is fascinating and consistently interesting, trust me on this.District 9 is directed by young Neil Blomkamp -- he is only 29. This is the only film of his I have seen but he has convinced me already that he is a force to be reckoned with. He made District 9 for little money, at least by the standards of most modern special effects laden films, and co-wrote the screenplay, too boot.This is a smart film; it is also sometimes moving and often funny. Highest recommendations!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Excellent premise but mixed execution,"District 9 has a fresh science fiction premise: an alien mothership arrives to Earth and inertly levitates in the sky over Johannesburg, South Africa. Once humans find their way inside, they find a famished alien worker population. There is no value in them except for their advanced weaponry that is rendered inoperable to humans. Like any great science fiction story, there are plenty of things left as a mystery.It is clear that Peter Jackson's role as a producer has benefited the film in many ways. There are excellent special effects and environments. The alien design is beautiful, although I'm sure that not everyone will agree with me. Their culture, language, and eating habits were reasonably believable. The attention to detail is fantastic, especially in implementing features such as the ""For Humans Only"" signs.The beginning of the film takes advantage of a documentary style. The story is told through interviews and news footage to retell history as it happened. Soon afterwards, the film follows events through the perspective of Wikus van der Merwe, a field operative played by Sharlto Copley. Although he is one of the more sensitive humans around, he still suffers from arrogance and selfishness. In fact, one of the things that might have hurt the film is the lack of any admirable characters in the cast. I found the alien leader and his son to be the only respectable characters.If the first half of District 9 is science fiction, the second half is action. Generally I enjoy action, but it was not very compelling here. I was disappointed to find that there was essentially no insight after the halfway mark. No plot surprises, no deep character interactions, and no creative uses of technology. The film simply deteriorated into unbelievable action and illogical consequences. The main characters dodge hundreds of bullets, blow up things (including lots of humans, which effectively burst in a spray of guts when hit by alien weapon projectiles), and manage to survive despite countless mistakes. The ending was strange, but does leave plenty of room open for a sequel (in 3 years?).District 9 opened fine, but slowly lost its appeal for me as it progressed. It felt like the writers wanted to send a message, but then worried that the audience would lose their attention so they threw in lots of action to try to make an exciting finale. That might be fine for most people, but it diminished my appreciation for the interesting parts.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
This film was AMAZING!!,"I went into this film not knowing anything about it (on purpose) other than having seen the teaser trailer. During the first 15 - 20 minutes of the film I was thinking, get to it already, but then when the plot with the prawns began, and we were hanging out with just them, it was brilliant all the way through to the end, and I could then see that the slow pacing at the beginning was actually beneficial to the film.What an amazing first feature film for this guy! The effects were 100% spot on. When I see other CG, for example the werewolf in the Twilight: New Moon trailer it makes you realize that the director definitely dictates how good the effects are.People were cheering all the way throughout the movie, as there are many 'FUCK-YEAH!' moments, and the story went exactly where I wanted it to go. The choice of having a comedic character as the lead role for this kind of film was very refreshing, and made for more of an impact when things start to get serious and brutal for him.It doesn't feel too long, and ends with you wanting more.I can't wait for 'District 10', as this is clearly the first chapter in a masterful trilogy. I can see another equally talented director taking the reins for part two, reminiscent of James Cameron continuing the Alien franchise.Cannot think of one thing I would change in this film.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A racist movie about racism?,"First lets deal with the basic storyline. Basically its a story about aliens which are stuck on earth due to some spaceship malfunction. They are lead to live a miserable life in South African ghettos as refuges. The movie is shot in a documentary style. We enter the movie at the moment our main character Wikus is put in charge of the evacuation of the aliens into what resemble concentration camp because the South African population are tired of them and their behaviour. While promoted as a apartheid allegory, where black people were put into reserve by white colonialist. It bear some important differences, since here it is the aliens ""invaders"" which are being oppressed by the native population while during apartheid it was the invaders (colonialist) which were oppressing the native population on their own land. I would say the allegory is a mix between apartheid and Jewish immigration in Europe/Germany before the war.I think the basic story is good, but thats were things goes downhill a bit. Nothing intelligent is done about this apartheid/Nazi allegory. I have to say this because this movie is taunted as intelligent sci-fi which its not. But personally I also like action/scifi so by itself thats not a problem to me. Unfortunately I found the rest of the movie pretty boring. Not much is really happening.The story is: While evacuating the aliens to the concentration camp our hero Wikus is contaminated with some Aliens fluid then begin to slowly morph into one of them ""The Fly""-style. But during the whole movie he stays basically human with an alien arm.When the government learn about his metamorphoses. They are ready to kill him and nurture his organ for some research. He escapes, meet an alien which tell him can turn him back to being 100% human. They get back into the research center together to steal back the fluid to help the alien escape the planet earth (with the help of Wikus at the last moment). At the end the Alien promises to come back to turn Wikus into an human again. I guess he will come back to get his people too.While I'm a big fan of Sci-fi including action sci-fi. I found this movie most boring. Simply because there's not much going on. Its basically a escape and run movie.But what struck me, since this movie is presented as a Apartheid allegory, its how the author Neill Blomkamp seem to not have dealt with his own prejudice toward black/African people. There are a few aspects which make this movie racist. There's the racist portrayal of gangster-flesh eating-Nigerians. Perpetuating the myth of the cannibal native. Natives believing foolishly that eating aliens flesh will give them power. No black person in this movie, set up on South Africa of all places, have any kind of significant role. Its like this movie is set up during the apartheid years, well maybe it is since no African people seem to have any leadership role. All a bit surprising when its a movie *about* racism. Then there's the little thing as black people seemingly showed to be the most racist toward the aliens. Or the aliens themselves being showed in such a unfavorable light that its almost understandable to put them into concentration camp. But I'll take it as a critic of the racist white South African press during apartheid years since the movie is shot in a documentary style. A white invader press which had to propagate myth and fake propaganda to justify the colonization, segregation and racism. And thats the only angle we see of those aliens. Wikus do meet a sympathetic alien, but unfortunately this alien seem presented to be the only one of his kind. As no other aliens are presented into a good light (do they have family values, life aspirations, dream, etc??). Alien are also presented as people which are not able to help themselves, thus need to be saved by the white man. There's no alien leaders, no Mandela or Soweto uprising here. Overall, the movie should have taken much better care since its a movie about racism and apartheid.In overall humanity is presented as being very evil. While its completely unrealistic considering the specific situation of the movie. For what we see in the movie, it seem there was no effort whatsoever by the human to communicate with them or to know them better. Hell, we could have help them make that damn fluid so they could go back home!! I'll also take it as a critic of the apartheid regime beyond its lapse in logic (we would never treat aliens that way in similar circumstances).The movie movie storyline was pretty boring, with not much happening. Escape running, that's it. Some lapse in logic here and there as to why the aliens don't use their own weapons for example. The technological backwardness of the alien (coming from a highly advance spaceship with robot weapon). Still worth a 6 (without considering the racist undertone which was hopefully unconscious). While no philosophical point was discussed somehow I wish the movie writer would have dealt with his own prejudice toward African/black people before tackling the issue of racism in a movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
I'd like to review this thoughtfully...,"...but I've just been pounded on the back of the head by a heavy metaphor for the past 90 minutes and can barely see. Also, I was forever stumbling in the big old plot holes and I believe I wrenched my knee on that last one.Blacks, I mean aliens, have gotten a bad deal in South Africa and their oppressors blame them for the conditions in their slums and slummish behavior and bully them. This is a Very Bad Thing, the filmmaker tells us, over and over and OVER again, just in case you thought relegating a whole species or race to a barb-wire slum and shooting them randomly and aborting their babies visciously was a good thing because you're some form of brain-damaged moron with no morals at all.Erase that endless awful metaphor, and the story doesn't hold together at all. To detail every way in which it failed totally would take me 5000 words, and I've wasted enough time on this bad movie already, but other 1-star reviewers here have hit on most of the idiocies here.Based on 50's sf film science, the story had ""aliens"" (with two eyes over a nose over a mouth, which of course will never occur in any other evolutionary system) contaminate a bad guy with alien black goo (shades of the x-files) and he became half alien (like in The Fly). oooooh! Were it 1952 and were I eight years old, this would be a cool thing. It's not, I'm not, and this movie sucks.There's plenty of crap blowing up, but that doesn't make drama. People, crap blowing up is just crap blowing up--it's not plot or suspense or character development or anything at all. AND YOU'VE SEEN IT BEFORE! Sheesh, how many explosions can one person stand? And for the girls watching, there's a little baby alien, awwww, ain't it cute and sympathetic, awww. Oooh, and Evil Corporations and their Evil Soldiers and why they didn't manage to wedge in a cliché Evil Preacher, I don't know. I've taught troubled high schoolers creative writing even they don't resort to this many clichés at once.I have no idea what was wrong with 90% of serious reviewers that they thought this crap was any good. I hope they re-watch it in three years and suddenly understand what total FOOLS they were and feel the shame they should feel over rating this thing any stars at all. Seriously, do they get bribed to do this? This is a bad movie and any adult with half a brain can see it is, so why is there even one good review out there?",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Instant classic of the genre...its that good.,"District 9 feels like a very original cinematic experience; more so in tone rather than content. Alien arrival and body shock elements are classic sci-fi but the way this film manipulates the familiar is both new and exciting for the genre. Aliens aren't threateningly unfamiliar here - they are persecuted and put into asylum! A designated shanty town to segregate the ""prawns"" from the humans - now there's a great concept and one that manages to speak for human intolerance, racism and all the inadequacies that stem from our self appointed ruling dominance over all other living things.That brings me to how misanthropic this movie really is; thats not a slight against it, but the protagonist is a barely redeemable character whilst every other human is emblematic of the more disgusting traits of human nature. You really are rooting for the strangely likable aliens all of the way. The pseudo-documentary feel implies that the film makers believe 'this is what would happen, if aliens arrived', and the grim actions of corporate agencies lend the film a disconcerting believability. Little Miss Sunshine this ain't, you will leave the cinema fascinated, thrilled, awe-struck and yet appalled! I certainly have to see a film this year that has made such an impression.There are a few hokey elements that rather hack handedly force the characterisation but D9 wouldn't necessarily be a better film without them. For the sake of this review, I'm trying to think of flaws but thinking of District 9 really just wants makes me want to see it all over again.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Disturbing but great film,"I have rarely been as uncomfortable watching a film as this. I spent the first half wanting to get up and leave; not because I was bored, but because the cruelty and violence portrayed was so vivid and real.That a movie can have such an effect is a credit, I think, but it went to places that made me feel uneasy. I was worried that nothing could possibly be OK in the end and that I'd leave feeling depressed.I'm glad I stayed till the end.

It's been too long since something like this!,"For years now, theatres have been all but devoid of original stories, instead being full of big budget remakes/sequels/adaptations. So I was already excited for District 9 based on its originality. But when I saw it today I was truly blown away. Walking out of the theatre was like when I finished seeing the Matrix for the first time. It was awesome. The film has a great story, excellent special effects, and great action as well. The film can be a bit heavy at times, which I enjoyed, but some viewers might be upset by the levels of cruelty, more than the violence. But then, it was inspired by the Apartheid, so what else can be expected? The only complaint I had was that it ended leaving so many questions. I won't spoil them here, but I will say this film will have people talking. See it as soon and as often as you can.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Best of the Summer, and...quite possibly...the year.",'District 9' is simply phenomenal. Neill Blomkamp's directorial debut is a stunningly realistic and emotionally gripping sci-fi thriller with heavy racial undertones and the questioning of loyalty in society as excellent thematic elements.Sharlto Coplay puts on a chillingly convincing performance and the visual effects are very well done. Jackson and Blomkamp have successfully transferred their creative energy into a film that is certainly worth your time. To not view the film this summer would be missing out on the most worthy of blockbuster sensations of the entire year.,,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Nothing new here, but District 9 is entertaining","28 Days Later + Aliens + Robocop = District 9Above all the hype on how ""smart"" the film is, forget it, its just basically a buddy chase film.That is the best I can do and completely avoid spoilers.The violence and of course some other elements of the film clearly harken back to Paul Verhoeven's Robocop, the movie was also equally influenced by the list I started the review with.Every one of those movies was good entertainment. So, wisely the filmmakers stole from good source material.District 9 largely succeeds at being what the abominable Cloverfield wished it could be: one heck of a B movie. Where Cloverfield's premise lost steam quickly after the opening scenes, District 9 changes gears every 20 minutes into almost a completely different movie to keep the pot boiling. The shaky camera stuff has been done to death but thankfully it isn't too overbearing here. Surprisingly, there are some good stabs at humor too.The special effects are OK, but with the DV shutter drag, we never get a good look half the time. The film feels low budget with really only one or two actors on screen at any given time. And don't get me started on numerous plot holes gaping bigger than that alien ship. Above the endless splattering bodies, crotchety aliens and mockumentary talking heads, when District 9 was over, I really just didn't feel anything. Other weak spots were the commando ""villain"" was very caricature baddie and out of place in the pseudo-reality of the other characters. The social message on the faux Apartheid is there but a bit thin and there really isn't much here we already haven't seen before, but I still enjoyed the ride.I liked it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

I don't want to give away anything so i'll be as vague as possible.

Surprise Summer Hit,"District 9 was the surprise Summer hit and it was also a great film debut for director Neill Blomkamp who was able to make one of the best sci-fi movies of the last decade. This movie had it all: great special effects, good action scenes, character development (not just of the humans but of the aliens as well), and most importantly an original plot which served as a socio-political satire on discrimination, genocide, and corporate greed. I think almost anyone could understand the message that the director was trying to get across with this sci-fi movie. He criticized how humans treat others as inferior to them and how that hatred develops amongst the different groups simply because of cultural differences. The aliens were just an excellent way to get this message across without being too preachy and at the same time making us realize how fragile we are towards others who we cant relate too. Even the hero of this movie was depicted as a person with several flaws who made very unethical decisions, but changed once he was able to relate too and identify with the aliens. I was waiting a long time to get the chance to see this movie because of the excellent word of mouth it was receiving and I wasn't disappointed once I finally got to see it.The movie was filmed in a documentary style (like The Blair Witch Project or Cloverfield) and that was a great addition to the film because it only gave it a more realistic and interesting take of the aliens and their lifestyle. The protagonist was Wikus, played by Sharlto Copley, who worked for a big corporation in charge of evicting the aliens and forcing them to live in concentration-like camps. These camps soon became slums where the aliens lived in very precarious situations and were looked down upon by the humans. Wikus is not your typical action hero, he is very unethical and treats these aliens very poorly and tries to manipulate them because he sees them as dumb and inferior beings. It is not until he accidentally splatters some bio-hazard material all over his face that we see him go through a Kafka like transformation and he also begins to see the aliens differently now and relate to them. Comparisons to the 80s movie The Fly cant be missed here as we see Wikus change not only in form, but in character as well and even becomes likable by the end of the film. He forms an unlikely duo with one of the aliens, Cristopher and in this relationship we get to see the aliens in a different light as well.You have to give Peter Jackson a lot of credit for producing a movie like this with a first time director like Blomkamp, but the result was great. The director counted with Jacksons blessing and was able to put to use all the resources he was given delivering a great combination of special effects and fun action scenes that lived up to the standards of Summer movies with good performances from the cast and an original plot. If this was Blomkamps first movie as a director I cannot wait to see what he has in store for us as he continues to mature in his profession. His name will definitely be one I will be looking forward to in movies to come. A lot of credit has to be given to Sharlto Copleys performance as well because this movie couldn't have worked without him. He did an excellent job at depicting such an unorthodox and complex hero who went through a range of mood changes and made the audience hate him during some points of the movie and love him at others. This is a must see film that is more than just an action sci-fi movie, it is also a smart social-political satire that will be remembered for years to come.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

"Well Executed, But Demoralizing and Depressing","Why isn't anyone talking about how similar ""District 9"" is to ""Avatar,"" the other attention-getting sci-fi film of the year?In both, a man belongs to an organization intent on oppressing an alien race. In both, he undergoes a kind of transformation that puts him in the aliens' place and causes him to sympathize with them. In both, the villains are thuggish military types, horror-show caricatures.Unfortunately for ""District 9,"" though its similarities beg comparison to ""Avatar,"" it pales in comparison in just about every respect. It's a well-made allegorical tale about apartheid in South Africa, but I can't say I enjoyed watching it, as it's nasty and harrowing in a way that's off putting rather than exhilarating. The main character is sprayed with a liquid that causes him to become one of the aliens, and his slow transformation, as his human body disintegrates, is dealt with in stomach-churning detail. Also, the film's version of humanity is depressing and demoralizing, as is its depiction of an alien race. It was hard to root for anyone, because nothing much seemed worth saving.

"An original, thought-provoking masterpiece","I wasn't expecting a whole lot out of District 9, to be honest. The trailers looked alright, and the premise sounded fascinating, to put it simply. Besides, I've always been interested in what director Neill Blomkamp has been up to, ever since I initially heard about his now long abandoned Halo adaptation. Having just seen the film, though, District 9 is not only perhaps my favorite movie of the year so far (challenged only by Coraline and Up), but one of the greatest films I've ever seen.Arguably the most surprising thing about this film is its budget; the movie cost approximately $30 million to make, yet looks as though it cost $100 million. The folks at Weta Workshop, as expected, did a truly exceptional job with the animation. All of the aliens (or Prawns) are given so much expressiveness, and in very subtle ways, too. In fact, I often forgot that I was watching a computer-animated character, which I think is the highest compliment that you can give to an animator.The highlight of this movie, though, is Sharlto Copley's portrayal of our main protagonist, Wikus. Throughout the first 30-45 minutes of the film, he's viewed as a relatively unlikable character, yet becomes increasingly sympathetic as the film continues. It's done so in an extremely compelling, extremely real, way, which is refreshing to see in a film. It's this character and his relationship with the aliens that give these already incredible action sequences (that look as though they were inspired by sections of Halo and Half-Life) some genuine weight. I found myself tearing up a couple of times, actually, fearing for the safety of one of the characters, and rarely does a film manage to get that kind of response out of me.District 9 is an original, thought-provoking masterpiece that shows how a system can force its citizens to be unwanted, without becoming preachy on the subject. I'll have to see it again, but I think that this film may actually dethrone Coraline (which is virtually tied with Up) as my favorite movie of the year so far.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

His transformation from nerd to empowered human was so astounding.Now I know this movie won't be as highly watched as garbage like Transformers 2 and GI Joe. Though for a film that was made on a measly $30M budget it far surpasses these films in both substance and effect.Also I saw this film on a Saturday and the theater was close to empty.

Totally.This is best movie I have seen in the past 12-15 years and it is now in my top 5 movies of all time. Hell, maybe even top 3.Do yourself a favor and go see this. You will be very happy you did.A 10 rating, it doesn't get much better than this.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Not for the faint of heart,"Personally, I think this movie has a lot to say about the ""human condition."" Without giving anything away, the whole experience is a comment on how we as a species behave. I thought it was an excellent piece of science fiction and a very accurate view into life on earth. However, I know that many people will not like this movie. It can be very disturbing in some parts, and its message is something that not everyone will want to hear.Judging this movie on its own merits, I evaluate it at a 10 out of 10. This movie is as good as it could possibly be and fulfills the highest standards of cinema (in my opinion, of course!).Enjoy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Slovenian ' film – makers ', learn from this ( fat chance ! )","A South-African Sci-Fi with photo realistic effects made by perhaps the second best effect company – Weta f/x , a film that was a financial and visual surprise of the year , a film that has infused the genre with new stylistic approach ( i.e. –just watch the first thirty minutes made as a sort of documentary ( in sci-fi genre , no less ! ) , where the whole story with the arrival of a gigantic space ship with more than a million creatures ,who look like a hybrid between a cockroach and a shrimp ,emaciated and having been eating on each other in order to survive, is explained ,as the huge human clean-up operation to relocate the very same 'shrimps' away from the encircled area near Jo-burg ( and that's another beauty of the film , namely ,forget about aliens razing downtown Washington , New York or , in a few cases Paris , it's the South Africa's turn now !) , is about to commence ,as the residents have soon become fed up , sorry , hostile towards the new arrivals , who have not done anything wrong , except that they look 'ugly ', i.e. too non –human , and are eating all the time ,and ,presto facto, the bustling trade with the Nigerian gang members selling ,mind this , the aliens' favorite food – cat meat, and , another original creations , namely an interspecies prostitution is also taken care of and in full swing !!

The first film in years I can truly give a 10 rating to.,"As a filmmaker myself, I find it rare, if ever that I truly enjoy a film anymore. Let alone one that I give a 10 rating to.Expecting a mediocre sci-fi film at best, I walked away just minutes ago in complete amazement.This film sets a new standard in film making and truly is the best film I've watched in years. It highlights the very humanity that lacks in so many ""Hollywood Films"" It transcended any other sci-fi film that has ever been made. From the very beginning until the end, the film is filled with constant action! It pulls you swiftly into it's story and doesn't let you go.Non of the actors are well known to the American audience, yet the acting is flawless all the way through and they bring a truer sense that what is happening on screen is real.Most films like this tend to lean heavily on hand-held camera shots, leaving you feeling sick and with a pounding headache, but it cleanly transitioned from shot to shot, always moving at a brisk pace.To say this is the best film I've ever seen, might be an understatement! I will return to see this film again. And recommend it to everyone! This is the best film of the year.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Get yourself as many tins of cat food to see this sensational gem!,"Please don't be put off by the fact that this is a sci-fi film about aliens. Of course if you do happen to be a complete sci-fi boff then you won't need telling twice to go down and see this, because you've probably spent your whole life trying to find that next great alien invasion films. And here it is. But, I hate sci-fi films, especially those with stupid aliens in them because you just can't take them seriously. Alien films are often a load of rubbish as well unless you're looking at family-orientated ones like ""ET"" or ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"". But, adult alien films (don't!) are often bad or just don't get it right like ""Signs"" which turned out to be really naff. So when I heard the hype surrounding ""District 9"" I looked at the trailer and thought, ""This looks like complete tripe!"" But when I saw it Asda for a fiver, all I could see was the raving reviews from pretty much everybody! Even Chris Tookey and Chutch claimed to adore it, so in the basket it went.I wasn't expecting much, but what I did get was something phenomenal. I've now seen it three times and each time it's still managed to leave me breathless. ""District 9"" isn't your ordinary alien invasion film, or at least it doesn't seem like it. It's a complete masterpiece from start to finish. Neil (the director) plunges you straight into this alien world from the very first frame and its impossible not to get seduced by it. Everything's told using a ""mouckumentary"" if you like, and it's really clever and sometimes weirdly believable. Maybe, it's because of the fantastic parallels concerning today's society and apartheid? The opening comes thick and fast and immediately grabs the viewer and pulls them in to the world of Johannesburg but not as we know it. I think that truly great films should make the viewer fell like they're their and not actually watching something on the telly. Films like ""Black Swan"" and ""The Artist"" have done this to me, and also ""District 9"".The film also seamlessly transitions from a sort of found-footage stroke ""mouckumentary"" and actual film. I suppose you could sort of look at the camera crew following the main character, Wikus, as a metaphor, of the humans seeing the aliens through lenses that aren't don't show the aliens truthfully, then when we're transported into the world we see what is really happening with the aliens, and we get the frustrating truth. It's a film that ""Avatar"" wanted to be, only ""District 9"" is one hundred million times better than ""Avatar""! It explores themes about apartheid and treating people right without shoving it down your throat in a patronising way. It's extremely poignant and handled beautifully. When Wikus ends up becoming friends with one of the aliens it's extremely touching and you end up caring for both of them.That's another great thing about ""District 9"" it has fantastic characters. I'm sure if this got a Hollywood re-do then they would make the character of Wikus as someone who has no flaws, a bit like the paraplegic man in ""Avatar"". Some sort of hero who knows exactly what he's doing. Whereas here, Wikus is the definition of a lovable tw*t. He isn't at all perfect but he has such a kind heart and is good-natured. It's only until he knows how it feels to be an outsider that he really starts to understand these aliens. He's a complete idiot and the film does have some really funny moments, although it does help with him having a south-African accent as some how everything they say just sounds so much funnier! The aliens are also in most aspects, more human than the humans, and you really want them to succeed, especially with that incredibly adorable baby alien!""District 9"" is not just only superbly written but also fabulously directed. It's fast-paced and the final third or so of the film is just complete non-stop exciting action that is just handled beautifully. Oh, and I'm not talking stupid, pointless action where the director decides that it would be better to just blow up something to make it look cooler (hello Michael Bay). No, this is action with a point. The characters have a motive and its a motive that you really want them to succeed with. It's breath-taking to watch and the special effects are literally out of this world! It's like the end of ""Avatar"" only much more exciting because the characters are so much more likable (and some appropriately unlikable). It also manages to take itself seriously without making it look ridiculous. That might be because it managed to poke fun at itself at the start which was also refreshing to see. It's brilliant.So whatever your view is on aliens, get down to your nearest supermarket (or maybe there's a nice cheap one on ""Amazon"" or ""Ebay""!) and buy it! Because this isn't just a film about aliens, it's a film about people and I think that's the point. You see the aliens and think ""Oh god, here we go!"" but as the film goes on you see them as people too. The cinematography is also sometimes breath-taking, especially with those iconic shots of that incredible mothership, which really must've been a spectacle to see at the cinema! ""District 9"" is a shot of adrenaline, straight into the heart and I didn't want it end.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Seriously good film-making.,,","From the beginning of this film, you get the feeling that you're watching something that's addressing big ideas. South African Apartheid, Slavery, The Tuskegee Experiments, corporate and governmental interests in profits and technology as opposed to humanitarian concerns. Those are things I thought about when I watched this powerful movie.The acting was great and the CGI was remarkably well-crafted. When I heard that the budget was $30 Million I almost didn't believe it, I couldn't. The Dark Knight and The Half-Blood Prince both cost over $250 million. It just goes to show, that the artists involved know what they're doing. Jackson and Blomkamp got it done.Originally (or so I've read) Jackson was going to use Blomkamp for a film based on the game Halo, but the project and the money fell through. Well, Jackson, being the stand up guy that he is, wanted to keep his promise to the director, and scrounged up $30 Million for a film. This was the result, and it was fantastic. Big ideas, big effects, big performance by Sharlto Copley, small budget. I will definitely see this one again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Humanity?,"What do we mean when we refer to our humanity as a virtue? When criminals, races, societies or anyone remotely different from the cultural norm are deemed ""inhumane"" in their thoughts, actions or behaviours, we see them as monsters and entities quite separate from us—they are them, and we are us, and to the grand majority of those pointing fingers and segregating the minority this is human. In the world of District 9 then, which occupies a reality where extra-terrestrial beings (colloquially known as ""prawns"" because of their resemblance) have been habiting the Earth for close to 20 years in slums devised to keep them alive—if only barely and out of the way of the general human populace—this black and white cross-sectioning of what is human and what is alien becomes a literal source of conflict.Like all great science-fiction, the heart of this story is not the ostensible plot lines involving devices like alien weaponry, government cover-ups or the aliens themselves rendered in masterful CG, but rather that allegorical subtext that drives the whole thing home. Sure enough, the aforementioned aspects are just as cohesive and compelling as that very substance that lies underneath and certainly shouldn't be ignored—but after countless ""science-fiction"" movies of the past decade merely concerned with cool effects and other-worldly exploit for the sake of it, it's the intelligence that subsides within the channels of District 9's subversive tale that defines it as its own work and brings it intro largely unexplored territory.So what does it mean to be human? Many would claim that it's to have compassion, to be consciously driven by thought and free-will rather than impulses or reptilian habits of our less evolved ancestors. No matter how you look at it through the lens of District 9 however, there's a notable lack of such qualities in much of the movie's scenes involving us. Instead, there's a predominant sense of the opposite; of the barbaric, unfeeling, somewhat logical and cold side of our overwhelming naivety and obnoxious pride as a species; fearing becoming one of them, but at the same time wanting the greater parts of those we alienate (some going to more drastic means than others), humanity finds itself defending an empty shell of a concept.This in turn, brings us to the protagonist of District 9's story, who comes in the form of Wikus Merwe, a representative and paper-pusher of an agency that deals with all alien affairs. Wikus is neither a good-guy or a bad-guy, he's just a guy. In the initial stages of the feature, the man is painted to a bit of a meek bureaucrat who takes no pleasure in killing the ""prawns"" akin to the battalion of hot-headed soldiers that looks after him on away missions, but certainly isn't one to question the morality of his job either which involves keeping the aliens under control through any means possible. As the movie progresses however and Wikus becomes more and more entwined within the fabric of the alien plight, his character takes on a startling transformation that is powerfully done, but not overly so. In this vein, District 9 rather rapidly tilts towards the action-survival side of things, and it's so expertly done that you really question when a movie made you feel this engaged and enthralled at the same time.Much of the success of this character however has very little to do with all the social commentary, subtexts, plot-developments and special effects but rather through the tremendous performance by Sharlto Copley. Let it be known that this isn't a performance likely to be considered for an Oscar Nomination in that it doesn't demand intricacies and subtleties so lauded by the Academy, but instead asks for something completely human and so damn convincing that you feel this man's pain and the horror that he goes through; you believe in the entire world of District 9 because in more ways than one, he is essentially the sole heart of the movie that beats with any sort of resemblance to what we term humanity.So what about the action? Well thankfully, I make claim without qualm that not only is the movie one of the smartest sci-fi movies to come out in recent years, but I can also testify that it's certainly amongst the biggest, loudest and most downright good-looking too. The action, which is saved mostly for the final act is riveting—the effects, never dominating the screen or drawing attention to themselves in an adverse fashion, work in ways that only the best of movies that employ them do so. There's explosions, futuristic weaponry, giant mechanoids, but most pleasing of all is that the aliens themselves look absolutely convincing and utterly fantastic in their animation and rendering details. Make no mistake; this one's smart and pretty.So just what does this awkward mix of brains and brawn mean exactly? Well, it means you have one very compelling movie worthy of some serious praise and recognition. You see, only very rarely does this clashing of art, idea and cinematic excitement come together so eloquently and natural that you're simultaneously engaged in this fantastical world so far beyond your own imagination but at the same time brought crashing home to your own through use of allegory. This mixture gives District 9 its central motif of sorts in that with the prerequisite composition of humanity itself comes the good, the bad, and you guessed it, the ugly. Embodying this theme not just in subtext, but through the use of survival-action which brings out such shades of human nature explicitly, District 9 is undoubtedly a science-fiction masterpiece sure to be revered long after it closes on box offices and enters the pages of cinematic history. It's got adrenaline, but it's got heart and head too—the foundations of our humanity, and therefore the very foundations of film itself.A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Respect Thy Prawny Neighbour,"Now that Peter Jackson has fallen into the Hollywood trap directing overlong excessive spectacles, at least he supports fresh talents who make highly original modestly budgeted genre pics with hearts and brains... just like he once did.Neill Blomkamp's the name of one of these protégés and his first feature-length pic marks an electrifying starting point. This highly entertaining sci-fi action movie creates a tense and unusually credible setting with both tragic and satirical leanings and a seamless blending of doc-style versus clear-cut storytelling and top-notch CGI effects. The talented cast of unknown performers is another plus.Unfortunately, the pic's intensity declines slightly in the second half while the action elements take over. And the rushed ending is not completely satisfactory.

Why can't they make more movies like this?,"I'm not a science fiction fan at all so maybe I don't know what I'm talking about and being too generous by giving this movie a 9/10. But this really is one of the most stunning movies I saw this year. It's so weird (in a good way) that you can't help but applaud the filmmaker for having the guts to make a movie like this.The film is set in an alternate reality and starts by telling us of an alien spaceship that stalled over Johannesburg, SA in the 1980s. Nothing emerges from the ship so the SA govt sends a team to explore it and they find it filled with aliens. They're malnourished and in need of attention so they bring them down and set up a community for them to live in. This area soon becomes a militarised slum (District 9).Skip forward about 20 years and we are introduced to Wikus van de Merwe who is in charge of relocating aliens to a new area. Legally, the govt. needs the signed consent of the aliens to move them and it's his job to get their signature and deal with any unruly aliens. Things don't go as planned and Wilke is forced to face up to some ugly realities.The story, special effects and message are all great. It switches between ""documentary"" footage and the feature film to give it a sense of authenticity and there's also a great sense of humour, which caught me off guard but didn't seem out of place.What I loved about this movie was how realistic it felt. Every other alien movie you've seen has a showdown between the two races and it's either us or the alien race as the aggressor. This movie treats the aliens more as a different race than as dangerous visitors. Initially, there are no fireworks, no display of superiority, instead the showdown is in the form of a bizarre refugee crisis as South Africans are forced to coexist with their new neighbours.There are some slow parts during the second half, which fu cks with the pacing but these are forgivable flaws in a movie this unique.Easily one of the best movies I saw this year.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
What are we watching again!?!?,"So, name a movie that is a mix of mockumentary, thriller, action, sci-fi, and political commentary? Can't come up with one? Well, in case a random question like this pops up in Jeopardy, the answer is District 9. Resembling nothing that was shown in the trailer, District 9 is a crazy-different way to look at cinema and the genre of science fiction. The movie itself is split into two major parts: starting off as a subtle hilarious mockumentary, but then quickly shifts in tone when the stakes are higher and danger is rounding the corner. This unique approach to telling the story about aliens stranded in Earth being shunned from human society will whether totally impress you or bore you to death, its very hit-and-miss. Even if the beginning isn't your cup of tea, stick around, because the true insanity starts once the events behind the camera start unfolding.District 9 involves a man Wikus (Sharlto Copley), in charge of attempting to peacefully relocate the alien species currently inhabiting Earth. With the entire army behind him, he sets off to District 9 to warn the aliens to move without conflict, or problems will occur. In the midst of the relocating and checking for any illegal activities and supplies, he becomes exposed to their biotechnology, resulting in him becoming a fugitive and in grave danger of losing everything he had worked for. At the same time, some of the aliens may be making process towards ending their alienation (pun intended) with the Earth. Based off of a short film directed by the same man helming this visual roller coaster, District 9 is a major allegory to the issues happening in Africa and the Middle East. Yes, there is a political slant involved, but it never distracts from the original story.The script is quite clever, but it's the directing and visual style that absolutely stands out. The first half of the movie is in a documentary format full of interviews and backstory as to how the scenario (and now issue) has come at hand. In this same documentary format, we enter the District 9 world, and see the poor condition the aliens were living through. We also see the corruption, greed, and evilness that occupy the same area. The camera vibrates, moves, and breathes just like a documentary, and the footage of the aliens intertwining and interacting with humans looks downright realistic to the core. Special effects and special directing can be attributed to this incredible accomplishment.Acting also enhances the documentary feel, as a good portion of the dialogue in the beginning is improvised on the spot, giving it an even greater feel that these events can be unfolding thousands of miles away. Everyone reacts to the CGI aliens with accuracy and realism, almost as well as Jurassic Park (which remains the best film in terms of the actors interacting with the special effects). Unlike in most sci-fi flicks, there is a good bit of emotional sentimentality, especially that of Wikus and his wife.The second half is where the entire movie turns around and becomes something totally different. In a style akin to From Dusk Till' Dawn (which turned from suspense to full-out vampire horror), District 9 starts off as a politically-motivated mockumentary with humorous undertones to a heavy action thriller with science fiction touches left and right. This will whether enhance the movie for you or totally turn you off from it. The shift in style never really changes the tone and theme of the movie, so it was a seamless transition (unlike From Dusk Till' Dawn and Pineapple Express), and one that feeds the action-starved viewers sitting through the first half. We wondered where the R-rating came from, and it wasn't until the action began dominating that we didn't see it.Neill Blomkamp directed the documentary footage well, but truly showed his skills when the action increased, especially considering the low budget. The weapons were impressive, the shootouts were tightly-edited, and the film never drops in suspense and thrills until the very end of the film. With very little time to breathe, you see blood spill to the screen, you see bodies flying everywhere, and you see that with a limited budget, you can still deliver very impressive visuals. While the ending came up a bit fast considering all we went through, it was a crazy ride from start to finish, and one you cannot claim you've been through before.Bottom Line: District 9 is the cure for the common sci-fi. This film will become a major influence to studios everywhere, because it was a visually stunning film, and it comes with a budget of less than 35 million—which is less than a quarter of the budget of Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. Blomkamp's first film was a success because of his ability to blend special effects and capture the emotions of the actors and actresses involved without going over-the-top. The first half gives the film a small sense of realism, and the second half gives the film a dosage of adrenaline that propels the movie through around half an hour of relentless action. As long as you don't mind the total shift in genre and style, then you are in for an exhilarating two hours.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

The choice of Johannesburg is good as well, it allows for the film to tackle some real life issues as well as deliver a mind blowing sci-fi plot.The film definitely has a point to make about apartheid and racial segregation. This movie shows how harsh humans can be when there is a different race looking to seek refuge in their country, it really makes us out as monsters at points.The main character is played brilliantly by Sharlto Copley, looks like he could become a huge star off of the back of this film.

"Unique story, AWESOME frags, regular actors, chunks of other movies = One of a kind film","So I am going to say what a lot of other people have said about this movie without revealing too much of the plot or fawning over how much I liked this movie. Yes, Billy, it is a unique story and nothing like I've seen ever before. I also have to dispel the whole ""racism"" thing that many have said is in this movie, that's total pap. I suppose if you REALLY wanted to stretch it, some of the signs in the movie that say ""Humans Only"" or that have the alien with the circle-and-slash (/) ""No"" marked through them, then it's an allusion to the ""Whites Only"" of the south in the KKK days. MAYBE I can see that. In any case, that's within the 1st 5 minutes of the movie and is more a visual plot device and NOTHING MORE. Sorry, no Billy Bob rednecks running around with nooses doing lynchings. The growing tensions between the Prawns and the people of Johannesburg causes riots and could be akin to the race riots of the 1960s. Allegory, yes. Overt racism? Come on, give me a break.I feel that this movie is an amalgam of a lot of movies that I've seen in the past with elements taken out of them and mashed up to make this movie. Remember Alien Nation from the 80s? A bunch of Aliens show up on earth with nowhere to go and nothing to do, they integrate into society but soon enough decline into the same sad state as regular humanity? I saw a smattering of that movie here along with the desperate, hardscrabble world of (insert your post-apocalypse movie here), the non-stop sense of what-the-heck-is-going-on from a movie like Cloverfield, and a bit of Bizarro-world mixed in with a Kafkaesque piece of Clock World Orange's character Alex. Maybe an anti-Alex? I'm also thinking a pinch of Enemy Mine plot elements thrown in for those astute enough to pick them out as the story progresses into the 2nd half of the movie. I see pieces and elements of ALL these movies in there.The movie opens up with the main character talking to the viewer and is this normal work-a-day guy from MNU (Multi-National United) who's getting a promotion to lead the Prawns to a new settlement away from Johannesburg's ""District 9"" because of the social tensions. Tasked with the huge job of transplanting and eviction (Trail of Tears anyone?), our main character finds it easier said than done and gets massive resistance from the Prawns and crushing pressure from the government, military, MNU, and those with other hidden agendas (MNU). The plot just takes off from there and I won't reveal any more as you should see it for yourself.What makes this movie work and work well is that it's presented in the same continuous-shot manner as movies like 28 Days Later, Cloverfield, and Blair Witch without intentional editing or shots being contrived. While some may argue it doesn't work well for those other movies, this movie presents itself almost as an unedited documentary on the attempt to move the Prawns out of District 9 and how it doesn't goes as planned. Don't take that to mean that this movie is boring, it's not.I also have to agree with what some others have said about the CG in this movie. It is not intrusive, mechanical, or in any way two dimensional. The alien characters are very believable and the composition always blends in well with the movie. It's not actors standing in front of a green-screen talking to dead air and the aliens are pasted in later in post-production. It is entirely fluid. I almost wonder if the fact that they used regular actors is why this movie and CG aliens was pulled off with such ease. Not gratuitous, just well executed. Of all the junk that came out this summer, this one was a sleeper. I loved it. Whether it qualifies as Sci-Fi will be up to others to debate. Oh yeah, I almost forgot, when the bad guys get it with the alien guns: KABOOM! FRAG! FRAG! FRAG! It was worth it alone for those scenes.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Science Fiction Classic,"I was in my 3rd deployment to Iraq when I saw the trailer on IMDb for District 9. From the trailer I knew the basic story and being a fan of Peter Jackson this instantly went to the top of my must see list. I was fortunate to come home on leave from Iraq during the time the film opened and went to see film opening weekend. After one viewing I want to see it again, this is one of the best films of the year. The movie tells the story of a gargantuan alien spacecraft that stalls in the sky over Johannesburg South Africa. When no contact is made by the aliens it is we humans who become the invaders and the movie turns the usual science fiction conventions on it's ear by showing us as the monsters. In a nice bit of irony the aliens were more human than the real humans. The best science fiction holds a mirror up to our world and this was a refreshing change from the usual. Just from the trailer I could tell that the movie was an allegory for apartheid and to his credit director Neil Blomkamp doesn't hit us over the head with it. The film's 30 million budget shows that what intelligence and creativity can do. The production values are all top notch with the special effects being among the best I have ever seen. The titular slum far surpasses anything in Slumdog Millionaire and further adds to the realism. The 3rd act of the movie is the weakest being a shoot em up but it is so well done that the strengths outweigh the weaknesses.The performance by Sharlton Copley is brilliant. He is a revelation and this a star making performance. This is intelligent absorbing science fiction of the highest order a true classic of the genre not to be missed.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Great tale about aliens who come to earth and the real danger is to themselves......,"Peter Jackson isn't exactly orthodox with his choice of films, and he continues in that vein with this gem. Aliens (or ""prawns"" as they are referred to) have arrived and are cornered into ramshackle ghettos in Johannesburg South Africa. Bad enough for humans, the aliens themselves appear degenerate in their surroundings. Along comes the ""MNU"" unit led by Wikus van der Merwe to evict the aliens and force them into a squalid camp which is nothing less than a concentration camp. Winke is a man who had landed his lead role through old fashioned nepotism and is seriously out of his depth. By some accident, he becomes infected by a liquid which slowly is transforming him into one of the aliens themselves. The race is on for him to find a cure to reverse the condition and the need to forge an unlikely alliance to get this done.The storyline may not appeal to most but it is actually very fascinating. The film turns the genre on its head in many ways. The aliens are generally weak despite being technically advanced, our lead character is a weak man (no Flash Gordon) and the setting is the unlikely location of Johannesburg (South Africa). The last part is important. The film really is a social commentary or reflection on South African and racism from the old Apartheid days. It's quite startling and a bit of an eye opener. Maybe as it's not humans as the victims, you feel less uncomfortable in watching it but there the point hits home in a way.The initial mock documentary style direction gets you into the action and story, whilst the acting by our lead man is great. He has to make you change your emotions for him a number of times in the film, from humour to horror to disgust and then to sympathy and so on. The aliens are very inhuman in their appearance but the CGI is excellent and you really believe they are for real at points. Some good action carries you along but the portrayal of the Nigerians in the camps is understandably controversial. That's a discussion for another day, best just see them representative of a gangster group (no matter what colour, race or nationality).Anyhow, it's a very good film, but definitely more for adults (not at all for kids). It can amaze and frighten, and at the end you will have a lot to think and talk about. Good themes and great direction. The film is open-ended so allows for a sequel. On this showing, many will be looking forward to its release.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Brilliant Film!,"Peter Jackson always comes out with great films, and this is no exception. District 9 is directed by Niel Blomkamp and it is based on his short film Alive in Joburg. This movie is freaking awesome! The story was amazing and acting was brilliant! The special effects weren't bad either. Do yourself a favor and go see this movie immediately or else you will be missing out on one of the best movies of 2009. The movie is rated R and for a good reason. There is plenty of violence and tons of gore and the language is strong and constant.So overall i give District 9 a full 10 out of 10. Go see it right now!!!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Shaky-cam has got to go,"I thought aliens look great, it's a good plot, the characters are good (some of them are a little cookie-cutter but no major complaints).but the constantly shaking camera has got to go. I know some movies are filming this way (a la MTV style) to give it ""added"" excitement but this film had great action already - if you add the shaky cam it removes the element of tension-release and creates nothing but tension. Total drag.So I would've given it a 9 but 2 points deducted for shaky-cam, making it a 7 overall. :)Wow it looks like they want me to write another line - I didn't want to continue because I would just start babbling. ummmmm... let me think .... I was actually really excited to see this movie - it was the plot element that drew me in. It was about what I expected - it wasn't all that deep but was a nice solid plot to build a scifi movie on.

Incredible,"I started seeing this movie at about 1 am. After the movie ended I sat in bed for another 10 minutes shocked by the amazing new genre. Then I said to myself ""Now I can die"" , it seriously was that good. The title of the movie ""District 9"" is so simple and perfect, sounds SciFi and a bit dark which it is. I was so impressed that I started reading reviews and made this IMDb account. After a while reading, something caught my attention. It was something like this : ""if the fans liked it, there will be for sure District 10"" . Just imagine the beauty of a second part with a higher budget. Now let us talk a bit of this weird genre.I have seen a comedy a while ago about a music artist called It's All Gone Pete Tong.People say it is real cause it was made like a documentary, what they didn't know is that it was a mock of a documentary. Mockumentary or mock documentary is a genre of film and television, or a single work of the genre. District 9 is done in exactly the same way and guess what, it worked perfectly.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Worth a look. Not your generic sc-fi film.,"Although I used to be an avid reader of sc-fi.

not overrated,"I absolutely love this movie. Very good acting, plots and direction. Very unlike other sci-fi movies, it's just different.

A : The aliens were out of special fuel. Only they have the knowledge to synthesize such fuelQ : Why does alien fuel turn a guy into an alien? A : The fuel might contain some sort of special DNA, or molecules required to stabilize the DNA contamination in Wikus.Q : Why would Wikus only cut off a finger? A : Wikus wanted to cut off his whole hand, but wanted to try a finger first. Alas he couldn't stand the painQ : Why didn't the aliens retaliate with their superior technology? A : The aliens were found to be in a bad state. Humans helped nourished them. The aliens were thankful to humans and accepted their place in district 9, and didn't think humans as the enemy.Q : Why would the government allow the aliens to be so loosely controlled? A : No government is perfect. Cost factor. Corruption.Q : Why do the aliens act like savages even though they are supposed to be an advanced race? A : They think differently, they might think trash is not an eyesore.

Aliens - go home,"Storyline An extraterrestrial race is forced to live within ""the projects"" (Yo, homie !) located in central Africa, striving to meek out their existence in hopes of returning to their home planet which they've been away from now for oh,twenty f'n years! A spirited government agent who is exposed to their unique biotechnology may be their final hope or pull their air all together. Think: ""Going Postal"" meets ""E.T."" . . . on crack.The Cast and Crew Hats off to Neill Blomkamp for not writing and directing what seems to be his first flick, but convincing folks to lend him tens of millions to make a sci-fi movie which appears written during some serious whippit sessions; which I'm sure he thought, ""it'll knock those tasty Reese's Pieces right outta cute little E.T.'s, glow-stick hand"" – Dumb, dumb, ta'daa Oh, so sorry Neill, with two ""ls"" for good measure, but you've just lost inLet's Make a Movie!

A couple of the military guys were okay, but the rest could just have been wallpaper as far as I care – give me the aliens; I am your leader!

If your have narcolepsy make sure your buddy/husband/wife/elicit lover has a cattle prod next to ya at all times. Once those minutes are over though, you're in for a treat; great visuals and somewhat ethical think-age you may experience, so pop a vitamin before hand, okay. The story becomes quick and really refreshing after those long forty.There's a real spin in this story and beautiful character arcs when I look back. Also, just when you think you've seen it all regarding blood and guts being sprayed about and even on ya, District 9, gives us a little more. Think, 300 – Blomkamp made this flick in that vain. Made you feel right in the mix; however, the documentary style approach in the first 40 severely clashed with the ""authentic"" approach (as if you are there) during the remainder of the movie – no balance and amateurish. Left some room for a sequel though. Good call, Blom. Who knows? Maybe. Just maybe.Loved the take on aliens and humans living on the same planet with the ethical dilemmas unleashed here; really fresh, if you cut the first forty I'd gladly bump you up a star or two.Bottom Line If you're into sci-fi you really can't go wrong – a truly unique storyline; however, wait until that rainy day and catch it at home – and fast forward the first forty, in case I forgot to mention that.Ck - iratefilms",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Best Sc Fi for our Generation,"This mind blowing indie film is in my opinion the best picture of 2009. We were lucky to get precious sci-fi art gems in the past decades. 2001 A Space Odyssey, Blade Runner etc were sci fi masterpieces. But there were no sci-fi masterpieces in our technological era(Apart from some good films ). Odd, but true,cinema of 21st century was deprived of a true scifi film with real substance and insight. But the wait is over. We got our masterpiece in this small indie film. It ruthlessly unveils human darkness, our ethnic intolerance and questions the basis of our civilization. Metaphorically rich, thought provoking, magnificent acting,strong narrative and splendid direction, District 9 is awesome in many ways.I bet you, this one is not gonna be forgotten soon.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Aliens and apartheid - fascinating science fiction,"One of the things I liked about ""District 9"" is its avoidance of typical science fiction film clichés. As in many science fiction movies, a huge flying saucer arrives and hovers over a major city. No, not New York or Washington, but post-Mandela Johannesburg, South Africa. Another premise that shows the writers, Neill Blomkamp and Terri Tatchell, are not dealing with clichés is that the aliens in the saucer are emaciated and unorganized.The South African government helps these aliens get out of their ship and cordons off an area in the city for their use. They call that area ""District 9"". Over many years, the South African population grows disenchanted with the aliens because of their disgusting habits and dependence on the public for their housing and sustenance (they consume large quantities of cat food.) District 9 has become a disreputable slum. So the government decides to relocate the aliens to a different area (District 10) far outside of the city. This is obviously a reference to South Africa's apartheid past, when blacks were required to live in designated townships.The story is told in a documentary reality TV style, with never-shown videographers following the actions of the bureaucrat assigned to manage the transfer of the aliens that we the audience are supposed to be watching. Like other films and TV series of that genre (""The Office"" comes to mind) we soon see scenes in which that format no longer works. One could imagine that the documentary film makers had filmed a staged reenactment of what had happened, but as we do with ""The Office,"" it is easier to just ignore the discrepancy.The second half of the film does have some clichés, notably a super-powerful and nearly indestructible machine that is controlled by movements of the person inside it.Although the first part of the film is good drama, it eventually turns into an adventure film with violence, weapons, and chase scenes. The capabilities the writers give to the alien technology is perhaps inconsistent between the early scenes and later ones.But the film accomplishes what many good science fiction novels and short stories of the past have done in giving us some philosophical issues to ponder over.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Reinstates my belief in science fictions films. It's a wonder!!!!,"I've never been much of a man for science-fiction movies. After the days of ""Star Wars"" and ""Back to the Future"", Hollywood went through a period of time where everything sci-fi that it spewed was absolute trash, but lately it's beginning to redeem itself with incredibly good films such as ""WALL-E"", ""Star Trek"" and the incomparable ""Avatar"". So when a friend recommended I watch a sci-fi film called ""District 9"" directed by Neill Blomkamp and produced by Peter Jackson, I did so with many expectations...and I must say the film delivers, enormously. I obtained a sense of utter satisfaction from watching it, and I declare it's one of the best sci-fi movies I've ever seen.It's completely fictional, of course. In a near future, a gigantic alien spaceship has arrived to Earth and is now suspended in midair over the city of Johannesburg in South Africa. After 3 months of uncertainty, humans board the spaceship and find millions of aliens living therein, malnourished, sick and in need of assistance; so the humans decide to transport all of these aliens to a holding camp in Johannesburg where the aliens can regain their strength and repose. These Prawns (that's how humans decided to call them, because of their obvious resemblance to prawns) are generally peaceful and adapt quickly to the rule of men, and they quickly become a hot subject for 'alien rights' and countless discussions and organizations worldwide. But they begin taking over the holding camp, so humans must evacuate it and fence it, and this alien camp on Earth becomes known as District 9.Now, District 9 is a serious problem because the Prawns have made their own small world inside it, they're reproducing at a fast rate and they're engaging in shady activities which cause great commotion to humans...so the MNU, the Office of Alien Affairs, decides to relocate the millions of Prawns to a larger camp outside of Johannesburg where they may not pose such a risk to humans, and they send their top employee Wikus Wan de Merwe (Sharlto Copley) with a team of soldiers to notify the Prawns of their eviction. Now, Wikus is a sweet, sympathetic, jolly man who takes this new job with happiness and excitement, but he's in no way prepared for what he encounters inside District 9...or how his entrance into the alien society will affect his life and that of his fellow humans.Now, where should I start? The movie is filmed almost in documentary style, with a variety of scientists, sociologists and experts being interviewed; they open the film by explaining everything that happened when the alien spaceship appeared on Earth, and lots of news footage is shown. Wikus is also interviewed, alongside some of his family members, and we immediately begin to establish a personality to this jolly man, who adores his wife and who tries to do his job as well as he can. He has a fascination with the Prawns, and we see him fidgeting excitedly and grinning from ear to ear when he's given the mission at District 9. He's a character we immediately like and easily identify with, even if he DOES have some traits that disturb us...like his unnerving need to touch everything, to explore, to probe into things that are really not of his concern. We see him like a sociable person who greets everyone at the base, who messes with soldiers' weapons without knowing what they are and who, once inside the camp, explores the alien settlement with fascination, touching, touching, touching.Before Wikus enters District 9, the interviewees on screen foreshadow an ominous event that 'happened' in District 9, and with which Wikus was heavily involved; that event is what the film is all about. The majority of scenes are taken by a hand-held camera, or from the buzzing helicopters, and it serves to involve us in the film's plot to a point where it feels like it's us walking beside Wikus, traversing the district. The editing is remarkable- scenes change, camera angles change perfectly, capturing that facial gesture, that body movement, lingering on that doubtful expression long enough to create tension and to move, fast-paced, onto the next scene. The score quite good, and since it's extremely subtle and muted, we're hardly aware it's there, and it builds up from sound to sound until we're so immersed in the action on screen we never really noticed when it got there to enhance the thrill and the suspense.This seems at first like any underground film, with a complete cast and crew of 'unknowns', but we KNOW it's mainstream Hollywood because of the impressive special effects and the magnificent production, manned by producer Peter Jackson. Just recalling his name reminds us of the astounding visual quality of his films, ""The Lord of the Rings"" and ""King Kong"", so there's really no need for me to try and explain the visual effects- they're amazing.Technically, the film is heavenly perfection. Thankfully, it also has a story, and a very good one at that. Now, the truly remarkable thing about the story is that it manages to involve us and it makes us actually CARE about the characters on screen, alien and human, even through some absurdly quirky characteristics of the plot. For example, the aliens who look like Prawns- they look cute and weird at the same time. Or the fact they could basically kill for cat food, which is practically their drug. A scene where tension is released and a possible street brawl featuring heavy gunfire is stopped with the help of some cans of cat food would seem laughable and silly in the hands of another director, but Neill Blomkamp has written and directed a story which, even through its implausibility, commands our attention and weaves a tapestry of action and suspense.The downfall of the film? I can't think of any.Rating: 3 stars and a half out of 4!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
I bet some people wanted their money back,"But I pretty much loved it. It helps if you've caught some South African sci-fi previous, though it isn't absolutely necessary. I was impressed with 2 things in particular: That the aliens were as believable as they were and that the movie celebrates ordinary, stupid humans. On the negative side there's an awful lot of sordid filth (not sex, more like garbage) in this film. After a while you get used to it. And, incredibly, you get to feel for the aliens! Now THAT'S a trick! There's suspense and a love story and action. And the quality of the CGI is wonderful. Some of the machines are near perfect. But this isn't going to be everyone's idea of a great time at the movies. But if your people aren't either squeamish or closed minded, this is one of the best new takes on the whole alien thing you're going to find anywhere.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

"Role-Reversal Alien Thriller is One Part Documentary, One Part Allegory and One Part Horror Film","It's strange to call a science-fiction thriller eerily captivating, but first-time feature director Neill Blomkamp has somehow managed to earn that description with a most unexpected twist on the alien invasion genre of films. Based on a six-minute short, ""Alive in Joburg"", he made back in 2005, director/co-screenwriter Neill Blomkamp has fashioned a propulsive, corking adventure film that manages to be a thoughtful allegory on xenophobia, corporate greed, and due to its South African location, apartheid. What is most fascinating about the screenplay co-written by Terri Tatchell is that the aliens are not positioned to the viewer as an unknown force ready to destroy mankind, as is usually the case, but rather as an escalating socio-political ""situation"" to which the South African government respond by assigning a multinational corporation to transport them from a ramshackle, inner-city shantytown called District 9 to another area outside of Johannesburg.Turning our expectations upside down, Blomkamp reveals an obviously powerful alien species rendered helpless on earth by their refugee status and relegated to criminal acts. In mock-documentary style, the story begins with a series of interviews explaining the back story for the aliens. A gigantic spaceship hovers over Johannesburg in 1982 (shades of Roland Emmerich's 1996 ""Independence Day"") where an exploratory team discovers over a million malnourished aliens onboard without a leader. They are tall bipeds with insect-like faces and crustacean-like bodies (looking very much like Jeff Goldblum's fully transformed title character in David Cronenberg's 1986 remake of ""The Fly""). Over the next two decades, the aliens conform to their squalid surroundings and engage in destructive behavior that raises the ire of the local residents who call them derogatorily ""prawns"". An officious Afrikaan field operative named Wikus Van De Merwe has been assigned the unenviable task of serving eviction notices to the aliens and confiscating their weaponry.On one particular raid, Van De Merwe inadvertently sprays himself with a mysterious liquid that mutates his DNA to take on alien characteristics. He is shunted to District 9 where he relies on a more thoughtful alien named Christopher Johnson to help him reverse the transformation process. Before that can happen, the multinational corporation wants Van De Merwe for his new-found ability to handle alien weaponry (which humans cannot operate). There is also trouble brewing with Nigerian gangs eventually leading to a violent mêlée that decides the fate of not only Van De Merwe but also the aliens on earth. Blomkamp decided to cast a first-time feature actor, Sharlto Copley, as Van De Merwe, and he is quite effective in the role. At first, he appears to be a geeky corporate lackey married to the boss's daughter and intent on carrying forth his undesirable mission with little trepidation. Copley manages to show his character's arc in not only the manifestation of graphic effects but also through the sinking dejection he experiences as an evolving alien.All the aliens are CGI-generated, and kudos belong to the visual effects team headed by Dan Kaufman, Peter Muyzers, Robert Habros, and Matt Aitken for giving them a scarifying look to contrast their increasingly vulnerable state. Make no mistake that despite the film's grander statements regarding the detrimental impact of social segregation, it turns primarily into a man-on-the-run (or should I say ""alien-on-the-run"") B-style thriller with eye-wincing horror elements. There is a robust set of extras with the two-disc 2010 DVD set. The first disc contains 25 minutes of deleted scenes, a strong making-of documentary, and an engaging commentary track from Blomkamp. The second disc is on the light side, offering four featurettes which detail various aspects of the production, but unfortunately, there is no sign of the original short, ""Alive in Joburg"".",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

"""Homeward Bound: With Love from Africa""","Great watch, will watch again, and highly recommended.This has a wonderfully exciting premise: alien refugees on Terra, how Terrans react and how the aliens react. The premise, as delivered, has some odd holes in though: it's specified that all of the crew have died, mysteriously, and no one knows how to operate the ship, but it's been in the air for some time. The idea of gravity alone should have motivated Johannesburg to evacuate, but their government interaction seems decidedly weak.The advantage of setting the story in South Africa, for an American audience, is that it's a very capitalistic society where they speak chiefly English: it's very similar to being set in Mexico and using Mexican Cartels instead of Nigerian gangs.So if we accept that we haven't been able to extract an incident report, that we're not able to move the ship, and none of the xenos can move the ship, then the premise includes that one xenos knows what to do. One would think that he just talks to someone and he gets all his people off planet, but since he's smart enough to do what he's been doing for 20 years, then he knows not to trust anyone. But this self-serving principle is key to understanding character motivations going forward.The writing in this is so good, along with the effects, and performance delivery. As Vickis deals with his transformation, it prompts so many philosophical questions of what it is to be a person / human / xenos, a citizen, a government agent. It also sort of resembles a gangsta / heist movie at parts, as opposed to a anti-government escapee.If any of the deep stuff worried you, then be at ease that this movie has plenty of explosions, gunfire and sci-fi goodness. It's also filled with some silly cliches that serve the points of the story, but there are several points in this movie that I have to shake my head at. The motivations don't make sense unless you're reminded that everyone, including the protagonists, are (forced) in a self-serving mindset and it's about what they can do for themselves, even when working together with the contrast being, of course, that only when anyone is cooperating that anyone gets anywhere.This is such a great watch, and if you like sci-fi styled stuff, and don't mind the South African setting (""Chappie"" is another one), then definitely give this a watch.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A science fiction masterpiece,"Visually stunning, powerfully acted, and filled with social commentary, 'District 9' contains everything it needs to become a science fiction classic.Aliens have arrived. Decades have passed. And the conditions are dire. In Johannesburg, South Africa, the malnourished 'Prawns' are isolated to an internment camp by the government. During a relocation procedure, a pleasant government agent - Wikus Van Der Merwe - gets exposed to alien biotechnology and must go on the run, in the process learning what it means to be an outsider on his own planet...Dealing with relevant sociopolitical issues to great effect, 'District 9' begins as a pseudo-documentary before turning into an action-packed blockbuster. Themes of social segregation and xenophobia are explored, using the aliens to demonstrate the corruption that permeates this alternate reality.The friendly but naive protagonist is played by Sharlto Copley, and in his first major role he gives an extraordinary performance filled with palpable emotion. His arc is powerful, with his slow transformation representing a literal one, as well as a moral one. He's a decent person who doesn't realise just how good is he until he's pushed to stand up to the injustice around him, and this becomes prominent during the intense and bloody climax.Neill Blomkamp proves himself an accomplished director, not just through the ability to tell a thoroughly gripping and worthy story, but also through visuals. 'District 9' achieves a lot on its modest budget, blending naturalistic and realistic computer-generated effects to provide a bleak and believable landscape scarred by government intervention and abandonment. The gritty camerawork serves the film well too, particularly once the action starts, and the music suits the setting while also becoming memorable in its own right. These techniques will soon become staples of Blomkamp's oeuvre.Overall, 'District 9' is Neill Blomkamp's masterpiece, cleverly imparting relevant themes while giving its everyday protagonist a hero arc worth rooting for.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Scatological allegory of the Iraq War or just a good B-movie? Either way, it works.","29 year-old South African director Neill Blomkamp co-wrote and directed ""District 9"", which is based on his 2005 short film ""Alive in Joburg"". An alien force, after years of living in slum-like conditions on Earth, finds a pariah to their ""cause"" when a government agent (Sharlto Copley) is exposed to their biotechnology and has to fight a horrific physical mutation, as he runs away from the authorities who want him dead. The story is simple enough and the not-so-new, hand-held camera documentary-style approached here works, even if some might call it gimmicky.It's hard not to see ""District 9"" as a scatological allegory of the Iraq War, although we can't tell for sure whether that was the filmmaker's original intention or not. Considering Peter Jackson is the producer, it could very well have been conceived as just a good B-movie, and it works as such, too (Copley, the protagonist, reminds me of Timothy Balme from Jackson's hilarious and gory cult classic ""Braindead/Dead Alive""). If Kathryn Bigelow's recent ""The Hurt Locker"" is arguably the best open account of the Iraq tragedy so far (its vertiginous style feeling like ""Black Hawk Down"" with substance), ""District 9"" is probably the best unapologetically goofy allegory we'll get. 7/10.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Decent, but story had some major oversights","The movie wasn't bad, but IMO doesn't have much replay value. I'm sure many have asked the same questions I have. Why in heck would intelligent aliens trade advanced weaponry for cat food? Couldn't they just invade the local Coscto? Did they feel that threatened by our 9mm handguns? Is barbed wire kryptonite? Seriously. Also, if they couldn't go home 20 years ago....how are they (all of a sudden) able to fly home at the end? Also. A virus that can transform one species into another? Really? How would you rate a movie where a virus transformed a pig into a monkey? C'mon now.The story has merit and potential but IMO doesn't succeed in capitalizing on them. Basically, human greed for power and money trumps the rights and well being of the individual, animals, or in this case....an alien race. This basic theme applies to both the MNU and the Nigerian gang, but I think much of this main message got lost in the cinematography.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Clutched by the tentacle,"Review Three: District 9A very original film from Blomkamp, District 9 is the film everyone was talking of in 2009. A brilliant mix of a pseudo-documentary and an alternative action thriller, this slow starting film turns into a spectacular display of both writing ability and directive talent. The first feature length film by Blomkamp based of a short he wrote years earlier does anything but bore its viewer.Even in our extremely slow opening sequence, it's hard to ignore the charming lead Wikus (Copley) with his entertaining mannerisms and strange behaviors. As unrealistic as he can get, it's hard to deny an emotional connection to this well built character. By the end of this film, you'll explore every emotion with him and the so called 'prawns'. Prawns are ironically, very much the most realistically deep characters.Visually, little is flawed. While these aliens don't look real, it's easy to accept them, as it's likely due to our contexts which originally denies their appearance as satisfactory. The so called UFO is stunning, as are many of the commonplace effects (explosions and the likes). The few flaws are easily overlooked, such as the aliens not being as blurry as the shots they sometimes appear in front.Some scenes are harder to watch than others, and you may find yourself laughing one moment and then averting your eyes the next. As a demonstration of human emotion, this film shows how to achieve any.Despite the movie being spectacular, I can honestly say I have no craving to repeat viewing it any time soon. The film is often hard to watch, often strange and never predictable. Every twist and turn will leave you hanging closer to the edge of the seat.As a popcorn film, or a film to make one happy, this film scores a low 3/10. If you're willing to let go and admire the well written story, deciphering it as you go, then it easily becomes an 8/10. Hollywood follows formula to make viewers comfortable, but District 9 puts most alien involved films to shame, and through construction of characters, environments and stories, you'll feel uncomfortable with many other alien films from here on in. District 9 has a spark which not many films have. Highly recommended. A SOLID 8/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
An ideal Sci-Fi movie,"Incredibly acted and well told story with a somewhat original perspective on alien contact that tried to realistically portray extraterrestrial beings making them as different from us as possible. Different in looks , way of living , diet , intelligence and so forth , unlike most Hollywood Sci-Fi movies who put silly make up on random actors and try to pass them as aliens. Sharlto Copley also gave an impressive performance nailing both the comedic and emotional roles he was given.But the story seemed to have been short as it was trying to tell a bigger story thus left out a lot of details that could have made the story even more intriguing.District 9 was a richly fresh, gritty, darkly funny , entertaining sci-fi flick that should not be missed. Can't wait for the upcoming sequel.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
An unexpected gem... just watch it,I am South African but I did not watch this movie until 2021 when I was searching for a sci-fi movie on Netflix. I was pleasantly surprised!It is one of the few movies where extra terrestrials are not type-caste as superior beings... they are surprising flawed and emotional like humans and this is an important premise of the movie.It is not overly-way over the top like the typical Hollywood movie yet it is strongly thematic and the sets are made more authentic by the found footage approach.I must say that the squatter settlements in the movie look very authentic and the characters are developed well throughout the movie.It is an entertaining movie to watch but oh boy is it thought provoking too.... a fresh take for the alien/extra-terrestrial genre.,9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Sci-fi with heart,"District 9 is science fiction with heart and soul. A South African production which is an allegory on apartheid, I was impressed with the writers ability to deliver an important message while entertaining the audience with a fast paced and well made film.It all begins with a spaceship above Johannesburg which is boarded and found to be filled with starving aliens. They are given food and shelter and segregated to a district 9. The hatred starts quickly, as the guests are referred to as prawns. The e.t.'s and humans have small skirmishes which cause the government to assemble a private security force to relocate the foreigners to a district 10. They are forcibly removed from their shacks at district 9 with vicious brutality.A powerful fluid is discovered and a human named Wikus is sprayed in the face and transforms into a prawn with the ability to fire alien weapons. The military pursue him in hopes of analyzing the liquid which is needed to use the guns. Several battles ensue between the army and Wikus and the news media report the terrible treatment of the aliens. The parallels are obvious and District 9 is a welcome entry to the sci-fi field.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

"1st half looked like Borat, 2nd half much better","I don't think the following is a spoiler since I am being very general... But anyways: It is a good movie, but it could have been a great movie had it not been for the 1st half of the movie. I thought the 1st half reminded me too much of that Borat movie and the main character reminded me of the Borat character. The main character was kinda annoying to me due to the character not being as funny as intended. If you're into silly slap stick comedy, then you may find it funny-not to me though. I just kept wondering if he would get seriously injured by the aliens or not when attempting to evict them. That was the only suspenseful part during the 1st half of the movie. The 2nd part is where the action and suspense happens. I also wish there was more character development and background info on the other characters in the story, but I guess the writers are saving that for the sequel.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

I've rewatched it for the seconden time now after a few years and again i'm in awe.The choreography is absolutely brilliant, from the first second to the last.The main reasons why I'm convinced this film is a solid 10:the documentary-style of explaining the story. It's supposed to blur the lines between reality and fiction and man does it work! It feels like an accurate representation of what could happen if it was real.the racism, xenophobia, and inhumane treatment of the aliens is just jaw dropping. At times it really turns your stomach around whit just the way they treat those poor prawns. The movie definitely wants you to think about the whole thing.there's no obvious good and bad. I think in any good movie makes you want to think about this.after the documentary-story the plot starts to unravel and oh my do they have a plot in store for you.the timing and speed in which the world and the co-existance between prawns and humana are explained is perfect. Not too fast, you can understand everything, but the movie also doen't treat is like we're dumb and explains everything.Christopher JohnsonConcluding, while I believe I didn't spoil anything important, if you like sci-fi movies and want to ser a really realitic spin on the topic, just give it a shot.Have a good one everybody!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

You'll never look at prawns the same way again after this...,"""District 9"" is one of those movies that you can watch again and again, as it does prove to be every bit as entertaining every time. And it is a combination of many things which adds up here; the storyline, the characters, the acting talents, the pace and the special effects.Yes, all in all then I will say that ""District 9"" is a MUST watch movie if you enjoy action-packed Sci-Fi movies. Especially since it is loaded with actions, character evolution (literally) and some very good special effects and interesting creature designs.The story in ""District 9"" is about a derelict spaceship that comes to hang over Johannesburg. The government eventually herds the visiting alien creatures down to live in an area known as District 9, which quickly turns into a bad slum neighborhood. When the government has to enforce eviction notices to the extraterrestrial residents and relocate them to a camp outside out town, things take a bad turn for the head of the operation Wikus Van De Merwe (played Sharlto Copley).The audience is thrown right into a very interesting storyline right from the very beginning, and the story just picks up pace at an early start and never slows down. And a big thumbs up to director Neill Blomkamp for the accomplishment with this movie.However, it should also be said that the cast were doing good jobs in ""District 9"". Especially Neill Blomkamp, whom was almost singlehandedly carrying the entire movie. He was just phenomenal in the role of Wikus Van De Merwe. And his performance alone makes it well-worth watching the movie.And also the special effects in ""District 9"" were quite good and added a lot to the overall enjoyment of the movie. The special effects team really pulled it off quite well, and the spaceships, weapons and alien creatures were realistic and believable. And while we are on the creature design, then I really loved the way that they made the extraterrestrial creatures, or prawns as they were called, look. It was really impressive.The alien language was also quite interesting, although it does raise some issue about how some people could understand the aliens and vice versa. But I guess with having been on Earth for 20 years, that some communication between the species should have been established. But we are not given any clues to this throughout the movie.""District 9"" also briefly touch some more heavier topics under the surface, such as racial differences, intolerance and how people treat things which they don't understand. They are there, laying under the surface, but are not the core of the movie. They just add an extra spice to the movie as a whole.If you haven't seen ""District 9"" already it is well in its place that you get around to doing so, because it really is a good movie. I am rating it a solid eight out of ten stars.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Visually stunning by-the-numbers science-fiction-as-social-commentary.,"District 9 is very much in the tradition of what kept Star Trek from being an obscure, short-lived sixties television series ? discussing incendiary social issues in the context of fantastical alien stories. Here space aliens stranded on earth are saddled with derogatory nicknames, penned onto scrub land and harassed by the government. It could also be the story of native Americans, Palestinians, Eastern Europeans during World War II, Australian aborigines among many, many others. Given the South African setting the most specific reference is to Apartheid and the film must have particular emotional resonance in that country as well as many others on the African continent subjected to colonialism. Beyond being a technical marvel (somehow the movies solves the common problem of real actors not appearing to actually be looking at the CGI creatures when they share scenes) the film captures the techniques of oppression with great fidelity. The government?s representative trying to move the aliens, Wikus, from their squalid encampment to something more like a concentration camp (as he later admits) provides a running narrative for the press explaining what may seem like oppression and harassment is really in their best interests. He uses the threat of taking away their children to gain their compliance in the context of ?only doing what is best for the children?. Inevitably, Wikus is infected with alien genetic material and begins a transformation so that he can eventually come to understand things from their perspective. Here the visuals become less impressive as Wikus follows the physical transform patter of the original ?The Fly? (one arms turns alien first) and the remake of ?The Fly? (his fingernails start to fall off and he starts eating unpleasant things). As you realize from early in the film he winds up finding on the alien?s side. This predictable story line (shared by Disney?s ?Pocahontas?, James Cameron?s ?Avatar?, Kevin Costner?s ?Dances With Wolves? among many others) is one of the film?s weaker points as is a lack of characters that we can care about (the only sympathetic characters are aliens who are too, well, alien, to gain much audience sympathy). See it for the movie-making skill but not so much for the story.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A Classic if you stayed till the end!,"I must admit that I found this movie quite ridiculous on my first two attempts to watch it.

But then after reading all positive reviews, I thought I should give this movie one more go. Boy!! I was surprised. 3rd time I tried my attitude had changed. I was curious to know why this movie is known as such a great Sci-Fi. It was more like I was given one final chance to appreciate a movie what I call a Sci-Fi masterpiece.Once you pass the 30-40 min mark, it only gets more and more interesting, and keeps you so attached to the story. ""District 9"" creates a whole new perspective to the question ""What if Aliens really come to the Earth?""Acting and the story was amazing.

An Expanded Indie Sci Fi Film,"When I first saw the trailer, I did not think I will like this movie. Ugly mechanical-looking aliens coexisting with humans did not really appeal to me that much. When I saw the name of Peter Jackson (of ""Lord of the Rings"" fame) above the title in the poster, then I got interested. However, as the credits came up at the end of the movie, I discovered that Peter Jackson did not actually direct this film, but is just one of the producers. I guess they had to highlight Jackson's name since the director and actors in this project are all unknown.The whole film for me felt like an extended independent film with a budget for CG special effects. The aliens (derogatorily called ""prawns"") were housed in a slum township in Johannesburg called District 9. The aliens here are left to fend for themselves among greedy and deceitful humans. They lead bleak and violent lives, scavenging for food in garbage dumps and victimized by abusive human gangs. (How is that for a social allegory?) After 20 years of such tension-filled co-habitation, humans decided to move the aliens 200 km away from the city. And this is where the main story begins.I liked the documentary feel of the whole movie. The scenes were taken from the lenses of a television cameras, hand-held cameras or even security cameras. I liked the fact that there were no name actors in this film. In fact, the lead role was amazingly played by a first-time film actor named Sharlto Copley. His ordeal as Wikus van de Merwe, from the over-eager officer in charge of evicting the aliens from District 9 to his exposure and infection with an alien fluid was very well-portrayed. His performance was very natural, as if he was ad-libbing the whole time . This also added to the indie film feel of the film.Because of the indie film vibe of this film, I am ready to just overlook the obvious plot holes. The main holes dealt with the nature of the Prawns themselves. Why have they arrived all those years ago? Why have a seemingly advanced alien life form allow themselves to turn into savages? Why was the effort to return to the mother ship only undertaken by a single alien entity named Christopher (and his son)? And what is the exact nature of that mysterious alien fluid? Unfortunately, the film expects us to just accept these things as a given and gives us no explanations. Ignore them as I would, these glaring unanswered questions detract from the overall quality of the whole movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Lets start with the Good,"I can, somewhat, understand the high rating of this movie. Its action packed, takes you along from the start and keeps you with it the entire movie. I definitely like the documentary/news style filming. The cuts to normal camera work are smoothly done, and the non-static camera work contributes greatly.Being a relatively low budget movie I think the use of CGI is great. Its not superb, but definitely good enough. The acting is pretty good also, with a touch of surreality/absurdness in it (ie the parents and stuff).While that's all great and stuff, imo the story itself is the most important. making an action movie gets you so far, its the story line that needs to make sense.and in that this movie definitely fails. There are many...MANY.. smaller plot holes, which are sometimes forgivable, but not in these numbers. And there are large plot holes which aren't forgivable at all. To be fair, its like a story of a 7 y old totally awesome, but totally lacking consistency.****spoiler warning*****Lets just name a few obvious ones;alien ship hangs there for 3 years (I forgot I thought 3). apparently the aliens cant get out and need to be saved by the humans. No explanation as to why, but a sentence is given 'leaders all died' oh oke! how many were there?Aliens are like redneck hillbillies? there are a lot of them but all expect once seems to have any intelligence. Still they are pretty human like with human emotions and such.They are a bit aggressive, but not really hostile, yet they have a lot of big guns. Which they trade for crap with gangsters. Oke so the aliens are not really taken care of and gangsters come in and sort of control the alien population. Very unreal situation!one alien is smart though and even seems sophisticated. he spends 20 years looking for some stuff. He could find that while in the mothership? I seriously have to believe he had to spend 20 years roaming a dump for an uncertain amount of black mutagen/gasoline?That stuff is pretty awesome, if inhaled by another species it will turn him into an alien, but if put in a ship its star travel material baby... ridiculous.when Wikus mutates the hospital is immediately evacuated, yet in the research center they touch him without protection, and force him to do all kinds of stuff. I don't know why really.apparently human hookers have sex with the aliens.. Jesus Christ.. really? you could let that part out? its totally uncalled for and doesn't fit the movie at all, but it gets worse they try to f***k wikus over by saying he had sex with them too. Such a lame part of the movie very childish.back to the smart roach; so the world gets tired of them, but people and roaches can to some extend speak to each other (atleast some). So there was no possibility that the humans could help them out, you know by trying to help find the black stuff.. no that all needs to be very secret. Its slightly backed by the EVIL BIG CORPORATION which has a hit team with a very evil hunter leader (cliche at its best).The part where wikus enters the robot is weird to me to. So he fits the suit oke, but this mega tech units has emotions and feelings?? did 'they' want to add somewhat more drama to the movie, like there wasn't enough? the whole movie was packed with drama but they topped it with the robot scene. every time he was hit wikus moaned and seemed to be hurt. the robots movements where human like and also seemed to express feelings... it even barfed (black stuff!¿). But wikus, suddenly turning into rambo, kept the robot up because of his powerful mind. its not that the machine broke down, no when wikus's spirit broke the robot broke... at least that is how it looked to me.also when wikus heard that the fixing of would took 3 years he just decided to knock out the only one who could possibly help him at a very crucial moment.. why is that? seriously dumbest decision ever. But miraculously enough he is able to fly an alien plain anyways. almost as miraculous as the roach being able to survive intense crossfire defending with a small metal plate.another failing moment imo is when the roach is in the lab (the suicide mission that goes extremely easy) he is flabbergasted when he sees a dead alien.. uhm I don't know, I see aliens being killed and harassed all the time, that really blowed your mind? btw how come wikus had passage to that room? he wasn't really in the position for that, he never seen it before.well I got a little carried away with this comment, I'll stop here but I assure you I can come up with many more weak sport in the movie. The fact is, the story is so weak its like seems made up by a child. an excited one that makes up stuff along the way.Well if you managed to read all this you probably know I am not liking this movie, yet it wasn't hard to sit it out. The constant action keeps you drawn. I wont recommend it, but if one wants to see it I wont try to withhold you either.poor movie with great camera work and good acting, but with one of the weakest story lines I've seen so far.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Does not suck,"A lot of recent sci-fi action movies tend to have the same predictable problems. District 9 doesn't.There is a plot. Really.

They don't even speak English.Bad guys act in their own best interests, not just try to make life difficult for the good guys.CGI doesn't yell ""look at me"". It's there, lots of it, but you just don't notice.Nothing looks artificial. There is no excessive camera shake a-la Bourne trilogy. Footage that is supposed to look ""documentary style"" is quite believable. Not easy to do, as demonstrated by Cloverfield.The movie starts slow and gradually builds up the speed towards the crescendo at the end, never slowing down.All in all, very impressive.

Absolutely great. So is the plot. Obviously,it has his flaws, some greater and some not so perceptible, but it has. Still, a great job done by Neill Blomkanp.

District 9 - Overrated,"DISTRICT 9 is the final film of 2009 Oscar BEST PICTURE nominated films I saw (what a relief!), nevertheless I still hold the opinion that it is unwise to double the numbers as an awkward truth is that at least half of these films are plainly fillers (for example, this one), it only makes the ceremony longer and offers these fillers some popularity.It seems to me that DISTRICT 9 is an overrated film, surely it has its own singular novelties such as its pseudo-documentary shooting, low-budget cost (30 millions) and carries an indie halo to subvert the Alien Vs. Human platitude. The story brings to the audience an intensely compact experience after 20 minutes until the end, but all the set pieces are far from innovative (for example 1. the most unimaginable way to take back the fluid in the lab is to snatch it simply like what the film shows; 2. the evasive usage of the precious fluid whose small amount takes a whole 20 years to produce, of course the background of these prawns is eschewed as well; 3. the stereotyped design of the villainous military man, to kill prawns without a cause as he is just loving to do so), unfortunately it's only breath-taking rather than mind-blowing.The low-budget quality also hampers the film from taking a more grande scale to see the alien sides (the mothership), in which fans are mostly interested. Another flaw is the ending, maybe they did run out of money, which is nothing to complain, it ends hastily without a clue of what will happen next (a sequel is promisingly under the way I suppose). Actually if we substitute any other disadvantaged group (the poor, the disabled, the distorted, etc.) with these prawns in the film, the film is able to remain intact, maybe less fun. The political attitude is obvious but I feel numb about it since it is banal.As his full-length debut, one must admit Neill Blomkamp has done a great job, his future is bright (should thank Peter Jackson too), I am looking forward to his new project, however I sincerely wish him that the best is yet to come.PS: After seeing all 10 BEST PICTURE NOMINEES, I would replace STAR TREK with DISTRICT 9 and A SINGLE MAN with A SERIOUS MAN, period.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Director finds a good story along the way.,"An official deals with personal change while handling the relocation of an alien slum. Pretty good acting, writing, etc. Plot was confusing in the beginning; I didn't know what the focus of the movie was for a while. Once it was clear what the plot was, the rest of the movie was pretty enjoyable and kept my attention. There was enough character development that I started to really feel for even the aliens. More futurey aliens/space tech than some other movies. Graphics ok for '09, a little CGI-y. Ending wasn't bad; leaves you wondering what will happen next, but maybe it's fine to end that way; it felt satisfying enough.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Utterly ridiculous,"I do not give out ratings of 0 lightly, but here it is - the first film I have rated for a long time which has absolutely no merit.Inane, trivial, inconsistent, just noise, no story, no dialog, scientifically unsound. How many more do you need? Turn the volume down and you might as well have a blank screen. Turn the volume up and if you are at all sensitive to gratuitous noise to attract people's attention then you will hate it.How anyone can write a movie about aliens which just sit around for 20 years because they are no capable of doing otherwise is beyond me. Plus, any alien species smart enough to get hear will certainly be smart enough to avoid hand-to-hand combatDon't waste your time. There are so many more movies out there which are worth at least a 1 out of 10.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Sequel? No thanks.,"Sharlto Copley is one of the major reasons why this movie works so well right from the beginning he is very likeable as a character you feel emotionally connected to him and that keeps you invested in the story throughout.
The story is unique but like most of the alien movies, this too has a military storyline going on which doesn't feel forced but that is once aspect of this movie which is not unique. But overall the movie comments on how mankind is selfish and how a few individuals are blinded by their desire for power.
The ending of this movie will leave you wanting for more but do I want a sequel? Probably no because I guess I am satisfied with its uncertain end.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

"Amazing, unique movie","An alien people arrive on Earth (in South Africa) and are forced into horrific, lawless shanty camps.An imaginative, sci-fi masterpiece which also sends a powerful message about human rights and our treatment of minority groups.I won't say more without ruining the plot but the film takes a fascinating and unexpected twist early on and keeps you gripped all the way.The aliens are incredibly realistic, novel and well brought to life. The special effects on the alien tech is impressive.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Not what you think it is !!!!!!!!,"At the beginning i thought it's just another alien movie, but i was wrong. The movie got me completely surprised by the way they've sympathized the aliens which you won't find in other alien vs human movies.The movie itself had a documentary way of narrating the scripts on the screen. This might be a little disturbing for certain viewers but that's what made the movie realistic. Certain scenes may bring you stomach upset so beware of eating while watching :).They've explained the true color of humans and brings us a thought of this might happen or happened. Undoubtedly director did a great job for his first movie. The movie will be nominated for all the categories it has and might win as well.Please don't miss this one even if you are not a sci-fi lover. Its not what you think it is.A easy 10 stars for ""District 9"".Love it !!!!!!!!!!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
not what you'd imagine,"This film's formula of creating a side switching attitude is amazing. I is a film of sympathy.Avatar is too famous! This film was released first. My bad that the film's director didn't have the credentials in directing Titanic but dammit this film was realistic and logical. Magic isn't real, even in other planets.District 9 is not a film about aliens invading a major world city or was it even about colonization. It was about immigration. An issue the world especially the U.S. faces today. It is unique. I am tired of something bad happening to New York City or San Francisco. So many films do this. But District 9's aliens chose a city that not everyone knew about. Just some city in Africa.All in all, the film is powerful. The climax is intense and the ending is sympathetic.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
average sci-fi flick,"The most noteworthy thing about District 9 is the way in which the movie was filmed. The movie opens up with the feel of a documentary complete with interviews and somewhat shaky in the field footage. This combined with some CGI aliens create a very novel experience. I have never seen another movie that brings together sci-fi content and documentary style and for that I must tip my hat to District 9. Something about the documentary style makes you stop and think for a minute, ""Wow, what if Aliens really did land on Earth?""Now, that aside the unfortunate part about District 9 is it has a very weak and rather uninspired plot. There are no great plot twists. Its actually a pretty conventional story adapted to fit the context of this movie.If you are a big lover of content and great story lines you may want to skip this one for that reason. However, if the look and feel of a movie is more important to you District 9 may just be your thing. For me I'm a little disappointed that it didn't have both.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Satisfying,"Firstly the story is pretty original.I think there is not any film about refugee aliens apart from this. Also at the initial part, the interview scene clearly introducting the situation to us and we get information about the history of conflict between aliens and humans. Interview scenes with the locals are so spontaneous and natural. I sense a reality with in it.After the first plot point, the point of view shot suddenly ended and the reality damaged so if only all scenes do not contain the POV shot except the interviews for rational development.why other creatures (except Christopher and his son) do not attempt to help ?. If only we watch a chaos between aliens and army It could have served for the story progress.End of the movie is emotional and realistic.Satisfying.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Not as good as it could have been,"It was entertaining. Innovative, even.However, when a filmmaker begins with a premise that just shouts out 'Allegorical telling of Apartheid', you expect him to say something. To say something about man's corruption, about man's evil.The beginning of the film is pretty good at tapping into this. However, the allegory is wholly abandoned within the first hour, and it becomes a Sci-fi flick. It's a fine film. But could have been much better.Also disappointing was the xenophobia and corruption by the native Africans. They don't pity the 'prawns', they prey on them. They become indistinguishable from the Afrikaners that created Apartheid.Which then begs the question: Why South Africa? It served no purpose, other than taking the allegory and rubbing our faces in it. If the history of South Africa taught South Africans nothing.... Well, it makes sense, because this film also teaches nothing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

"CG great, annoying ignorant and irritating rushed at the same time","OK. I'm going to make this one short and sweet. This is strictly a review: no recap.The Cinematic Graphics are quite well done in this movie. The gritty desperation of the ""prawn's"" (the aliens of the movie) situation stands out in quite the artistic fashion.Now the bad: The humans of this movie were crazily stupid (i.e. the MNU soldiers goons walking up to high tech alien Mech machines that have demonstrated deadly unmatched fire power, shooting sub machine guns at them as if the fifty soldiers the mech killed a second earlier was just a fluke...).The main character has some strong acting points in the first half of the film, but his moronic babbling acting in the second half just became annoying as he demonstrated time and time again his inability to use common sense (maybe it was the script...).For some reason the aliens, were brilliant and physically more dominant than humans, and had amassed high tech weaponry, but were crazy scared and submissive to the humans...could not understand that one.Basicilly: Character development and realism not in this movie...but boy does it look cool. I'm glad I watched it for free instead of paid nine bucks...",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"A creative, realistic, impressive alien movie, with amazing potential, undercut by some flaws.","Incredibly impressive and creative directorial debut by Neill Blomkamp. I love the documentary style, though it's a little inconsistent, it grounds the movie and makes it feel so real. There's some excellent world building, this feels realistic to how we would react to aliens. The visuals are fantastic, though some of the CGI looks wonky at times, but as a whole it's a fantastic experience. I wish I could praise more of this film, but it does have problems. The entire plot is largely contrived, and there are too many convenient moments. The storyline, while mostly unpredictable, ends up being quite simple. All the side characters are extremely cliched. Only the main human and alien characters are any good. Sharlto Copley does a really great job in his first movie acting role. I love how real Wikus feels. He's a flawed individual, makes mistakes, is selfish, but tries to be good. Overall it's just a really impressive and captivating film, I just wish there was more in the story and characters as the world and potential ends up being more interesting than the film itself.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Review - District 9,"Personally, I am a bit of a science fiction lover. I have seen tons of sic-fi films, from fun and lighthearted popcorn flicks to deep and emotional ones. I've seen clichéd and basic-formula ones, and ones that have a distinct uniqueness about them - new worlds, unique scientific concepts, memorable scientific technology and what not, and much more; and, best of all, unique twists on stories. District 9 is one such unique science fiction film. It has several obvious clichéd and borrowed aspects, but overall it's a somewhat creative film, and pretty memorable, too. I didn't see it when it came out, and, in fact, I had never even heard of it until sometime last year. So, after reading a bit about the film, yet still not knowing much about it, I decided to give it a try in May (yes, this year), and I'm glad I did.District 9 eludes many expectations of a sic-fi audience. The film is set in an alternate timeline, where, in 1982, a spaceship appeared over Johannesburg, South Africa (instead of a usual sci-fi setting). The aliens on board, instead of being evil and strong with an urge do kill, are helpless and in weak condition. The aliens, unable to operate the ship anymore, are taken to a temporary camp on the ground underneath where the ship is hovering. Unfortunately, due to the the high population of these aliens, and to typical political flaws, over the years, the temporary camp eventually turns into a giant slum segregated from the rest of Johannesburg. Also, the initial welcome wears off, and humans begin to discriminate against the aliens, nicknamed ""prawns"" due to their ugly appearance. Finally, in 2010, the Multi-National United munitions corporation is sent to evict these prawns from the slum, with Wikus van der Merwe in charge. In the process, Wikus is exposed to a strange alien chemical, at which point his personal nightmare begins and everything changes drastically for him, and the story really starts to get going and unfold. I won't give anything else away about the story after this last thing: along the way, Wikus befriends an alien, and his small son.District 9 combines dosages of the man-befriends-other-race-and-turns-against-his-own-people theme, the don't-judge-a-book-by-it's-cover moral, political elements, elements of racism, segregation, and discrimination, and a bit of E. T. and some other themes. It uses its running time wisely and tells its story very effectively. Some of the film is in documentary-style, and part of it is in regular style, and there are even some shots seen here and there from security cameras, and things like that. Visually, the film has a gritty, ugly look about it, adds brilliantly to the tone of the film, and gives it a bit of a more realistic feel to it. Even the aliens themselves are pretty ugly, but they are very well portrayed with top-notch CGI. In fact, all of the special effects in the film are very good. Clinton Shorter composed a very effective score for this film. It's not a great score or anything, but it does help bring out the tone and emotion of the film, just like the special effects do.There is not a single actor in the film whom I have heard of before seeing this film. However, the actors' performances are pretty good. The actors really bring out their characters very well. I liked the characters. They are strong and dynamic. Wikus is a good protagonist, and I really cared about him while watching the film. I also came to like the aliens he befriends - they may be ugly, but I really felt true emotion for them and their inner characters, who they really are inside, especially the big one (the father). I know hardly anything about director Neil Blomkamp, but he did a very good job with this film. There are definitely some things that he could have done better, and the overall film was not great, but Blomkamp did a good job overall, and gave us a pretty good film.So, overall, while District 9 is, in my opinion, not quite an iconic or classic science fiction film, it's still pretty unique, and it has some pretty memorable things about it. It's not really something I might remember immediately many years from now as a classic film or anything, but, like I said before, it's pretty memorable. It's a smart, emotional, and entertaining science fiction film, and it's definitely worth seeing at least once.My Rating: ***1/2 (out of ****) For more reviews, please visit my website: http://robertsreliablereviews.blogspot.com/",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

I've read some of the comments about this movie and im just laughing because i couldn't even watch more than half an hour. First off it was lame, second, it was boring, and honestly not interesting at all. Im not a sci-fi fan, but i gave this one a try because everyones telling me to go see it, but honestly i don't get the big hype. I think people juat love to join in on the hype when a movie does good, they love to pretend it was good so they get their moneys worth. Face it, you got RIPPPED OFF!

The Tale Of Intergalactic Discrimination Has Never Been Told So Ruggedly (If at all)...,"South African director Neil Blomkamp's debut is the ultimate fusion, and homage-payer, to nearly every sci-fi film over the passed twenty or so years, that tells the tale of an alien species stranded on earth and herded in a slum outside Johannesburg. Blomkamp got this opportunity by creating his own five minute live action sequence taken from the, now somewhat defunct, ""Halo"" film project. Viewed by, and obviously having impressed, Peter Jackson, the New Zealander promptly gave his backing, both in critical and financial terms to his new protégé to create this intergalactic tale of discrimination and very big guns.Comparing both the aforementioned five minute ""Halo"" trailer and ""District 9"" you cannot help but notice Blomkamp's delicacy when it comes to the implementation of special effects into a film. Too often are films overloaded with computer generated effects, both from other worlds and this, that do not convincingly real, despite all the money that is pumped into them. Blomkamp has a keen eye for being able to blend the virtual with the real in an almost seamless fashion, which in a film where half the cast are non-existent ""prawns"" from another world is somewhat of a key trait in selling the film. Also, equally as noticeable, is Blomkamp's exceptional directing technique when it comes to shooting, but also editing, the high tension action sequences. He knows how to create tension with the use of long tracking shots, interspersed with crisp cuts that, while chaotic, actually keep you up to breast with the geography of an all-out gun fight. Keeping perspective of where your characters are in the grand scheme of things and creating the heart-pounding tension that the audience needs to be immersed, yet follow proceedings, in the world is not an easy skill but one Blomkamp ensures happen with worrying (for other directors of the same genre) accuracy and style for such a young director.The cast which carries the story is led wonderfully by Sharlto Copley as the bumbling and out of his depth ""Wikus Van De Merwe"" as he manages to entice sympathy from the audience and then just as suddenly the reverse, without ever making his character unbelievable. The script, which is very well written for a film of this genre, provides Copley with just the right balance of humour, emotion and as many uses of the word ""fok""as an actor could possibly hope for. Copley carries the film extremely well, given he is often the only ""actor"" on screen at any one time and finds himself wonderfully backed up by a whole host of weasel faced antagonists who provoke the right amount of spite and venom from the viewer, despite them never being fleshed out as anything more than clichéd ""bad guys"".Book ended by a documentary styled account of the events in District 9, the action during the middle segments romp along at a great pace, yet while on first viewing is enough to engross the viewer, on second there is a slight problem. Initially there is so much going on, so much that feels fresh and unique that you can't help but be swept away by it, but on second viewing you have to question the longevity of a film such as this. While it is undoubtedly a good piece of action-cinema, the sci-fi element demands more than simply big plastic guns that make people explode. Blomkamp creates his own intergalactic apartheid in ""District 9"", yet never explores the connotations of the why, when and what for. Science fiction is a genre not simply of aliens, but also of philosophy and meaning. If you look at the classics like ""2001"" and ""Solyaris and a great many anime's there is always an underlying meaning or reasoning, something to get the audience thinking about what is being shown on screen, to delve deeper and explore the film as well as themselves. ""District 9""'s only failing flaw, is that it fails to explore the separation of the humans and aliens, why they have been separated, what has allowed it to have come to this, why are the aliens being treated with such disregard? Is it simply because these people are the sort of white supremacists that caused so much damage in South Africa? These and more issues are either glossed over or never addressed at all, and I feel that perhaps if Blomkamp had tackled even one aspect as to ""why"" there was such discrimination, as opposed to the mere one line ""justifier"" in the opening montage, that it would push the film into epic proportions.While the criticism of the film is a heavy one, it does not tarnish what is otherwise a superb science fiction action fest that audiences and lovers of the genres can get their teeth into. Blomkamp delivers on the promise that was his online snippet and has now set himself an even higher bar to which to aim his next project at. He has created a self encompassed world that requires no sequels, prequels, tells its story efficiently and drags its audience along for a ride that hallmarks one of the more impressive films, never mind debuts, in quite a while. My only wish is that while the stylised homages to The Fly and Aliens show a director who has knowledge, and command, of the sci-fi genre, the director continues to progress in the right direction and perhaps for his next challenge includes the gut-wrenchingly profound that District 9 finds itself separated from.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

One of the most ingenious movies I have ever seen.,"I delayed watching this movie as I thought it would be some kind of sci- fie alien movie. It seems Hollywood is too keen on making alien movies without any reason. But after reading the reviews I decided to give it a try. Well, I was delightfully surprised by the quality of this movie.First of all, the movie has extremely great plot. It revolves around the landing of alien mother-ship and various aliens living in refugee camps around Johannesburg. The story is swift and fast-pacing.It has a mix of real life footage, documentary and conventional footage in it. It goes on to show the events in the life of protagonist. I also liked the way special effects of the movie. By the end of the movie the viewer kind of home to the mother-ship. Absolutely crazy CGI.

good film,"I did quite enjoy this film. It's different to the generic Hollywood movie in many respects. There are no American good guys saving the entire world from the arab terrorists or perfect RP English speaking criminal mastermind in this film. Instead the main character is actually South African, he is not a clear hero but just a normal and very flawed human, capable of treating others very inhumanely. The film shows all humans in a negative light and very realistically so. It really does escape from this Hollywood ""hero"" idea and bring reality of how people would really act in situations to the screen. It is kind of eye opening and believable in how we could possibly treat another intelligent species. The film is shot in a very believable way also, using a lot of hand-held camera shots, adding to the realism, it's kind of like the blair witch but filmed more as if reporters are actually filming the main character (trust me it really works well). The action likewise is fairly gritty and realistic and there are some cool alien weapons and technology to be seen! It is the kind of action where 1 person getting killed has a lot of impact due to the gritty realism, as opposed to action films where hundreds of people get shot but you don't really care because they're just generic henchmen there to be shot in the hundreds in a boring fashion haha.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The best of it's kind so far.,"Well, besides any comment that's been made about this film not being a classical sci-fi one, having original concepts, and being well told and interesting through the whole 112 minutes, i'd like to point out the fact that's probably one of the bests low budget movies out there, and if there's something that i liked on this film -without spoiling anything- it's the way the aliens are made, not being a stereotypical dumb which expands really fast race or the totally opposite, super smart ones, but just a kind of human one where there's dumb and intelligent ones, that along with their attitude was the kind of alien i've wanted to see on a movie.I certainly liked the start with it's documentary style, and i liked the end, opened to a 2nd movie, that the producers will hopefully start to work on sometime soon.About the plot, it was good, not awesome, yet OK, there was a little detail about a line of the main character that i wouldn't have done, but nothing really wrong.Just watch it, really worth it, and i guarantee there will be unexpected stuff.I'd give it a 7.8 if possible.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"It's got the people talking, so that's something","The South African apartheid allegory feels contrived, especially when equating the oppressed. The ""prawns"" are not human after all. One could defend director Neill Blomkamp's heritage, and the film's setting in his native Johannesburg, but I don't buy it. The man is a white 29 year-old.At its best the film highlights the dangers of bureaucracy and its inherent silliness. One sequence culminates with the scientific and bodily horrors of putting advanced alien bioweapons in human hands. I haven't seen such poignant illustration of the system since Terry Gilliam's Brazil, and found the scene deeply, affectingly relevant.District 9 sparks the imagination thanks to its (probably) realistic depiction of an alien race and the events following their arrival, but its exposition-free documentary style ultimately leaves the viewer with more questions than answers.

Instead in most movies where we are the prey and the aliens try to conquer us, it's the other way around.

We use to and even still today mistreat people and nothing is done, about 50 years ago we ordered people around like animals and felt Superior to them. Even though it has those types of messages throughout the movie, it was still a great movie. This original movie will have you talking about it for weeks to come it has rewritten what we think of aliens, not harmful but gentle loving a peaceful. The story is amazing and very creative.

Absolutely Groundbreaking......Best Film of 2009,"There are so many things to say and to point out about how incredible this movie is, but I will break them down into 3 categories: plot, filming, and performance, but don't worry; I am not an advocate of spoilers. It is very difficult to put it all into 1,000 words, because there are so many things that deserve light shed; this movie absolutely pushed the envelope.The Plot- When seeing the trailer for this movie, there are many things that you could have gathered: this is an alien sci-fi, it deals with humans and the relationship with the aliens coming into contact with earth, and this will be another CGI wonder-film. In ways those are correct, but in so many more ways it is wrong. District 9 was a movie that collectively took the interest of humans in the extraterrestrial wonder, but it developed that into a scenario that was more realistic than any other movie about e.t.'s in the history of film. Also taking that concept and having it coincide with human development is remarkable. It took the vulnerability of any being, and took it to the next level. Humans without a doubt would have a completely different outlook on what would happen if we were to come into contact, but District 9 shows us how the way our world is ran would take the comings on and make it into something that it could and most likely would happen, adding to the reality of viewing and relating to movies, in every since.The Filming- The way this film was approached when it comes to filming in general in cinematography is astounding. I have not seen a film with this much ingenuity. The way they approach the news related information for the film viewer and for the SAKE of the film at the same time is like nothing else: it is brilliant. There are some movies that have attempted to do the same process but none of them have achieved the accuracy that District 9 accomplished. The CGI was nothing less than brilliant, at times I truly forgot that I was watching computer graphics and what was actually able to be filmed. It was incredible.The Performance- Sharlto Copley I knew had not had too many acting performances that were known to the world of film, but I can say honestly I have not seen a character develop in a movie as considerably as his character has done in years.

It sucks you in and then grosses you out,"Pros: *Impressive special effects such as robots *The shaky camera style makes you feel immersed in a futuristic, sci-fi environmentCons: *Aliens are disgusting to look at (look like prawns, eat garbage, eat disgusting foods, urinate publicly, vomit)*99% of the aliens are 'worker' aliens with absolutely no personality *Scenes of violence including people getting their limbs ripped off by aliens, people cutting their limbs off, people exploding after being shot, heads exploding, etc. *The hero in this movie is a poorly educated man who expresses himself mostly through violence and also through arts and crafts",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Hopeless post-alien-invasion documentary,"This is an interesting story of unethical human/alien experimentation, anti-authorities, the hopelessly devastating situation...etc. The movie follows Wikus (Sharlto Copley, who did a completely mind-blowing performance) who is an MNU field operative and later turns into alien form because of exposure to the alien's liquid. Overpopulated District 9 has been located in Johannesburg, South Africa for 20 years. But after the place turned into a slum and deteriorated safety concerns increased so local people protested to be kicked out, MNU decided to lead the plan.What I found interesting is the way humans treat aliens. They came to the earth so at least they are a cognitive entity, but the prawn leadership caste died of hunger and few can face humans equally now. MNU's policy is apparent because Wikus also treats them disrespectfully, he's very much under the influence of the company mentally and physically. This fact suggests that even if someone isn't an alien when we can't understand them or we think we are superior to them, we can treat them as such. So Vicki's turning into the alien form implies understanding what we regard as ""uncivilized"" or ""primitive"". And that's why it is important to focus on this seemingly random guy.The science behind the alien's liquid aside, the alien's concept is very different from those of humans. They, Christopher at least, don't have trust issues because of how many times Vikus betrayed him when he attempted to help him. Compared to this humble attitude (being overly humble is his loss, though. Not everybody is a good person), Vikus altered his stance better once he realized Chris could fix him was selfish, hideous average human behavior.There are so many ways how we face such an emergency...having a cup of tea with the alien in Arrival, fighting with them without tea in Alien, or governing them in District 9. But this movie felt like the most realistic one among them. After watching the ending, I can't decide if this is a love story or a pre-alien-invasion thriller. In a way, this is such a biopic for humans. Through the alien's perspective, we now know how cruel humans can be.Overall it's a remarkably engaging, creative sci-fi thriller. But it just suggests tons of problems, solving nothing. So this is the first film I thought it needed the sequel.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Good movie but.,This movie had great reviews so i couldn't wait to see it. After 10 minutes i was ready to walk out. The movie starts out like a cheap documentary shot by people that learned their technique by watching TV.but after a long long long while they drop that and get to it. The reason i gave this movie a 7 was it did little to develop the plot. Why are they here? Who are the people in charge of them and why? Why did they put the aliens in a garbage pit? It got to the point where i was hoping the ship would crash and take the aliens and the city with it. The other thing is i am getting tired of watching films like this where the hero is a blooming moron. Its called a convoluted plot device. The hero has to be stupid so he does the thing that gets him in trouble which is part of the premise of this film.Then they dump the mockumentary crap and start a great movie. You pay for the first third of the movie but you stay for the last 2/3s. From that point the movie starts to make you care and its a great ride from there. See this movie.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
District 9 or Chappie ?,"District 9 vs Chappie. Tough decisiond. Both movies are set in South Africa. Both movies feel South African to me (I'm not South African). Both movies are distinctly different. Chappie is a movie about a robot who is raised by the real-life famous music band Die Antwoord. Full of action, the robot Chappie is very funny, and the twists in that movie are so extreme and sobering that those scenes will always remain in my fond memory. I still prefer District 9. District 9 features a French reporter who gets mixed up in alien business. Those aliens have just landed in South Africa and are now segregated. They have no rights. People treat them like animals. That's where the main character ends up, and literally turns into one of them. The plot is almost a little stereotyped. Segregation. Keep everyone real. Segregation is a real issue. And yet, District 9 does in fact feel more real to me. The plot is brutal and yet the movie is very rewatchable. It's a close decision, but District 9 is just slightly better than Chappie. In order for Chappie to win this race, the robot itself would have had to be ... I don't know ... better.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Making Politics out of Cat Food,"James Stills writes: ""The lead character is portrayed as a passive-aggressive racist who... smooths over police violence in front of the press, and fails utterly to comprehend the situation around him. In short, he's marked for death. ...But when something bad does happen to him the movie's logic goes off the rails and melts into a steaming pile of a cheap Chuck Norris action flick where rifles blaze, grenades explode, and there's no motive to any of it other than just to blow sh*t up for the twelve year old kids in the audience.Question. If you were making an allegory about Apartheid why would your clueless, selfish, white guy racist jailer be the hero and liberator of the oppressed black people? I should think that in the 21st century old ideas about the White Man's Burden is more than just offensive; it's also a tired cliché. The jailer bureaucrat's only motive seems selfish: he just wants to go back to his old self.""He couldn't have said it any better... The film's noble attempt at political critique of neoliberalism/neoconservatism (privatization of militaries, the administration/bureaucratization of populations, refugee politics, interventions, multinational corporations, etc.) is directly REPLICATED through the racist representations of Africans and by sustaining (for no reason) our identification with a white racist bureaucrat. This critique is then completely lost when the transformers-style Hollywood action takes over.If you could take the three aspects of the film and divide them up into: -Socio-political critique -Hollywood Action -Hollywood Racism Then the film would be successful in each of its prospective parts.But it didn't.And it turned out to be pure garbage of the worst kind.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

A sci-fi modern classic that challenges our so-called humanity ..,"In my ""Manchurian Candidate"" review, I called it a fair deal that the film portrayed Americans confusing anti-communism driven patriotism with lunacy, while centering on an existing Communist conspiracy. In the same vein, ""District 9"" exploits archive footage of South Africans criticizing immigrants for real yet without sugarcoating immigration either. I admire a movie that shows us as a whole capable of the best as well as the worst regardless on the color of skin or demographic group.On that level, the film is as smart as ""The Manchurian Candidate"" and as prophetic. Indeed, there are so many parallels you can draw between the situations of Alien refugees in Johannesburg and the massive wave of immigration in Western countries it's eerie. I read many Youtube comments comparing the Aliens to some communities, even using racial slurs to define them, actually these comments don't miss the film's point, they make it in an indirect way by showing the very rampant intolerance the film is denouncing.And to the patronizing idea that Black South-Africans are supposed to be more compassionate toward the aliens who are undergoing a new Apartheid (District 9 is a nod to District 6, and you can find all the information on Wikipedia), the unanimousness toward the alien case actually shows a form of universal disdain toward a non-human species that ironically united old enemies. Take for instance ""Invictus"", a movie made the same year and set in South Africa: Clint Eastwood showed how the same passion for rugby united Blacks, Afrikaners and every layer of South Africa's new society into the same united community during the World Cup. Here we have the same effect with a common enemy that doesn't even behave like one.The film asks a relevant question about alien invasions: what if they don't invade us? And it's a valid scenario given the way these aliens look. They aren't exactly the prettiest-looking and the little one makes E.T. as cute as Shirley Temple. They're constantly referred to as 'prawns' just like the Tutsi were called 'cockroaches' in ""Hotel Rwanda"". Their physical features seem to obey to scientific speculation as much as artistic licenses, but it's important that they inspire instant disgust and defiance. And that's the stuff genocides are made of.Yes, with all the talk about ""learning from WW2"", the film confronts us to a very delicate question: since we care so much about humans, we defined crimes against humanity, since we believe animals deserve respect, where would creatures we consider lower than both groups stand in our standards of appreciation? And ""District 9"" is interesting in the way the young director Neil Blomkamp, in his debut, guides us into a journey of humility and understanding.First the film opens with a newsreel, a masterstroke of exposition, giving us enough information and footage to accept the presence of these aliens in South Africa since 1982 as historical reality. Then we get to 2010 where a multi-national corporation named MNU volunteered to relocate the ""prawns"" to a bigger area with better facilities. The supervision of the operation is given to one of these ""employee-of-the-month"" guys I used to despise since my days in Procter and Gamble.His name is Wikus Van De Merwe, he's played by Sharlto Copley and the act he puts in front of the camera to impress the big shots, especially his CEO (who happens to be his father-in-law) is symptomatic of that human contempt I described. The mockumentary style enhances that biased, one-sided, outsider's ""civilized"" perspective. And we see humans acting with the aliens as if they were a ""lower race"", forcing them to move from the ghetto under the threat of soldiers from diverse ethnicities.Remember ""Aliens"" when the squad found the nest with the Queen and started destroying the eggs, we couldn't shed a tear for them, we knew how potentially lethal they were. But we've only seen the prawns burning trucks or being annoyances, a commentator explaining that they might not have the same behavior standards (of course, they don't), the worse they did was slashing a man's arm but even then, I hated the casual way Wikus torched the egg-place and laughed at the pop-corn sound it made.Even his portrayal during the news' section show him as a not-so bright man, compromising and friendly. Wikus embodies our condescending nature, too cocky to even wear a mask, which will start his trouble... and eventually, his redemption. And this is perhaps the best thing about the film. As soon as he's contaminated by an accidental spray and slowly turns into an alien, his personality evolves as well. The film shifts the genre and turns from documentary to more conventional narrative and let Copley lead the show with his spectacular performance.This is not just a director's but an actor's film. The evolution of Wikus from an slick blue-collar guy with the hair on the side and the yellow vest to a man scared out of death and realizing the extent of humans' barbarity once he's submitted to it, is the true highlight of the film. The MNU shows its true self as well, a greedy corporation resorting to torture and arbitrary killing to get the hold on a sophisticated machinery under a commander whose enjoyment to kill prawns remind of other soldiers from the darkest hours.The parallel is even stronger when Wikus reveals that the place of relocation is no better than a concentration camp as he tells the one prawn he befriended, ""Christopher Johnson"". I won't spoil the third act. It might feel formulaic with its avalanche of shooting and action sequences but it's in the tradition of many sci-fi classics to entertain and thrill as much as asking thought-provoking questions.Indeed, regarding Wikus, he might have regained his humanity. But the film teaches us not to take that word for granted.A sci-fi modern classic that challenges our so-called humanity ...",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Interesting and unusual science fiction,"District 9 is one of the most unusual films I have ever seen. I'm a big fan of science fiction films and have seen quite a number of them, yet this is a unique film. Most sci-fi films are futuristic or have a simple good-vs-bad plot. In contrast, District 9 is a more realistic portrayal of what would actually happen if aliens landed on earth. I like how the aliens were unlike what one comes to expect in these types of film.Although the plot is intriguing and more mysterious than most films involving this subject matter, I found some of it hard to believe and ludicrous. Nevertheless, the film is exciting and you just never know what to expect.Kudos to the director for making such an interesting film and pulling it off for the most part.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

"This time, we're the problem, not the aliens ...","I liked this movie. It was definitely not a traditional sci-fi theme (like ... destroy the monster, save the world, destroy the scientific breakthrough that mankind isn't ready for). It was more of a tense sociological theme where a large number of aliens are being interned in an impoverished, restricted living zone. It kind of brings to mind ""Alien Nation"" from the late 1980s.Aside from the above, this movie has several things going for it. First, the alien effects are pretty darn good - modern monster design is hard and these folks did a really good job. The pacing was good - there were no dead areas in the film where nothing is happening. There were also no big-name actors used, so the movie succeeds on Peter Jackson's association and the power of the acting, script and production - which were all good. It's also great to see that this movie only cost $30M; I hope this encourages studios to greenlight more of these movies.Now, the movie is not without a few issues. I would liked to received some more background info on the aliens and what has been learned about them. Also, a lot of the scenes were a bit formulaic, so as soon as you see the setup, you know the outcome.However, all in all, there's a lot to like here. If you're a sci-fi fan, I recommend seeing it. You'll either really like it, or at worst, think it's decent. It's the most interesting offbeat alien scifi movie in a while and we'll probably see a sequel in the not too distant future.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

One of the best sci-fi movies I've ever seen.,"Before I start to write the review if you want a good sci-fi film with a little bit drama and with lots of action this movie is for you. First, I will talk about the age MPAA rating because lot of people ask about is it scary or not. I don't want to give a spoiler but there are 1-2 disturbing scenes and a few frightening scenes but I didn't felt scared but there is a lot of blood (not ""Saw blood"") a little bit more blood then a normal war film. OK now let's talk about the film .First of all, few part of the film is like documentary(10-11 minutes max.).But it's fine, some of you just want to see action and people fighting aliens with lot of intense scenes don't worry rest of the film is like that. Some of you want to compare with other sci-fi movies so do I ,this film is way better than War of the Worlds or other sci-fi films. The reason why I'm comparing with War of the Worlds because you can't always see aliens (You see in 2-3 scenes).But in this film you always see aliens and you can see what they do . You can see the drama in the film where some of the people behave so bad to the aliens and behave them like they are slaves.You can see a person who don't feel bad like the other persons but then a lot of events happen and the old thoughts replaces with new and different thoughts .It's so interesting that a sci-fi film have some drama with a lot of action.And last but not least this movie has a great and a different view to the aliens. And this is it, I'm sorry if there are mistakes with my grammar and I hope you will like this review and District 9.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

The power of the unexpected,"I'm getting to be really sick of reading review after review of ""District 9"" praising it as a revelatory masterwork of great depth with superb social commentary to boot. It's not, and if this is what cerebral science fiction now is, that's very sad news for those of us who have devoted hours and hours and hours of our life to that great genre. ""District 9"", however, is an example of what action SF should aspire to. The content is substantial enough for the film to earn its desired emotional weight, the satire clever and incisive, the action very well-executed, the story fairly well though-out, and the delivery and construction of the film clever and powerful.In short, this is what you'd want from an expensive genre production. It's a smart crowd-pleaser but also a fairly smart narrative in its own right. Criticisms of the movie's action-packed final act make little sense, as the entire film is paced as a thriller, and while there's no question the first two thirds are less chaotic and probably a great deal more focused than the last third, the transition is quite seamless and fits in perfectly. It's enough to sell the movie as 'cool' to sell tickets, but also part of the story and if not totally necessary that the scenes drag on for as long as they do (and that's really the movie's only major fault, there are too many contrivances leading up to explosions and badass weaponry), then at least they fit somewhat organically into the narrative. Sharlto Copley plays the lead extremely well, and he's apparently never acted in a movie before! Not bad, not bad.The characters are pretty well-drawn overall, which is important in selling this sort of film. For once praising the effects is praising character, as the 'prawns' here become very sympathetic and convincing, convincing enough that in the crucial scenes you're not really always thinking 'that's fake' in the back of your head. The story is simple (Aliens come to earth. Aliens are forced into slums and camps and an apartheid system. The rest of the narrative isn't really worth spoiling), but is delivered in an interesting style which mixes faux-documentary and fiction narrative.Neill Blomkamp's debut as feature film director is extremely impressive. His handling of tone is remarkable, the ugly, bleak, and totally miserable mixes seamlessly with vicious satire and even some sillier comedic moments, and exciting, coherent action. He is destined for a great future in the film industry, and based on the overwhelming reaction to this film over the weekend, this might come to be known as one of the great mainstream debut features. It's not totally flawless, not at all, and one gets the nagging feeling that concessions to the mainstream derail the film a bit, but overall it's just a great roller-coaster ride, and a damned good effort from everyone involved from the director to the actors to the effects folk. It also possibly makes more of its relatively small budget than any other film I can think of. Very impressive film.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Mellow Yellow,"In ""Esthetic and Ethics"", a very interesting section of French script doctor Miguel Machalski's book, ""The Screenplay"", the author reminds us —one more time, because it is often forgotten— that every product of cultural consumption contains ideology. In ""District 9"", director and scriptwriter Neill Blomkamp tries to cover all bases: what a better center of contradiction, abuse and progress than South Africa, to place a suspended spacecraft above Johannesburg, where whites, blacks and aliens are all victims of the big businessmen of the planet, rulers of the World Organization of Nations (or something like that, a construct that is behind the omnipresent weapon factory MNU), and, after a discouraging ending, Blomkamp adds an even more pessimistic post scriptum, about the growing number of marginalized aliens on Earth, and the trial of the protagonist's assistant, for revealing secret MNU information. But as Machalski adds, ""Silence speaks volumes"", and besides the denunciation of world powers, organizations of united nations, and weapon manufacturers (generally, lumped together), there is no mention of the worldwide audiovisual industry, the biggest power on planet Earth, capable of the unspeakable —for being impossible to measure. Beyond this, the film is attractive during the first hour, with a style that mixes techniques of musical videos, TV reports and documentaries, and benefited with a cast of practically unknown faces that do not distract from the story. But around minute 64, the memory of ""Enemy Mine"" surges, and we go back, once again, to the 19th century melodrama, secure, comforting, conformist and reinforcing the status quo.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

One part of a great sci-fi year,"I just got back from seeing this and thought it was good - as in a solid 7 out of 10 good. There are a lot of perfect ratings, which I think has to do with people not expecting much going into it. The previews do a great job of not giving the drama away. To me a 9 or a 10 would be ALIEN, ALIENS or the first two TERMINATOR flicks.I like my eye candy, even if it's only a tracking shot of a desolate ROAD WARRIOR landscape. My main DISTRICT 9 criticism is the shaky cam, washed out, docu-style shooting. Considering the setting is a slum, this approach looks even worse. I would have preferred smooth photography and shadowy lighting. Now, that doesn't keep me from enjoying BLAIR WITCH or CLOVERFIELD, but I think of how much more I would enjoy these movies without that docu-style gimmick. Granted, this camera work is nowhere near as disorienting as those two, but I can't say that I want to eagerly revisit this world of shaky slum shots. The movie is like SLUM DOG ALIEN MILLIONAIRE!Some people are in awe of this being ""only"" a 30 million dollar movie. Did you expect Peter Jackson to ratchet up the WETA bill on his own production, or go with the low bid? There are no 20 million dollar actors in this. The aliens and effects are the stars of the movie, supported by a cast of unknowns. That's a good thing, because if the lead character was played by Tom Cruise, you would have certain anticipations. With the character of Wikus Van De Merwe, you don't know what to expect and that's the way it should be.What worked best about this movie was how the storytelling would paint the main character into a corner and arc him out of it. It's a classic polar transformation. What is equally impressive is the morphing of the aliens into something we ultimately care about.I like a lot of sci-fi and horror, so where does DISTRICT 9 sit for the year? I have to admit that I enjoyed STAR TREK a lot more. I would put this one in the mix with TERMINATOR: SALVATION and OUTLANDER. I really enjoyed those, more than probably most people. (I wouldn't ever expect McG to direct to the level of James Cameron, so no disappointment on my end.) Those movies are all easy on the eyes, whereas DISTRICT 9's superior characterization is counterbalanced by ugly backgrounds and photography. (I don't care how intentional that is, it made me enjoy it less than its potential.) TRANSFORMERS 2 was shallow fun, but sits near the bottom of my list. I still have to see WOLVERINE, but am not expecting much from it. EDEN LOG was just okay and if I had to pick on a movie, it would be DANTE 01, which was beautiful to look at, but bored me to tears. I haven't seen MUTANT CHRONICLES and some others.I'm anxiously awaiting PANDORUM, SURROGATES, DAYBREAKERS and the year end biggie,...James Cameron's AVATAR. Cameron's movies are what most modern sci-fi is compared to, so I'm anxious to see if he can live up to the hype after his long hiatus. I think DISTRICT 9 will probably end up as one of my favorite top 3 or 4 sci-fi movies for 2009, which is a good showing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Mockumentary that is better than anyone would expect,"A completely unexpected gem of cinema.
Beginning as a poorly filmed documentary on the clearance of an alien ghetto in Jo'berg, within which the history of the arrival of aliens is explained, the plot develops so that ultimately the viewer is drawn inevitable towards favouring the alien cause over the greed-driven schemes of the humans.
The main protagonist (Sharlto Copley brilliantly playing the wimpy Wikens van de Merwe) accidentally sprays an alien fluid into his face and soon finds the liquid has had a disastrous affect upon his body. Thereafter everything goes wrong for Wikens, and it is from this point that the human race begins to show how truly despicable it can be.
The alien creations here are brilliantly crafted - the cinematography is excellent and it is obvious why the film picked up four Oscar nominations.

Too many ob-stackles in 3rd act,"There's a scene at the beginning of O Brother Where Art Thou where a blind seer foresees ""many ob-stackles"" to be overcome by the three heroes -- a light-hearted slam at the story pyramid version of Aristotelian aesthetics. Act One sets the scene until turning point 1 creates rising action. Act Two builds to a climax and turning point 2. Act Three provides resolution after many ob-stackles are overcome during falling action. Without the ob-stackles, you don't really have a movie, goes the received wisdom. Serious critics will complain about a ""lack of obstacles,"" implying a movie is lame or shallow because it doesn't follow guidelines now taken as gospel.Many stories just don't need a slew of meaningless ob-stackles to provide a satisfying path. District 9 is one of those stories.Despite howling plot devices -- fuel that doubles as a genetic virus, a control unit that falls conveniently from the alien spacecraft, a Nigerian criminal who follows the evil genius rules (never kill Bond when you can blather while he unties his hands), pivotal characters repeatedly meeting by chance -- we buy into the suspension not only of disbelief but also of impatience with formulaic laziness, due exclusively to the exotic nature of the set decoration, locale and CGI creatures. Unfortunately, that all falls apart when the hero engages in a standard chase containing so many homage points they're not worth tallying. And in that chase, we encounter, and become impatient with, many ob-stackles.It's a credit to the set decoration, locale and CGI creatures that with all that I still rate District 9 six stars.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Fantastic Documentary-Style Film,"I thought I watched this long ago, but I don't remember this being as good as it is. This story was wonderfully written and perfectly shot through a documentary style. It also did a great job of illustrating how we humans can conflict with each other's cultures. The main character Wikus did a fantastic job portraying his character and the struggles through his government job. I thought the bad guys, especially Koobus, were a bit cliche and corny and could have had more depth or uniqueness to the characters. It tackled some ethical dilemmas quite well and presented situations fairly. Well done Neill Blomkamp, this was fantastic! 4.5/5 stars.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Vacuous misanthropy,"This could have been a subtle and thought-provoking portrayal of the dark sides of mankind – instead it presents its message as wet defecation spurting out all over the place in an attempt at social and political satire. The film, which technically is a masterpiece, could have shown us how we as humans meet the unknown with fear and prejudice. How the single individual may appear as devoid of malice, while it as a part of a group might contribute to incomprehensible evil. Instead the film chooses to present the humanity as some sort of a Hollywood-esque caricature of Nazi-Germany. In this world, evil and egoism – in its simplest meaning – are the prime force of human actions, while the aliens on the other hand, annoyingly anthropomorphistic, seem like simple and unselfish individuals. District 9 fails to point out what's interesting about human evil – the fact that it doesn't emerge from the individual consciousness, but from the collective unconsciousness.Neill Blomkamp is a hair's-breadth from the head of the nail – but misses and hits his thumb so hard that it fractures in at least two places. The film is entertaining in its technical flawlessness, but fails on a deeper level, and ends up as vacuous and naive misanthropy.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
One of the better sci-fi pictures I've seen lately.,"The aliens, once again, have landed. This time, they've chosen - or have they really? - to arrive in the sky above Johannesburg, South Africa. Soon, however, they prove to be unruly visitors, and are exiled to a ""camp"" on the fringes of the city. A cheery government functionary, Wikus van de Merwe (Sharlto Copley) is given a promotion so that he may serve eviction notices on the aliens, which the locals intend to move to an even more remote area.In the process, Wikus goes through quite the ordeal, getting hunted by his fellow humans, and ultimately becoming both victim and hero, even befriending an alien named ""Christopher Johnson"", who clearly has an agenda going on.Co-written and directed by Neil Blomkamp, who was given about $30 million for a project of his choosing by presenter / producer Peter Jackson, ""District 9"" takes the viewer on quite a ride. It's got enjoyably designed aliens (disparagingly called ""prawns"" by bigoted humans), *excellent* visual effects (you can actually accept the aliens as characters, and not just gimmicks), large-scale, violent action (albeit with a lot of CGI gore), political / social commentary, a solid no-name cast, and great music by Clinton Shorter.In fact, this is one of the freshest, most interesting takes that I've seen on the science-fiction genre since ""Men in Black"", complete with humor and quite a bit of humanity as well. While Wikus is motivated for a while by pure self-interest / self-preservation, he's still, in the end, a good man who can't just leave a friend behind.And speaking of the end....this is one of those films that's actually *earned* a sequel. I would like to see these characters again, and get caught up to speed on their story.This is a feature length remake of ""Alive in Joburg"", a short done by Blomkamp in 2005.Eight out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A unique style of science fiction filming,"Like many other directors that have a breakthrough in film, their first theatrical release is always considered to be their best. Sam Raimi is the perfect example. Before Spider-Man (2002), he was known for creating the low budget horror film, The Evil Dead (1982). Now look at him, even after all the other well praised films he has made, he is still best known for that movie in particular. Same will happen here with director Neill Blomkamp. District 9 (2009) will forever be considered, by many, his best creation in film. For the most part, this is mostly credit for the type of style this film gives its audience.The story revolves around how a dystopian city called Johannesburg where humans and aliens called ""prawns"" live amongst each other. Unfortunately, neither species is happy living with the other on the same ground. But what will really grab the viewers' attention is Neill Blomkamp's direction. At the introduction and the finale, the film acts like a documentary with interviews from various citizens and professionals. I assume this is where the short film Tron: The Next Day (2011) got its creativeness from, because they too used a documentary- like style of filmmaking. This kind of direction does make the experience feel more authentic because documentaries are historical film works which are supposed to give its viewers a better understanding of what happened in the past.Adding to that authentic feel is actor Sharlto Copley, who at the time, was a no-name actor. Copley is in his root continent in this movie, which makes the story that much more believable. Plus, because Copley hasn't really shown audiences until now what he can do, he will prove himself not only as a viable action star but also a actor who can show true emotion. Even more astounding is how this movie was able to create such a real looking environment and creatures. The prawns are something to behold, especially the way they talk. It is a very intriguing sound. But, it may annoy some audiences that there is no translation for the dialog between prawns. Its basically like watching two wookies talk. No clue what's being said; which is frustrating.The special effects and action scenes were also well executed. Even the practical effects such as makeup was innovative. Though one element that I found this film to be weak in, was the film score. Clinton Shorter, a composer with not many theatrically released movies under his belt, lacks sufficient expertise to really bring out the emotion in various scenes. I like that he was able to give the score an African voice to its background, but was only effective to establish the setting. After that though, it needed more depth to illustrate the struggle between humans and prawns. But I never felt that at any point. Instead, Shorter will incorporate a lot percussion when tension arises but other than that. The music is left under produced.Blomkamp's theatrical debut may not contain the most convincing music but with solid special effects, a realistic tone and unique film making, after viewing the movie, some people may think District 9 may have existed.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Good Sci-fi-Action movie,"I think I saw 'District 9' shortly after its release of home video. It's hard to believe that was about 10 years ago. I enjoyed it then, and I still like it now. What I find surprising is how good this movie works as a well paced sci-fi action movie that never really stops. From beginning to end it flows quite seamlessly from one event to the next. Whilst the film doesn't do much at all to develop its characters, you still end up rooting for them... well, at least the goodies. It's well worth a watch (and rewatch).But for writer/director Niell Blomkamp, lighting doesn't seem to strike in the same place twice. Together with his wife, he co-wrote this film, and two other Sci-fi films which aren't really up to scratch by comparison. 'Eylsium' and 'Chappie' - also directed by Blomkamp - two more sci-fi actioners, with the former being below average, and the latter being unwatchable in my opinion. It's difficult to believe that the same creators who brought us this solid sci-fi action film, returned to other projects with such diminishing returns. Still, at least 'District 9' still holds up well.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Hidden Metaphor?,"This is one of those films that make you reach for the door of cinema or the remote control of your DVD to turn it off in the first ten minutes, but hold off.The first fifteen minutes of the film is slow and sets out the basic plot for the film even though you don't actually see the aliens arrive, they are just ""there"" from the word go. This in hand there are a lot of shots in the style of ""Cloverfield"" but instead of a group of amatures filming it's a TV reporter and his film crew creating what is basically going to set the scene for what is about to follow. There is some very Paul Verhoevenesque (Robocop) scenes, for instance at parts it feels like a news report on the BBC with Kate Adie somewhere in a war zone which in effect it is. It's basically Aliens lands, alien attacks (accidently) a human, humans respond by blaming aliens then so on. However I sat watching this with someone from SA and he pointed out that townships were like this, no law, gangs and lack of any form of a decent life.As you get into the film the narrative changes from the aspect of the reporter to a full on film. As the story line unfolds you cannot disguise the fact there are parallels between a South Africa from the time of apartheid with the government forcing ""blacks"" out of townships. You just can't help not thinking there are some very disturbing political overtones of the story line. In fact the majority of the film is shot in townships that would not look out of place even in this day and age. It's also rare to see a film thats shot in Johannesburg yet alone anywhere in South Africa.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

original science fiction flick,"This science-fiction film takes us away from the usual European, or North American standards, showing settings and roots of the events in a different reality. ""District 9"" is the feature debut of Neill Blomkamp, who co-scripted with Terri Tatchell and was produced by Peter Jackson, the New Zealander who came into the spotlight with The Lord of the Rings. All these ideas and emotional come out of a fast-moving story that flashes up on the screen, just when the lead Wikus is along the journey of transformation. There is a strong poignancy in his situation and in that of the prawn scientist working to re-activate the mother ship and get away from. The film has an impressive surface due to the fine work of Kiwi Philip Ivey and is peculiar due to the absence of any familiar face. This documentary (mockumentary actually) prevents us from guessing who will live or die and ends on a touching sequence evoking Ridley Scott's Blade Runner. It's a good film, worth the ticket for sure.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Refreshing sci-fi film, although the first few minutes look bad.","District 9 is a true Sci-fi movie, and a refreshing one. Human race making contact with an Alien race is a classic theme, but this movie explores it from new angle and brings new depth to it, and does that on a superior level.Altho the beginning is discouraging and shaky - documentary style looking like a student exercise, and i have to say my first attempt to watching District 9 ended right there, soon it gets on its feet and takes you on a great ride.The Aliens in District 9 do arrive, but remain stationed aboard their spaceship, suspended enigmatically above Johannesburg city, South Africa. They do not try to contact us or attack us, and don't seem to be enterprising anything at all. When we finally approach their ship and make contact, we find their society disintegrated into a horde of brutalized individuals only interested in eating and breeding. Their legacy is great - artifacts that our corporations would be happy to have, but it responds only to alien DNA. Cramped inside a camp called District 9 in the vicinity of their spaceship still up in the sky, the aliens go on with their despicable way of life for decades, multiplying into millions, finally becoming too much of a nuisance, so they are about to be relocated.This is a refreshing premise. I have to really concentrate to remember a ""sci-fi"" whose aliens do not try to destroy us in any way they can, eat our brains, mate with our sexy lead actresses or vandalize our landmarks running them over with their spaceships, and what not.In District 9, our (unintentional) hero is the average guy, Wikus, a civil servant, married with the daughter of his Boss, working for this corporation in charge with the aliens, and he is commissioned to relocate them. He has to descend amidst the filth and misery of the Alien camp, and get out of there with the job done, while he is filmed for the world to see the corporation is humane.While so many movies out there - not only sci-fies - have the hero emotionally changed after experiencing the suffering of the weak, District 9 cleverly explores the possibilities a sci-fi offers: at the end of the day, acquitted of his duty, Wikus remains emotionally untouched by the realities of the camp, but he is changing physically, a process that will alienate him from his own, turning him into a prized artifact, hunted by the very corporation he worked for a day before.All Wikus wants is to return to the comfort of his former life, happy in the arms of his wife, and complex depths of the relation ""individual vs society"" unfold, as his salvation can only come from an alien - Christopher, father of a son, who wants to save his own people, but whose only hope is Wikus, who has to deliver him a much needed artifact the humans hold.Everything now accelerates into an action movie, shot almost as a first person shooter game, and this part does feel like Half-Life game put on film, which i consider an achievement. We experience the alien weaponry in action, and when they're unleashed against the corporation's military commandos, they look and behave otherworldly, devastating in both their effect and screen presence. The sci-fi inventory is completed with an awesome Bio-Mech, the interior of an alien shuttle cabin, and the corporation xeno labs facility, while all the intense fighting taking place stays hardcore, avoiding gratuitous explosions, and throwing a lot of blood and gibs at the camera.By the last part of the film, the unending hunt for Wikus and Christopher the alien is becoming dreary, but the director saves it just in time, reaching a conclusion, documentary style again, disappointing, but the closing scene saves the last impression of the film, in a fresh new way.PS. Director Neill Blomkamp seems very daring and promising technically, but what he does looks more like playing with winning recipes from other genres: I've recognized ""The Passion of the Christ"" and ""Half-Life"", they kept me entertained, but inbetween them there was little speaking of a style of his own.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"An Unchallenging, Simplified View of Racism Leaves Much to Be Desired","After I watched District 9, if you told me that it was considered a decent, lesser-known sci-fi action film, I'd be moderately impressed. The setting of the South African ghettos is unique for this genre and well-executed, and the CGI is quite good for the time and budget. But I can't disagree more with those claiming its one of the best sci-fi films of all time. To say it is an accurate allegory of human racism is like saying Salon Kitty exposes the flaws of the Nazi regime.Prejudice does not grow on trees. People don't hate everyone that's different from them. There are centuries of cultural evolution and conflict behind people's perceptions. While some people see other races and ethnicities as dumb or savage, they rarely treat everyone with disdain. For example, a white person who hates ""ghetto"" culture may find the work-ethic of East Asian nations admirable. Its a complex, important topic that needs to be addressed to break the barriers between us, yet District 9 contributes nothing to the conversation but villainous stereotypes.As far as I know, the Prawns have done nothing to even agitate the human race. Yet the South African government, completely unimpressed by the appearance of intelligent life from a distant galaxy, does not show a shred of humanity. They send the Prawns to ghettos, kill them in weapons tests, and even abort their unborn without a second thought. They are just as bad as the Nazis, but without centuries of prejudice to support their actions. Yet barely any time is devoted to explaining this xenophobia. The government is evil for the sake of being evil, and is thus unrelatable to prejudices seen today.Just because the film brings up racism in a new context does not mean it should get a participation trophy. Its ultimately as safe as an episode of Sesame Street, allowing its audience to pat themselves on the back, never thinking of their own prejudices. Nor would they think in Neill Blomkamp's next film, Elysium - a practical remake of District 9 with changed nouns, discussing economic division only deep enough for it to be a plot point. The 10% of the world could pat themselves on the back, knowing that, no matter how greedy they can be, at least they're not the 1%!I suppose it can still hold up as an action film to some degree. But when all the praise seems so misplaced, its hard to ignore the bad world building and stock, two-dimensional characters. Its an alright popcorn flick, but even among action films, you can find many with better plots and characters. I personally wouldn't even recommend it to sci-fi fans, who usually seek films with intelligent writing, not a generic action movie with a sci-fi coat of paint. A lot apparently liked District 9, but I feel that's settling when we deserve much more depth than black-and-white, good-vs-evil.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

One of the best sci-fi films of the last 20 years,"Now that I've watched it a second time, it still stands out to me as one of the best sci-fi movies of the last 20 years.

I also like how genre conventions are played around with, by the having the faux-documentary feel for much of the movie. Still greater is the movie's treatment of racism as more than just a cultural problem, but something which essentially robs us of our humanity, or causes us to view others as second-class citizens. And of course, the action is first-rate, albeit with a little more shaky-cam than I'd like. All things considered, it's a must-watch regardless of its genre.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Great but not the ""BEST""","I kept hearing from people who caught the 'special' screening ""Oh it's the best movie of the year! You gotta see it!""...I must admit, it was a good movie, but not the BEST. The plot was extremely original which I LOVED, the special effects are 'top notch' as promised in advertisements and reviews, but what it lacks in is execution, now don't give me s**t about my opinion because it's just that, MY opinion.I was expecting some thing shocking, something that would blow my mind but the only thing that blew me away was really the theaters AC...oh and the plot. For me it was just another Alien movie...but it's not your typical alien movie. We're all used to watching ones with butt-loads upon butt-loads of action and violence and some pretty freakin' scary aliens but this wasn't anything like that...NOT that I'm complaining mind you, I just really disliked that it was made out to be this major action movie, and we're left with AT MOST 15 mins of serious alien vs human death-matches.On the other hand, I was very impressed with the visual effects, story and acting. I gotta hand it to the main character, for being an unknown actor and not really starring in very many movies, he did a phenomenal job in this roll.So I guess in the end all I can really say is if you decide to spend the $9.50 (or however much it is you spend on a ticket), go in prepared for lots of dialog, special effects. Luckily our theater here is still cheap so we only had to shell out $4.50 matinée price...so I guess the movie lived up to it's ticket price.

"Explosive, creative, and entertaining alien film.","Very creative alien film that isn't another hand-me-down from the original alien invasion story. Creative story, awesome action, great characters, and an all together fun ride.Shot as a documentary, the film at first explains how 20 years ago from 2002 an alien aircraft came out of nowhere and hovered over the city of Johannesburg, South Africa, where the military found aliens on board, more specifically named ""prawn"". It eventually leads to them creating a slum like location for them to stay on Earth called District 9. It then introduces the main character named Wikus Van De Merwe, who works for MNU to lead the aliens out of D9 and into a different location. During which, he becomes infected by a fluid that starts to turns him into a prawn. Eventually, he is pursued by MNU to obtain his organs to allow them to use the prawn weaponry that can only be used by prawn. He makes friends with a fellow prawn whose goal with the fluid over a period of 20 years was to use it to program a secret underground ship and use it to escape, which could also turn Wikus back into a human. They then team up to obtain the fluid.As the story progresses, you feel more for the main character, and eventually, you even feel for the prawn, which is pretty impressive. Visuals are stunning as can be, with both the prawn, the explosions, and the ship. All put together is simply breathtaking. Though the action gets a tiny bit uncreative, there are definitely some very clever action moments, which just makes you get goosebumps.Even though it would have been nice for Peter Jackson to do the Halo movie instead of this, this still turned out pretty decent.Though I have to say, seeing it the first time is the best time. If you try to see it again, it may not be as good, but still, thats just for me. I saw it a bunch of other times, and it just wasn't as good.

"Smart, exciting sci-fi from South Africa","Newcomer Neill Blomkamp shows up every American sci-fi blockbuster of the last decade. It's not an extremely complex film, but it is coherent, has a decent amount of intelligence, a good idea behind it and fairly interesting characters. That's all you really need, isn't it? The premise: 20 years ago, a gigantic alien ship stalled over the city of Johannesburg, South Africa. Inside it were about a million aliens, starving to death and unable to fix the ship. They were brought down and allowed to live in the slums of the city. The human inhabitants dislike them, and want them to be removed from their society. The story: Sharlto Copley plays a bureaucrat in charge of moving the population of aliens, known as Prawns, into a refugee camp some distance from the city. Obviously, with a population now numbering nearly one and a half million, these creatures aren't easily moved. Some of them even have some tricks up their sleeves. The story obviously has parallels to South Africa's own apartheid situation, which gives the movie a little bit of heft. I also thought Copley's character was quite daring, because he's the protagonist but he's really quite an unlikeable little snot for most of the movie (it also supplies a more identifiable alien character, named Christopher Johnson). The little flack the film has gotten from critics involves its basically turning into an action flick in the second half (the first half is actually done in documentary form, which works for the most part). While I admit it's a little more predictable in its second half, I don't see why we should complain that it's an action movie when it's a good action movie. We actually care when the characters are in danger. With all the garbage that has been released in the summer of '09, a good action movie is more than welcome. One complaint I would make, probably the thing that holds the film back from being a masterpiece, is the completely bland villains, led by a dull corporate CEO and a sadistic military leader.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Certainly one of the best Sci-Fi this year, possibly of the last century, maybe of all time","Many sci-fi/action films have tried but very few have really pulled it off in so many ways, District 9 is that film....finally Sci-FI is back in its greatest form!!District 9 is possibly one the greatest visions of earth-space contact in memory. It is so much more than ""just another alien movie"" it works on levels of action, character, emotion, and social commentary.The mockumentary style (which is carefully and resourcefully utilized) is often an overused tool that often masks lack of character, plot, and story. Here, it is brilliantly interspersed as a tone device and character piece. It manages to dodge the typical ""shaky-camera-syndrome"" of Blair Witch and Cloverfield while the outlook manages to deliver intensity and appropriate tone to the first act.Certainly the most disturbing is the all-too accurate depiction of governmental reaction, irritation, exploitation, and fear of the aliens. Example being the use of ""relocation camps"", where they promise the aliens will be more ""comfortable"" and ""free to flourish"". The social interaction of humans with the aliens, bartering, co-existing etc is intriguing as we often have wondered how/if two species could co-exist.The film manages elements and tones on par with Alien, Terminator, Total Recall, The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) while depicting the struggles to co-exit and instinctual interactions of The Killing Fields, The Deer Hunter, and Black Hawk Down. Finally, the film manages to create the human-alien connection, empathy, and emotion of films like Starman,Close Encounters of the Third Kind and E.T.The depiction and action of the aliens is brilliant part CGI, part live action. They really become an integral part of the story and provide a plethora of glimpses into their social and psychological adaption to life on Earth. Most interesting is the instinctive employment of violence and intimidation by the humans versus the lack of understanding and little knowledge of it by the aliens.Above this all, District 9 manages to become a truly reflection of classic sci-fi, action, and a gritty depiction of social interaction, and humans' ""print"" on anything that opposes or bewilders it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

I get what it's going for, using aliens to stand in for unwanted, uneducated immigrants and all, while being a pretty good sci-fi movie - I just don't see how it's groundbreaking. It's all been done before, though perhaps not in this combination of elements.

District 9: 9/10,"Nominated for Best Picture and some audiences thought it should even win, District 9 is an instant science fiction classic that looks beautiful and entertaining.In 1982, a massive star ship bearing a bedraggled alien population, nicknamed ""The Prawns,"" appeared over Johannesburg, South Africa. Twenty-eight years later, the human are starting to get annoyed by the aliens and want them gone. The refugee camp where the aliens were located has deteriorated into a militarized ghetto called District 9, where they are confined and exploited in squalor. In 2010, the munitions corporation, Multi-National United, is contracted to forcibly evict the population with operative Wikus van der Merwe (Sharlto Copley, newcomer) in charge. In this operation, Wikus is exposed to a strange alien chemical and must rely on the help of his only two new 'Prawn' friends. Although this is his first official acting role, Copley is the best at it. Playing the role like he was an experienced actor, Sharlto Copley was unfortunately snubbed from the Oscar race.The visual effect amazingly vivid and the make up is stunning, but perhaps what is more important is the writing. Writing alien/human interaction is obviously not new, but there is something incredibly refreshing about District 9's script that made the movie all the better. Nominated for an Oscar, Neill Blomkamp's first major writing job is quiet impressive and he's definitely got a career in writing ahead of him.District 9 was absolutely deserving of the Best Picture nomination and perhaps the best science fiction film of 2009.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

But IMHO and only in my opinion it seems, is that the characters were very despicable or shallow, all of them except Christopher and his alien kid did I feel any emotion for, sure the main character Sharlito Copley played his role perfectly and deserves an award, but I did not care for him or the predicament he got himself into, but as blockbusters go, this is a winner, and I am looking forward to the sequel which must follow soon!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Apartheid Filmmaking,"""District 9"" is a relatively enjoyable and exciting alien sci-fi action movie, although the societal metaphor is blunt and the style inconsistent. I suppose, however, that the obvious allusion of the treatment of the extraterrestrials to Apartheid in South Africa, as from the typical perspective of the white savior, is why it received more than the usual acclaim for such a genre picture, including a surprising Academy Award nomination for Best Picture. That the picture mostly focuses on the white characters, the reluctant hero and the corporate baddies, with Black Africans predominately represented by gun-running Nigerians, and that the discriminated-against aliens, indeed, do resemble humanoid-formed insects undermines any message of racial tolerance.Partly, ""District 9"" is presented as a mockumentary, including interviews, narration and apparent found footage, but a larger chunk merely follows the hero's journey, although with some shaky, blood-splattered camerawork. It's an incongruent mix of perspectives we've seen in prior pictures, which jarringly puts the spectator in the position of observer one moment and participant the next. Although, I suppose, that's not too unlike the plot of the protagonist, from him viewing the alien slums as an outsider working for the ""MNU"" weapons manufacturer, to his perspective changing multifold, including a ""Prawn Like Me"" sort of twist, from within the camp.Unfortunately, most of supporting characters tend to be tropes, though. The alien tech isn't too interesting, either--mostly just more weapons, which are unique only in that they require a certain species to operate. In other words, racist weapons--or, whatever, speciest. Nor are the visual effects anything extraordinary, but are serviceable, along with the score and affable lead, to allow some tension for the inevitable action scenes. Looking back at ""District 9,"" it's also incredulous how similar ""Avatar,"" another Oscar-darling, released later in 2009, is to this: same white savior transformation undermining a hollow anti-racist message for the same action sci-fi junk and evil corporate baddies, except the characterizations here may actually be less stereotypical, although the visual effects weren't nearly as revolutionary as those for James Cameron's record-breaking blockbuster.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
""" Can anger, frustration, apathy, racism, prejudice, compassion and friendship be Universal? ""","Peter Jackson's claim to fame has already been established with his world renown Classic, 'Lord of the Rings.' His experience and expertise was the impetus behind writer/Director Neill Blokamp's superb film entitled "" District Nine."" If history is any guide to Human behavior it's prominently displaced in this incredible film. The story tells of the events which follow when a rag-tag group of Aliens called Prawns arrive on the Earth seeking refuge. In typical Earth style, they are accepted and settled in a desolated area of Johansburg, South Africa called District Nine. Greeted with interest at first, over time the Earth people's original curiosity is replaced with anger, apathy and resentful disdain. That prejudice results in their host erecting restrictive barrier's, bared wire fences and eventually to imprisonment. The general population is apathetic to their plight, with only the Military taking a definite but collective interest in their alien weaponry. Deciding to move the Alien encampment to a distant location, a relocation commissioner Wikus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Copley) takes a personal, but artificially sympathetic approach to their resettlement, that is until he is contaminated with a strange black fluid and begins to evolve into an Alien. His mutation causes him to realize he has become an outcast like his targets. With the government, the press, the military and a select group of lethal mercenaries out to capture or kill him, things become more serious. Further he discovers an ally in a pair of highly intelligent and compassionate Aliens. The movie is jam packed with fast paced action, explosive confrontations and human complexities and as a result this movie will become a triumph for Neill Blokamp and Christopher Johnson who plays all the Extraterristals.

Absolute toilet,"I watch a real variety of films and enjoy most of them, for all sorts of different reasons. This is not one of them.This is a dreadful film. I have just signed up in order that I may counterbalance in some small way the rave reviews given elsewhere. I can only think the director has some very kind friends.It is hard to know where the director thought the film was going.Putting aside the irritating south African accent the first half hour is filmed on a hand held camera presumably to give dramatic effect that cant be found in either the incoherent script or the actingHaving read some other reviews, any attempts to justify the screenplay by supposing some semblance with ghetto areas in south Africa or elsewhere beggars belief. Maybe they were going for a comedy. Aliens that love to eat cat food - that has got to be funnyThe worst point is the end, where they unapologetically leave the 'plot' open to a sequel.

Refreshing take on human-alien cohabitation,"How refreshing. A smart original sci-fi movie that's not a remake, a sequel or based on anything already existing such as a toy-line. Even better, not only is it suspenseful and unpredictable, it makes you think and serves its fair share of social commentary without hitting you over the head with it. In short, the aliens are here, arrived 20 years ago, but they're not like anything we expected (more like animalistic shrimp-insectoid hybrids) and they're living in a slum in South Africa the nice humans built for them because the aliens couldn't survive on the big giant spaceship that brought them here, nor could they leave Earth. The story is at first told in a faux documentary fashion before becoming more traditional later on yet always quite dynamic. It's amazing to me that this was made by a first-time movie director considering the talent shown.The human cast is unknown, at least in America, so it helps suspension of disbelief and they're good but nowhere near the highlight of the guy playing Wikus (somewhat resembling Christian Bale), the functionary put in charge of relocating the aliens far away from the city. I particularly liked the character development of Wikus and how our perceptions of the aliens change as we go along. I also liked the twists and turns foisted upon us. However, I did not like a particularly stupid decision made by Wikus, under emotional duress to be fair, that at the time seemed only there to create conflict and delay the end of the movie. I think the story is partly so good because in similar circumstances, the reactions of the involved parties could be very much like this.The aliens were extremely well done in terms of looks and movements. It's a thought-provoking movie but it has lots of thrilling action especially in the last part. There are also some gory moments but they're over quickly. The location of the story, South Africa, is brilliant because of all the associations with Appartheid, disinformation and racism. I would say that right now District 9 is overrated on Internet Movie Database but I think it's because people were anxiously waiting for a great original sci-fi movie with some substance. It's certainly not in the top 50 movies of all time but it's probably the best sci-fi movie I've seen in 2009. With a much lower budget, it beats most American blockbusters in terms of enjoyment and satisfaction.Rating: 8 out of 10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Take a deeper look,"Being a South African, one notices certain parallels between the movie and the history of our country. Locally produced and inspired movies are usually disappointing and slightly embarrassing but for once I was pleasantly surprised. If you ever wanted a taste of South Africa and its culture this is a movie you certainly shouldn't miss. Although the lead actor's performance was pretty top notch as far as SA actors go, I would however like to point out that most South Africans do not speak in such hick-tongue (and that's about all I'd change). Otherwise, the special effects were impressive (considering the budget) and the story even more so. I would definitely not miss this one guys. It was ""fokken"" good.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Wow. Hilarious and unsettling and deeply original. Cat food anyone?,"District 9 (2009)Aliens in Johannesburg. A lot of them. And humans, without the usual fear of invasion from outer space, but a more normal fear of those who are Other, just plain different. What do you do with a million uncouth strangers who can't even speak English? Exploit them of course, and put them in a giant tent city. And make them victims of a modern bureaucracy, too, and ask them to sign papers for their own eviction from a squalid camp they never asked for in the first place. I'm surprised they didn't think to tax them, too.Yes, this is District 9: inventive, preposterous, crude, grandiose, silly, disturbing. In spurts and surges, with talking head experts and creaky sci-fi effects, District 9 downright crazy, too. Above all, though, it's a relief. It isn't a Hollywood version of the same clever idea, and though I might like to see that slicker, and probably more sentimental movie, this one is a rare divergence, valuable for its diverging. Unlike many European films and their sibling American Indies, this South African production aims high, and big. And it pulls off some happy combination of absurd and profound in an entertaining, unpolished hybrid. It creaks and groans are unfortunate, and the plot could use some depth, but the whole situation, and the suspension of believability required, are fabulous.It's worth saying, at the start, that the monsters (of which there are an unreasonable 1.8 million during the main part of the movie) are unappealing, grotesque, violent things, vaguely human in shape, but eating raw goats heads and, their favorite treat, cans of can food (including the can, it seems, or at least without a can opener). But if this is enough for some viewers to wish them all dead, or at least wish them all to go home, it doesn't seem to bother the human population. Maybe this looks like small potatoes compared to Apartheid, a parallel lost on many younger and most outsider viewers. But the crux of the movie is the apparent kindness of humanity to help the aliens in their time of trouble (their spaceship broke down).The plot doesn't quite devolve into a good guy bad guy movie, though there is a particular bumbling, lovable hero at the center of it. It does resort to half an hour of chasing and shooting toward the end, with lots of effects not far removed from a contemporary video game. The fact that you are rooting for the aliens by then should strike you as odd, and in fact it might strike you as a parallel to a truly Hollywood movie with similar threads (stereotypes of aliens and macho humans battling for survival), have you heard of Avatar? But give this one a chance to get to you more poignantly (with less of the sweeping oh my effect of more expensive movies) and you'll maybe get what's good here.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

"Human point-of-view, as destruction looms above","I've seen this twice now and both times I'm striken by how quickly, how uniformly we are lowered inside it. What is so thrilling about it is the camera the filmmaker gives it. As with Spielberg's War of the Worlds or Cloverfield, destruction looms huge above us but we are stripped of our omnipresent role and given the subjective, exclusively human pov. We merely steal upwards glimpses of the larger theater. We'll see a few more films in this direction I'm sure, that will build on the failings of these attempts.Sure, there is a storytelling spine that guides the vision. Familiar reversals, about a flawed protagonist who must rediscover his lost humanity (and limited pov) by broadening his view to encompass the other, the opposite. And the obvious social metaphor that gives it some topical relevance. For me however it comes back to our placement in the cinematic world.What I would leave out of it is the wafer-thin cardboards of the human antagonists; the obnoxiously macho SWAT leader, the coldly calculated cruelty of the father-in-law.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Where were the rest of the world?,"District 9 is an odd film. I quite enjoyed the mockumentary style of the opening part and the not-very-hidden allegory to the South African apartheid policies of the past. And I must say that I'm amazed that the South African government didn't attempt to ban the film (or, should I say, that I never heard of any attempt to ban it?)One thing is for sure, the sci-fi parody of SA politics is not difficult to see unless you've had your head buried in the sand for the last 50 years!One surprising aspect of this movie is that Peter Jackson was one of its producers but didn't direct it. I couldn't help wondering why since he has no South African ties that I know of.But the most glaring anomaly of the whole movie is the fact that South Africa seems to be all alone in dealing with the aliens. In real life that simply would NEVER happen! The USA would have immediately stormed in and taken charge (whether asked to or not) and, in keeping with this type of movie, Stallone, Schwarzennegger, Willis and all the other tough guys methodically wiped out the aliens, friendly or not!As one who enjoys fantasy movies I'm afraid that District 9 left me a bit ho-hum but, if you like the genre, by all means give it a go.

I'm an Alien. I'm a legal Alien... I'm a Prawn in Jo'Burg!,"Although seemingly quite the hype in the rest of the world, ""District 9"" got unleashed into theaters in my country without much publicity or commotion. It's only playing in cinemas with the largest number of screens and if I hadn't coincidentally checked what was playing in theaters this week, maybe I would have missed it completely. I've read in the trivia section that the American marketing campaign included interactive posters with phone numbers that upset citizens could call, but here in Belgium there weren't even any trailers. Too bad, actually, because ""District 9"" is an imaginative low-budget movie that for once really deserves to lure as many curious film fanatics to cinemas. Unlike other over-hyped blockbusters of this type, like for example ""Cloverfield"", this film contains a large amount of genuinely ingenious ideas and a truckload of very effective social commentary. ""District 9"" differs immensely from the average type of alien invasion movies and is actually more of a pitch-black comedy slash political satire instead of a Sci-Fi. The coolest and most inventive aspect about the entire concept already comes at the beginning, with the arrival of a mysterious spaceship on earth, but not in New York or Paris or any major Western city, but above the 'crime capital of the world' Johannesburg in South Africa of all places! After nearly twenty years of silence and no attempt of the aliens to seek contact, soldiers eventually break into the spacecraft and discover a severely weakened race of aliens they baptize Prawns because of their hideous appearances. The South African government is now ""stuck"" with the aliens, and since they're unable to integrate in society, they put them into a township called District 9. Today, in the year 2010, ambitious social worker Wikus Van Der Merwe is assigned to finally evict all the Prawns one by one, but during his round he accidentally comes into contact with an alien liquid and gradually turns into a prawn himself. Now fleeing from his own government, since he has become an eagerly wanted study object all of a sudden, Wikus discovers that human never had any good intentions with the Prawns and simply wanted to dissect and study them and obtain accessibility to their powerful weapons.Particularly the first half of ""District 9"" is downright brilliant and jaw-dropping original, because writer/director Neill Blomkamp fantastically illustrates the South African living conditions of poor people. I've spent two months in that country myself (though in Cape Town and not Johannesburg) and can actually confirm that these Townships are disastrous places where often two million people live together on a couple of square kilometers, in terribly ramshackle cabins with barely any running water. These places gradually sew despair and they are breeding grounds for criminal gangs. The alien intruders in Blomkamp's are actually just oppressed South African people; locked away in townships and given the negative image of being a ""financial burden"" to bear by the rest of the country's population. Blomkamp's film, in documentary style with interviews and seemingly live action reporting, is masterfully compelling and – even with the implausible premise of alien intruders – feels incredibly authentic. The second half of ""District 9"" is a lot less interesting, since the script reverts to violent shoot-outs and rather indigestible sentimental plot lines. The infected Wikus teams up with the most intelligent member of the Prawn species to fix the spacecraft and find an antidote for Wikus' deteriorating condition. The subtle social criticism gradually vanishes during this second half, as there are a lot of agitated confrontations with military forces and Nigerian crime syndicates. In spite of the relatively low budget of $30 million, the film has amazing special effects and make-up art. The unknown cast does a terrific job and the overall tone of the film – in spite of the harsh political topics – is spirited and energetic. Can't wait to see what Blomkamp does next, whether or not with the welcome help of producer Peter Jackson.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

It plays like an unfunny gross-out comedy done on the cheap by amateurs. There is nothing here to keep you watching the screen.

We may be shocked at first appearance, but that wears off in about 15 seconds. The disgust does not wear off.There does not seem to be any plot, any decent camera-work, any acting, any direction, any reason to care about anything on the screen.

See This!!!!!,"This is one of the amazing films of history. To think that it was done on an indie budget, with the two lead actors as first-timers, and a director who has very limited experience is somewhat mind-boggling. I suspect that the superb empathetic elements in the Christopher Johnson character and his son deserve a slight nod in the direction of the producers (cf. Gollum & King Kong). What do you want? Acting? We got that. The evolution of the Wikers character is truly dynamic in a very personal way. You want pathos? We got tons! You want action? Some of the best action sequences I have ever seen. You want FX? Again, seamless and some of the most impressive FX ever! You want Sci-Fi? This is in the grand tradition of ""I am Legend,"" ""2001/2010,"" ""I Robot,"" ""Thirteenth Floor,"" and a long list of socially relevant Sci-Fi films and literature. Humor? Check! Shocking realism? Check! Even a rather touching love story between Wikers and his wife. Check! This movie has it all, and is a non-stop dramatic tour de force from beginning to end. Warning: not for morons who have trouble with understanding South African accents, social relevancy, or who can only see aliens as the universally superior, new age, breathlessly long awaited saviors of human culture (cf. Close Encounters), or on the other hand, evil predators who live only to survive by evisceration of humans or implanting embryos in their abdomens (cf. Alien, Aliens; which films I love, BTW).

Apartheid and corporate abuse,"Members of the National Party manufactured apartheid as a means of using the judicial system, law enforcement, and the military to cement minority white racial control in South Africa. Two decades in its wake, this excellent film -- part action flick and part social commentary -- is critical of the we/they binary and profit-at-any-cost logics which underpinned apartheid and that obviously inform human/non-human relations in the corporate governance of District 9. Binary logics lose all common sense, though, with a critical turn of events as the telling of Wikus Van De Merwe's story unfolds.

The combination of pseudo-documentary, and conventional film, was very effective.

Decent!,"Going into the cinema I had mixed expectations as I only saw a handful (yet interesting) posters and only one trailer. I only heard a handful of reviews yet all of them came from this site. Well, I decided to hedge my bets and walk in anyway. And I'm glad I did.""District 9"" is a wallop of a film that is also one of the year's very best films. It perfectly presents the balance of human emotions and CGI mastery. The acting is top notch and believable, and the characters are so realistically presented; even the protagonist is deeply flawed, and during some scenes I wonder who should I root for.The story is well told; a refreshing, unique and somewhat original scenario, one that we've never experienced for quite some time. The atmosphere is bleak, dark and realistic, actually making me believe this thing can actually happen here on Earth.The special effects are excellently rendered, and actually give more than their money's worth (Only US$ 30 million! And the effects were amazing, as great as anything WETA has done before!). The creature effects are so realistic we could not tell the difference. Thanks to none other than WETA for this amazing feat, and I hope they get an Oscar for visual effects. But the practical effects are believable too, as per the engaging and thrilling (and also non-stop) action sequences in the film's second half. And boy, those weapons are awesome! Special mention goes out to the fluid editing. Example, first half of the film works like a docu-drama, and the second half becomes a hybrid of Black Hawk Down, and we don't notice the change of pace. It's that brilliant.Peter Jackson really knows how to pick a good story and director when he sees one. And I want to shake Neill Blommkamp's hand if I meet him. He is certainly a talented director, and one to look out for in the future. (P.S. If that Halo movie is still going on, Blommkamp has proved that he is the man for the job) In short, it's an excellent science fiction action film, but not without it's intelligence.

Excellent Movie,"I will save everyone some time here and just say that this movie was excellent - maybe even a little beyond. They did an excellent job of putting the movie together in a very unique way. For sure not your typical science fiction. As other have mentioned, the setting (where the movie takes place) also adds to the interest of this movie. There are some mild attempts of humour with this movie and that was well done too. The special effects were also top notch. The thing I liked the most about this movie is that it seemed as if it really could have happened. (you'll understand when you watch the movie) Another angle the director hits on was the relationships, not only between the officials, but also some of the locals and within the alien community itself. It's something you don't usually see in these types of movies, and when you do, it's usually done in a tacky sort of way.

Tense solid character-driven action/drama with forgivable faults. 8/10,"As the summary suggests, this movie features a solid premise, very able acting, and a sensible script. The plot is fairly well thought through and each scene follows from the last. The director must have done a fabulous job because I really couldn't predict the events of the movie. It didn't lock itself into a hero-movie path.The character-driven nature of this film is one of its best characteristics, and as a rare treat for an action movie I was able to emotionally invest in the fate of the lead characters. This extra quality offsets the typical action, and more than makes up for some of the slightly more clichéd elements within the show. Thankfully though, they did not follow any formula closely.It *does* have some faults. There are moments when plot or scene logic doesn't hold up to serious scrutiny, and while the action is well-done, it does have a few of those ""why doesn't he just..."" moments. That won't matter to you though because you'll be so intrigued with having a cinematic experience that treats you like a thinking person that you won't even bother to think about HOW the logic is incomplete or how the action should have been done. The foibles are sufficiently minor and the movie keeps moving forward.My biggest problem is with the camera work. The shaky camera effect was used in places I felt it unjustified. Certainly some of the film is believable with the hand-held quality but many parts make that really inappropriate and distracting.This movie is intelligent, and I beg for a sequel. I want that sequel to be a continuation of the story, with the same high calibre acting, attention to script quality (that's so important), and not blown way out of proportion and made horrid like sequels normally are.Thank you, everyone who contributed to District 9.

This movie is to alien movies what Saving Private Ryan is to war movies. I saw the reviews on here and I usually trust them because after a sample group of thousands of people you get a general idea of how good a movie is but it had a 9. That was really high so I decided to see it over other current movies. I just can't believe how good it was. I love the feeling of being super happy and adrenaline pumping because the movie had you genuinely surprised, and worried about the characters in it.

District A Good Sci-Fi Action Thriller,"District 9 is a good sci-fi action thriller unlike any other but in a good way. It has character development, action, suspense, drama, and some humor to light up the serious mood of the movie from time to time. I can see why many people liked this film after watching it. Writer/Director Neil Blomkamp is admirable in making this movie to the big screen with a compelling story and impressive special effects that help bring the film to life. Newcomer Sharlto Copley is effective as the lead bringing a lot of comic relief to his role. He's believable as his character who goes through a major transformation during the course of the movie. The rest of the unknown cast are good in their roles too. The aliens looked realistic like a cross between insects and cockroaches. The special effects are great especially for a small budget independent film including the hovering space craft and the alien weaponry. The bloody brutal violence is well executed which mostly happens toward the second half when the action kicks into high gear. Besides some flaws with the dialogue at times overall District 9 was much better then I thought it would be. I actually enjoyed it more than X-Men Origins Wolverine and Transformers Revenge Of The Fallen which were okay but had many flaws that weighed them down. So if you're looking for an entertaining sci-fi action thriller, District 9 is the movie for you.

However as I found out more about the film, my interest rose. The hype for the film also rose. I waited each day for the rating to show on IMDb, and finally it came. Top 250 in it's first few days. I had to watch it. And I was blown away. On a budget of $30 million, the effects and direction were brilliant. Better than the garbage camera work of transformers 2. Shot with subtlety and a believable plot, it will rise in the ranks for top sci-fi films. I was nervous about Neil Blomkamp, haven't seen really any of his works, but now I believe he will rise as a director. I praise him and Peter Jackson for this movie. Well done.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
aliens in refuge camps....,"could be another title for this movie. District 9 is the name of the camps that millions of aliens have been sent to in Johanasburg, South Africa. It seems aliens arrived about 20 years ago and the humans put them in camps and control them. The aliens are called prawns because that means they are the lowest of the low.The movie is shot like a documentary. Government worker Wikus has been sent to get aliens to sign eviction notices. He picks up an alien cylinder that sprays him with black fluid. It begins to transform him. So, he's captured and this company wants to do experiments on him. He escapes and meets up with an alien whom may be able to help him. So the latter part of the movie is just year average chase film with explosions and such.FINAL VERDICT: It was OK, the aliens were good special effects and the story made sense. It's also got some nice kill shots for gore fans.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Very well documented praise ...,"I haven't seen the short movie this is based on and which apparently impressed Peter Jackson enough to pull some weight, so that this first-time director (at least full length wise), could get a decent budget to realise his dream. Of course that also brings quite a few haters, who say this isn't a first time project if you get to play with that much money ...But a) you have to earn that and b) you have to know how to handle that money. And here is a young new talent that shows promise. The movie, that wasn't exactly how I imagined it, but managed to exceed my (high) expectations!

The Lord of the Rings of scifi,"I saw this movie yesterday evening and it's definitely one of the best scifi-action-adventure movies ever made!!! Before I went to the cinema, I'd heard that the film contains a lot of blood and guts and it might be unsuitable for some people. I agree with this, but at least for me it was far from a too violent movie, because the gore scenes are quite gritty and blurry. This is why I'm honesty recommending this to the majority of adults. It has so much to offer.First: the plot. Despite you've seen the trailers and read the synopsis, the plot has many twists to surprise you. And unlike in the case of 24, the twists are pretty reasonable and humane. Besides, it's not hard to recognize the connection between the alien community problem and the global social issues of the real world (just think about this after watching the movie).Second: the CGI's. This is probably the first film including so realistic CGI effects that they are actually hard to separate from the ""real"" objects. Also, the rugged documentary-like picture enhances this vision very well. Nonetheless, the explosions and the other such visual effects were cutting edge. Still, I was a bit surprised to see that the film wasn't completely shot in this documentary-like manner, though only some individual scenes were.Third: the action sequences weren't presented too frequently and that's why they worked so effectively. Despite this I didn't find myself bored in any part of the movie, probably because the action scenes were highly intensive and simply super-exciting!Fourth: Sharlto Copley. This guy was incredible. He played his character (Wikus van de Merwe) extremely well, which reminded me of Borat (by Sacha Baron Cohen): so innocent and well-meaning person, but still people see him as a goofy (which appears to be a false assumption, when it's about his survival). But maybe the most impressive thing about him was the South African accent, it's simply unforgettable when you hear him swearing (and that's what you'll going to hear a lot in this movie).The only thing that bothered me a bit, was ""the overwhelming necessary evil"" character that they had to include to the movie for some mysterious reason. Maybe this will make it look more Hollywood style, but still I think it's a bad cliché.Bottom line: don't miss this film, if you respect good scifi entertainment. It's like the Lord of the Rings of science fiction movies, one of the best movies of it's genre. Last, but not least: respect for the co-operation of Neill Blomkamp and Peter Jackson.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Alian apartheid? I argued with my girlfriend to go see this movie,"in place of seeing ""Time Traveler's Wife""... I do not like chick flicks and argued that District 9 would amuse her... I was WRONG and I have to pay dearly... she hated it and I kinda, sorta liked it...First of all, the graphics were EXCELLENT and they were well integrated with true characters... but did we have to suffer through the obvious apartheid lesson for soooooo long? I lived in South Afica for a bit and hated anything to do with apartheid but the director forces us to re-learn the whole evil lesson... much of the 1st third of the movie could have been deleted / shortened but remain effective with telling the apartheid horrors...So, I still gave it a ""6""... the acting was a tad amateurish but that gave the movie a local South African flavor... a little more editing and this movie is much better... again, the graphics were great...",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
An unusual Sci-Fi film,"This is one of the few (if any) sci-fi movies I've ever seen in which the basic plot and theme of the movie have virtually nothing to do with science fiction, and instead focus on human qualities and weaknesses, which may be why (I predict) the critics will like it so much.During the movie, we learn very little about the aliens, their (obviously advanced) technology, their biology or their culture. Instead the movie focuses on the human aspects of the story and the growth of the characters (alien and human).While this is bad news for me (personally) because the sci-fi aspects of the story (alien science, technology and culture) are what I enjoy the most about sci-fi movies, other viewers will probably find that the strength of the ""human"" qualities of the story are compelling enough to drive the story, and by the end the human and alien characters have grown on you enough to get you emotionally involved in the climax. And that's what a movie should do.This movie takes a long time to establish the characters and the situation so I found the first half kind of slow, but it builds to a nice crescendo and it's all worth it in the end. And they give themselves a big fat setup for a sequel in three years.My rating of 8 out of 10, is based mostly on the strength of the underlying theme, the acting and realistic (gritty) documentary style of filming. If there had been more detail about the aliens themselves this would have been a ""10"" for me.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Noy quite,"I had great expectations before I saw this movie. But after wards I felt somewhat disappointed. The film is technically well executed but the script isn't that good. Especially the main characters motivation, didn't make sense and in some parts it just felt plain stupid. The acting wasn't top notch either. The main character felt like a beginner in many scenes, and according to what I have read - that's about true.The CGI department is where this movie's strength lie. It's well designed and on a level that doesn't shift the focus entirely away from the characters and the story. But in some parts i wish it did. But still I give it a 7 since I'm a sucker for Sci-Fi and Blomkamp should receive credit for producing a movie that has some thought in it and doesn't take place in LA.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A thought-provoking sci-fi tale.,"District 9 is a unique experience. I'd describe it as political sci-fi action faux-documentary thriller. If that doesn't qualify as unique, I don't know what does.Another simpler way to describe it is that it's a good sci-fi movie. District 9 poses the question of what would happen if some relatively unimpressive aliens were forced to find refuge in South Africa. There's lots of exploration of themes like xenophobia, exploitation, bioengineering and weapons ethics, among others. The best science fiction movies always seem to find a way to tackle a complex subject or two, without beating the audience over the head with it. District 9 (along with Moon) is a good recent example of that.Don't fall under the impression that this is some cerebral think-piece, though. There's lots of action. In nearly every scene, there's some small (or huge) bit of interesting visuals going on. From the design and animation of the aliens, to their technology and various explosions and gun battle set-pieces, the special effects are universally impressive. Especially for the relatively small budget that the picture was made with.I heartily recommend this to almost anyone. District 9 is a very entertaining movie that can offer you more, if you choose to ponder the topics it raises. And if you just want to see stuff get blown up, it'll still have you covered.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Incredibly disappointing (yes, call this review ""District Whine"")","As an avid movie fan, in particular the science fiction genre, I had high expectations for this film. The last two sci-fi movies I have seen (Star Trek and Moon) were both top caliber films, easily eclipsing anything within the last few years. Based on the fantastic reviews and the association with Peter Jackson, I thought the summer sci-fi's would be three for three. But was I so wrong.The problem with the film is that it just isn't plausible whatsoever. I am a mid-30's engineer, so for a teenager who loves ""Transformers"", I can understand that this movie would have incredible appeal. And even for me there were parts of the film that I really liked. But the outrageously unrealistic scenes outnumbered the plausible ones with a ratio of about 5 to 1. There were so many issues with realism, I don't know where to begin. When I see science fiction (vs fantasy), I expect realism ... this isn't Lord of the Rings. And I felt alarm bells going off a few times on ""social commentary"" using aliens as a metaphor for illegal immigrants (""aliens""), and I think that also could be driving some of the high ratings.So if you love C+ action movies (hey, I have enjoyed plenty ... including parts of this one), give this a try. I think there are aspects of the movie that most people can enjoy, but just don't count on seeing a movie that is currently sitting around the top 30 movies of all time as ranked on IMDb. It isn't even close. Statistically speaking, with roughly 100,000 movies out there, I would say it belongs in the top 50,000.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Budget: 30 million,"I watched the film thinking how on the face of this planet could the director and producer only used 30 million to create this film and still create wonderful visual effects. Maybe it is the absence of big name actors. Maybe Peter Jackson knew people who can charge less money. No, it is not that; it was creativeness that made the movie so cheap and I put Einstein on the spotlight with his famous quote, ""Imagination is more important than knowledge."" And if you are confused how that can be, than watch District 9 and you will find out.The basis of the film is that twenty years ago, an alien ship landed in the middle of South Africa and had alien refugees in the ship. The government was kind enough to bring these aliens into a refugee camp and the government believed that soon, the aliens will fix the ship and be able to get out of Earth. But after twenty years, nothing happens except the aliens start acting up and riot, wanting to go back home. So the MNU (Multi-National United) decide to take care of the aliens and throw them into an area called District 9. They not only abuse the aliens, but also attempt to learn about their arsenal and technology. Of course, the aliens refuse to give it up. So a brave, yet moronic man named Wilkus van der Mwere who is part of the of the MNU goes out to District 9...And I have to stop there because a true experience of the film is to watch the movie without knowing anymore than what I said.The first act of the film was in a documentary format which made this alien concentration life seem more realistic to a human perspective. What really made me proud was to see new time director, Neill Blomkamp, use some documentary film making in this movie because topics such as alien invasions and documentaries were never melded together before like it is shown in this movie. The director created a movie that not only stuck to what the audience likes to see on the big screen, but also to experiment and go a bit progressive into the idea of the science fiction genre such as a documentary filming in the first act.The visuals effects were fantastic, which is not surprising considering Peter Jackson produced the film who is known for visual movies such as Lord of the Rings and the King Kong remake. The aliens looked realistic, the weapon firing were outstanding and the cinematography was another great highlight. Every bit of the 3M budget was obviously for the special effects, and it was used very well. Also, the story line was well developed and because it was complex, and it really got the audience and I engaged in what was going on. The story line also connected with real-life issues such as racism, apartheid, or xenophobia which I believe should be the basis for good science-fiction movies, a connection to human flaws and set in a grungy future of the Earth.District 9 is what we would call ""The Matrix"" ten years ago, ""Terminator"" twenty years ago, ""Alien"" thirty years ago, and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" forty years ago. A science-fiction action film that used progressive and advanced camera styles and also went above and beyond into the world of the science fiction genre. And who better to be connected to the next movie that would do this visual effects revolution than Peter Jackson/Neil Blomkamp. I hope this team will perform another spectacular science fiction opus in the near future and Neil Blomkamp has said that he will revisit the District 9 world someday.The only thing is that if you do not appreciate science-fiction, then this is not the movie for you. The movie is for serious science-fiction lovers like me. Only for viewers who enjoyed Alien, Terminator, The Thing, and all of the science-fiction classics. This movie will become a classic many years from now. You have to watch this movie on the big screen because it was meant for the big screen. I do not know why the movie was not in an IMAX format because that would have upped the ante even more. The film is going to lend itself to a sequel and hopefully the sequel will be just as I hope it will be. Well directed, well produced, well filmed, kick-ass, and in IMAX (hopefully).",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"District 9, gets a 9 out of 10.","Finally I had enough time to sit down and watch this movie that has been on my most anticipated films list. It was one of the greatest films ever made.

It stars of as a fictional documentary of how the aliens came about and then the movie switches into the aliens and the humans sides of the story, which I thought was brilliant. The computer animations were insane.

A Good Idea That Wasn't Well Executed,"Unlike many people, I was disappointed with this movie. The extended documentary-like opening (which, in many ways, ran through the whole movie) was too much. It might have served a purpose if it had been a brief way of introducing the basic story, but to film a movie largely in this fashion certainly detracted from the development of the main characters. You certainly feel sympathy for the aliens in general, and even for Wikus eventually, but it takes a while to develop that, which made this seem like little more than watching CNN coverage of a major news event. You watch to see what's happening, but you're not really drawn into the story. By the time the end came, although sympathy was developing for both Wikus and his new alien friend Christoper, the movie took on a certain comic-book feel as Wikus dons the alien suit and takes on the appearance of a sort of alien super-hero. It didn't work that well, and actually felt a bit silly.There were aspects of the story, mind you, that would have been interesting had they been better developed. It was very interesting to see a movie depicting aliens arriving on earth not as evil conquerors but as pathetic refugees - and everything about them seemed pathetic, as they were forced to live in slum-like conditions in what was essentially an internment camp, denied any basic right, and having their needs exploited by the less savoury elements of South African society (where the movie was set) - although I found myself wondering why there was such a focus on ""Nigerian"" gangs? Why Nigeria? The movie effectively puts a new spin on the desperate plight of all refugees by making these refugees aliens. Still, the movie didn't really capture me. It was an interesting idea, but I didn't find it particularly well executed.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Science Fiction Has Met Another Masterpiece,"NO SPOILERS: District 9 delivers a movie that Science Fiction has been waiting for since the days of Star Wars. Masterpieces of the genre include 2001: A Space Odyssey, the Alien duet (Alien and Aliens), and, of course, the unforgettable Star Wars. District 9 is everything you want and more. It makes itself a masterpiece through originality, great story telling, realistic aliens, both in looks and actions, reality, and meaning. To put the final touch, it delivers a multitude of action sequences that keep your eyes wide open for the second half, without which we would be subject to another movie that you hate to watch because every time you find yourself drifting off to sleep. This is no space opera and it has no complex subtext scattered throughout. It is a genuine story of realistic Science Fiction. The many themes, characters, and emotions within the story make it a powerhouse within the movie universe. The few fallacies lie cluttered in the script, mainly in the lack of dialog aside from f-bombs. On a lighter note is the connection you have with the aliens. Even in other movies where the aliens are the ""good guys"", you find yourself wanting to care for them. The connection developed with the alien Christopher is more than you could want. The personification of the alien's eyes gives you a hold of the connection reel before it pulls you in. District 9 is the Science Fiction masterpiece of the 2000's. The Story reminded me most of Fargo, which showed greed and selflessness and the effects of both. Movies like Avatar and Donnie Darko are great but hail in comparison to the marvel that D9 delivers. I purchase few movies but this one sits in my library next to Star Wars, Alien, and 2001 as an equal. OVERALL: 9.5/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
This IS Science Fiction,"Let's be honest: The best science fiction we've ever read or seen does start with an impossible, incredible, at least highly unlikely idea.Asimov, Bradbury, Clarke, or Lem.All of them ask you to believe in a very unbelievable idea from the very beginning of their stories.I've seen District 9, and I've read a lot of the reviews giving it a low rating. Most of these ratings however make a lot of assumptions about what an encounter with an alien race would look like, what an alien race would want, desire, or be able to do. They complain about the unbelievable, the strange, the illogical.I admit that some parts of the story do indeed seem illogical, but that's EXACTLY what the human race is all about! We ARE very unreasonable, have motives that would be quite impossible to understand from an alien point of view, and our cultures are so diverse that we hardly understand each other.So, who's to complain about something unreasonable about an alien race? What the heck to WE understand about it? Nothing! I've recently seen Avatar (and I liked it), but in comparison, the cultural and social depth of District 9, the realization of being human, and what that means, what kind of species you're a part of, kicks you in the head with a much more powerful impact.Naturally, the film is a film and must follow some rules of film making, and only has two hours to tell the story to the audience.Taking into account, that the film has only a short time, that the subject touches not only technology, but also culture, history, present conflicts of our time, and of course introduces a whole new species, I've got to say it's the best science fiction film in years.I'm giving it 9 out of 10, because there was indeed one moment of asking myself ""What the heck is this?"" However, compared to a lot of other films I've recently seen, District 9 still shows them all where to set the standards, what creativity means, what amateur actors can do, how to tell a compelling story, and how to approach a very difficult subject, and get it to work.I'm very content that I finally saw this film, and I say to any TRUE science fiction fan who is able to admit that real science fiction involves SOME leap of faith: This is a film that I'd really recommend!

Containing The Aliens,"District 9 is an interesting film in that it is set in South Africa - a country with a tragic history of separation and intolerance.That this was the case is hardly ironic, the filmmakers deliberately used South Africa's racially divisive history to emphasize the ill-treatment begot by 'Prawn' aliens landing in Johannesburg some 20 years ago.Peter Jackson lends his masterful cinematic experience to a film which has proved that South African filmmakers can confidently stand alongside Hollywood giants in the big-action sci-fi flicks.The story is a nostalgic mix of Starship Troopers, Independence Day and perhaps even Alien vs Predator. The visual effects are stunning, the action is intentionally documentary-style and overall it comes across pretty well.Over 1 million 'Prawns' are being forcefully relocated away from the main population center in Johannesburg - some 200km away (reminiscent of the Group Areas Act - where the Afrikaners forcefully vacated Black shantytowns away from White Areas). But not all the 'Prawns' are going down without a fight.That's where Wickus Van Der Merwe - MNU Operations Head comes into play. This soft-spoken bureaucrat is charged with the removals. But he gets 'infected' by 'Prawn' DNA and so begins a terrifying journey of self-reflection, disillusionment, rejection and prejudice.Suddenly Wickus knows how it feels to be hated. He is ostracized from his family, his friends and society. His new goal is to help get the 'Prawns' back onto the mother ship.This is where the journey begins, who knows where it will end...",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Great SciFi like we had not seen in a LONG time,"This is a GREAT movie about a very plausible situation. A MUST-SEE!! An Alien ship, transporting hundreds of Thousands of Alien population malfunctions and they are obliged to land here on earth. This is an important detail, because later on you will get to understand that they are both technologically and socially much more advanced than us, and they would have not chosen earth as a destination. Actually as they were maneuvering a smaller aircraft coming from the main ship lands, but that is a minor detail that will only become major later. In any case we get to the main ship and bring the aliens down to earth, they were weakened and needed food, so the decision was made to transport them all down to a refugee camp as a 'temporary measure' they somehow were able to breath fine, and particularly enjoyed cat food. The main ship remains afloat Johanesburg in South Africa and down below the Aliens live in a camp that quickly turns into a funky slum. What is great about the movie is making the transition between Alien exotica and 'everyday Alien"", we see them interchanging with humans, trading, and constantly moving about. Although they look like human sized lobsters, and are referred to as ""Prawns"" they pretty much have the same configuration as ours.The movie starts actually a full twenty years after the 'landing' so all the glamor of news and novelty is gone and the South African Government is just trying to move them to another district, further away from their capital city by forced eviction. At this point the man in charge of the operations, Wikus Van De Merwe played by Sharlto Copley gets infected by a canister that contains a liquid two of the aliens had been hard at work for a long time. He does not know this, he thinks they are gangsters because their hut is full of computers and weaponry, but in reality they are the scientists amongst the aliens that have been working all this time to fix the spaceship, when he accidentally sprays some of the contents on himself he starts triggering a genetic reaction that will slowly change him into one of the creatures in a slow but very visible way. The strong, excellent performance by Wikus is what makes it believable, he is a totally square and regular guy, actually pretty good natured and in the process of this horrific change he maintains his humanity and sanity and has a complete change of heart in his relationship to the Aliens, as he is forced by circumstance to 'bond' with the one scientist who was involved in making the liquid, and his small son.The film is important in showing the complexities of the exchanges with the Aliens and covers full well the political intrigue and inhumane behavior that is part of our present state of evolution. It starts out very slow and is not particularly great in the introduction of this information, so that at one point I was getting very impatient, but then started to enjoy the flow of the story. The turning point was the intervention of the liquid that changes Wikus and everything about the movie from that point forward. A rare instance in SciFi where violence is not gratuitous and all the tech makes perfect sense. It will doubtlessly become a cult film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Original and emotionally gripping from start to finish.,"With the recent decline in quality of summer sci-fi blockbusters (Transformers 2, anyone?), it's nice to see a film such as ""District 9"" that's original and groundbreaking; with a universe and a web of intrigue that you've never seen before in the sci-fi genre. I won't spoil any details of the plot but I will tell you this: This film is the most emotionally gripping and horrifying experience I've ever had this year. Some parts of the film were unintentionally funny, giving it dose of black comedy that works really well with the grimy, dilapidated slums of South Africa with performances by Wikus Van De Merwe, played brilliantly by Sharlto Copeley. In addition to the well-written script and beautiful direction lies some very original creature designs seemingly inspired by the Cthulu mythos of H.P Lovecraft fame which that are truly terrifyingly realistic. But beneath all the great aspects of this film is the heart of the film showing the good and bad of both sides of the conflict bringing in touching moments of heroism and justice, racial intolerance, isolation, and brutality. Some of the violence is really shocking and disturbing so I advise parents not to let their kids see this one because some of what's up there on screen will really give them nightmares.I have to say this is if you want to see a thought-provoking, original, and gripping sci-fi film, see District 9. One of the best films in the genre of this year.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Violent but well done film is much more politically incorrect than perceived,"This quite violent science fiction film from South Africa is about seemingly slow witted aliens (who look like giant insects or crustaceans) who arrived in a giant spaceship over Johannesburg some decades ago, and were forcibly put by the government into a camp (actually one big slum) inside the city called District 9, where they live in despairing conditions. When the government decides to relocate them to concentration camps far from Johannesburg, Wikus, a nerdy public servant involved in the relocation, is sprayed with a liquid (which the aliens plan to use in a ploy to return to their planet) and slowly starts to mutate into an alien. Considered now to be a threat to the state, Wikus decides to become a fugitive and help the aliens in their plans (more things happen, but I leave the plot there). While not totally successful, it is nevertheless entertaining, and gives quite food for thought, in ways different than most critics thought. Many critics and commentators lazily called this an apartheid allegory, but if anything the film is much more politically incorrect than that: it's really about the despair white South Africans feel when they realize they are now a tiny minority in a country flooded in crime, driven in part by immigration from other African countries (the portrayal of Nigerians as brutal criminals living alongside the aliens in the slums is particularly heavy handed – it's surprising the film wasn't more denounced for this). The constant use of hand-held camera is a bit tiresome – and may make you feel dizzy as well.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

The closest movie to this (and superior) is Braindead - also associated with Peter Jackson. But that movie never forgot that it was not meant to be serious.

An interesting new approach to the Sci-Fi Thriller,"Watching District 9 was an odd experience.I was taken back to a time when sci-fi/thrillers relied on the craft of set designers, make-up artists and clever directors to make an ambitious film possible despite a rather limited budget.District 9 reminds me of sci-fi classics like Alien, in which a team of artists led by a young but apt director work in unison to bring a unique take on the genre to life.The idea of filming District 9 as a quasi-documentary allows the audience to forgive the lack of fancy special effects and the lack-luster appearance of an alien breed that could have been designed two decades ago. The documentary feel also creates an air of intimacy and realism that is highly engaging.Despite having a share of weak action scenes and some plot inconsistencies, the movie remains interesting throughout due to a very original script, artistic concept and creative artistic design.The lead character embodied with great energy and ability by the unknown Sharlto Copley (South-African actor) gives the movie an added aura of realism, placing an average-looking man without the typical chiseled features of Hollywood action heroes.For some, District 9 will be caricaturesque or even silly in its original approach to a Hollywood subject that has been widely explored: the man vs. Alien battle for supremacy. The truth is that District 9 brings a breath of fresh air to an exhausted genre by making humans the villains and aliens the victims, exploring some ethical and political questions but never being preachy.District 9 is one of the best movies of 2009. A must-see.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
District 9 is a fast-paced sci-fi thriller that will glue the audience for 112 minutes.,"Set in Johannesburg, South Africa, District 9 is based on Alive in Joburg, a short film also directed by Neill Blomkamp. Sharlto Copley played as Wikus van der Merwe, an MNU (Multinational United) agent who was sent to work on the non-humans relocation from District 9 to District 10. The non-humans (sometimes referred to as the prawns) arrived in Joburg 28 years ago in a spaceship which still hovers above District 9 in the present day.During the relocation process, Wikus came into contact with a substance that apparently transforming his left hand into an arm similar that of a non-human. MNU then did some tests on him, including the use of non-human weaponry. Later MNU decided to harvest Wikus' organs in order to replicate them. Wikus however, managed to escape and went back to District 9 to hide there.From start to finish, the plot unfolded in a fast-paced manner. Although some questions arise in my mind regarding the plot, this sci-fi thriller is surely exceptional. It is however, missing from the plot on how the non-humans and humans managed to establish communication given that the words coming from the non-humans are barely recognizable in the movie. Another oddity is the fact that the spaceship remained hovering over District 9 for 28 years. Looking at how fast the folks at MNU came to the decision to harvest Wikus' organs, how come they haven't harvest the spaceship? They could bust into the ship, why not disassemble it altogether for scientific study? Nevertheless, despite these questionable details, the film managed to deliver the message regarding greed and discrimination.It is not without reason why I list only Sharlto Copley in the cast. The movie is singlehandedly focused on Wikus that it made everyone else's performances insignificant. Copley's performance however, was outstanding and made as if the movie is actually a documentary. He managed to portray the transformation of Wikus' character from a jovial fellow to a  well, not so jovial fellow, perfectly. I've seen character transformations before but this one is surely one of the best that I've seen.Overall, I consider this movie as a great sci-fi thriller. The acting was dominated by Copley, but he did it superbly. The plot itself provided a thrilling ride from start to finish, but with some questionable details. For District 9, I give it a 9.0 for giving me an awesome entertainment.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Science Fiction Alien Spaceship romp!,"It is difficult to mock this film and not to enjoy it given its high commendation on this website and its Oscar nomination for best picture. I am no fan of science fiction over drama or thrillers or romance but this is an entertaining and original film which should undoubtedly be seen.It is the last of the Oscar best picture nominations for 2010 for me to see and I think the one with the least chance. It clearly will have a cult following with people of all sectors of society.I wonder whether Peter Jackson was called upon for his experience in character creation with Lord of the Rings series, that is a semblance of connection for me.overall it is a harsh story line and I feel the aliens are not treated sympathetically, given they are a unique species. Fencing them in and letting them live in slum conditions was surely a throwback to Soweto and Apartheid, but who am I to be correct about that? The film is more of a documentary than a conventional movie but don't be put off by that. I agree with earlier comments that this is a very realistic storyline and we can all apply our intelligence to think that something like this COULD happen but surely the rest of the world would not stand by idle and allow a country like South Africa.The MNU were clearly integral to the story and their quest for weapon control than alien-welfare was an underlying factor.sorry folks, I was much more comfortable with NINE and STAR TREK, does Blomkamp really want us to think the aliens are coming?

reasons not to like this movie,"1. Peter Jackson apparently likes to fill entire movies with ugly creatures: aliens here, orks etc. in LOTR. 2. Peter Jackson apparently likes to fill entire movies with pointless battles, so does he here. 3. As a consequence of this, content got third priority. You could sum it up in a few sentences. Same problem in ""King Kong"" (which I find unbearably overlong and overrated).So why do I still give it a 7? The story in fact is interesting, but he could have made much more of it. No betrayal, love or any strong personal feelings, nothing. Just some pointless phone calls. You can't call that a masterpiece.4. You couldn't make the announce for a sequel more blatantly obvious.

Brilliant movie,"I never expected to see a new movie that can really keep me up in the night until it's over. There was little hope to be a good one(aliens, laser guns etc etc are old news already, but still...). Super plot, good metaphor om immigrants seen as aliens, the message is anti-racist, romantic and it really touches where it should. Not to mention the graphics, that are really plausible and careful done. What I liked the most is the way the makers succeeded to create empathy in the viewer for the aliens even though their looks may seem disgusting to some. I can't wait to see District 10 (I hope someone will try to make a sequel, of course in the same spirit) A plus from me.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Not impressed,"I watched this movie in theaters a few days ago and came away slightly disgusted and unimpressed. Although ""District 9"" has an excellent story line and a lot of potential to be a good movie, someone twisted this movie into yet another profanity infused gore bath that seem to be become ""all the rage"". The positives of ""District 9"" were that it put a new spin on ""aliens"" which have a history of invading Earth and graphically eating people. In ""District 9"" the aliens (called Prawns in a derogatory manor) are portrayed as almost human despite their outward appearance. They have feelings and are intelligent, have their own way of behaving and for the most part get along with humans. That's about were the goodness stops. After the introduction of the movie is past, the blood, gore, and profanity is kicked into a gear so high, the only other movie I know of that used it was the latest ""Rambo"" flick. The excessive violence is unnecessary and not entertaining in the least. The movie didn't need it, and would have been much better without it. I would have even been OK with it if they didn't have a shower of blood and gore fly all over the camera lens every time a person was ""popped"".The swearing is also unnecessary and detracts from the movie as a whole. I give this turd of a film **** stars (out of ten). I don't recommend it at all unless you have a fetish with blood and enjoy hearing the f-word repeated over and over countless times. I have no idea who would give this movie more than 6 stars, but hey that's just my opinion. However, I have no doubt that this film will leave most of you with an expression on your face of, ""Why the heck did I just waste an hour and 45 minutes on this?"" and the question in your mind of, ""Did I just watch an epic battle scene or an alien warbot taking a shower in ketchup?""",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The Fly meets Independence Day meets ET = SUCCESS,"Even though I had heard good reviews, I resisted knowing a thing about this and went in cold. What unfolded was one of the more gripping cinema experiences I've had in years.If I had to use one word to describe the film, it would be ""intense"". The scope of the film covers such a broad array of real-world topics (as any good sci-fi does), ranging from racism, to animal testing, to genocide, famine, corporate war-lust, the list goes on. But the beauty of District 9 is not its political overtones, but rather its emotion. It's able to wrap all these elements together in a very compelling and believable way. Of course it takes a few Hollywood liberties, but they are NOT cheap and you find yourself almost feeling senses of relief when they occur.Nothing about this film feels rushed or overdone. Everything unfolds very organically and there are enough story devices at work that you will have a hard time second guessing what will happen next. This is an exceedingly rare quality in film today.The CGI effects are sound and I can't applaud Sharlto Copley enough for his performance. His character portrayal is stunning in its scope and depth (plus some great dry, awkward humor) and this role will certainly put his name on the map.Last comment - even though there is plenty of brutal violence, the film never holds your nose to it...just enough to make you squirm a bit. I will say that it is not a film for everyone.Both the premise and execution of of District 9 were ambitious, and in the end, wildy successful. This film will be discussed for years.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"A commercial action sci-fi film that's also smart, political, darkly funny, and at moments very touching,","Blomkamp does the amazing by combing roller coaster excitement with an intelligent context that makes all the noise about something. While some of the ideas are occasionally heavy handed or on the nose, it's so exciting to see a Hollywood action film that traffics in ideas, that I'm willing to forgive the occasional 'I get it already' moment, or logic lapse, or easy coincidence, or mediocre supporting performance.The story is simple. A million plus grotesque looking, starving and sickly aliens get stranded on Earth when they essentially run out of fuel. And while at first humans try to reach out in friendship, before long corporations are trying to make money by exploiting their technology (especially, or course, their weapons) and the aliens are herded into a 'district' and walled in. (That the film is set in South Africa is one of those choices that feels like gilding the lily – even though that is the film-makers home). And it's clear that progressing from apartheid to Nazi style medical experiments and concentration camps is the next step.While I wish the villains were less mustache twirling (some 'banality of evil' would have been even more chilling), the effects are great, and it's a film that grew, not shrank as it went along. For the first third I thought it was OK, the second pretty good, and by the end I loved it. And it's stuck with me.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The Best Sci-Fi Film to Come Out in the Last 20 Years...,"Hollywood is dead. This is a well-known fact. The past 15 years or so have seen the gradual decay and demolishment of the once-proud Hollywood to the point that its corpse is being flailed around and puppeteered by a throng of sick, deranged juveniles. However, despite these abysmal times where films like ""G.I. Joe"" and ""G-Force"" make the weekend lineup, a shining gem has come from a relatively little-known director named Neill Blomkamp. ""District 9"" is easily the best science fiction film to come out in the last 20 years. Not during a single moment does it come across that there are actors on the screen. Not during one moment does it strike you as ludicrous or potentially unbelievable -- the best and worst aspects of both human and non-human alike are portrayed excellently and executed perfectly. It is able to mesh everything necessary to make a fantastic film and a rollicking sci-fi tale. In short: this is a great film and a amazing surprise for these dark times. See this movie -- it is vital. Hopefully, Blomkamp can keep up this kind of reputation and not be poisoned by the disease that is collectively known as Hollywood.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
powerful surprise,"When i went to the cinema to see this movie, i was expected a mindless sci-fi movie with aliens attacking a group whom we follow for the start. But it is not like this, it is way different.The parallel with this kind of system we find in many countries (the principle of salad bowl) and the obvious racism against migrants is way more scary here than in drama movie dealing with those issues.The great storyline reinforced by a well-directed casting make us understand what it is to treat other like ""aliens"". And the assessment is clear : the ugliness of the humanity is here pictured with violence, creating a gap between reality - in the movie - and the fiction the government is selling. And this is the great power of the film, by showing us our own vileness.For those looking for a sci-fi movie with typical aliens, you may be disappointed somehow. The first degree of lecture is enough for you, then. But for those willing to see something different and denunciatory, this is for you.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

cult classic,"This is in my mind exactly what this film will become. A few people like thinking of themselves as Sci-Fi fans, I do to, but I can't remember a time in the last few years when I have not been utterly bored by Sci-Fi Flicks, or when all i remember from the movie is some extended dramatic metaphor which at best should have been in a straight drama. District 9, has a message content which is best placed in the movie it is.(yet it is not soppingly dramatical, the action {which is par excellence Spec.Forces like} and the characters, which are well rounded serve as straight knives to tell the story with an emotional force ...which i cannot classify as 'foolishly generic') Living in a foreign country I miss South Africa ..it's diversity, and while others of more cultured states often look down on us, I was glad to see characters which come across with the force and the malignancy of these characters (showing to mass conscious that we SAs are on par) ...some spoke about comic relief. ..(& those who were over-critical of the movie, see in the element I am about to mention... only a message of anti-prejudice... i would argue that no such message is existent. honestly, what message is their in or current dealings with humans.. none, and so there is none in this movie).. these moments were in the Wikus characters mannerism and attitude, frequent swearing (foken, is like f***-en) and the police buddy type friends & eviction notices (aswell as the reports of alien crime, which were of-the-street guys talking about current crime...lol). Also, it was in the Nigerians, and there serious presence in the movie.(that was comic relief to me..not viewed as something ridicules or with a serious.. what info is this type manner).Cult Classic, because of the force of it's consideration (metaphor of types, what it makes us consider), and in-that it was cleanly cut beginning to end. I could not help thinking of the irony of an Alien Ship choosing South Africa... were else,.. how many different cultures are present there. and where else would an alien be treated with veracity... not god-like status, but with a common parity... i treat and think of u evenly even despite the VERBAL MOCKS (..people can say nothing of u and still treat u as a foreign entity)... ...so in my extreme metaphysical metaphor ...it was a karmic situation of the aliens going to the place where they'd best ""just be people""",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

It belongs in District 9 of IMDb,"I remember seeing Alive in Joburg three years ago, after I found out that Neill Blomkamp was going to direct the movie adaptation of Halo. I was impressed by the idea and hoped to, one day, see it adapted to the big screen.A year later, I was pleased to find out District 9 was in the making. For the next couple of years, I followed news of the movie with great interest. Finally, I got to see it last week. Disappointment?No, it was...awesome.I figured that I may have hyped myself out for this one or that the old ""i-hate-it-because-it's-popular-now"" beast was going to shed my skin; but District 9 delivered.It very much is a movie of many sides with the main themes being:Documentary - Action - Alien - HumanI was so impressed by the way that these four sides integrated into the movie. It's amazing how it moves from alien documentary, to human documentary, to human drama/action and, finally, to the alien story.The main character was great. A completely human anti-hero rather than an over-the-top marine hero or something. His physical changes are mirrored by his changes in perception of how things are; it's great character development. Also, he's very well-acted by Sharlto Copley - while the Academy may snub him, I think he is Oscar worthy in the eyes of many others.Blomkamp's experience with directing CGI really shows in this movie. He's at absolute ease with this kind of stuff and it's all rather believable - that's coming from someone who usually dislikes CGI in movies.My only main criticism was with the intro. I feel it could have been done a lot better as it felt a bit jarring.

District 8!,"District 9, a film directed Neill Blomkamp, has to be on your must-watch movie lists. It's like Aliens mixed with Transformers but a little bit better than both. The reason this movie stands out of the rest alien movies is mainly because it shows that we need to get along even if we are aliens or humans, District 9 is also a political film and that's one of the reasons why this lost one star from me. The aliens in this movie are not called aliens but instead they are called ""prawns"" because their characteristics and personality match those of a prawn. The action is mind blowing but at the beginning it's starts out boring and slow but then it runs smoothly and gives you a package of action and a cool story. The acting particularly from Sharlto Copley is more than exceptional and even though it's the second movie he has starred in, he gives one heck of a good act. Sharlto Copley's role is unique because he plays someone who is a fugitive human-alien on the run because he didn't like being tested on and together with his two prawn friends he has to cure himself. One of the reasons why this film lost a star from me is because during some scenes a interview will pop out of nowhere, like cloverfield.After being exposed to an alien material, a MNU agent is now being hunted by the government because his extraordinary skills can fire weapons made only for the aliens. He makes a strange friendship with a prawn and his son because they can help him cure his condition.A solid action flick is what you need when you are searching for a good movie.

Creative and involving film unfolding within this dystopian world full of aggression and hatred as an individual with a set task and existence is put through a wringer.,"District 9 is an exciting, raw and unflinching South African science fiction film; a piece that you feel is the result of years of studious work and hard graft finally come-good, work that has consequently broken into the world stage. If there was a reason to feel as if one was beginning to trawl through the latter stages of the The Lord of the Rings trilogy, whilst at the mercy of New Zealand born director Peter Jackson, then it might very well have been so that one might be able to observe District 9 some years later. The reason for the mentioning of Jackson and his trilogy of yester-year is that, by way of a South African film maker named Neill Blomkamp, whom himself with District 9 has revisited a 2005 short entitled Alive in Joburg, is that Jackson green-lit the bigger, broader project; consequently turning it into a smart; intelligent; engrossing sci-fi which is only mainstream entertainment in appearance but is also something far more interesting. With District 9; Blomkamp has shown himself to be a filmmaker able to run on ideas and creativity born out of his own mind, but apparently to be able to execute these ideas with an ability to draw in a mass audience; when linking him to other directors born out of the former British Empire, one might very much mention him in the same breath as his apparent mentor here in Peter Jackson or, and time will tell, even someone like James Cameron.But how does the film differ to any other space invaders-come-aliens landing from outer space piece? In the past, where intergalactic species have sought to destroy without mercy nor apparent reason; District 9 offers an eerily similar premise to proceedings but with an eye on developing this as a subplot around which their basing on planet Earth for twenty five odd years has already happened. A key scene from 1996's spectacle favouring, flag waving science fiction film Independence Day had a scene in which the incoming beasties inadvertently revealed their plan to us; one that revolved around going from planet to planet wiping out all traces of life, after which the rightful reaction ought to be: ""that just sounds a little bit......rubbish"". If ever there was a revisionist incoming beasties sci-fi action film in which said creatures felt, hurt and had personalities then District 9 is it. Although that statement itself raises a paradox some have brought about through 1990's Dances With Wolves, that while the Native Americans are deconstructed as the lead spends more time with them, the blood thirsty Apaches draw the short straw and stay as such. Most of the other aliens in this are these apparent dead brained, bug like creatures with an apparent ability for inter-galactic travel but remain quite primitive in attitudes and ideologies.The film sees a huge ship hover above Johannesburg, South Africa in 1982; a mission to board it revealing a near-dying breed of tall bug-like creatures whom are brought back to Earth and just placed out of the way in a slum. The script has fun with a more American infused attitude to this material, faux interviewees telling us it didn't happen to land over a large American city and that expecting ""bright, flashing lights"" wasn't out of the question in what it a reference to Spielberg's Close Encounters film; itself a piece about aliens arriving without initial intent to annihilate. Cut to September 2010, and the extraction of the now proclaimed 'prawns' from this ghetto is to be headed up by a certain Wikus Van De Merwe (Copley), nothing more then a desk jobber at the MNU organisation charged with infiltrating the slum with weapons wielding law enforcers and clearing them out to a new zone, of which is later referred to by Wikus as resembling a concentration camp. In Wikus, and later his cohort in a prawn named Christopher Johnson, is a thoroughly nourishing character study. The po-faced pacifist Wikus talks goofily into the camera the faux-documentary crew film him with as they follow him around extraditing the Prawns, as more battle hardened; trigger happy law enforcers seem content to shoot first, ask questions later. After years of Apartheid rule, blacks and whites-alike are now seemingly aligned with one another in battering and turfing out a new breed of organism in the most merciless possible fashion. Didn't anybody learn anything?The joy is in following Wikus' plight as he finds himself away from a previously well protected, bubbled existence, and accidentally sprays himself with a fluid Johnson had been storing in his shack, something that brings about the 'Prawnification' for that of whom it sprays, and the consequential falling apart of his life and alienation from his loving wife. Wikus' po-faced appearance gradually gives way as his body mutates and a visual sense of weary, bearded dishevelment settles in as he stands up to arms dealers and sheds his previous office laden image; a literal suiting up into this metallic, one man army suit nearer the end signalling the ultimate in this transition. Suddenly, solace can only be found in the Prawns and those he worked with, in the MNU, are after him for all sorts of sordid testing; the places of the respective characters' dwelling a routine but effective item used to highlight the distinction between the two: a plated shack and a large detached house. The film's premise and plot ideas revolving around chase and epiphanies are pretty standard, but are given leases of life and fresh interest through this lens of creativity. The film's antagonist is corruption: the enemies its lying media and conniving government with whom it operates; a skin headed, sadism revelling fascist mercenary taking the reigns as a physical villain towards the end; culminating in an unflinching look at a world full of hatred and rejection, in which the joy is watching people finding their psychological state torn and their physical identity in a disturbing process of transition.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The most original movie of the last decade.,"I cannot remember the last time I watched a movie that had me on the edge of my seat like this. I cannot remember the last time a movie gave me such a mixture of emotions. The story was not meant to be political, according to the director in interviews that can be found on the special features of the Blu-ray release. But you cannot help but feel drawn to how humans were treated in much the same way during the partide in Africa. The use of CGI is masterminded to absolute perfection, which is a lot to be said for a lot of so called Hollywood blockbusters these days. The cast and script were all top notch. As for those in the forums who have said about plot holes, i feel this movie was designed to be watched more than once. I certainly felt so!. After more than one viewing, all plot holes, if any, disappear into the atmosphere of the movie. A fantastic job all involved.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Quite an achievement,"This is a great action sci-fi movie. It's suspenseful as you don't know where the story is going. Because of the way it's shot and edited, it's pace is quick and it doesn't dwell on slow moments. It has great battle scenes, interesting weapons, curious creatures, and teases us with only a few glimpses of the alien world.While I'm easily annoyed by political agendas disguised as entertainment, the themes here lend themselves to various interpretations, not just the standard one about race that perhaps the writer had in mind. You can think of it in terms of the universal rotten human nature, or in terms of the animalistic will to dominate, or in terms of a post-9/11 militarized global agenda, of the complete integration of the military industrial complex with government and with the media, or the absurd obsession with weapons and the black market it fosters.This is the kind of movie that could have never been made in the US or handled in any way by Americans. Were this an American movie it would be full of Wagner-plagiarized orchestration, it would be offensively moralizing and condescending, the casting would have to fulfill bizarre quotas, a love story would occupy half of the time. Instead we get an action movie that is often funny, surprising, and no-nonsense.The special effects are outstanding. I was surprised to read that it's all CGI. It is rather humorous to watch aliens misbehaving pettily just the way humans do. The acting is good, although I suspect that the writer is to blame for the excessive portrayal of the main character's nerdyness. At some point several people are getting geared up for action and our main character, who looks like the guy from Revenge of the Nerds, has a giant calculator and pens in chestpockets over a bulletproof vest. I'm not sure the story is entirely solid. The more one thinks about it, the more holes one may find so it's best to just go with what we are given and not ask about what isn't said.Still, despite minor shortcomings, this movie is destined to a classic and I wouldn't mind sequels.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Great Sci-Fi Movie that doesn't try too hard,"District 9 is an awesome film. I feel like way too many movies (Sci-Fi especially) go to way too many lengths to try and explain themselves. Movies try to make their premise believable and give a sort of explanation like Jurassic Park of how everything happened. This rarely works. Also, many movies try to be like Star Wars and create a whole universe where every gun and creature and piece of technology is all explained and catalogued. This works for a few great films, but most that try end up boring you to death.District 9 simply blazes along at an intense pace where I don't care if certain things are explained or probable or add up because I am so caught up in the suspense and action of the current situation. On many movies like this, I might find myself saying things like ""No way! not possible"" and ""Yeah right"". But if the movie can keep your attention and focus on what's at hand, it can get away with little plot-holes just fine.Go in to this movie expecting just one thing: a great movie. It doesn't need a universe or video game adaption or sequel, just one good story. I feel this is exactly the type of movie that would make a terrible sequel. But who knows, Neill Blomkamp has a great style and could maybe pull it off. Lets hope if the rumors are true and he does do Halo that it goes as well as this.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A fresh and unique Sci-fi story,"District 9 does a fantastic job at showing the states of immigrants living in districts and slums and mashes it together beautifully with an interesting, engaging and unique sci-fi concept.From the start it shows very clearly the relationship between the humans and the prawns (the aliens are referred to as prawns), the prawns are the foreigners and therefore they should not be allowed to coexist with humans. Even by the organisations who are supposed to be there to help the prawns focus more on keeping the aliens in line rather than taking care of them as their goals are more focused on making a profit than preserving the prawns lives and technology.Generally the characters personalities are based around their occupations or political views and this could have easily come off as simplistic and unempathetic. However, the characters are all so well presented together and get just the right amount of screen time that they perfectly expresses not just theirs, but the entire world's opinions around the prawns, and that is all shown through the small handful of main characters.The cast are great as no one feels out of place or misused, even the smaller characters are played really well. However, Sharlto Copley's performance as the main character (Wikus Van De Merwe) is incredible and the real driving force behind this movie. He may come across as simplistic and predictable at the start, but as he is threatened and eventually hunted the desperation really starts to come through. As Wikus is continuously avoiding being hunted and captured, his increasingly complex mix of fear, paranoia, anger, desperation, etc. Is presented beautifully and makes it really inviting to invest in Wikus as a main character. Sharlto's delivery makes the experience of watching the film so much more exiting and intense as there is so much passion and commitment behind every scene.The political themes are almost uncomfortably realistic and present throughout the film, but they are not so intense that they become overbearing and annoying. The views of the public and the organisations involved help to set the tone for the film as well as helping in investing in the emotions of the main characters. As they are fighting against a remorseless organisation prioritised only about making a profit, without regard for human or prawn life.The story by Neill Blomkamp and Terri Tatchell is incredibly well done, nothing seems too far fetched or forced, and the way the characters are shown further help you to feel invested in the plot. The way that Neil Blomkamp directed the film helps convey the story in the best way possible and there is never a moment that feels like it could have been directed better. The characters, even the background characters, are engaging even when they don't have any dialogue, as no one feels out of place, or just there for the sake of it.If I had to criticize one aspect of the film it would be the shaky camera work. Generally the camera work is focused on tracking shots as well as adding found footage and interviews in a fake documentary style. This leads to the camera having a consistently shaky aspect, which fits perfect for the found footage elements and fight scene. However, that style is present throughout the film and for scenes where characters (particularly Wikus) are walking around or talking with other characters it almost feels over exaggerated.In summary, District 9 has an incredible story, cast and production. The directing is fantastic and perfectly expresses the feeling of the film and the characters. The ending, whilst hinting that there could have been a sequel, doesn't leave the audience feeling cheated. The story feels to have reached a natural and satisfying conclusion. Aside from a minor problem with the camera work this film is exceptional and unless you really can't stand sci-fi films, I see no reason as to why you wouldn't enjoy this and I highly recommend it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
District 9,"When I first saw District 9 back in 2009 at the theater, I was satisfied, it was the first time in a long time that I felt satisfied by a Sci-Fi movie, since The Matrix maybe. I must admit that these last 2 or 3 years have been great for the Sci-Fi genre. Though most of the recent Sci-Fi flicks are as elegant and well crafted as District 9.On the same year we had Avatar, Star Trek, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen and District 9, all of them visually impressive, yes, all of them good, almost. Avatar is a visual masterpiece that manages to stay entertaining for two and a half hours and Star Trek gave us such an interesting shift to the usual sluggish pace of the Star Trek movies, without losing content nor sense. Transformers: ROTF on the other hand is a trashy movie that does not deserve to share the same genre as the 2 before mentioned movies.And last but of course not least, the movie I am reviewing, District 9, it avoids the convetionalisms of trashy, cheesy Sci-Fi, by not giving us an attractive male lead with a perfect body and smile and flooding with altruism, instead we get a complex anti-hero, that is cruel at times, ignorant and even coward, that most of the time is looking for his own well being without thinking about others, it also avoids the conventionalism of having trashy, stupid, repetitive humor as well as a ''well known'' background location, like New York, Los Angeles, etc. It is decidedly original, from the background, to the lead character, to the premise and story, which are by far the best and strongest elements from the movie. For those who have already seen the movie, you know what I am talking about, but for those who haven't seen it, I won't spoil it, because, just as it pleasantly surprised me, I want you to be surprised by the freshness and originality of this film. Granted, some will say it was already been done, but not like this, not with this setting, not with these characters, not with such a coherent and well crafted script. You'll get the action and suspense we all appreciate from Sci-Fi, but you will also get a complex, realistic character development study, you'll find plenty of smart, interesting allegories and clever and even funny dialog and even very sweet romance if you are willing to understand.I've compared the movie to the contemporary Sci-Fi movies, because it is the easiest way to demonstrate that this is truly the Sci-Fi masterpiece of our times. Just one year later we got a Sci-Fi pretentious, overrated, incoherent movie by Christopher Nolan that claims to be a masterpiece, please avoid it, don't waste your money nor 2 and a half hours of your time, when you can enjoy of a true masterpiece with District 9, if you are a lover of clever, creative and original Sci-Fi, do yourself a favor and rent District 9, it is worth it.10/10 Superb acting, direction, photography, sound, visuals.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

District 9 - Very Cool,"It's refreshing to see a modern alien film that doesn't blow. If you're thinking about seeing ""District 9"", but remember the horrible experiences you had viewing the ""Day The Earth Stood Still"" or ""War Of The Worlds"" modern interpretations, don't be scared. It is nothing like that terrible, polished crap. D9 boasts a unique story that will draw you in while maintaining a very realistic feel. The special effects are top notch and the CGI interaction is spot on. At the risk of sounding like a nerd, the alien weaponry is very cool. The bits of humor don't take away from the serious atmosphere and you won't be bored by a single emotion for very long. It left me with a very old-school sci-fi feel. Definitely more of a ""dude"" flick however.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
See it.  Now.,"District 9 probably isn't what you think it is. If you've seen any of the trailers or recent TV spots for the film, one might expect that it's a slightly more intelligent version of Independence Day. Ominous shots of an alien mother ship hovering above Johannesburg have no doubt fueled speculation that this Neill Blomkamp/Peter Jackson collaboration is a movie that's strangely ""arthouse"" in its aspirations, which are awkwardly offset by the inclusion of what appears to be a fair amount of mainstream Hollywood-type alien/human warfare. Forget all that. It's a piece of cinema that's not flawless, but it's very close–it's a movie I could talk about all day, but it's something that you need to experience to truly appreciate.If you want my thesis, though, here it is: District 9 is an alien epic that's simultaneously exhilarating and affecting. Even though it occasionally surrenders to certain filmmaking and storytelling clichés, this is a must-see film for any fan of science fiction, and it's commentary on racism, prejudice, and the inherent violence found in all organic beings makes it, in a few brief, gut-wrenching moments, as thought-provoking as anything else out there.The aliens in this movie, known as ""prawns,"" were extracted from their ship by humans after it came to Earth and showed no signs of activity, floating quietly over South Africa, for a long period of time. It turns out that the prawn were malnourished, stranded, and didn't have anywhere else to go. Because of their large numbers (somewhere on the order of 1.5 million), it was decided that they be kept in a restricted area known as District 9 for their own well being.During an attempt to relocate the prawn, our protagonist, Wikus Van De Merwe, an employee of an organization titled Multi-National United (MNU), is accidentally sprayed in the face with a prawn biochemical. Soon, he starts having a really bad day (in true Peter Jackson fashion, I might add, that's directly reminiscent of one of his especially gory features–the classic Dead Alive). Before long, it's clear that the MNU has a more sinister motive for keeping the prawn in captivity, and the whole thing essentially becomes one long chase film (albeit a wonderfully crafted one).When the movie begins, the story unfolds in the form of a documentary, but, as the action is amped up, Blomkamp opts for the more traditional method of directing, and we're allowed to see things that could never be revealed via documentary. On the whole I think the decision to shift the mode the story is told in is a good one, but there are times where, in the middle of the action, the perspective reverts back to that of a documentary. When this happens, it often seems as if it's done for a sense of continuity–it doesn't really add anything to the story itself, and seems to be more of a stylistic decision. I suppose this is a minor gripe, but it can be a little distracting. I think the movie would've benefited from having a contained documentary placed exclusively at the beginning that explains the origin of the prawn–the random switch-back to the ""security camera/handycam"" view, especially in the heat of the action, could interrupt the trance District 9 will undoubtedly have you in. There are also one or two ""Hollywood"" moments that may have you rolling your eyes–especially when they're in stark contrast with the realism found at the beginning of the movie–but the story is so cleverly constructed and the transition into a more traditional mode of storytelling is so subtle that it ultimately shouldn't hinder most people's enjoyment of District 9. In fact, it will make a movie that could've been alienating–please forgive the horrible pun–accessible for a wider audience that might otherwise be put-off by the unusual approach Blomkamp initially takes in terms of telling this particular story.In light of all that District 9 accomplishes, the minor flaws I've just referenced almost completely disappear. The attention to detail, for example, in the movie is staggering; everything from the prawn technology (you can see the moving parts in each and every weapon) to the strikingly human emotion incorporated into the beautifully rendered CGI creatures will mesmerize you. Blend this with some strong acting from Sharlto Copley and the universal theme of bigotry (and how it's handled) and you'll see why many critics have praised this as the best piece of sci-fi to come along in quite some time.So, despite my nitpicking, I absolutely loved this movie. It's an almost flawless piece of sci-fi cinema–it's emotionally engaging, thought provoking, and is filled with original, jaw-dropping technology and action. I want so badly to comment on how much I loved the ending, too, and what it suggestsbut I won't do that because I would be doing District 9 a severe disservice. The only way to appreciate this movie is to get out of your chair and go see it. Now.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Interesting enough,An unusual fiction movie story. A star ship from another planet comes above earth and stands above Johannesburg. Aboard there are hundreds (or thousands) of aliens not on a very good physical shape who are taken off and installed on a closed camp on the outskirts called District 9. These aliens' figures are conceived as half human half insects but their images are extremely well conceived in visual terms and with great and good fancy imagination. And they have an almost human behaviour. However after more than 20 years their relationship with the local inhabitants begins to degrade itself and the supervising department of the alien population decides that they must be evicted to a camp a few hundreds of miles away from the city. It's when the situation becomes complicated first because of the aliens' resistance to eviction and then because the man appointed as the operation chief becomes contaminated with a fluid that begins to transform him into an alien which leads to make him almost as a danger for the human community being treated and chased as so. This could be a good movie of this kind if it weren't for some not well explained images and sequences even in terms of fiction that we could then take for granted. Anyway it's a movie interesting enough to be seen.,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Politically Correct, it's a great film - realistically it isn't","I could imagine following scenario: Producer: ""How did you like the film?"" Critic: ""This piece of crap is the shoddiest, plagiarizing"" Producer: "" it's an allegory about apartheid, by the way."" Critic stops dead in his tracks: "" most amazing, beautiful movie I have ever seen! 10 Points!""I don't know, perhaps age makes suspicious but I tend to approach movies where the largest part of the poster says, ""Celebrity X presents a Y movies"" with suspicion. Say, for example, if the poster exclaims ""Quentin Tarantino presents a movie by director so-and-so"", it's a virtually guarantee that the movie is guano. (Same goes for film-posters where the directors' name is spelled bigger than the actual title but that's another story).So, what we got here? You're average run of the mill science fiction flick (of course PRESENTED BY PETER JACKSON!) that does a whole lot of borrowing.Did I just say borrowing? Pardon me; I'm having too kind a day. Let's call the rose by its name then and call it outright stealing. Why, surely very few people have ever heard off or seen David Cronenbergs ""The Fly"" or ""Aliens"" or ""Robocop""? ""Rambo"", ""Transformers"", ""E.T."" or even ""Dance with the wolves"", who'd every notice a young aspiring director 'borrowing' from such obscure flicks? But perhaps I'm reading too much into the film and those little borrowed moments are pure coincidence – and perhaps PETER JACKSON, who PRESENTS this film, has simply missed those parts.To be honest, after having seen uncounted war world 2 and apartheid dramas, watching another SA apartheid film (even if it's thinly veiled as science fiction) provoked the same sentiment as watching another apologetic German movie about Hitler: utter boredom sets in. Alright, we all got it: apartheid was wrong, a great crime against humanity and all that  now, could we get on with something fresh, please? Pretty please?But let's speak about the main-factor of the film: it's being PRESENTED BY PETER JACKSON! What makes this a Jackson film? Well, primarily gore – which is a good thing if you have a taste for cinematic gore but the blood and entrails here are obviously and painfully computer animated, it leaves the watcher with the same expression a meat-connoisseur might have after being presented with a tofu burger. Plus, there's a scene where a soldier is hit by a flying sheep – if that isn't a tribute to New Zealand, I don't know what is.I'd give a couple of points but only because that is one of the few South African science fiction movies, so here goes for the exotic factor. Not to mention a bonus-point because this film was PRESENTED BY PETER JACKSON!Oh, did I mention that this film was PRESENTED BY PETER JACKSON? You know PETER ""Lord of the Rings"" JACKSON? Now go run off, buy the DVD, buy the Blue-Ray and don't forget to dig in for the merchandize – or save your cash for a better flick.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Refreshing,"It has been a while since I've been able to enjoy a modern movie that included special effects. Thanks to its believable plot and very convincing acting the last thing I realized about this movie was that it had CG characters. I am a confessed hater of modern films and proud of it. That being said I liked this movie very much.None of the scenes were unnecessary, they all had a purpose to further the story. All of the actors displayed both sides of the human conditions accurately. The movie had just enough grim and adult situation to keep you interested without offending anyone.I applaud the use of actors that are not currently over saturated. For me nothing ruins a movie more than to see a guy I've just seen in 10 other films playing a character which is essentially himself in full make up. Next on the list to ruin an artsy film is shaky-cam!

Watch the Damn Thing Already,"I enjoyed District 9 immensely.I'm not a film critic nor will I try to pretend to be one on IMDb. I just love film. I've even written, produced, and directed a few.

So many novel adaptations and defiling remakes are really showing what a cesspool America has for screen writing talent. District 9 soars above the majority of dull, stagnant films being mass produced week after week here in the states.I don't know how it's gotten this bad, but it's terrible. I have to wait several months, sometimes years before leaving theater saying, ""Wow, what a great story!"". Most of the time I find myself trying to point out the pros of a film like, ""That had some cool effects"" or ""The acting was really good"" or ""I really liked that character"". I want more movies like District 9, while not perfect, still have me leaving the theater satisfied on many more levels than one.Original, entertaining, stylistic, thrilling, while delivering an important message all at once, District 9 accomplished a lot more with a budget half the size of stale, re-heated Blockbuster attempts (i.e. King Kong, The Wicker Man, The Day the Earth Stood Still....all remakes) Stop giving these mindless, unimaginative writers and filmmakers money and go see films like District 9, PLEASE!!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

I think that even if everyone have the spirit of self-sacrifice, people who can be transferred to real action is limited. I think ""discrimination"" and ""prejudice"" are the theme of this movie.

"A riveting, original and exceptional sci-fi movie","District 9 absolutely outstanding in almost every respect. Telling the tale of an atypical alien invasion, the plot fitted the documentary style of direction perfectly and was gripping right from the opening scenes. The story was truly original with a fascinating twist on the typical War of the Worlds/Independence Day modern sci-fi movie. It was remarkable, gripping and thought-provoking, which I believe is becoming increasingly rare in modern cinema.District 9 avoids modern clichés such as fast-paced plotting and relentless over-editing, instead focusing on plot and character development with a superb dose of action to conclude the film. The film, set in South Africa, features an entirely South African cast of unknowns but was particularly well performed. The score was excellent and was appropriately avoided in the more documentary-style segments of the film to offer a more realistic tone. Similarly, the direction, particularly of the action sequences, was superb; this is even more impressive considering the relatively small budget of the film.Every once in a while, but not very often, I come out of the cinema feeling truly stunned by a movie. For the fist time in 2009, this happened to me after watching District 9. I struggle to pick out any significant flaws in this movie and I thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of it.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
District 9 - The Review,"So here we are, yet another film about aliens visiting Earth. Big, vaguely-threatening, city-size flying saucers? Check. Ray guns? Check. Funny-looking, insect-like fellas? They're there too. And it's fair to say that if you've any experience with science fiction, you'll be able to guess most of the early plot twists – what the goo does, what's up with his fingernails, and so on.But the promos were right, this is different. There's no all-American, wise-cracking, chisel-jawed hero; instead we have a bureaucrat whose accent I believe is called 'Afrikaans,' who isn't actually all that nice, despite his disconcertingly chirpy introduction. I mean, he's okay, but he also threatens people, swears like a docker, and mainly acts in his own best interests – sometimes at the cost of a smooth and early plot resolution.And yet...it works. If we were in that situation, we'd probably do the same. I'm fairly surely I would. He's the kind of dysfunctional anti-hero that the writers of 'Hancock' could only dream of. This angle, along with the general feeling of dread and depravity throughout, had me believing we were headed for an unhappy ending, something I very rarely suspect. The kind of ending that says: 'See how crap you all are? Here's what you get.' I won't tell you if I was right, but the conclusion was another thing I liked about 'District 9'...it wasn't a clear-cut thing, there were definitely shades of grey. Though the very last scene was a little bit corny for my tastes, especially considering the intense emotional roller-coaster that preceded it.Have I mentioned the ending, without discussing the actual plot? Whoops! The main plot hook, and the idea behind it, is definitely a smart one – you can see how Peter Jackson (the producer) was brought on board. Aliens become stranded on Earth, possibly in the late eighties (the film states they have been here twenty years), and end up hovering over Johannesburg. Once 'rescued' from the ship, they find themselves living in a slum, sleeping under bits of cardboard, harassed by stereotypical African crime lords, and generally having a lousy time. There are moments when the aliens/immigration issues combination feels a bit forced, and there are significant chunks of the film where the humans seem so evil it's just ridiculous; but these weren't serious problems. For the most part, my disbelief was suspended.One of the ways they achieved this (or tried to) was through use of classic 'cinema verité' techniques, such as shaky cameras, and fake interviews. To be honest though, that aspect didn't really work for me. Some reviewers liked the 'sparing' use of the technique, but you could also call it inconsistent – they were heavy on the 'fake documentary' stuff at the beginning, then forgot about it completely, before picking up again...then dropping it. And it came back at the end. For some reason this ticked me off. Maybe the style is just getting old, they've been doing this sort of thing in science fiction since 'Firefly' (and by the way, they totally stole the ship design, for the smaller alien ship, from that show. You'll see.) The fake interviews made for some good foreshadowing of the main character's fate, but were only very tenuously linked to the rest of the footage. Those parts just seemed like leftovers from a bad TV movie.The special effects, however, were extremely satisfactory. The lead alien ('played' by Jason Cope) was brilliantly realised, surprisingly full of expression, one of the most convincing CG-character-in-a live-action-film's that I've seen. This made his interactions with the human lead the high point of the movie, turning into a very realistic (and actually, quite touching) friendship. The mothership looks fantastic, and having it floating there in almost every outdoors shot works really well as a 'motif,' a reminder of the issues and problems that metaphorically hover over the city.The only bad special effects come as a ridiculous one-two punch...a man in a sentry tower explodes like a balloon full of jam, and suddenly a pig is fired out of a cannon. Seriously. I laughed. I'm not a gore lover, and there is a fair bit in the film, but I'm pleased to report I didn't have to look away once – not like when I didn't see the entire second hour of 'Sweeney Todd.' The gore wasn't just there for the sake of it, and it was done with a bit of taste. The sets were fantastic, though apparently they saved a lot of time by shooting most of it in a recently-abandoned existing slum – so perhaps they shouldn't get too much credit for that.So, to wrap things up. If you've remained unspoiled, I can definitely recommend a trip to see 'District 9', there is a great deal of tension and excitement all the way through. I went in expecting it to be a bit preachy, but it actually wasn't – though there are a couple of problems with the narrative style, particularly the unusual and contradictory mish-mash of techniques. They may make more sense on a second viewing, but for me they came close to spoiling my 'immersion' in the world of the film, which is particularly irritating as it was meant to have the opposite effect! All in all, I give this film a prawn-tastic three out of five.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Showing your ignorance,"All the negative feedback here about this movie has one underlying feature - ignorance. It seems that the brain-dead critics have no idea of what this movie is all about. The story is so ""unrealistic"" huh? Well,if you know South African social history and the forced removal of black people from District 6 in Cape Town during the 1960s (check out ""District 6"" on Wikipedia), you'd know that this plot is a parody of very ""real"" events which happened. Do a bit of research before you shoot off your mouth. Remember, it is better to be thought a fool than to open your mouth and remove all doubt! Sure, the ""transformer"" ending unfortunately slips into Hollywood sci-fi shlock, but that is the beauty of this film. It is a blended product which combines real history, sociologiocal perspectives of ""the other"", commentary on the nature of man,amazing CGI and blockbuster effects, together with the tastelessness of Hollywood. In fact it contains everything you could ever want in a movie. But if you are ignorant of the basic plot, it all means nothing to you, as most ignorant morons don't appreciate anything.

District 9 (2009),"Directed by Neill Blomkamp. Starring Sharlto Copley, Jason Cope, David James, Vanessa Haywood, Mandla Gaduka, Louis Minnaar, William Allen Young, Eugene Khumbanyiwa, Robert Hobbs, Kenneth Nkosi, Marian Hooman. (R)Ambitious, allegorical science fiction film presents a Johannesburg that houses (imprisons) a large group of aliens that arrived on Earth a few decades earlier inside a large, walled district that has the appearance of ghetto slums in a warzone. Presentation of xenophobia through apartheid parallels is on the nose enough to be heavy-handed, but it's still a good message, ripe for blistering commentary that shines through the more thoughtful first act, less so during the action-heavy final act. Copley's irresponsible diplomat is an unlikable protagonist who doesn't particularly earn redemption, but at least the characterization shakes off the easy mantle of the ""white savior"" device. Creative and well-mounted production, assembled in a style that mixes faux-documentary talking heads, found footage, and traditional filmmaking; it's just a shame that they didn't follow through on those sharp, funny and tragic early scenes that held the promise of greatness. Based on director Blomkamp's short film ""Alive in Joburg.""72/100",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A very gritty and compelling sci-fi story.,"District 9 is different. There's no doubt about that. The premise is not totally original, but it feels fresh enough to prevent the audience from feeling they're watching a retread. It's also very smart, very exciting and visually arresting. Like some of the best science-fiction stories of all time, it actually has something to say, and it stimulates the mind instead of killing it. Is what Transformers 2 would have wanted to be - yes, there's even a fight sequence in District 9 involving a big robot and it's a thousand times better than anything present in Michael Bay's movie - and what most sci-fi movies should be. Granted, I guess a lot of people - especially teenagers - will hate it because it doesn't follow the usual rules of ""summer blockbusters"", but it matters not. Although it's got its share of action and special effects, this is by no means a typical Hollywood blockbuster, and I thank director Neil Blomkamp and producer Peter Jackson for that.District 9 is an interesting motion picture. During the majority of its considerable running time, the film is constructed as a mockumentary, with interviews with ""experts"" and even the protagonist's family being intercut with the actual events of the movie. And the actual events are shot and cut in a very ""in your face"" kind of manner, with a particular sequence - that in which Wilkus is infected - being the most obvious example. (The cameraman is an actual character.) Fortunately, the camera-work is not as shaky as in, say, Cloverfield, and the technique never really turns into a gimmick. Actually, Blomkamp's gritty, realistic approach works wonderfully, giving the movie a sense of verisimilitude that adds some gravitas to the proceedings. It makes the viewer feel like part of this world.A lot must be said too about the film's special effects, which add to the feeling of realism instead of detracting from it. Simply put, they are top-notch, something that is quite surprising considering the film's modest budget of $30 000 000. The aliens' design is effective, and although they were all created in a computer, there wasn't a single moment in which I thought they were digital creations instead of palpable characters. The few action sequences the film provides with are all pulse-pounding and expertly shot - Michael Bay should definitely watch this movie -. (Consider the finale involving the giant, alien robot, for example.) Most importantly, though, the effects never call attention to themselves, and they make an appearance because they are needed, not because the filmmakers wanted to craft a CGI stravaganza.Clearly, the film's tone is not very optimistic or cheerful, but that goes with the material. After all, it present a world in which aliens are ""greeted"" with discrimination and greed, and every good intention humankind could have had before is quickly disappearing. From a visual point of view, Blomkamp conveys this with a very gritty, almost black-and-white cinematography - this is a very bleak world in which people - and aliens - get all bloody, messy, dirty and even killed. On the other hand, although most people might think they ""should"" root for Wilke, things aren't as simple as they look. The way Blomkamp makes the viewer see things is very interesting - Wilke is not a ""bad"" man, but since he does things that look as terrible as anything done by a stereotypical movie villain, one doesn't really know if he's a protagonist worth rooting for or not. Maybe that's why the aliens - especially Christopher Johnson - were given a humanoid look and human-like mannerisms. Considering how they are treated, one should expect to feel sympathetic for them.Still, compared to how scientists and greedy company CEOs are portrayed, Wilke is almost an angel. After all, there's still some humanity left in him - he has a a wife that he loves, for example -, and he becomes even more humane during the last few scenes, even though he suffers a transformation that, in theory, should make him less of a human. If anything, the movie shows how people can be overridden by greed and xenophobia and that, ultimately, they would care more about money and power than the human - or alien - condition. The worst thing about this is that, if aliens ever visit out planet, there are more chances of us treating them like they are treated in the movie, than of being all benevolent and peaceful. One only has to give a brief look to any history book to find proof of this.District 9 won't make anyone feel happy or joyful, but that's beside the point. It's a very compelling movie that works in both a visceral and intellectual level, and that should be enjoyed by any ""serious"" science fiction aficionado. It's got some exciting actual sequences, amazing special effects and a very well-thought premise but, most importantly, it also has an interesting - and sadly plausible - message about humanity. The film's ending is also something of a set up for a sequel, but unlike other movies, it doesn't feel neither incomplete nor unsatisfying. I, for one, would certainly like a sequel to be made, although I have no idea of how Blomkamp could continue telling his story in such a believable and ""in-your-face"" kind of way. No matter. As it is, District 9 is one of the best sci-fi movies I've seen in some time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Refreshing take on sci-fi, with a disappointing third act.","District 9 has today been out for 6 years, yet when I finally saw it, it was nothing like what I had thought it was all these years. I am so pleased to see that the alien sub-genre within science fiction has not completely stagnated (I'm guessing the Transformers-movies give this genre a bad name).The first thing I noticed about District 9 was its style of narrative. It starts in a mockumentary-like narrative, which Blomkamp slowly abandons through the movie's progression, for better or worse. I wouldn't mind so much if it wasn't for the fact that he stands by the hand-held camera-work, which is a personal pet peeve of mine. Either way, I can't remember the last time I saw science fiction try something new when it comes to form. This is very refreshing, it's neatly done and it draws you in closer to the story.The first half of the movie was MINDBLOWING! I especially loved the not-too-subtle critique on racism and the treatment of refugees. What Blomkamp does here is what sci-fi is ought to always do; reflect our problems in society by mirroring it in different creatures or worlds. Also, everything that Wikus went through kept me in complete awe, despite the clichés. Copley's acting was on point and his scenes were gut-wrenching like nothing other, to the point where I had to hold someone's hand to continue watching.Sadly, however, the second half of the movie, especially the third act, results in rather epic, grand, macho-pumping action. It's not necessarily dull or badly orchestrated, but I felt like it was too simple for such a grand opening.District 9 is definitely worth a view, and I wouldn't mind it becoming a sci-fi classic. In its genre, it truly stands out. If I could give it 7,5 stars, that would be my vote.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Best Moral-Sci-Fi in Years......,"I had no idea what I was in for when I watched this movie.

Though its setting does lend a certain desperation to the work of the DAF. (Dept. of Alien Affairs.The protagonist's acting is Oscar Worthy IMO.

A wildly original tour-de-force that needs to be seen to be believed,"District 9 is perhaps the best science fiction film since The Matrix. Startling words for a little film out of South Africa with a mostly untested cast and crew, but it is doubtful that the phrase will be contested by many.Going in knowing very little is key to the success of this enigmatic masterpiece of contemporary cinema. Blending techniques from the schools of cinéma vérité and avant-garde, District 9 details an alternate history of the world where a spaceship lands in South Africa in the 1980s. Its occupants, some 1-million-plus aliens, are given refugee status and forced to live in a shanty town fenced off from most of the human population.Using government official Wilkus Van De Merwe (first time actor Sharlto Copley) as the central character of the film, District 9 jumps between being a faux documentary loaded with expert interviews, hand-held camera footage and security camera footage, to a gritty, dystopic allegory mixing in elements of Apartheid, big business and even Nazi Germany. But through seamless editing, the major jumps are barely noticeable. While some films find it hard to move from style to style without feeling jarring or blatantly forced, District 9 manages to find a masterful way of movement that feels all too natural (much like Danny Boyle's Oscar-winning Slumdog Millionaire).It is because of this wildly original motif that District 9 stands out as such an amazing piece of film-making. Low budget miracles aside, the film plays out unlike anything you have ever seen. It is truly a unique and original film. Using the relatively untapped documentary style narrative for the majority of the film, the method of storytelling here is so powerful that one wonders why no one else has ever thought to make a film like this before. Doing away with complexities, it is so simple it almost pains me to think that some people just will not get it. In a decade littered with films that ape off of significantly better films or just feel stale altogether, here is a small film that is so wildly off the grid that it practically demands to be seen to be believed.I mention some not being able to grasp the story and ideologies director Neil Blomkamp is putting forth because the film is undeniably and unapologetically anti-Hollywood. There is no flare of contemporary glamour, no big name actors or crew members (outside of producer Peter Jackson), no Transformers-style big budget effects; nothing that screams contemporary American studio-produced cinema. But at the same time, it does not feel like a low budget indie or a foreign produced festival film. It feels like it is one-of-a-kind, a starting point for a breed of experimental film-making. Films like Children of Men, Cloverfield and United 93 have used the stylistic and experimental means of cinéma vérité to their advantages over the past few years and stand out as uniquely made films. But District 9 is the first film in a very long time that really harnesses the medium as an experiment, and succeeds at being so unlike anything that has been released for the entirety of 2009.Being so low budgeted, one would think that the special effects would not be nearly as well done as a film like Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen or Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince. But rather surprisingly, this film has a sense of epic grandeur that begins with a shot of the alien spacecraft near the opening of the film, and never fades away. So much is done with so little that the story of its production practically begs to be taught in film schools immediately. The aliens, or 'prawns' as they are referred to, are so realistic and lifelike that some shots look even better than those heavily budgeted films. They even have their own language, inexplicably understandable to humans, but so easily used here that it is a great special effect all on its own. Some of the makeup effects are simply astounding for how authentic and terrifying they look. And when the film saunters into being fairly violent, the horrific depictions on-screen are almost too genuine. District 9 is so polished and so seamlessly edited that one wonders why every movie does not look nearly as well done as this one.The acting, as untested and improvised as it is, is strong across the board. Everyone feels natural in their roles, and never once do we question their acting abilities. Copley is the clear standout of the picture, expressing a multitude of emotions every chance he gets. You would never know this is his first role with just how much effort and ease he appears to be giving. I can only hope we will see more of him in the future.The film has too few faults (outside of a few minor plot holes) that it almost feels criminal to mention them. There are a few character motives and perspectives that feel off in the final act of the film. They do not ruin the greatness of the final product, but they do detract from it. And while the film's running time practically soars by, there are more than a few things that seem a little too glossed over. A good movie always leaves you wanting more, but there were a few too many points that went unanswered that easily could have been explained in a piece of dialogue. It is a minor quibble, but nonetheless takes away from the film.Imperfections aside, District 9 is one hell of a ride from start to finish. Some may be turned off by its style, but the film is such a great piece of art that any fan of the medium owes it to themselves to see this film. It is easily one of the best films of the year. Now, do not ruin it with a sequel!9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Kitchen sink scifi allegory ... but it works,"As an allegory for all refugees (particularly the Palestinians), there's certainly nothing original about ""District 9"". The plot includes elements of ""Alien Nation,"" ""The Fly,"" ""Robocop,"" ""E.T.,"" and, of all things, ""Laserblast"" and ""A.L.F."". Sharlto Copley plays his bungling bureaucrat as a mix of Steve Martin's ""Inspector Clouseau,"" Jonathan Pryce's ""Sam Lowry"" and Linda Hamilton's ""Sarah Connor"" in ""The Terminator"". At first I had trouble Copley's performance; then, I realized it was key to caring about his character's fate.The cinema verite used in ""District 9,"" while effective, was much better executed in ""Cloverfield;"" which is, also, a much better movie. Nonetheless, ""District 9"" works well. I give it a ""7"" out of ""10"".",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
dismally unoriginal,"One of the first sci-fi films I ever saw was a story of a space craft that lands just outside a small, country town in England. When it is discovered, the town's people, who are very superstitious, eventually greet their visitor (a very old, human-like alien) and then proceed to beat it to death. . . the end. That film's premise is the gist of District 9.English subscripts for alien-speak reminded me of Star Wars. Star Wars didn't try to be provocative. District 9 did, but failed. It is too common for film makers today to treat their audiences as immature. Such gimmicks remind me I'm watching a movie and that the film maker took the easy way in story telling. Communication of ideas can be achieved with imagery alone. The alien mentioned above never said a word, but we understood him nonetheless.(Have since actually seen the film. Much better than I blindly conceived it to be. And I understand the productions logic for using subtitles. Much more original than I believed it to be.)",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A good premise that slightly drifts,"Starting as a mockumentary about the arrival of aliens to South Africa, the film is a clever take on the problems of immigration and the issues facing integration of different societies. The main actor portrays the pen pushing Wikus with the charm that should be attributed to a mid level bureaucrat. He enjoys his job, he has a beautiful wife and he's just trying to get on with his life, despite the fact that most of the people he works with see him as a mid level bureaucrat. Without his performance this film could have been a lost cause, yet his emotions keep the film together. Filmed in South Africa, there are clips of people on the streets that are reminiscent of apartheid videos from the eighties, and the activities of the Nigerians in the film resonated with South African colleagues. This could have been a more accessible way to deal with race and culture to a generation for whom apartheid is in the history books. Then you have the second part of the film. The aliens have weapons that make human weapons look like catapults, and the producers are not afraid to show them off - in all their visceral fury - making the latter part of the film more like a horror film. Yes, the violence may be needed, it just feels over done to the point of comedy (think the 1987 Robocop). If this film is about apartheid, then this violence is simply scaled; one man against the system, using the weapons at his disposal to make a difference (as opposed to many people with smaller weapons). Yet, that also sits at odds with the helpless nature the aliens portray through out the film. They're shown as starving and cowed by the humans, but they're physically stronger than the humans and there doesn't look to be any indications there was any struggle when they landed. Yes, the aliens could probably have taken over the planet with their fire power, yet at the same time it shows the humans to be more monstrous than the visitors. An entertaining film, with some hard hitting messages and the expectation of a sequel",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Should have taken the Oscar for best picture.,"Let me just say up front that District 9 is a great movie. I'm not sure what influence Peter Jackson had here, as he's listed as a producer and not a director, but someone deserves a lot of credit. On paper, District 9 sounds like Saturday matinée throw-away nonsense. In reality, it is a movie with subtle storytelling, a griping plot, great action, and superb effects. The characters are driven not by silly Hollywood archetypes but believable motivations. I found myself looking down on the aliens, revolted by the aliens, and then cheering for the aliens. The main character is a schmuck, he's selfish, he's a coward...but the movie did a great job putting me in his shoes, making me empathize with him and understand him. The faux documentary style adds to the film and never detracts. Even the hand-held ""shaky"" camera style that I usually dislike was used expertly here.The best science fiction often hides a powerful message behind a fantastic facade. The message here goes beyond the ham-fisted environmental simplicity found in Avatar. It also goes well beyond the apartheid analogy everyone likes to pretend that they noticed on their own. It's a movie about xenophobia, about becoming something you fear, and about the treatment of those we consider inferiors. There are overtones of First World vs Third World and themes of cultural corruption and decay.Plus, District 9 stands up pretty well as a shoot 'em up, sci-fi action, monster movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Original, but not perfect","Today, originality is rare, especially in the sci-fi genre. When we look at the wonderful blockbusters of recent days, such as Inception, we begin to notice a pattern: almost all major science-fiction films fundamentally have been made, albeit slightly differently, before. In Inception's case we can consider The Matrix, from which many major ideas have been recycled.Maybe, in District 9, we have something different. In a realistic story that focuses on the politics of an alien invasion as much as the action, I found myself watching a story somewhat unlike any that I had ever seen, in which morals, the true ideas behind characters and who to support in a non-binary are not necessarily clear.Sharlto Copley gives a strong, charismatic and believable take on the character 'Wikus'. This main character is not overly likable but not annoying. However, this is not the brilliance of the characterisation: the character goes on a physical and mental arc, in which his moral compass, ideas and form are changed in numerous ways. These changes make the character brilliantly compelling and watchable.The design of the aliens are also a positive of the film: they look strong but not wholly evil, which is representative of their place in the story. However, one must question in a film where most aspects seem realistic, whether this design is to be believed, and the answer is, unfortunately, no. The aesthetics of these aliens are too humanoid for the audience to believe that they developed outside of our world, and the idea that they can survive here without any side-effects is overly convenient.It is this convenience in which I believe the film is flawed. The plot may be the film's greatest asset, in the fact that it is original, but it is also its weakness, as the ridiculous coincidences of some events can distract from the aspect of realism that the film otherwise maintains.The plot, unfortunately, wasn't the only weakness of the film. For a sci-fi action movie, the action seemed somewhat lacking in creativity; it never looked as though it was going to advance past the stage of immature and unnecessary violence - like people getting blown to smithereens with alien laser guns - and this gives it a painful Michael-Bayesque feel. I wish there were more scenes of exciting hand-to-hand combat of the likes that we saw in 2014's greatest (in every sense of the word) flop Edge of Tomorrow, or 2010s Inception, which certainly was not a flop in any way. To me, it seems a tragedy that these films were not sufficiently recognised by the academy, whereas District 9 (the admittedly inferior film) was.When we see originality, we must forgive its overly convenient plot and the frustratingly uninventive fight scenes, and focus on what is a surprisingly political story with an interesting message.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

WOW! A winner!,"Director and co-writer Neill Blommkamp has a winner on his hands. It has been a long time since I have seen a movie that was so enjoyable. I am a science fiction fan and District 9 delivers. After their spaceship become stranded hovering above Johannesburg South Africa. A million desperate aliens, are stranded for twenty years in a refugee camp called district 9. Prawns as they are called live in poverty scavenging trash in the wastes of the district. Wikus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Copley) is a government functionary in charge of moving more than a million alien refugees from their camp in district nine to a new facility 200 miles away is the protagonist. He comes across as both a competent civil servant and unaware dupe. (Elisa and I did have a conversation about how in the know Wikus actually is. They needed to make him sympathetic while still showing that he disregarded the aliens as much as anyone else.) He an everyone else seems racist towards the aliens. The callous nature of the approach to moving them re enforces the relationship. They are not human nor are they seen as equal or intelligent. A very interesting juxtaposition considering that their technology is so much more advance than ours. In fact there are governments and multinational corporations searching for a way to use the weapons from the aliens. Unfortunately they are bio engineered and only the aliens can use them. Shot in a style of gathered video it could have been slicker but I do think that the found footage approach did not take too much away from the story.The rest of the plot centers around Wikus and what happens to him while moving the aliens. He finds a cylinder of black liquid and when it accidentally sprays him things start to change for him. I do not want to give away any more of the plot. Go see this movie!I will say though, that the tension and action of this film grows from that point on. It transforms into a very good action film and is a great ride.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A fantastic allegory – and an allegorical fantasy.,"Imagine an alien inter-galactic space ship arriving above one of the major cities of the world. Wait – that was already done in The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951). There's nothing like sticking to a good formula, though...In this story, however, the world doesn't stand still; instead, the space ship does, hovering, blocking out the sun over a major portion of the city (in this case, Johannesburg) and, no doubt, interrupting the tanning efforts of many would-be sun worshippers. No matter, because the poor aliens' ship is broken, and its crew descends to earth for help – only to be corralled into alien ghettos by downright unfriendly humans who just treat them like, well, sub-humans. Now, just why the aliens – called prawns by the alienist humans – allow themselves to be so imprisoned is poorly explained. But, that's part of the delicious allegory, however.Essentially, the movie opens with a private company – MRU – beginning the process of getting all those no good aliens off their butts, outta those slum dwellings and outta sight into to some other corral 250 kilometers away from the city, and – let's face it – outta the way of the humans too...From that point, the satire is poured on, thick and fast, as the hero – some would say jerk – in charge, Wikus van der Merwe (Sharlto Copley) sees the eviction and transportation scheme going to pieces when other factions muscle in with more permanent ideas – like, death for the aliens, for instance. By the end of a bad day for Wikus, a worse one for the bad guys, and a cornucopia of crunching collisions between machines, men, and aliens, the viewer might be left drenched in the sweat of excitement – but, thankfully, not in the gory blood, body parts and guts that are liberally thrown about and which often spatter the camera lenses. All good fun, hey...For me, the best part about the film is the comedy supplied by Wikus as he tries to save the day – for himself, largely – and the unintended (?) hilarity of the fight sequences between the bad humans and the good aliens. Talk about over the top gore mixed with humour: Nightmare on Elm Street is kid's stuff by comparison. Hang on, Nightmare is kid's stuff...Oh, well, while on the topic of other movies, you should know that District 9 slavishly copies species metamorphosis from The Thing (1984) and The Fly (1986), powerful weaponry similar to that in the latest Terminator offering, and gallons of gore from the Predator series. So, all in all, Distruct 9 – sorry, District 9 is a pretty darned good action flick. Technically, it's very good too: doing for $30 million what cost Cameron's backers $300 million for his Avatar adventure, but without the 3D, of course. And, while on Avatar, you'll note distinct motivational similarities between Wikus in District 9 and the marine hero Jake in Cameron's epic; and you'll also see the organic/machine merge – as in Avatar – to let rip the ultimate intelligent killing machine. The cinematography, CGI and editing all meld to great effect for a frenetic, and often funny, 112 minutes.In sum, as pure escapist entertainment it's an interesting film, with an even more interesting semi-documentary structure to it at the beginning and the end. Hence, overall, I'd recommended it to those who like to see something different in sci-fi – and combining a not-so-subtle message about intolerance, which, as some would know, has been the subject of cinema ever since D. W. Griffith made Intolerance in 1916.Plus ça change, plus c'est la même chose, as the French say.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Witty, but Repetitive in Set Design","District 9 is a well liked movie due to its intense and hard hitting approach to social interactions with alien species, and I agree it's the film's strongest suit. Director Neill Blomkamp also aided by Peter Jackson bring experience and competence to its execution despite the location work being extremely dull.Sharlto Copley is perfect for the role, bringing a degree of shock and realism. David James is convincing with just enough humanity to make him believable.The highlight of the movie is by far the amazing alien creatures brought to life through top tier special effects and motion capture.Where the movie ultimately stumbles for me is in its middle arc. Some aspects are glossed over too quickly and there is little inclination in the plot as to how the world responds to these events - it all feels too isolated. In addition the primary locations look tatty, cheap and unexciting.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Ingenuous!,"D-9 somehow manages to juggle four or five things to incredible effect. Mockumentary is hard to do without becoming preachy or self-serving but D-9 makes excellent use of such. Science fiction means different things to different people (some say there's only been a half dozen authentic science fiction films ever made) but D-9 has to be as much if not more ""sci-fi""than; e.g., ALIEN (films like STAR WARS don't even count). The script and editing were great: Not a wasted minute. The special effects were just right; e.g., not too much or too little. There was humor, though maybe its more appropriate to call it comic relief; as the term was/is truly intended. There's a hero, or rather a main character that goes through a heroic transformation. And I don't care what the snobs say, D-9 is great social commentary, quite possibly because such comes so cleverly disguised as entertainment. I'm so glad that every time I start to believe no one will ever make an exciting movie again, a film like D-9 comes along and proves me wrong.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
If your in for a mind-boggling masterpiece. Just see it.,"Meet Sharlto Copley. Maybe one of the best actors to come out since Anton Yelchin. With a decade of horrible Sci-Fi movies. This is the diamond in the rough. Copley delivers a dramatic, amazing and saying the ""F Word"" 100 times. Now if this guy sticks to instant classics then he will be fine. Now just imagine if Hollywood made this with a PG-13 rating with Will Smith playing Vikus. Don't get me wrong I LOVE Will Smith (Who doesn't) But this was done right. Peter Jackson right. At times I felt like this was a little borrowed but I went with it. Now just wait 15 years for Hollywood to remake this starring Robert Pattinson as Vikus. Whatever. I was nuts about this film. It had everything right and I'm proud. Now hopefully Sharlto Copley will become a star and keep making instant classics because this one is one of the many of this decade. 5/5. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

You are not welcome here.,"District 9 = something new,something different and something great. Reading all the 5 star reviews, the teasing posters up on bill boards and the simple tag line ""You are not welcome here."" It did more then enough to convince me to watch this flick even before it was released. I did no much information about the film, but it looked too interesting to miss, was i right? completely. I applaud the director Neill Blomkamp for a very unique movie, i was also impressed by the cast. After watching Distict 9 i was awed, but like many others i also believe that it might just be a tad overrated (maybe even not enough for the top 250) but saying that i can understand why it's get's such a high (deserved) rating.Set in ""the slums"" of south Africa, a perfect place for this film to be set in. An extraterrestrial race forced to live in slum-like conditions on Earth suddenly finds a kindred spirit in a government agent who is exposed to their biotechnology. Just to make it clear the ""extraterrestrial race"" are aliens. But sorry people, don't expect blood sucking cruel aliens trying to invade earth! This looks at a different view of what a alien or a ""prawn"" (as known as) it gave another option that they could in some way be similar to the human race(no by looks though!) That's what i liked about this movie so much, it was far from typical. It started of well with a few minutes explaining the plot about the aliens and use of interviews which makes you wanting more. Even though the action was limited it was really cool and nicely panned out when it was used, (so for all you sci-fi alien action fans, that ones for you!) The ending was very original, good and possibly for some heart touching.I cant go into further detail or i'll end up spoiling it for you! The camera shots, well. If you don't like loads of camera movements following the cast around (like in the movie cloverfield, borat etc) then you probably wont enjoy to much. The cast were very impressive especially the upcoming Sharlto Copley. So if you love sci-fi, action and mostly thrilling drama you will enjoy this, if your looking for something way different to recent films (the past 10 years or so)you will definitely enjoy this one more.

Good apart from protagonist,Loved the documentary first half of the movie. Good CGI for the small budget the movie had. Also an interesting change from stopping an invasion of aliens - instead a showcase of aliens trying to live in horrendous conditions on Earth.

District 9...will there be a sequel?,"I agree with another reviewer here that this is one of the 5 best films of the year so far....I even agree with his other 4 choices!.....Not only is the writing and plot a bit more sophisticated than your typical science fiction film, but the special effects are seamless....The prawns actually do look real and interacting with the human actors.Now, I wonder if the whole movie was a set up for a sequel 3 years from now? I'll be there! But as my friend commented, what could the sequel possibly be about?

A work of cinematic genius,"Over twenty years ago, aliens made first contact with Earth. Humans waited for the hostile attack, or the giant advances in technology. Neither came. Instead, the aliens were refugees from their home world. The creatures were set up in a makeshift home in South Africa's District 9 as the world's nations argued over what to do with them.Now, patience over the alien situation has run out. Control over the aliens has been contracted out to Multi-National United (MNU), a private company uninterested in the aliens' welfare. MNU will receive tremendous profits if they can make the aliens' powerful weaponry work. So far, they have failed; activation of the weaponry requires alien DNA.The tension between the aliens and the humans comes to a head when MNU begins evicting the non-humans from District 9, with MNU field agents responsible for moving them to a new camp. One of the MNU field operatives, Wikus van der Merwe (Sharlto Copley), contracts an alien virus that begins changing his DNA. Wikus quickly becomes the most hunted man in the world, as well as the most valuable—he is the key to unlocking the secrets of alien technology. Ostracized and friendless, there is only one place left for him to hide. District 9 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

If you hate Sci Fi; SEE THIS FILM!,"===============FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION ONLY===============OK, the only reason I gave this 9/10 is because you wouldn't believe me if I gave it a 10.District 9 was a very surprising film for me. I saw the preview and expected corny lines, possibly some sort of intergalactic dance routine, and perhaps a perfectly matched alien V human fist fight (which would be absolutely mental because everyone knows that aliens could kick our ass in a fight, unless of course you have been speaking to my girlfriend, and Gerard Butler is fighting the alien).What I actually got was a great unknown cast, top notch CGI, and a story that you have to see to believe. The film is set in Johannesburg, and is told through news reports, interviews with the general public, and a bit of doco style shooting; reminiscent of Starship Troopers only much more realistic.I'm not going type anything else. You really do need to see it. I'm already waiting for the Special Edition BluRay. What are you doing right now? When's the next session? Why not watch it right now?

"One word, SPLENDID.","(May be considered as a spoiler to some) Like, seriously, from CGs, to camera angles, to sound effects, everything was PERFECT. This movie is just really really awesome.I was kinda expecting a typical ""it's end of the world"" + ""Aliens"" movie, with a really cool CGI and sound effects. However, I was was way taken aback by it. As the movie starts, I was expecting like, ""oh, this would happen... and that would happen""... Just like how it normally would turn out. BUT, the director managed to do something cooler, and come to think of it, it's what most people would do/what would happen to most people.I also liked the fact, that they manage to make certain stuff come alive, and also how the aliens have their own mindset, own character and own language. It's not like a ""freak who comes down to earth and kills everyone till they're satisfied"" kind of movie.I was also taken aback at some of the camera angles that some of the movie have, which was really, very brilliant.

An Utterly Phenomenal Experience,"After only having seen one trailer for District 9, I went into the film expecting an enjoyable yet predictable no-brainer. Fortunately, I was pleasantly surprised to find so much more.The reason this film is so successful on so many levels is pretty obvious: it has heart. You can tell by watching it that everyone working on this movie was pouring themselves into it. From the amazing CGI to the acting to the unbelievably complex and convincing clicking language that the ""prawns"" use, nothing seems to come up short. And best of all, the plot isn't at all predictable. It's true that this film is big, loud, and action-packed, but I found myself truly feeling for the aliens as well as the humans, and the narrative takes a number of surprising twists that keep your eyes glued to the screen. And when you find yourself empathizing with creatures that look like enormous, ugly, mutated prawns, you know the filmmakers have done SOMETHING right.The only criticism that I can envision someone making has to do with the cinematography. The director chose to use a documentary-style approach to filming that makes a lot of it look like it was shot with a hand-held camera. I happened to like Cloverfield, but those who didn't shouldn't worry; the director obviously isn't a purist and he knows when to back off and switch to more conventional techniques that make the narrative flow very smoothly. It isn't anywhere near as choppy and jarring as Cloverfield or The Blair Witch Project, but it does pull the viewer in and add to the atmosphere of confusion and terror that the characters are experiencing.Going into this film, I wasn't aware of the District Six inspiration, a sickening event in and of itself. I've seen one review that claims District 9 is insensitive to the Apartheid experience, but personally I don't think that's the case. While it doesn't seem that the director is explicitly referencing or criticizing the District Six horror, it doesn't glorify the incident either. The oppressors in this film are painted in revolting, cruel shades.While leaving the theatre, I was tempted to just head back in and see the next showing as well. It's also making me itch for a sequel, which, in this day of crappy sequel cash-ins, is really saying something. So go see it! If you're anything like me, you'll be glad you did.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"DISTRICT 9 (Neill Blomkamp, 2009) ***","Despite my general aversion to contemporary movie fare, I usually try to keep abreast of my favorite genre (Fantasy i.e. Horror and Sci-Fi) and, in fact, have been looking forward to catching this acclaimed recent example. Apart from its mixed origins (this is an American-Canadian-Kiwi and South African production that includes Peter Jackson as one of its producers), the film's major claim to fame is the fact that it garnered 4 Academy Award nominations including an unprecedented one for Best Picture! For what it is worth, it is also currently at No. 122 on the IMDb's all-time Top 250!!In hindsight, I do feel that DISTRICT 9 is somewhat overrated: what we have here is, basically, a combination of Steven Spielberg's CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND (1977) and James Cameron's ALIENS (1986) and, therefore, despite the obvious intelligence on display, also with a clear eye towards hitting the box office jackpot. With this in mind, one is expected to forgive (and, indeed, embrace) the presence of a 'cute' alien kid who, unexpectedly, bonds (as does his ambitious father) with the hunted (and highly unlikely) human hero. As portrayed by virtual unknown Sharlto Copley, it was a nice touch to make him a nerdy, soft-spoken and nervous type and I was disappointed to hear him burst into a constant array of expletives in the second half of the movie where he has to contend with macho South African arms dealers and his former colleagues now bent on destroying him.Actually, the unusual South African background against which this action-packed morality play takes place adds much to the mix and perhaps even invites the film-makers' tendency towards gore and tastlessness – not least in their decision to make the prawn-like alien design such a disgusting one! Incidentally, the following day after watching this one I also caught several of director Blomkamp's previous short films, namely: ADIDAS ADICOLOR – YELLOW (**1/2), ALIVE IN JOBURG (**1/2; something of a precursor to DISTRICT 9 itself, with Copley in much the same role), CITROEN C4 – ALIVE WITH TECHNOLOGY (**), HALO – LANDFALL (**1/2), NIKE – CRAB (**), NIKE – EVOLUTION (**1/2), TEMPBOT (**1/2) and TETRA VAAL (**1/2).",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Highly original but frequently absurd.,"Though District 9's originality can't be denied, the absurdities do get piled up pretty high. it's not the logistical plot holes that annoy me (most of which I can't reveal without being a Spoiler) but, rather, the frequent lapses of believable human behaviour. The capper is the ridiculous and gratuitous surprise party thrown by the wife and father in law of the seriously wounded and grievously ill main character. I suppose it may been intended to be funny but the filmmaker didn't really tip his hand in this direction. As it plays out it just feels jarring and dramatically OTT.Unfortunately that's the case throughout a lot of the film. There are numerous moments during the eviction operation with the lead character mincing and prattling about like a hepped up camp counsellor on a Sunday stroll, utterly oblivious to the imminent danger of the situation. These scenes could have been humorous if played as broad satire or as a direct parody of the U.S. govt. handling of Katrina, but, unfortunately they're played pretty straight and whatever laughs might result feel unintentional and awkward. Much of the film's action unspools this way, lurching from faux docu-realism, to surreal comedy, to all out action that it makes for an uneven and, for me, somewhat strained experience. However, I think a lot of these problems will be ironed out by the highly talented director come the inevitable sequel time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

The trailer didn't reveal much at all about the plot, so it was hard to tell what I was going to be walking into. The film opens with newscast in the style of a mockumentary, setting up the situation with the aliens on Earth. Eventually the style changes into an ordinary film, with an extraordinary story.I won't reveal much more than that because not knowing what the story is only makes it more of a mystery and more entertaining. What I will tell you is that District 9 is one of the most memorable movies of the year, possibly even my favorite so far.

An Original and Powerful Movie with a Message,"Every not-so-often comes a movie that is disturbing and holds such a powerful message that it will definitely leave an impression on you. Whether you enjoyed it or not, it will certainly cling onto you. District 9 is original, realistic, and powerful and it definitely delivers the message.District 9 tells the story of what happened when a malnourished and weakened alien race is stranded on Earth. Our people give them a place to stay, yet, like any normal human, we fear and hate them. Thus 'racism' is the main subject even after two decades since the aliens landed.As the story goes, Wikus, an MNU (Multi-National United)agent, is sent to evict these 'prawns' to a new place  or rather, a concentration camp  where they can no longer make human feel uneasy. But during the eviction notification process, conflicts arise and Wikus is accidentally exposed to a biofuel that slowly turns him into the 'prawns'. He then experiences what it feels like to be surrounded by people that hate him.The movie is way more realistic that  in its own term.It's told in the form of a documentary, using snippets of 'real and raw' footage of when the alien first came, interviews with people, and also hand-held and even security camera all put together into one beautiful piece of work. The second half however is shown in a clean and edited movie picture. It is so well done that you won't even notice the shift in the story-telling process.The acting are top-notch and not to mention that the movie is made by a first-time big-budget movie director with a cast of unknowns.But enough of that.What I love the most about the movie is that the 'prawns' are depicted not as aliens but as a minority race living on Earth. People hate them. We run tests of them. Abuse and even kill them. Racism and intolerance is a bad thing. And through Wikus we will feel how it's like to be hated. For example, in one powerful scene, Wikus is forced to kill a prawn. He hesitates and was electrocuted.I won't say any more. You have to see it for yourself and really catch that message it's trying to deliver.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
New style and ideas,"District 9 rides the Blair Witch Project wave in that it heavily utilizes the mock documentary style the aforementioned film popularized some years ago. It also tries new things with its basic premise, putting actual aliens in the position of aliens, as in immigrants. It's a fascinating idea and will naturally allow for a lot of new directions from which to examine the old problem and dilemma.I only wish it had stuck with that basic idea. Because now it seems that they came up with this great idea, but instead of doing a social commentary or even a satire, they decided to shoot an action film. And sure, an action film can comment on current society as well, but it simply cannot do it as well because you need to make room for gun fights and explosions.But, don't get me wrong. The gun fights and explosions are nice. This is a good science fiction film. The special effects are topnotch, the alien designs are creative (though, why always bugs), the action works well and the actors are talented. Though I do admit that I find Sharlto Copley's accent to be a bit thick, but at least it's memorable.District 9 divides opinions. Those that are looking for a good scifi action film with a clever premise will absolutely love it. Unfortunately, those that have listened to the hype and come in expecting a modern classic, a revolution, will be somewhat disappointed. Absolutely worth seeing, but do come in with an open mind.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Hard-Core Thingies,"Seeing District 9 on broadcast TV is a lot like watching the idiotic porn-lite flicks on a movie channel that rhymes with Sinemax. It's embarrassing, but you don't have to see this doodad going into that whatsits, which is the black heart and sick soul of hard-core.The TV version of this science fiction morality play is a blessing because, if you read about all the stuff the Fox Movie Channel cut out for broadcast, you may thank your lucky starships that you didn't see the hard-core original.Yet, unlike the spewtacular Starship Troopers--the first movie that comes to mind that has a nausea-factor off the charts--District 9 has a soul. Read between the lines and you see a thinly-veiled criticism of the disastrous effects of shelving unwanted people into refugee camps. Although the moralistic treatment of the subject of where to put more than a million sick and starved extra-terrestrials who have come to Earth is heavy-handed, it is refreshing to see some thought, some cleverness used in what is essentially a ""bug-hunt"" movie.Twelve hours after seeing District 9, my passion for it has cooled. I was impressed by the documentarian treatment of the story of a corporate bureaucrat who is given the task of over-seeing the eviction of the ""Prawns"" from their wretched ghetto. Director Neill Blomkamp carefully reveals a multi-leveled story of the bureaucrat, the corporate baddies who would just love to see what makes the aliens' weaponry tick, the hostility of the humans toward these invaders, and the (pardon me) humanity of the Prawns.What cooled my passion is what so often happens to heavily-laden CGI flicks and other bug-hunts--as the story works its way into the third reel, we are forced to watch a horror story turn into a gory rescue-mission shootemup. Even with the editing for television, the bodies start stacking up, the blood and brain chunks start coating the lenses, and the viewer (me) begins, once again, that shutting-down sequence that means my emotional bond with the movie is unraveling.Even though this isn't a Hollywood movie--it's an indie from South Africa--District 9 collapses into just another pool of red and black blood because, I guess, it's expected. Why force the audience to keep thinking all the way through a movie when you can cut to the bullet and ray-gun ridden chase?We all knew it was coming. Why complain?Blomkamp even throws in some Spielbergish tugging of heartstrings by showing the lead alien grieving over his loss of hope, his son, and the discovery of medical experiments being performed on the Prawns. It's a bad sign when a bit of computer flimflammery can show more emotion than most of the humans running around. I swear, if I saw this in a theatre, I would have bet that there would have been somebody--or somebodies-- mewling ""aahhh's"" when the camera captures the grief on ""Christopher's"" face.In District 9, an attempt to turn the monster-movie on its head by making the aliens very, very human would have worked if the humans making the movie hadn't lowered their bar by saying, ""Sorry folks, you're too dumb to get the social commentary here.

I did laugh a couple of times, but for most of it I was just smiling at the absurdity of it. If however, this was meant as a serious movie, then I would give it a 1. Please tell me it wasn't meant to be serious. Please tell me when I heard them say ""human rights groups would be monitoring the evictions closely"" that they actually said ""nonhuman rights groups,"" because having a human rights group at the evictions of alien cockroaches makes as much sense as them being present at a whale hunt. If it was meant to be comedic, it is still pretty lazy in writing. Peta would have made more sense. But that's a sloppy line if I heard it right. If this movie was meant to be taken seriously it had many more problems. Such as the idea that the US and other countries would leave an alien ship and weapons in the hands of South Africa. Never. They could have written a few lines to explain it away well enough but they didn't bother. Or that any country would tolerate such obnoxious looking and behaving aliens on the doorstep. They would have been quarantined right at the beginning unless they were worried an alien ship would come back looking for them-a few lines would have explained it. The refugee scenario worked OK in Alien Nation because the aliens acted more human like and it was a cop drama anyway--but here, there wasn't much done in an effort to make such a scenario realistic. And the idea that one was supposed to feel sad for them--I am afraid the director didn't do a good job making me feel that way, and I avoid stepping on insects when I walk! I felt nothing for them. Spoiler: When the main character gets sprayed with goo and has a change, it was so clean and perfectly done that it reminded me of 1950s cartoons where someone drinks a potion and their head changes into a frog (while their hands stay normal). If this was serious, the guy's face would at least have had a rash! And the way they stick him in the gun for the test--it just made me smile. It was ludicrously presented. So i have to believe it was mostly meant as a comedy, but it didn't work for me. Also the use of shaky cam annoyed me, and the docudrama style was inconsistently used. I had heard it was like this generation's 2001, Robocop and Star Wars. Big praise. The movie borrowed a few elements from them but wasn't fun like those movies. The aliens spoke in a bizarre clicking fashion and the humans could perfectly understand it--in Star wars this was done in a comic book manner, and the Stormtroopers were wearing helmets that may well have had a translator device. That was cartoonish. The alien arm transformation was cartoonish. I know it was a bad summer for movies, but really, was this that much of a breath of fresh air? It only came about because the video game movie Jackson had planned was canceled-and they needed to do something with the money they had. It wasn't as if the director had a script about alien race relations sitting on a desk. And there was precious little about that in the movie. I cant remember one quotable line of dialogue. I keep coming back to it being a comedy--even the idea that Nigerians would prostitute themselves for the aliens as suggested in a line--hard to imagine. Seems more like they just threw everything they could at the screen and hope it stuck. Lucky for them they had the backing of a big studio and director. The effects were quite good though-I just wish they had used them in a better story.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
sci-fi with style and depth,"As ""District 9"" opens, we learn that a mysterious spaceship has been hovering over Johannesburg, South Africa since 1982. After years of trying unsuccessfully to integrate the more than a million aliens who arrived on it into regular society, government officials have decided to move them out of the slum, known as District 9, where they now reside, to District 10, a camp located far away from the city (the aliens are referred to derisively as ""Prawns,"" due to their crustacean-like appearance). Trouble begins when Wikus Van De Merwe, a field operator for the MNU (Multinational United), becomes exposed to a mysterious alien substance while in the process of evacuating the camp, a substance that causes him to slowly turn into a Prawn himself. Immediately, the MNU wants to dissect him to better understand how to operate the aliens' weaponry (for some reason human DNA renders the weapons useless in human hands). However, Wikus escapes and becomes a fugitive from justice, finally hooking up with an alien who may possibly be able to help him retrieve his full humanity.(Though set in South Africa, the movie's provenance is actually New Zealand).Shot partly in the style of a you-are-there documentary and partly as a conventional third-person narrative, this relatively low-budget ($30 million) thriller, written by Neil Blomkamp and Terri Tatchell and directed by Blomkamp, is high on creativity, raw energy and imagination and low on sci-fi movie clichés (the overused fugitive-on-the-run scenario being one of the few concessions it makes in that regard). ""District 9"" also provides more food-for-thought than the average big-budget movie in this genre. Like ""Alien Nation,"" it uses the arrival of outer space visitors to weave a thought-provoking parable about such relevant social issues as prejudice, governmental and corporatist secrecy and propaganda, black market exploitation of the masses, and xenophobia. The script also deviates from the standard formula by making the aliens neither pointy-headed super-intellectuals light years ahead of us in knowledge, nor unthinking villains bent on colonization and destruction, nor namby-pamby sentimentalists reaching out a hand of friendship from across the cosmos. They are just worker drones who happened to get stranded on a strange planet, whose generally compassionate inhabitants invited them to stay on - albeit, clearly as second-class citizens, as it turns out. The movie also captures some of the poignancy of the 1986 version of ""The Fly,"" as piece by piece, Wikus loses the one thing that defines what he is - his humanity. Yet, ironically it is in becoming less human - in being able to more fully identify with an ""other"" to the point of extraordinary self-sacrifice - that he becomes most human (a theme not unlike the one in ""Avatar,"" actually).Even with all its impressive CGI effects and hardware, ""District 9"" would not be half the movie it is without the extraordinary performance of Sharlto Copley who, as Wikus, provides the picture with the human heartbeat it needs to be effective. A somewhat bumbling, barely competent bureaucrat is not an obvious choice for a an action movie hero, but Copley makes that very tricky transition seem utterly natural and seamless. Wikus is a good-hearted man who's forced by circumstances to perform actions he wouldn't normally perform just to survive, yet he remains true to his moral code most of the way through. It is he and he alone who lifts ""District 9"" to the level of compelling human drama.Excellent special effects, exciting action sequences, some subtle social satire (particularly in the early stretches) and moments of surprising tenderness all combine to make ""District 9"" a one-of-a-kind movie-going experience.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Interesting movie greatly marred by dialogue,"I was very interested in seeing this movie from being a major sci-fi fan but decided to await its DVD release due to the US economy I tend to reserve no theater viewing of any of the films I would enjoy. Plus IMO today's movies aren't overall that great to have to see the week they come out.Anyway this was a good movie overall - From the camera work except for camera in the bathrooms was a little out of place it had a good take on presenting the story.The CGI was realistic and the interaction with the live scenes was well done.The story was okay from a sci-fi perspective it was a nice way to represent the changes that had happened over the last 20 years in the real world of the South Africa area.For me the worst part was the dialogue, it started soft and clear and the interaction with the aliens was fine, then the f-words started to pick up and this started to make the key dialogue get mumbled as the F-word was more pronounced and more frequent without much stress upon the actors involved. It was if the F-word was became the main language of actors. This was very much disturbing from the lead actor's character who started was a administration clerk and turned into gangster wannabe based upon his dialogue alone.Yes he was suppose to be stressed, great we got that in the prodding scenes, but his whole dialogue became mostly the F-word than other English swearing. The cool thing about the dialogue was the use of native language words and yet instead of using more of those the F-words became a rhythmic assault to the viewer and because the dialogue was a great part of the style marred the rest of the film for those that were watching this on our home theater.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
One of the most original and inspired sci-fi films in ages,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningThe eyes of the world fall on South Africa when a giant alien spacecraft descends over it. Some of the aliens come down to earth and end up living in the shanty huts, but face prejudice and oppression from some of the earth dwellers. Finally, a giant government agency comes in and tries to forcefully relocate the aliens and in the process gentle, compassionate Agent Van De Mere (Sharlito Copley) swallows some fluid from the alien camp and finds himself morphing into one of them. It is then that he finds out just how corrupt the government are and is forced to go on the run from them...and to try and forge an allegiance with the very beings he had previously been trying to help get rid of.With it's sorry history of apartheid and segregation, South Africa is a clever backdrop to set this off beat sci-fi tale against, and with aliens and humans in place of blacks and whites. Told in a post modernist, mock documentary style, which seems to be the style these days, District 9 is an inspired and original science fiction story in a day and age where the genre is dying on it's lozzells. The camera lens and style of filming create the perfect sense of atmosphere and tension.Neill Blomkamp and Peter Robert Garber are the directors at the helm, but this is a Peter Jackson production and the special effects genius is in his element on a doubtlessly smaller budget than most of the other projects he's involved in, delivering some impressive 'prawn' prosphetics and make up. The aliens are given really sweet, gentle, puppy dog faces which makes you end up feeling for them even more. In the most important role, Copley similarly delivers an earnest, rootable hero, speaking in South African, that most weird of dialects that is a mix of cockney and Australian, but sounds more Irish coming from his mouth!Destined to become a cult classic, this is a unanimously pleasing effort for Jackson Productions (the same can't be said for the Lord of the Rings films!) *****",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Enjoy a truly spectacular work!!,"Seeing the mothership over the grounds of Jo'burg inspired me in ways that most people can't even begin to imagine. It was truly a glorious momentum for all of us, ""Third World"" cinematic enthusiast. The Aliens visited earth, and no, they DID NOT ARRIVE IN THE STATES. I think this flick represents even more than people realize, it is a clear view of the beginning of a successful world wide cinematic decentralization, one that starts in SA and surely will not end soon.The film's plot is spectacular. It's a shame that probably it will be treated as the average American action trash, when really, the social critique of a still experimental post-Apartheid country is not only evident, but is the pillar in witch the impact of the movie relies. I think that this movie is best enjoyed if you have a general knowledge of South African history, of the Townships, and of the discrimination that black people suffered during the Apartheid era. If you don't, then you will only be seeing ""a guy who helps an alien go back to his planet,"" and that is a true shame.Thanks for this amazing film!!!!

"District 9"", despite being an interesting, competent and well-made product, does not survive a deeper analysis due a shallow and superficial plot","Adopting a mockumentary format - in the best style of ""Spinal Tap"", ""The Blair Witch Project"", ""Cloverfield"", among others -, the director Neill Blomkamp, who until then worked as an animator and had directed some short films - including the one that gave rise to this one, Alive in Joburg, from 2005 -, uses some tools that are already becoming commonplace, such as the handheld camera in an attempt to simulate a supposed ""reality"" and that gives the film an immediate rhythm, reinforced by the reiteration of ""real time"" that is intrinsic to the project. If Blomkamp is accurate in maintaining the atmosphere of tension and creating a realistic mise-en-scene at low cost - ""District 9"" has a well-finished look, even if aesthetically not very sophisticated -, it fails to trust its viewer. Assuming that the sci-fi genre is the realm of metaphors, Blomkamp and his collaborator Terri Tatchell have written a film that is far from subtle. The first misconception is locating the spacecraft exactly over Johannesburg. Dealing with racial apartheid - obviously the film's main theme - in Mandela's country is to fall into howling simplification, despite the fact that the audience is tired of catastrophes in New York or Los AngelesTo say that ""District 9"" brings an allegory about apartheid would be an understatement: focusing on signs with the words ""Forbidden Aliens"" that obviously refer to similar warnings directed at blacks during that long and terrible period in the history of South Africa (in fact, of several countries), the film clearly sees extraterrestrials as a representation of minorities that over the centuries have been massacred by the ruling classes - and just the fact of bringing a story set in Mandela's country is something which naturally gives an immense symbolic dimension to the narrative. Even so, it would not be difficult to extract, from the script written by Blomkamp and Terri Tatchell, references to the Holocaust (the concentration camps; the measures for ""population control""). Criticism of the dehumanization of large corporations, whose profit motive goes above anyone else, is also disposable. Incidentally, with some effort it is even possible to see here a small manifesto against the miserable conditions in which a large part of the population of the Third World lives - and seeing alien adults and children looking for food in the garbage is the greatest example of this.Blomkamp, who also signs the Oscar-nominated screenplay, along with Terri Tatchell, his wife, managed to bring together several beaten elements of science fiction films in a cohesive, original and very easy to watch plot. These elements are, among others, (1) the ""humanitarian"" company that is not that humane, as previously mentioned; (2) weapons that only work with the DNA of the beings who made them; (3) genetic manipulation and live guinea pigs; (4) character exposure to alien biotechnology; (5) disgusting transformations; (6) an original alien design like Ridley Scott's Alien, and (8) the badass rogue soldier. But even using a patchwork of genre clichés, it's a relief in the midst of recent sci-fi movies. It has everything to please fans of the genre on levels that go far beyond the mere surface. After all, the film - somewhat reminiscent of ""The Planet of the Apes"" - also pleases on the other hand: its social denouncement. In the midst of all that technological apparatus and special effects, there is a strong story of intolerance, genocide and greed that sums up very well what has been happening in the world in the last several decades.It would be a problem to detail the unfolding of the story in more detail - after all, the explanations and constant comments that the script imposes on us are enough. If the ship moves, then a reporter appears saying: ""The ship moved!"". If the hero is on the run and has nowhere to go, the commentator audio comes in to repeat: ""He had nowhere to go!"". These off-screen texts are bordering on unbearable, reiterating what the image already says. This is aggravated by the fact that there are two times and two levels of simultaneous comments: the factual (the transfer of shrimps is accompanied by journalistic coverage) and the documental (experts recalling, from the future, the whole case of Wikus). It's too didactic. And it is an unnecessary didacticism, because the film is far from being cryptic or needing a manual. On the contrary, he opts for a well-established structure of twists and turns: we have a hero who despises his enemy and is suddenly forced to put himself in his enemy's shoes. His allies weren't who he thought they were, mind you. It's the political-humanist metaphor for beginners: nothing like making people taste their own prejudice so that they realize how prejudiced they were before.Following the documentary logic, Trent Opaloch's photography adopts a desaturated and dusty palette that highlights the misery of District 9, also giving a realistic tone to the narrative - and, thus, when we see the huge alien ship floating in the background, it becomes a chilling sight instead of sounding like a mere visual effect. Likewise, the occasional loss of focus simulates the improvised, reality nature of what we see, as well as the occasional use of security cameras to fill in certain gaps in the story. Unfortunately, however, director Neill Blomkamp ends up failing seriously by not maintaining this logic on some occasions, when he uses a non-diegetic camera (that is: one that is not physically present within the narrative) to portray some specific events - such as when showing what two aliens are planning inside a shack. In these moments, precisely because it deviates from the documentary structure, ""District 9"" ends up weakening the narrative itself, becoming artificial due to the contrast between the different styles (to make matters worse, in these specific scenes Blomkamp and editor Julian Clarke use a conventional montage, with several cuts, close-ups and so on, further emphasizing this contrast).On the other hand, the visual effects of the project are impeccable: from the alien creatures, whose movements are conceived with immense fluidity, to the robotic creature seen in the third act, passing through the makeup used in several moments of the projection, ""District 9"" does an excellent job of establishing that universe as something not only possible, but real - something that becomes even more fundamental due to the pseudo-documentary approach. While ""District 9"" starts off as a character piece, exploring and developing this new human-alien world, the second half features some impressive action set pieces. The alien weaponry that becomes the driving force of the story is put on brilliant display with some disastrous effects to human anatomy. This film definitely earns its R-rating when the fighting starts, and Blomkamp knows how to pack ever-increasing moments into the film without completely disengaging himself from the reality he so successfully created. Despite all the explosions, all the blood, all the lasers and giant, fully equipped mech suits, it all feels, weirdly, completely authentic and totally plausible. Furthermore, the film also benefits from a magnetic and visceral performance by Sharlto Copley, who, a childhood friend of the director, took on the lead role without considering himself an actor, revealing himself, in the process, to be a fantastic discovery - and it is thanks to him that the insecure and stupid bureaucrat Wikus Van De Merwe becomes a character that is not only surprisingly complex, but also deeply tragic.However, the film has obvious flaws and most of them are in the screenplay signed by Blomkamp and Terri Tatchell. The script, after its splendid introduction, focuses too much on Copley's character, leaving aside the social theme. The impression is that the film succumbs to Hollywood's pretension for box office and the consequent need to tell a story with the standard elements of a cinematographic script. In addition, improbable scenes are created that differ from the style of the film, especially when they portray the confrontation between Van De Merwe and an unbeatable representative of the MNU.Also disturbing are the coincidences about the ""black liquid"" created by one of the ETs. I won't say too much so as not to spoil it, but suffice it to say that it took ET 20 years to gather enough of the liquid and the very day that MNU enters District 9 to move the shrimp is the day that ET completes what he needs. There's also the fact that District 9 is, all of it, preparation for District 10. It's not like there's a speck left for an eventual continuation. No. Blomkamp must have known he had gold on his hands, as he spent the entire film making it clear that the narrative would only be complete with at least one more film. Not exactly a bad thing, but the production would have benefited from a self-contained story.It is almost impossible not to make a parallel with real life: racial segregation; the houses are reminiscent of favelas; police violence; the negligence of non-governmental organizations and the government, for not providing basic assistance; religious beliefs treated as something normal that lead to violence, like those that happen to albinos in Africa because they are different; the lack of respect for differences. In addition, of course, to the defamatory campaign carried out by the traditional media (radio, magazine, newspapers and television) which, of course, is sold and provides services to the company MNU in exchange for sponsorships, since in the film they used false images of Wikus.""District 9"" proved that fiction doesn't always take place in space, Earth can also be a great setting to create a movie out of reality. But the film is so well done, that the impression is left that if by a miracle, something like that happened, it would be exactly the way it is exposed in the film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Interesting and surprising,"Firstly, this is by no means the 44th greatest film of all time. Well, that's where it's currently listed in this very site's top 250 films of all time. This is no A Clockwork Orange which is a mere 53rd; it's nothing compared to Raging Bull which is a whole 31 places bellow District 9; and, to compare it with another great sci-fi film, this doesn't even put a scratch on Alien – which is holding strong at 64. In fact, I'd be so bold as to say it doesn't even come close to the being in a list of the 250 greatest films ever made, but that's not my choice.However, despite all this, District 9 is an amazing and surprising film which I highly recommend seeing; the film itself is truly one of the best films to come out this year. The film tells the story of a one Wikus van de Merwe, a worker for a fictional company called M.N.U. Although this does not seem to be a character film it truly is that. This film is one of the best films to come out, possibly in the last ten years, to have such a strong lead character played perfectly by Sharlto Copley.Along with the excellent leading man the film is directed wonderfully by Niell Blomkamp, whose interesting shooting style and interesting camera-work keeps you from ever losing interest.

Welcome to District 9. You're Not Welcome Here.,"Many years ago, science fiction has some of the most exciting yet exhilarating ideas of them all.

But what happens when aliens arrives on Earth and Earth does not want them to be there? The answer? District 9. District 9 is a new and very smart idea movie that hold emotions and thrills.

They're not welcome on Earth and the aliens don't want harm and trouble with anybody. The movie was inspired by the director, who inspired the movie as African apartheid that happens in the 1980's. The separation of humans and aliens was made to look like apartheid. District 9 is a very smart, but yet solid motion picture that was nominated for Best Picture of 2009.

Showing just a segment of a story is also commonplace here, finite endings are outlandish. South African filmmakers are very good at 'revealing whats really going on', most especially with regards to abuse in our own country; unlike many Hollywood films which have the tendency to promote the good parts of America, how great it is and how cool the characters are.

21st Century cinema heaven!,"Last night died and went to cinema heaven – District 9 is a work of absolute genius and one of the most enjoyable films I have ever seen. An unprecedented and totally successful fusion of action, intelligence and humour – stunningly realised. If you don't get a kick out of this film then there's probably something seriously wrong with you.I'm just staggered at how well the film makers managed the fuse a variety of styles into a coherent (and enjoyable!) whole. Funnier than most comedies, smarter than most art-house pics, and the action and effects speak for themselves. Something that seems to be lost in the post as far as praise for this film goes is the incredible performance by Sharlto Copley – just like the film itself he managed to nail an entire spectrum of emotions, that by most conventions, would never even appear in the same movie. His character was grey-scale interesting and multi-layered enough to keep you interested in every decision he made.The first 20 minutes or so were just brilliant satire, this was followed by a slight lull before the film kicked in to an emotion-led edge-of- the-seat adrenaline rush. I was literally on the edge of my seat for the entire second hour – something I haven't experienced watching a film for a long long time.There were a few problems of course – mainly in some of the supporting acting – the actors playing both the chief villains (the father-in-law and the merc) were poor, as was the actress playing the wife. A bit more care in casting would have worked to make the film near perfect in my eyes. Most other supporting actors were great and special mention should go to the guy who played the main 'documentary' talking head narrator – the best fake expert commentary acting I've ever seen – and believe me it's pretty hard to get that done well.Yes there were 'plot-holes' but the whole world was so well realised that it didn't seem to even matter (or you just accepted that you weren't in full possession of the facts)This film made me genuinely excited about cinema again – and I can't wait to see what Blomkamp does next.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Sci-fic renovated and that's entertainment,"A brilliant sci-fic movie. Something that makes the genre proud, but explores new ideas and narrative, and offers a story that is clever, thrilling and entertaining. It had to be a non-Hollywood director, a South African (and some ""Kiwis"" too) to come up with such a good story and cast.The narrative of the film is great as the film is presented as a documentary that tells the story of the leading character in the past, with the colors and realistic use of the camera of documentaries, but still developing a fictional story that is presented as real. The use of the faded ocher colors it helps to convey realism and past tense, and gives credibility to the whole setting. This has been done before but not, as far as I know, for a sci-fic story.The main character is superbly played by an unknown (at least to me) Shartlo Copley, who has has done a tremendous job playing with credibility a demanding character that goes from being a naive a little bit jerky soft-mannered public officer to an action fighter.If you want stunning star special effects this is not your movie. This is a movie in which those effects are powerfully developed but subtly and realistically integrated in the story, which is what matters here. The aliens are greatly designed, especially their language, character, social structure and biology, points that are all relevant to the story, never self-indulgent.The director has done a super-job in directing a movie that could have been cheesy or comic (in the bad sense) irrelevant and unsubstantial, but is nothing of that. We cannot forget Peter Jackson's production and the creative team in New Zealand either, who deserve a great praise for supporting such a great project!My main problem with the movie was the setting, the fact that the spaceship stops over South Africa and the relationship that the locals establish with the newly arrived. Don't take me wrong, I think it is great that a country that is not the USA or an Anglo-Saxon country is chosen as a set of a movie; that's great! It is also true that the setting is perfect to explain many of the social reactions that we see happening in the story. My concern has to do with the fact that the movie, involuntary demonizes South African society and black people in general, and Nigerians in particular, who are portrayed as a despicable subhuman group. All of this was unnecessary, truly. Imagine how much verosimilar the storyline would have been if the setting was an invented country in which the social groups are not from a certain known country, just humans. Unintentionally, the script has done something that I usually hate in Hollywood movies - that is, that the bad guys are most of the time black, dark color and/o foreigners from non Anglo-Saxon societies and the hero a white man.The personal relationship between the leading human and alien characters vaguely reminded me of the one shown in ""Enemy Mine"", although both movies are quite different in story and narrative.I loved the last scene of the movie, really tender and full of hope. I would say that the movie was left open to a sequel, which I would definitely welcome.Sci-fic fans will love the movie, and lovers of good movies in general, too.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Garbage,"No, really – literally. This is what you'll be seeing for a better part of 2 hours on the screen - garbage. Lots of it. Aliens digging in it, the hero being repeatedly thrown into it, the inevitable cliché ruthless mercenaries fighting in it.I won't even bother describing the weak social message the movie tries to get across (or at least we are told that it does, I tried to look for it but could not figure it out). It is hopelessly lost in the incredulous plot, pointless action and piles of garbage.There is only one full-time human role, that of Wikus – the main hero. The ""prawns"" are of about Cronenberg's Fly quality, but what was acceptable back in 1986 just does not cut it anymore. The only, as I said, full-time human character's performance is impressive if you are impressed by an actor with only one look on his face – permanent desperation, and two ways to deliver his words – pleading breathlessly or screaming hysterically. I hope that Sharlto Copley can do better than that, because here the screenplay did not leave him much room for any other emotion. Not a lot of room when you are standing knee-deep in garbage.Technically the movie is substandard for a 2009 flick of any budget. There is an alien ship painted in the sky, a few alien guns with action so familiar from Doom and Half-Life, and even a (spoiler?) ubiquitous battlebot. Its movements are about as lifelike as those of the first Terminator. The jittering ""handycam footage"" style is hard on the eyes even on your TV screen. I'm glad I did not go to the theatre – the motion sickness prone spectators could barf. On the other hand, there is enough visual content there that can cause the same reaction. Remember – garbage.I cannot believe that IMDb audience rated this movie so high, almost on par with Avatar. The latter was often criticized for a weak screenplay. I can agree to an extent. Nevertheless, Avatar compensates with scenes of incredible beauty. With District 9 the gaping holes in the plot are landfilled with garbage.PS -- I read a few more reviews to try to understand why could anyone -- capable of writing a review -- like this film. I could not. People call it Sci-Fi. Excuse me, there is most definitely no Sci here. Aliens living in garbage -- not Sci. There is also no Fi -- fiction is something that assumes a coherent story. No folks, still nothing but garbage.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
I can't believe this movie just had a budget of 30 million dollars,"I can't believe this movie just had a budget a 30 million, it could have easily been way more. This movie had it's budget used very wisely because everything is done effectively in this. The development and transformation of the protagonist is done very well and almost everything about this movie is stunning. It's a movie that deserves it's hype, in fact this is one of the best alien movies I have seen. Anyone that enjoys watching movies should most definitely check this movie out, you won't be disappointed. I sort of knew the direction this movie was going to go, but it does it in a very engaging and entertaining manner. This is almost a perfect sci-fi movie and not only is it engaging but as the movie progresses it really starts to get engaging. This really is a brilliant sci-fi flick with excellent development and has a engaging story and character to go with it. When I saw the trailer to this movie, I was expecting some good things from it but it really did beat my expectations in almost every level. The movie has slight flaws though, and something are just not answered very well like the reason why the aliens came to earth in the first place being one of them. If the background of the aliens were given a bit more than this film would have been better, also if it gave other characters some depth and establish some of the other characters as well. Overall this is a must watch film and deserves the high praise and rating it's been getting.8.9/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
South African film well invested in...Worth Watching,"It's nice to see a science fiction film in which aliens are not blowing up New York or Washington or any part of the States. Johannesburg is a refreshing setting.These aliens are not hostile but they are refugees in need of asylum. So therefore the South African government allows them to settle in the slum of District 9. Eventually the slum becomes militarized and some of the aliens or ""prawns"" become violent. So the weapons company of Multi-National United or MNU take responsibility for relocation of the aliens to another camp.If those who have watched it have not figured it out, this film directly mirrors the apartheid era, hence South Africa is the setting.For an international film the visual effects are really good. I am saying this because I do watch these new Bollywood films and the effects are pretty bad.The violence and gore in this movie makes Kill Bill look like a kids film.I liked it a lot.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"If somebody gives you a ""flower"", you accept it, right?","You know that many people hated Alien 3. Even the movies in IMDb Bottom 100 that some people are sorry for haven't been treated like that. However, my objection is that there are not really credible or really valid reasons of people. Alien 3 was entertaining, it was dark, it was suspenseful, bizarre (in a good way) harsh etc. but many people did not care about it and it is the same for District 9. The opening sequence of the movie, the introduction part in documentary style was extremely realistic, but at the same time very exhausting, I missed the half of it, it was because I watched the film with subtitles, so couldn't follow that part. The aliens in the movie are the most realistic and also intelligent ones in science fiction cinema history! The visual effects are flawless, again realistic. They look even better than the blue people of Avatar. Wikus is an unlikeable character, not a hero, not an anti hero either, he is a selfish guy, he thinks only himself, again realism here! There were some bloodcurdling, nasty details in the movie: sexual contact stuff. There is an experiment part in the movie, it is cliché, but personally I did not mind it, because the movie is dramatically very powerful, its breaking points are brilliant. If you are not against catharsis, this is your movie. In terms of action, the movie is a fresh, dynamite-like, captivating work. This movie is genius. District 9 has hundreds of themes, subtexts and metaphors. It is a satire, it is a thought provoking film. Let me tell you what I saw briefly. Basically, this movie is about humanity. Furthermore, cruel or sadistic people enjoy harming other ""people"". In the final act, there are some wow moments, I just say I was heavily impressed by the movie. May be in the final act, the movie becomes cliché, conventional a little bit, but I didn't mind. There are some real gore moments, while watching, I said to myself, these scenes must be the idea of Peter Jackson. As for the ending, it is an ending that most of the movies wouldn't dare! but the last image was too naive and unnecessary for such an intense film. Some people might find it ridiculous, but if somebody gives you a ""flower"", you accept it, right?",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
District 9,"After The Lord of the Rings trilogy and King Kong, Peter Jackson was handed the keys to a Halo movie. But work starting on The Lovely Bones (due out December 11, 2009) and the possibility of The Hobbit in his future, Peter Jackson opted to produce and wanted to pass directorial duties to an unknown South African director named Neill Blomkamp. With an unknown director known only for his short films, commercials, and special effects work and a reported $150 million budget for Halo the producers and studio balked at the idea of Blomkamp directing. After Halo fell through, Jackson offered Blomkamp a $30 million budget to direct the film of his choice. The result, a feature length version of Blomkamp's first short film Alive In Joburg called District 9.District 9 starts as a documentary. Thirty years ago an alien ship came to a halt over Johannesburg, South Africa. After emptying the ship of it's inhabitants, the government segregates the aliens from the humans into a dirty third world camp called, you guessed it, District 9. The aliens who looks like a cross between insects and crustaceans and are referred to as prawns are forced to live in squalor and filth in rickety shacks and have to dig through trash for food or trade their advanced weaponry to Nigerian gangs for cans of cat food (their preferred food). Unfortunately, everything in District 9 isn't as it should be as the humans want them moved even further away from society, so a plan goes into effect to move the prawns even further from society into District 10. A group of officials from a government contracted firm called Multi-National United (MNU), led by Wikus Van De Merwe (newcomer Sharlto Copley) is sent into District 9 to give the prawns eviction notices stating that they have 24 hours to vacate District 9. During the course of their project, though, Wikus accidentally has some mysterious liquid sprayed in his face which has some devastating effects.District 9 could quite possibly be the best movie I've seen all summer, my only regret is that it didn't come out sooner. It starts out as social commentary dealing with apartheid, the humans take great pleasure in treating the prawns as less than human, shuffling them around, berating them, and even burning down shacks that contain their eggs. It's this socio-political relevance that really causes this movie to rise above it's sci-fi peers. On top of that, the movie is shot with a real documentary feel, this adds to the gritty reality of the movie. You believe this is happening because it feels like a documentary you'd watch on the History channel.On top of that, the acting is superb as well. A special shout out must be given to Sharlto Copley who has no acting experience and had no previous acting experience and had no intention to be an actor prior to Blomkamp's short film, Alive In Joburg. His character Wikus is seen in nearly every scene of the movie and you really feel for him despite his early despicable acts in the movie. You always feel for him and you always root for him, and while that can be attributed to great writing, it takes a great actor to really pull that range off.The real winner in this movie, and what really blew my mind, though, are the special effects. I don't normally mention budgets when reviewing a movie, but here I think it's important. To give you an idea if you were to look at the other action movies to come out this summer you would see that X-Men Origins: Wolverine cost approximately $160 million to make, Terminator Salvation cost about the same, and Transformers 2 cost about $200 million. On the other side of the spectrum, if you look at comedies, Funny People cost $75 million, and last years Zack and Miri Make a Porno cost $25 million. Hell, back in 1991, Terminator 2 was originally budgeted at $77 million but went way over budget. The point: this movie had as many special effects as, say Wolverine, and cost less than a third of that to make and looks 10x better. Remember, all of the prawns, except the dead ones laying out on tables, were shot completely with digital effects and they all look photo-real. This movie easily looks like a $150 million plus movie.All in all, I'm really hoping this movie starts a new trend among studios: more original movies. I highly recommend you check it out in theaters, but before you decide to take your kids remember that this movie does earn it's R rating. It has way more than it's fair share of cursing, and exploding bodies (that alien technology will get ya every time). If you have a chance to go alone, or don't mind your kids seeing gore and hearing multiple f-bombs, I suggest you see it now and not just wait for this movie to hit DVD.5/5",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Absolutely not a typical Sci-Fi flick. For me, totally disappointing.","With the high ratings here on IMDb I thought that this film was a shoe-in. How wrong that expectation turned out to be. The film is more of a sociology study about 2 incompatible societies. The aliens are gross, but in a pathetic sorta way. I guess that that was the intent. The way the plot starts out is just stupid. I'm sure I'll get thousands of ""unhelpful"" votes for this review, but this movie, for me, was quite the disappointment. The fanboi base must be voting this film up BIG TIME. Take the blacks under apartheid in South Africa and substitute funky aliens and you get this film. I gotta admit that the look of the aliens was well done. The portrayal of the human response to the aliens just was not well done at all. It is the absolute antithesis of how it would be done in a big budget film. The portrayal is amateurish. Humans probably would have the general mindset shown. Again, how the script portrayed the human response was bush league ... and the acting was as good as the script.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Stunning Gem,"Well... after many, many, many years (27 to be exact), we have a match for John Carpenter's unique science fiction masterpiece ""The Thing"". And I don't dare say which of the two is the best. I started watching District 9 because it once hit the top 250 at IMDb, --which in itself does not mean that much, the moment we get craps of the Kill Bill style down there-- and to be honest, I expected another crap yet, since the video club owner had discouraged me telling me District 9 was ""bizarre"", implying it was bad. Let me tell you: the first half is, in effect, bizarre and in a ""tv news"" fashion; however it is quite amusing and I was just wondering if I'd include it in my second best ever list... then comes the second part (I saw a comment right here titled ""Expect the Unexpected""): stunning suspense, brilliant plot... keeps you tied to the seat until the very end... which invites clearly to a sequel.

Alien Nation meets Outer Limits,"Not entirely original, but sooo much better than the rest of the crap served up these days as science fiction, now dumbed down to 'Syfy'. For those of you who have seem the original Outer Limits TV show, the plot of District 9 may seem familiar. The 1964 episode starring Robert Duvall, The Chameleon (which may be viewed from a link on this website), features a very similar plot. Duvall's character is (voluntarily, in this case) surgically altered into an alien simulacrum to infiltrate an alleged invading group of aliens, but ends up 'going native'. The Alien Nation and Robocop influences are obvious and covered in detail elsewhere...Forget the Transformers, GI Joe and all the other kiddie action flicks.

Made on a minuscule budget of 30 million, funny people cost 70 million. the special effects, lighting, cinematography, direction and acting are all made with care and skill.We the viewer, get to follow Wikus Van Der Mew as he embarks on a thrilling journey of self discovery and redemption.

Great Story Ruined By War Porn & Medical Torture Gore!,"I'm starting to truly believe that a large segment of the human race (mostly male) has a defective gene. This defective gene causes a love of gruesome violence and a total lack of concern for the suffering of others. This gene also promotes binary thinking - the guy with the white hat is good and the guy with the black hat is bad. There's no in-between. And if there is - who cares!A certain segment of Hollywood knows how to precisely exploit this genetic weakness and billions of dollars pour into their bank accounts. Telling a good story is a lost cause for this segment of the population. Show as much blood, guts, torture and torment as possible. It's such a formula recipe, it could be written on the back of a matchbook cover: Blood, guts, action = BILLIONS, year in, and year out! Why didn't I think of that?If you love oceans of blood, vomiting, heads and limbs popping off of bodies with regularity, a graphic torture chamber used for medical experiments and repeated attempts at cutting off someone's arm - then District 9 is for you! And there is also ZERO sexuality in this film. (Why am I not surprised?)The only reason I didn't walk out was because I wanted to see if the good guys were going to win in the end. I did actually care about the main characters and the gruesome violence made watching District 9 all that much sadder and annoying to watch.THIS NOT A FILM FOR CHILDREN!! If the images shown do not disturb your children, I suggest they need to get some help. THIS IS A WAR PORN MOVIE! It exploits the audience, plain and simple!Beside feeling sad, I felt empty when I left the theater. Lucky for me I was able to sneak into another movie and watch it for free.

A rare jewel: it promoted of human emotions and energy,"Nowadays, when it's obvious that the cinema is going downwards, it is so uplifting to see movies like this. District 9 proved once again that something doesn't have to be perfect to be fully enjoyed and valued.The way the story and the characters were done was fantastic. Of course, there were some one-dimensional individuals in order to fuel up the audiences feelings towards them. But, District 9 was not about a character study, so it's okay. The movie was about struggling in extreme situations.The special effects were just downright perfect. I didn't see the aliens as CGI but as real characters to feel sympathy towards. Through the great effects came excellent action. To me, action is about adrenaline, tension so strong that you can't relax when watching the movie. The filmmakers made those fast moments sharp and brutal and, therefore, shocking. The limit was probably exceeded, but, it is nice to feel strongly alive.Last, but not least, the overall atmosphere was refreshing. Today, the look of almost every single film is digitally manipulated darker or brighter. But, in this one, they left the colors natural and neutral. In this way, I didn't feel like I was been told to feel someway about something.The well done score didn't control. It represented the characters and amplified the emotions and the effect.The people who made Distict 9 really seemed to care about it.

Neil Blomkamp's debut feature film is a sterling effort.,"Neil Blomkamp's debut feature film is a sterling effort. The South African director's talents were first noticed when he made short film Alive in Joburg, and it didn't take long for Peter Jackson to hire Blomkamp to both direct and write District 9, a full length version of the aforementioned short. Blomkamp obviously wasn't overawed by the prospect. D9 is one of the freshest and most original sci-fi films to hit our big screens in a very, very long time. With a hint of comedy, a splash of drama and two big cups of action, science fiction has rarely been so rewarding.With a meagre budget of only $30m you would expect there to be some shortcuts taken with the special effects but wouldn't you know my surprise when I found the CGI to not only be seamless but inventive to boot. The disgusting 'prawn' aliens are a sight to behold, their slimy faces and emotional eyes are perfectly executed and they interact with the actors fluently. I was shocked to learn that no physical effects or makeup were used to create the creatures such was there realistic appearance. Those who have seen Jackson's earlier film Bad Taste will see the definite influence he had on Blomkamp when it comes to the amusingly gory deaths in the final scene.Lead actor Sharlto Copley has never acted before yet his transformation from bumbling idiot to South African Rambo (via outlaw on the run) is highly believable. The accent can sometimes cause unwanted laughs but I reckon Blomkamp and Jackson knew this already and subsequently turned the joke on us, the choice of humorous dialogue designed to ham up the Efriken accent proves this.I didn't notice it until I was walking out of the cinema but D9 also features one thing seldom seen in a movie that also features exploding heads and grotesque aliens: a remarkable story. Blomkamp and Terri Tatchell have crafted a tale that incorporates messages of racial discrimination (most apparently the Apartheid) and profiteering, but never do they rub it in our face. Instead they choose to allow the audience to get involved as much or as little as they want. Don't want to think about the issues? Well sit back and enjoy the glorious action. Like a bit of deeper-thinking in your sci-fi's? You're covered too. No-one is left out and this is what will make D9 a long term favourite like genre classics Alien and The Thing.I wait with baited breath on what Blomkamp decides to do next, but in the meantime directors Michael Bay (Transformers 2), Stephen Sommers (G.I. Joe) and McG (Terminator Salvation) should be taking notes: this is how you entertain an audience.4.5 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Average, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
In one word: Amazing,"I went to see District 9 not knowing much about it. I had seen Neill Blomkamp's short film 'Alive in Joburg' (practically the prequel to D9) earlier that day, as well as 'Landfall' and 'All Arms Race' which Blomkamp made to promote the release of the video game, Halo 3.I was glad to see an alien/human contact movie where the aliens are not invading and slaughtering as they go. I also enjoyed the fact the the film was set somewhere other than the United States which seems to be, as another movie put it ""The only place where aliens ever seem to land"".It was refreshing to see a cast comprised of unknowns, as I feel that the overall value of the movie would have been detracted substantially if they had hired an all-star cast.The special effects in the movie were great and the actors were fantastic. The one thing that clinched this movie for me was that fact that it is believable. It feels realistic, which is one thing many sci-fi movies lack these days.District 9 is just amazing and it is a breath of fresh air for the movie industry.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
movie about aliens with an interesting history,"District 9 was another good surprise in 2009 , the film is very interesting, the plot draws much attention for its very different from other films with the theme Alien, the special effects are great , the acting is good, the direction is good too , the film has good moments of action, and a good soundtrack , Visual aliens is pretty cool, and the flying disc is amazing, very well done , and the pace of the film is good, Neil Blomkamp the director of this film , after directed over two science fiction films , Elysium and Chappie , unfortunately both had not the quality of District 9 , District 9 is one of the best films of 2009 , with a very interesting and different storyline.

Top class film,"Pleasant surprise - thoughtful plotting not overshadowed by the (non-gratuitous) violenceThe external threat caused the South Africans' mutual colours to be unimportant - for example, the protagonist's handover to his successor and, in the extras, the TV interview of the MNU bossThe aliens were the more deserving of empathy; consider the alien parent's concern for van de Merwe, its nerd offspringThe implication of the action extending beyond the film (without being a hook for a sequel) was intriguing - van de Merwe's implied continuing transformationAll the acting was excellent",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
One of the best scifi,"This film has a separate base on comparing other alien invention films. A scoop of emotions added to this made feel like a easily attachable thing. The way they conveyed like a documentary was the real impact of the film which made me feel lively. Overall one of the greatest sci fi film which has a individuality from other alien sci fi films by having a mixture of thriller, emotions, love, sci fi ,documentary etc",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Independence day + Signs + Clouse encounters + clichés = ""District 9""","The Aliens franchises of films in recent years proved too repetitive: or they were an apocalypse with a huge alien invasion on our planet; or the good aliens arrive on earth and are unwelcome. Neill Blomkamp and Peter Jackson finally managed to bring back the old spirit of the original Aliens movies with ""District 9"".""District 9"" unlike other Alien films, scraped together all sorts of Alien clichés, ranging from big cockroaches to super-intelligent beings who can be peaceful and dangerous at the same time, and have a super ultra-pack laser guns ... cool right?! Well, let's start with the story. ""District 9"" begins in 1982 when a massive alien ship (on ""Independence day"" style) begins to fly over Johannesburg, South Africa (yeah, it's not New York or Washington ... finally!). That ship was carrying an entire population of strange creatures (giant super smart cockroaches) called ""The Prawns"". Humans put and housed the aliens in a huge military area called District 9, where ""the prawns"" could live peacefully with humans. But 28 years later, the entire area was damaged into a massive slum with African militias bribing and terrorizing ""the prawns"". In 2010 the multinational weapons enterprise ""MNU"" (Multi-National United), that spent years researching the use of the weapons aliens that were also transported on the ship, was hired to transfer all the aliens to another military district called District 10 (UOL , I didn't expect that). To this they put in charge of the operation the employee Wikus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Copley)... but like any Aliens films things did not turn out very well, especially for Wikus that after being infected by a strange alien virus, begins a furious fight for his life.As said before Neill Blomkamp and Terri Tatchell (Peter Jackson worked as a producer this time) put together in a beautiful script all kinds of Aliens clichés in a masterly and original fashion (mainly because the entire movie take's place in Johannesburg and not in a American capital). But while with the clichés, they showed a great originality in two aspects: the first is the fact that almost the entire film is presented as a documentary (this thing has never been done in aliens movies); and also the fact that they present a huge society critic soon after the incident with Wikus.Wikus who was a huge prejudice towards the ""Prawns"" begins to depend on them when he gets infected and starts to turn into one of them. Everything he had from friends and family begin to treat him like an animal. We begin to feel their pain and rejection, not only because the film has a good realistic touch but also because of the connection we make with the character (thanks to his good sense of humor).Not only in humanity and philosophical aspects that the film is impressive, but as said before this is a aliens movie, there couldn't be only a drama as ""Signs"". District 9 brings a good set of action with laser guns, thanks to good reality of the film, we can even see the reaction of a human body when it receives a shot of a laser gun (don't let fragile kids watch the movie).""District 9"" can be one of the best (if not the best after ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"") Aliens movies ever made. Along with a great mix of clichés and a good human philosophy, maintaining a good line of entertainment with spectacular action scenes and superb visual effects, is a film to be seen at least once in your lives.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
I love this film.,"Seriously. I love this film. Last year, two movies made me crazy, which were Iron Man and Dark Knight. This year, it's Harry Potter 6. Hangover, and this. Amazing action, great story, and touching. This will show Transformers and Terminator with GI Joe that a Sci Fi movie can have a story with amazing effects, that too with only a 30 million dollar budget. The background score is electrifying. The performances aren't the best, but they are believable. Which brings me to this: this movie is too believable, too realistic. You might feel a bit uneasy, but if you're emotionally strong, you can take it. Hats off to Peter Jackson to slapping the Sci Fi film genre back to it's senses.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A well crafted story of first contact with bug-based alien life with a clever plot.,"I'll probably watch this movie again I liked it so much, it's a juxtaposition of African apartheid policies and shanty towns with first contact of a bug/crustacean based alien race. The script is very well crafted and uses a lot of symbolism from human history to tell the tale of how we would probably treat these alien beings. The acting is well done and the lead character has an unusual accent that gives the whole movie a more unique character. The story focuses on his experiences with an alien refugee camp as a ""MN"" worker trying to move the camp away from the city of Johannesberg.PLOT: Part of a MN team (think UN team) in Johannesberg assigned to a refugee camp for alien life forms comes in contact with some alien technology that creates a great deal of turmoil both with the MN and the camp. Some interesting special effects, but the plot is the main point of interest here, this is a cerebral flick with good action scenes. The movie uses a documentary style at times but doesn't beat us over the head with it like Blaire Witch or Cloverfield- they know when to flip into live action and leave that style behind.All in all this winds up being a carefully crafted science fiction story with the occasional wow moment of action, good show!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
War of the Worlds (2005) meets Transformers!,"War of the Worlds (2005) and the Transformers franchise are in my top favorite films, so adding this little combo to create this film, I did have high expectations going in. Those expectations were satisfied! Many of my friends thought this wouldn't work, some did based on the trailer. I avoided this trailer at all costs, even changing channels when the trailer came on TV. So going in blind, I was pleasantly surprised! This is a well executed and directed script with amazing cinematography and VFX. It's a winner from me and a well deserved 9/10!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
One of the more original films.,"Don't worry, no spoilers here. I was truly entertained and surprised throughout the entire movie. The creativeness reigned supreme throughout. First the main them was interesting. Then the movie takes you from thinking the movie is one way and then another. Then humanity shows where you never think it will when you first start watching. There is enough good and evil and enough action/violence to keep most anyone happy. I would say though, that children under twelve should not see and over twelve, the parents should watch it first to see if they want their kids to watch. Some of the violence would be considered epic and well, of mature theme. Over 16 should be OK though. This is a Sci FI masterpiece and one of the best ever made.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Edge-of-your seat stuff,"Executed in typically Peter Jackson style documentary style with horror elements, the viewer is sucked into a fast paced, unsettling alien invasion scenario form the first minute.
Just when you think sci-fi was reduced to Tom Cruise running around senselessly or the umptenth Star wars sequel, a team from South Africa smacks the US dover the head with this one.
Protagonist Sharlto Copley does an excellent job, changing from a hapless bureaucrat dominated by his evil father-in-law to an independent fighting, spirit after being experimented upon, having to live on catfood, and being dumped by his wife, realizing the aliens are intelligent creatures.
Lots and lots of noise, shouting, explosions and a deafening drum-banging music score - this is a movie to rattle the glass in the cupboard with.
Coming from South Africa, there is an (intended) unsettlling feeling about the mainly white military establishment having interests in suppressing the aliens and stealing their biological weaponry, adding an element of engagement,
Even the title refers to an existing Thuisland in Soweto (District 6) where much of the footage was filmed.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

"Earthlings, don't miss this film!","I have read many critiques about this movie and let me say when it comes to saying whether this movie is great or not it could just easily be both. Prepare to watch a 'LOVE IT' or 'HATE IT' movie.In my opinion this was another great sci-fi. A superb production by Peter Jackson with great direction that shows the movie as if it was a National Geographic documentary but it never stops being a real movie.There isn't just action and amazing, seriously amazing special effects, 'District 9' has an interesting script more realistic than many sci-fi scripts I've seen.We are not talking about a Hollywood super sci-fi production like 'Transformers' or 'Star Trek', however when it comes to entertaining the public and keeping you at the edge of the seat 'District 9' has nothing to envy those films.It is not an action movie where everything you see is human fighting aliens non stop and a blood shed, quite the contrary there is a lot of interesting dialog and realistic scenarios, nonetheless you will see some mayor action and very brutal combat. I personally loved the equilibrium between good action scenes but also dialog and quality.The acting is not one of the primary good points of the film, yet Sharlto Copley (main guy) did a pretty good job for a man that is not commonly scene on screen.I gave this film a well deserved 8 stars and frankly I recommend anyone to watch it and I would certainly watch this twice.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
WTH is this crap?,"Too bad there aren't any negative numbers! R u freaking kidding me with this? The ""aliens"" are so pathetic... So ""Cops"" with the cat food and ""it's not mine"" !

Stunning Surprise,"When District 9 started, with its interviews and the ""mockumentary"" feel it had to it, I must admit that I didn't expect much out of the project, but when I started watching, the scenes rolling deeper, I must confess that District 9 surpassed--no, shattered--my low expectations.Gritty, shocking, nail-biting and hair-raisingly real, this movie presented more than anyone could have expected, or imagined. It felt... Real.It does deserve a sequel.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Awesome,"Great movie! Made in the style of a documentary. It's gripping, touching and very, very watchable. The main attraction for me was the role played by the main character - he's a wimpy, nerdy, beta guy, who's a bit of a dork. But circumstances lead him to become more than that. Really enjoyable, and well-made movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
What a film,"This film shows the human race in its full glory of our lack of tolerance and reminds us all how crap it is to be a human... - Great film... watch it! - if you like films that have a deep meaning then you will love this film, its about time someone did a film with a bloody good story line. well done! - not just full of FX, after watching it reminded me how weak we are. and how fast we are to give an opinion on something... so next time someone says there gay or disabled don't be so fast to give your opinion, because one day it might be you getting the opinions about you. and because i have to give 10 lines i will just ramble on, lol. it said comment not an SA... lol",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
