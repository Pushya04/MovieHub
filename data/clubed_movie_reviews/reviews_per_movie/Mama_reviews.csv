"Begins with a lot of promise, but ends with an unsatisfying note","¨A ghost is an emotion bent out of shape, condemned to repeat itself time and time again.¨Another South American director has made his splash on Hollywood after the successful debut of Mama in theaters this year. Argentinean director, Andres Muschietti, made over 70 million dollars in the box office and received decent reviews for this horror/suspense film based on a short 3 minute movie he directed in 2008. That short film garnered the attention of movie executives such as Guillermo Del Toro who decided to produce and present this film. The fact that Del Toro's name was used here and that the coveted Jessica Chastain signed on to play the main character gave Muschietti the tremendous possibility of debuting on a high note. The formula worked pretty well because critics and audiences seemed to enjoy this film alike, and we could be heading to the start of a new horror franchise. I enjoyed most of the movie, and loved Jessica Chastain's performance, but the ending just ruined the entire film for me. It is kind of the same problem pretty much every ghost story film has. I feel like most of the endings in this genre are pretty unsatisfying and ruin the entire suspense the film has been building throughout the story. There is no denying that Japanese films have heavily influenced the genre with films such as The Ring, The Grudge, Dark Water, and One Missed Call which have all been remade, but the truth of the matter is the only film that really worked with critics was The Ring. They have tried to imitate its success, but I haven't been scared like I was with The Ring, which had a pretty satisfying ending compared to the rest. I do prefer this type of psychological horror more than the gory slasher films, but I find it troubling that they can't find a satisfying ending. My favorites in this genre will always be the first two I saw: Zemeckis's What Lies Beneath and The Ring. The rest have all fallen short. Mama was close to achieving that similar success in my opinion, but the ending really hurt it.The film centers around two girls named Lilly (Isabelle Nelisse) and Victoria (Megan Charpentier) who are abandoned in a cabin in the middle of the woods after their father murdered their mother and was attacked by some presence inside the cabin. Five years later the search finally pays off and their Uncle Lucas (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) finds them. To everyone's surprise the two girls have managed to survive on their own, but they live like animals crawling around the floor and talking to walls. Lucas and his girlfriend, Annabel (Jessica Chastain) decide to raise the kids with the help of Dr. Dreyfuss (Daniel Kash) who continues to treat the girls in order for them to make the transition from their isolated lives to a normal and nurturing family life. Annabel soon discovers that these girls might have never been on their own and that somehow the presence that was with them in the cabin might be in their home as well. Several suspenseful and horrifying events begin to take place while the girls continue to talk to shadows in the walls and call out for Mama.The film has several thrills and suspenseful moments with a great performance from Jessica Chastain. It was good to see her try out a different role and she proves she can do about everything. It's hard to find good performances in horror films, but this may be one of the best. The movie also has its weaknesses like pretty much all horror films do considering the protagonists always seem to make stupid decisions, but that is what makes the genre so entertaining at times. They are clichés which we have learned to accept. The two girls were also surprisingly good, they had strong performances as well. I really enjoyed everything about the movie up to the last 15 minutes which pretty much ruined everything. Psychological thrillers usually have this impact: they begin with a lot of promise but end up on the wrong note, and that is exactly how I felt about Mama along with Sinister, a similar movie I got to see a few months ago. The film is above average thanks to Jessica Chastain, and Guillermo Del Toro's influence in the production of the movie, but that is about it.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Mothmom Possibly.,"Mama is directed by Andres Muschietti and written by Muschietti, Barbara Muschietti and Neil Cross. It stars Jessica Chastain, Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, Megan Charpentier, Isabelle Nelisse, Daniel Kash, Javier Botet and Jane Moffat. Music is by Fernando Velazquez and cinematography by Antonio Riestra.A Suicidal father abducts his two young daughters and takes them to a cabin out in the woods, his intention is to kill them. Before he can enact his plan he is killed by a strange entity, leaving the two girls alone in the cabin. Years later the girls are discovered in the cabin, completely feral and when any sense can finally be made out of them, they talk of being looked after by someone they call Mama; And it seems Mama has come back with them to civilisationBased on his own 2008 Argentinian short of the same name, Andres Muschietti expands the idea out to a full length feature film. With pretty decent results as well. Pic is a supernatural fairytale, thick on ethereal atmosphere and not over reliant on boo jumps or an adherence to blood and guts spilling just to put bums on seats. From the moment the girls are found, scampering around the wood cabin on all fours, clearly having survived on cherries for five years, there's an uneasy feel to the story. We already know there is a spirit involved as we half glimpsed ""Mama"" during the pre-credits sequence, what we need now is a good story and a healthy quota of frights and peril for Waldau and Chastain as they become surrogate parents to the troubled youngsters; And again, Mama mostly delivers all that is required of it for a good night in by the fire whilst perched on the edge of your seat.Chastain is excellent as the punk rock chick reluctantly mothering two children before her time, the two girls, Charpentier and Nelisse, are also top draw, exuding the sadness and confusion that children of that age would obviously be feeling under these circumstances. While their reactions to what we ourselves can't see, via glances or hushed exchanges, has a creepiness to it that delivers a bucket load of dread. Muschietti's direction is very stylish, not only does he marshal his principal cast members with great skill, he shows some ingenuity in scene staging with one sequence particularly brilliant as Chastain does housework and the younger of the girls plays with Mama in the bedroom, we know it, even though we can only see the wee bairn. The soundtrack and score is suitably screechy, and the cinematography by Riestra has Gothic tints to it.Why Mama is not a bona fide entry in the upper echelons of horror is mainly due to an annoying mistake that so many horror genre film makers make, namely showing too much of the spook. There is a point around the hour mark where ""Mama"" herself just stops being scary, a shame because the effects work isn't half bad. There's other, less itchy problems, such as Waldau being reduced to a bit player from the mid-point, a sub-plot involving Kash's Dr. Dreyfuss just feels like set-up material, while the ending is sure to be a bit too WTF for some. That said, this is good genre cinema for those who like The Woman in Black type of thrills and story telling. 7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Just missed by an inch of an fraction to become a classic.loved it,I am a big fan of horror but recently i cant remember a movie which i enjoyed to my heart but then i saw MAMA and it was like a fresh air which u asked from a long long time. What makes MAMA special and different is it's Story and Acting.Not many horror movies has it now a days but MAMA has it all..a beautiful and emotional film with great horror elements to back it.The performance from Jessica Chastain is mind blowing.when the movie starts I didn't seem to connect with her character but as soon as the movie progressed she just blown my mind with her screen presence and screen fit performance.,7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Interesting angle, still scary.","When sisters Lily and Victoria are left in the woods after a series of horrific events leaves them orphaned, how would they survive for the next five years until they are eventually rescued? Have no fear, Mama is here. The debut feature from Spanish director Andres Muschietti has some plot hole, but still delivers the goods in a scary, almost poignant way.In Mama, there are similarities to the American version of The Ring in the way some of the scenes are shot in that grainy, static, antiquated, black and white style. Horror/ghost film fans might think parts of the film are clichéd and they would be correct. However, the two sisters in the film (played by Megan Charpentier and Isabelle Nelisse) make for interesting viewing. As Victoria and Lilly, the two are feral creatures having lived in the wild the bulk of their lives. Even after being taken in by their uncle (Game Of Thrones' Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, Lilly still prefers to run around on all fours, eat with her hands while on the floor, and sleep under her bed. Her speech is relegated to growls and grunts with a few words mixed in. Her big sister, Victoria has a faster time assimilating to the civilized world. She even begins to cozy up to her uncle's punk rock girlfriend Annabel (Jessica Chastain).What makes Mama work is the relationship between the female characters. Chastain ( Take Shelter, Zero Dark Thirty) has the lead role. She's the girlfriend, but becomes the unwilling stepmom to the two girls. The girls accept her to different degrees, but still cling to each other first and foremost. They also cling to ""Mama"" and vice versa. Thus what you have is a battle of wills between the supernatural and the living world with the emotional and physical well being of two little girls hanging in the balance. Maybe the presence of Barbara Muschietti (sister of the director) as one of the producers and writers of the film had some influence on having women as the driving force.In addition, Mama might feel and look like the style of Guillermo del Toro film. That could be because he executive produced the film. If you are familiar with his work, you can see his hand in guiding this maiden voyage. Even so, Mama stands on it's own merits. It's far from perfect. The acting, especially from the kids, some trippy and macabre imagery , and a bit of a twist might make you want to sleep with the lights on.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not entirely feeling this Mama's love sadly,"This is meant in a genuine and not at all malicious way. 'Mama' is not a bad film. It's also (this is all personal opinion, not objective) not a great film. It very nearly was and its potential was enormous, but this is one of the most frustrating recent examples of films of two halves.'Mama' is absolutely great in the first half. It's genuinely unnerving with a good deal of suspense in the ambiance and build-ups, beautifully timed jolts and spine-tingling scares without resorting to cheap gratuitous gore to make their mark. There are many horror influences here but not in a cheap or predictable way, almost in an affectionate homage sort of way without it meaning to be. The titular character is an ominously creepy presence for most of the film, there is a real sense of danger lurking around the corner at any time. There is something very beautiful and poignant about the story-telling too, underneath the horror was something more than that with at first characters one could connect with and a vulnerable edge that comes over movingly.On the most part, 'Mama' looks good. It's suitably unsettling but also beautifully shot with creepy and audacious production design and splendidly macabre and sometimes inventive visuals. For the first half of the film, a lot of thought went into the visual effects. The direction from Andy Muschietti shows successful attempts at taking risks rather than over-blowing things or taking it too safe, there is a lot of visual panache and a seeming appreciation for film not just of the horror genre but in general (some of it actually almost thriller-like).Always look out for a good music score in film, being a musician and growing up in a musical family music is of great importance to me when watching film, television etc. 'Mama' has that, a lot of it is truly haunting while not being over-bearingly used.Jessica Chastain may not convince as a punk rocker but gives a performance of intensity, steel and vulnerability. Have noticed that both here and in Muschietti's latest film 'IT' that he brings the best out of child-acting, something that has wildly varied in film throughout history. Because 'Mama' is one of the finer recent examples of child acting that is remarkably mature, poised, natural, affecting and sometimes frightening. All of which achieved by Isabelle Nelisse and particularly Megan Charpentier. Daniel Kash makes the most of his problematic nearly pointless plot-device role, while Mama herself is voiced to unnerving effect and even more so in action with Javier Botet.Which is why it is such a pity that at the midway point 'Mama' feels like a different film altogether with a second half that brings things down. The scares become less frequent, the pace lacks its tautness, the dialogue gets confused and things start becoming predictable and contrived. Due to plot devices not properly followed through, things that don't add up sense-wise and some illogical character decisions.The less frequent the scares got, Mama also diminished in the scare factor and was almost cartoonish and the effects start to lack finesse. Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau does his best but he is used terribly to the point that he is nearly completely wasted, despite his role in the story being important it's not treated as importantly as ought and fairly indifferently done in execution.Faring least is the ending, which was unsatisfying on every level as has been said. It is just far too ridiculously outlandish, feels tacked on and it's also very vague in that it leaves questions without fully if at all answering them.In conclusion, great first half but really disappoints in the second with a slap-in-the-face ending. A small 6/10, was very torn in what to give it having been so disappointed with its unevenness but its good elements and the first half were so well done that being too hard on it was a no-no.

Some Flaws but Overall a Creepy Film with a Great Lead Performance,"Mama (2013)*** (out of 4)A couple (Jessica Chastain, Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) take in their two young nieces five years after they were kidnapped by their father and spent the majority of that time alone and in the wilderness. The two girls slowly start to come out of their state but it doesn't take long for the couple to realize that there's something else with them. MAMA is a feature length version of a short film by the director and for most part it's a successful horror film. There are a few problems that we'll get to but for the most part I thought director Andres Muschietti did a fine job at really creating a dark atmosphere that hangs around the entire film. He also managed to use this atmosphere and make it very effective during many of the scenes, which were quite creepy at times. I thought that really made the film stand out compared to so many other stories was the character played by Chastain. In most films like this you have the good person doing good deeds to protect the ones she loves. That's not the case here because her character doesn't want these girls, doesn't like how they've changed her life and there's not really any cute scenes. The character development here is something quite rare in horror films but I think it really works itself out nicely. As for Chastain, it's good that some of her caliber is here because a great performance really helps bring credit to the events in the film. The supporting players are good too and this is especially true of the two actresses playing the girls. Now, what really doesn't work in the film is the CGI ""mama"" character. I'm sorry but I really don't see why you have to have poor looking CGI bring a film down. Not only is the CGI rather poor but the ghost creation just does so many unrealistic things that you can't help but not be frightened of it. The director does a good job at building up the tension but once the creature actually comes it goes away. Still, MAMA is a pretty strong horror film that's not perfect but it's certainly good enough to watch.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Not Flawless, But Better Than Average Horror","Annabel (Jessica Chastain) and Lucas are faced with the challenge of raising his young nieces that were left alone in the forest for 5 years.... but how alone were they?I am very conflicted on this film. While overall I have to say I liked it, and thought it was one of the better horror films I have seen recently, it is not without its flaws. For one thing, I found Jessica Chastain as a punk rocker a bit hard to swallow (though she pulled it off better than Kristen Stewart trying to be Joan Jett). I also think that they showed the CG a bit too much. Not that it was terrible by CG standards, but one of the keys to a good monster is not showing it...Those criticisms aside, this was a generally good film. The atmosphere was eerie, there were some good jump scares, the little girls (especially the younger of the two) were phenomenal actresses... and I am pleased they made this PG-13 rather than R because the focus was on the mood and not the language or sexuality (which would be quite inappropriate considering this is still basically a story about kids).I loved the look of the flashback scene. The style was excellent. Again, I have to bring up the CG -- I would rather they never used any at all, but the people who did it made it look decent. Not perfect, but pretty good. Better than in other contemporary horror or fantasy releases.The story of the doctor and his searches... that part left me unsure of how I felt. I got the impression that the heart and soul of the story is built around the two girls and the creepiness of the Mama ghost. The doctor seemed like he was added just to push it from a short film to 100 minutes. Not that this is a bad thing, but was it crucial? Was it maybe better as a short film? Hard to say.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Nutshell Review: Mama,"The title may be tacky, but this Canadian-Spanish co-production, with Guillermo del Toro lending his name as producer, is one of the better horror films to have come out from the West in recent years, despite being filled with the usual clichés, actually contain a proper story, and delivered really well in terms of chills, thrills and everything that's necessary to creep you out and make you jump at your seat. Co-written and directed by Andres Muschietti, Mama shows how it boils down to story, building upon his short film of the same name some 5 years ago, and a solid cast to gloss over the expected bag of tricks.Many of the clichés were put to good effect, which in some ways you'd come to expect certain things to happen in a certain way, and they did. While it may be blunted in terms of anticipation and build up, it didn't shy away from delivering that sucker punch when required, and kept good work in framing and editing for maximum impact when the moment called for the unabashed dip into tried and tested elements. One thing you'll note is how assured Muschietti's direction is, as if doing it all for the very first time, with the aim of wanting to stir up its scares really well. Liberal use of CG also helped, but never done in slip-shoddy fashion, which added a layer of positive production values to the film.I mean, there's creepy children, a ghoul that gate-crashes a reunion of sorts, and the usual spooky house no thanks to noises during strange timings, and the rote blinking of lights. All ingredients that you've seen utilized to the death in various horror film productions, but coming together really well in Mama, playing to the strengths of these elements while fiercely ignoring the negativity associated with lazier filmmakers who just slap these elements together, expecting them to work. It's not a special effects extravaganza when it's not required, and Mama showed just how its story and characters were allowed to lead, rather than to have strangely illogical moments, even for a horror film, fall coincidentally into place.Jessica Chastain may be the latest IT girl in Hollywood, and it's encouraging to note she's really going all out to take on various roles in different genres, despite her more recent art house leanings of late. Here, she's the quintessential scream queen, albeit only just, given her role of Annabel being a rock star wannabe, sporting almost full body tattoos that betray a rather soft demeanour, when her maternal instincts get called upon to look after the nieces of her boyfriend Lucas (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau). They were found after having disappeared for five years, which the opening sequence and credits would have pointed to an unnatural upbringing under the hands of the titular Mama ghoul. Battling for custody, it is with reluctance that the couple take the children under their wing, probably because Annabel knows she'll eventually be dumped with the kids, which did happen.And the entire middle act is when the fun begins, for fans of horror films forking out good money to be entertained with the roller coaster ride of scares. Muschietti and his story collaborators Neil Cross and Barbara Muschietti managed to keep an entire back story up their sleeves, to reveal them in teasing fashion, which worked to keep you engaged throughout. And credit must go to Muschietti and his DP Antonio Riestra for having framed the initial introduction to the ghoulish elements that went for maximum WTF surprises, especially with sleight of hand techniques that didn't jar the narrative, nor relied on the necessity of a jump cut edit to hammer home its creepier moments. It grows, slowly, and that's one master stroke Mama had that worked wonders.This is the second film in a row that had its child actors provide top notch performances. Megan Charpentier and Isabelle Nelisse play sisters, who with the aid of CG move around complete with unnatural mannerisms, having it in term to creep you out, before having to develop their characters into emotional cores that added a lot more depth to this film as it steamrolls its way to the finale. Andres Muschietti is the name to watch now for taking something that's expected to be cliché in a horror film, but fulfilled more than you'd bargain for. A definite recommend!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Creepy, Scary but with a Disappointing Conclusion","The senior partner of an investment brokerage Jeffrey (Nikolaj Coaster- Waldau) has a breakdown and kills his two associates and his wife. Then he takes his three-year old daughter Victoria and the one-year old daughter Lilly and drives his car through a winding snowing road to Clifton Forge. He has a car accident and fall off a cliff, but he brings his daughters to an abandoned and isolated cabin to kill them, but the children are saved by a creepy ghostly creature.Five years later, Jeffrey's brother Lucas finds the children that were raised without social relationship and claim that they have been raised by Mama. Lucas disputes the custody with the children's grandmother but Dr. Dreyfuss (Daniel Kash), who is studying the girls, selects Lucas to take care of the children. Lucas lives with his girlfriend Annabel (Jessica Chastain), who plays in a rock'n'roll band, and Victoria and Lilly moves to their house. Soon Lucas and Annabel find that the girls were not delusional and they are not alone in the house.""Mama"" is a creepy and scary horror movie, with a frightening story. The girls Megan Charpentier and Isabelle Nélisse have convincing performances in the role of two young sisters that are left alone in the woods for five years.

A Fantastic Film Experience,"I went into this film with high expectations. I am a horror movie junkie, despite their general lack of critical acclaim. They should be entertaining, even if they don't give you nightmares. After first viewing the trailer over the summer (rolling in for The Possession), I eagerly anticipated the January release. Seeing that Guillermo del Toro's name was attached to the project made me even more giddy. I saw it opening night.I was not disappointed. Not in the slightest. In fact, I was happier with the movie than I intended to be. Believe me, that's saying something.Not one scared by stories themselves, but solely by moments that utilize the element of surprise, I have never jumped out of my skin more times during a single film than I did for ""Mama."" That pretty much makes it the scariest movie that I have ever seen. However, seeing as different things scare different people, that is most likely not the same for everyone. If you aren't a jumper, don't worry, it's still very much worth it.The story is not your typical ghost story. It has a terrific exposition to settle you into the film's focus. The situation is solitary enough that you won't yourself experience it, but isn't so far-fetched that it's unbelievable. The characters are both likable and flawed, which gives them dimension and makes them more interesting. And the girls are adorable, but not so cute that it detracts from the terror. As you can see, the film is very much balanced. A good film needs that balance.As far as scares go, some are quite subtle. A few you don't particularly realize are happening until something changes, and you're caught off-guard. Seeing that the premise is supernatural, the idea of an elusive antagonist is key. You can't see too much of what you're supposed to be afraid of, and for the majority of the movie, you don't. The cloud of mystery surrounding Mama herself is hauntingly beautiful, and will both demonize and delight you. By the time you finish it, you will most likely feel both happy and sad, and will not know where your emotions should be.I highly recommend ""Mama"" to anyone, because it is not your stereotypical horror movie. Its distinct lack of gore, and high level of well-crafted story, makes for an exciting experience for both horror lovers, and those who don't necessarily appreciate the genre. If you get the chance to watch it, take it immediately. If you aren't given the chance to watch it, make the chance yourself.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Good, not perfect.",Generally the story is quite attention getting and most of the cast play their parts well. The music really helps pull the movie together and it does have a fairly creepy vibe all the way through.Yes there are some unanswered questions. Yes there are some plot holes. I can't say I feel like we got the full story and some of the characters were a little bit of a throwaway part. Some of the CGI is good. Some of it isn't.That doesn't stop me enjoying it and would say give it a try if you've not had the chance to see it.Recommended.,7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Besides the structure, design and vibe everything else is mediocre","I liked the structure, design and vibe of this movie but everything else was kinda mediocre. It's basically a ghost haunting movie, of course the ghosts in different movies haunts for different reasons. But this one is a ghost haunting movie. Where two sibling kids that move like a spider Gollum especially the younger one that gets found in a small house in the woods. And a couple decides to take care of them because the guy feels responsible because they are the daughters of his brother who disappeared. And the 30yr old garage band girl who is the girlfriend of the guy because she feels that she needs to put up with it. This movie does a decent job of making a dis-likable character somewhat likable near the end. Like I said the structure, design and vibe adds a lot to the creepiness but when it comes to the story, it doesn't really stand out. This movie is much better than ""Don't Be Afraid Of The Dark"" which is another movie presented by Guillermo del Toro. But it doesn't reach the psychedelic dreamlike vibe that is creepy or even scary and yet beautiful although it tries to be. The film ""The Orphanage"" comes to mind.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Amending The Horror Story,"Horror has been one of the least appreciated film genres nowadays for relying nothing more than the excessive amount of violence and repetitive jump scares, plodding the storytelling by its completely lifeless characters who are ready to get killed. Mama is something else however it still has those horror movie clichés, like those easy loud jump scares and some ghostly pathos, but there is a fascinating concept behind the scares that leaves the audience a beautiful story than just a cheap horror shock. It also has a set of strong performances and solid production. It could have been much genuine in being scary than simply loud but Mama is still one of the great horror films we got in a while.Unlike most modern horror films, this movie's ambition is to tell a compelling story. Obviously there is a hidden emotion beneath the concept, but before we get to that, it explores around the characters and the gloomy atmosphere. Rather than throwing a horrific death scene to show fear, it scatters some symbolic objects that indicate the presence of the titular monster. It's a fascinating trick of manifesting its mysteries and fear. What defy the odds of the genre are the characters. They are not only ought to get scared. This is a rare set of modern horror characters that possesses a genuine soul. The performances handle them terrifically. There is a lot of remarkable performance to talk about but anyway. It's not only about the scares. It finely balances the drama to the darkness of the story. Personally, it's kind of more interesting when it simply tells the story of the two kids and the Mama ghost even though it features a horror cliché of ghosts telling their past to the central character. In the end, we'll realize the film actually offers more to the picture.The only largest misstep they had is the excessive amount of loud jump scares. Though, they can be effective at some point. They still used some other ways of scaring the audience, like mimicking the clever horror trick of ""The Orphanage"" and letting the character be alone exploring the creepiness going on. It could have lingered on those parts to feel the danger of the characters, but instead they immediately send off a loud jump scare because it works to everyone. The film uses some CGI which made the monsters look a bit awkward but they are decent enough. Everything looks great in general. The cinematography and the production are a total pay off. It's just beautiful to look at.Mama turns out to be pretty good. At glance, it doesn't look like the kind of horror film we usually thought about but furthermore we get to realize it is beyond than we should expect. The clichés still exists but they are used in a better way. Putting aside those cheap scares, it's a refreshing story that is indeed worth telling. It's still far from classic but it is also far from generic and annoying like most horror films we get these days. The performances and the filmmaking give more to the experience. Mama is the kind of horror film that abandons the gruesome acts and rather shows its dark aspects in a quite endearing way.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
IMDb rating is far too high in my opinion,"My girlfriend & I bought this DVD to watch one evening & we both could not get to grips with it, the story is too far-fetched & lacked any aspect that could draw the viewer in, there are few ""jumpy bits"". The only merit of this film is that the character ""Mama"" is a real person where the only changes are that his hair is CGI. Upon seeing the film on the shelf I turned to IMDb, as I usually do to see what the ratings are, most modern horrors tend to score relatively low but this seemed to have a respectable score which I think is ill-considered. Another film where a potential good idea has been poorly executed, I would not recommend this film to anybody, extremely annoyed that I paid £7 to own this.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

"A Haunted House Movie, But With Something I've Never Seen Before","This is a movie by Andrés Muschietti. You've never heard of him because this is his first major motion picture. Yep, basically a first time director. 'Mama' was the most anticipated horror movie from November of 2012 to when it came out, and ""The Best Horror Movie of the Year"" until April 2013, form a first time director. So, I saw it on opening weekend, and I thought... How could a first time director make such a good horror movie.There were many scares in this movie that were in the trailers. That's why it was so anticipated... But it was still really good. The beginning was... Odd, but interesting. They also did a good job at having you see the ghost that was in a very good context. It started out with a lot of potential and made a clear path for itself. After the title sequence it got slow, like basically all horror movies do; but it was interesting. There was some creepy with the girls, but it was in a bit of an unexplained context. It's hard to explain. There was good acting, good dialog, and character buildup that worked. Some very creepy and unnerving things happened in coming up scenes that worked well for this movie. Muschietti was doing a really good job at throwing the scares at us.Coming up, there were many, many creepy moments, especially with the little girls. Some unfortunate things happen to the family, but it happens for a good reason. That also worked in the movie. Coming up there were even more creepy and even scary things that happened. It did turn into a haunted house movie, but several things happened outside of the house, and this wan't done like most haunted house movies. I liked seeing something different in this type of movie. It worked about as well as the cliché haunted house movie horror events and scares, but still, it was new. There were creepy, suspenseful, intense moments that made most of the creepy parts scary. It was good that this movie was able to pull those scares off. There were some jump scares in this part, but it was less about the point that something was jumping out at you. Some of them were the point that little girls don't do that or the point that those things aren't supposed to to happen. The ones that were just jump scares were so big and done so well that it was actually scary, not just a jump scare. I've rarely seen a movie pull that off.Coming up, the movie gets extremely intense, suspenseful, creepy, and more scary. Odd things happened, big things to the story line happened, and scary things happened. The scares in past parts of the movie had to do with the sounds or the facts that things like that were not supposed to happen or intense, creepy parts. The scares now almost mainly focused on the visuals. There were very scary things that popped on the screen and were done almost perfectly. There were also realistic reactions and very well done written and directed scenes. There were some things that I had never seen before, but some that I had seen before.I rate everything up to the end 9/10, but the end brought it down to 7/10, because the ending was horrible. Several things that had been scary in recent parts or earlier in the movie in general, stopped being scary, and were just there. It wasn't scary: it was slow, stupid, badly written, and didn't belong with a horror movie. I don't know why the writers decided to do that, and that Andrés Muschietti decided to execute it that way. It also started to make scary things earlier in the movie not seem as scary when you look back on them.'Mama' was good, scary, and done well. It could have been an 8/10 or 9/10 if the ending was good, but it was not. It did not bother me later at all, but it was still scary. I recommend this movie to anyone who's thinking about seeing it. I bought this movie on Blu-Ray, too. The 7/10 rating means I thought the movie was good.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Finely a movie that is creepy.,"I keep waiting for a movie that is supposedly creepy to actually be creepy. This one is. Baby Lily and older sister Victoria are whisked off by their father, who killed his partners and wife and is fleeing. He spins off an icy road, over an embankment, and the three of them wander in the woods and come across a cabin. They go inside, and he gets suddenly killed. His brother never stopped looking for them, and five years later they are found. Since Victoria was older, therapy helped her better but Lily still is quire feral. He makes drawings, and she is in a punk band, but they want custody. His sister also wants custody. The institution that worked with the children provides him with a large home, rent free, so the kids can stay there. His sister lives far away. Pay attention to the black moths and the movie will provide a very nice assortment of both jump scares and creepiness. His wife, Annabel never wanted kids, has no experience, and is told she will have a tough chore, but she expects Lucas to do the majority of the care. The spirits have other intentions. The children were able to survive for those five years with Mama taking care of them. But who or what is Mama? The last act has a lot of tension. I just wish there was a bit more on the back story. One gets the outline, but it is rather bare.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
God Awful.,"One of the worst bits of dribble I've ever seen. Continuity was god awful, cinematography was horrendous and If I had written that script I would have hung myself. I walked out the cinema! Terrible. Oh, and zero suspense as I knew the ending with in the first 10 minuets! Have some originality.Just wanted to warn you, don't normally write reviews, but it had to be done. Don't watch this movie, you see the the main evil person in the first 5 minuets, now come on thats no way to build suspense. Another thing, worst CGI I have ever seen, its not that difficult to hire a better visual effects artist.The director should be ashamed.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Mama delivers the terror while building a exceptional story for a horror film.,"""MAMA"", a film executively produced by Del Toro follows the story of two little girls that are found in the wilderness for five years. They are then adopted by their Uncle Luke (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) and his girlfriend Annabel (Jessica Chastain)and right off the bat, strange things start happening. While trapped in the woods, Victoria (Megan Charpentier)and Lily (Isabelle Nelisse) formed a guardian to protect and care for them, who they call Mama.This is an excellent movie. Be warned that it does remain dependant on jump scares to scare you, but they are what I like to call ""true jump scares"". Not a cat bursting out of a corner, or a shoe falling from the sky. ""Mama"" utilizes CGI by creating dark, disturbing images along with a tense orchestral sound track to scare your pants off. The acting was also superb, particularly Jessica Chastain and Megan Charpentier. Isabelle was solid also, but I had a feeling that before every take, she was told what to do, but Megan was old enough to understand the script and story. Something that really impressed me was how the story unfolded, and how beautifully the mother daughter relationship was portrayed. The cinematography was also one of the most beautiful jobs I've ever seen on a horror film. Camera work was steady and the dolly shots were smooth and suspenseful. Overall, Mama was a terrifying horror movie with a beautiful story and wonderful camera work. I hope this movie is recognized as a classic for years to come. This movie also proves that PG-13 horror movies can be scary after all. 9/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Mama has flaws, but great concept","I really liked this movie and the concept for it was original. I think this film makes the viewer think about what the characteristics are of being a mother. What sort of instincts we as woman can display and what kind of connections can be made with a child, even if you're a terrifying ghost.Del Toro will always put his name on a good thriller surrounding small children. This movie had all the thrills of a scary movie and the elements fright used in the film had everyone in my theater on the edge of the seat. The movie waist no time getting into the meat of the story.There are flaws in the film and it does have to do with plot holes. The director could have worked these holes out with other writers......like Del Toro perhaps. The back story had the hugest gap of all.Regardless, it was better than 'Don't be Afraid of the Dark', and I will be seeing this film again.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Damn it! Damn it! Tricked again!,"Let's add another crappy pg-13 horror movie to the ever growing unfortunate list of crappy pg-13 horror movies shall we. The only reason I decided to view this flick (in the theatre no less), is because Guillermo Del Toro was a producer on the flick. Fair warning, unless those big names are actually making the movie themselves don't watch it. Here's another horror flick that startles you, not scares you, with jump sequences. Another horror flick that involves some long haired brunette girl that walks or moves like their having a spaz attack. Story sucked, acting sucked, it just flat out sucked. I would love to see a modern day horror film that frightens you with it's story and it's intense believable acting and terrifying premise. It must be really tough because so far there is only a few good horror movies in the past 20 years.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

Interesting Fresh Horror Film.,"I was not disappointed in Mama in the slightest. I found the story original and fascinating. The acting was well done. The children were great and the character of Mama was very creepy indeed, even if I did feel a bit sorry for her back story just a tiny point.I don't see why people seem to have a problem with the second half of the film. I found it just as solid as the first part. I was engrossed right through the whole film and was not left feeling cheated of any scares or thrills.The storyline is solid, and like I said previously it feels like a fresh creepy idea and certainly had the great atmosphere which I feel makes a good horror film. I am pleased to have it on my DVD shelf.Would definitely recommend.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
original in parts despite some recycled horror tropes; good acting but nothing stellar; eerie with some really cool scenes and an unexpected ending,"Foremost, I avoided this movie for so long due to the title and premise. I tend to step right over horror movies whose central plot device revolves around children. I of course never realized Jessica Chastain was the lead, who I love, and am also a big fan of Nicolaj Coster-Waldau. Both did great, and the kids did as well, but weren't as front and center as I was dreading. Overall a balanced story with some original takes in plot and cinematography, but nothing outstanding. Cosmetic effects for the titular creature/entity were great, though. Tangible suspense despite some tired horror tropes used to death these days. Still entertaining, especially with a really cool first-person dream sequence and a rather uniquely unexpected ending. If you're a big fan of Chastain, definitely an 8 in my book; if you're not, I'd still ground it as a high 6 or low 7. I'm being a little generous with my rating given my low expectations.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Boo,"Other than the two child actresses doing a great acting job, there is not much to say about this movie other than it is really bad.The premise of the movie starts out halfway decent but after about 30 minutes the curiosity starts to die. There was no thought put into the ghost or whatever she is,nor is there any background as to why she even exists. If you are a true horror fan, this movie will do nothing to satisfy. The ending of this movie is so ""out there"" that I started laughing and couldn't stop. I wasn't even going to watch this movie after reading some of the reviews but I guess curiosity got the best of me. Don't waste your time on this one.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
An impressive debut by Andres Muschietti. It's a spooky and intelligent horror film.,"Mama is the best horror film I've seen in a while. It works thanks to the efforts of director and ambitious newcomer Andres Muschietti. Another reason why the film works is because it was produced by the visionary Guillermo del Toro. Barbara Muschietti, the director's sister, was also a producer. The scares here are a product of the mother's attachment to the children, and this theme works well in the context of the film. The mother in question is certainly a frightening creation. While there are jump scares the majority of the horror involves tension and mystery. This makes Mama seem similar to Gore Verbinski's The Ring (2002). The cinematography of The Ring is dominated by the colors blue and green. Antonio Riestra's beautiful cinematography for Mama is dominated by brown and black. All this makes the film an interesting chiller, and I enjoyed the atmosphere as much as I enjoyed the story. In the end though it's not easy to feel sympathy for the mother. Some scenes show to the audience that she's a sympathetic character, but she's still too scary and her acts too gruesome to make her really sympathetic. Another quirk is that the acting isn't always suitable, so even critics' darling Jessica Chastain doesn't always deliver with Muschietti's direction. One of the influences on Mama was obviously the Japanese horror genre. The best releases from that genre ended before the mid-2000s, but Mama shows that elements from it can still be effective. All in all it's an engaging horror film, and I recommend seeing it.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Most reviewers must have only saw the first half of what I saw,"I had high hopes after reading some very positive reviews and after the impressive performance Chastain gave in Zero Dark Thirty. For the first half of the movie those expectations seemed to be largely met. Some good old school horror thrills as others have said. Things got more and more ridiculous as the movie progressed and had to reveal more of what was going on to keep the suspense going. It was still not too bad until the ending which all I can say (without giving anything away) was completely ridiculous. The first sign of trouble for me was when a character jumps into their SUV and drives into the middle of nowhere to a creepy old cabin by themselves, timed to arrive at night, with nothing but a flashlight. That's just the first hint of how dumb things get.Yea, it's about ghosts so you have to kind of leave your logic and reason at the door but the ending was bad enough that it transcends that. I'm not even getting into the ridiculous fact there are all these strange things and sounds going on in the house day after day with a couple creepy kids acting even more creepy when it happens and the parental characters don't even bother to look into it. Not even so much as opening closets after seeing something go in there.The only reason to watch this movie is for Chastain who made the most of a ridiculous script.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Mama! I don't want to die I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all!,"Typical movies like ""Mama"", by which I mean PG-13 ghost movies with computerized shock-effects, definitely aren't my thing but I will admit straight away that I cherish some respect and appreciation for this particular movie. ""Mama"" is fundamentally a very clichéd and ordinary flick about a fiendish supernatural entity, but writer/director Andrés Muschietti single-handedly brings it to a higher level thanks to processing realistic main characters and socially relevant themes into his screenplay. I was particularly impressed by the opening sequences that so unscrupulously deal with family tragedy. A clearly desperate middle-aged father reportedly killed three people already, including his ex-wife, and drags his two young daughters to a secluded cabin in the woods where he sees no other alternative than to kill them and himself as well. We regretfully see a lot of tragic news facts like this one on TV, but for some reason they still remain taboo in movie scenarios. The supernatural aspect kicks in when the father is prevented to fulfill his vile act of desperation by a ghostly long black-haired entity. The plot then subsequently introduces two other identifiable main characters, namely the girls' uncle Lucas who's overpowered by feelings of guilt and responsibility and his rock artist girlfriend Annabel who supports her man but is actually reluctant to take the girls into custody. Annabel even becomes the lead guardian when Lucas gets severely injured in a bizarrely inflicted accident. The rest of the film is familiar ghost-movie stuff, meaning predictable plot-twists, a too large portion of sentiment and an avalanche of textbook ""boo!"" situations. For you see, throughout a long 5 year period, the poor little sisters survived in that little cabin in the woods because they were being looked after by the restless spirit of a mother who got murdered in that same location many years ago. When the uncle finds and ""rescues"" the estranged girls, the Mama-ghost turns malevolent and follows them to the civilized world. The Mama figure, with its long weaving dark hair and bizarrely produced sounds, is very reminiscent to the ghosts introduced in popular Japanese blockbusters, like ""Ringu"" and ""Ju-On: The Grudge"", and the film makes the typical mistake of showing it too much and too frequently. In this type of scary flicks, the less you see of the evil, the more menacing it is. Jessica Chastain gives a stellar performance and a handful of scenes are definitely unsettling. Andrés Muschietti initially released ""Mama"" as a short film, but thanks to the interest of certain influential producers like Guillermo Del Toro, it became a large-budgeted and internationally acclaimed long-feature horror hit as well. I read that his next project will be an upcoming remake of ""It"" What is it with promising young directors immediately blocking their creativity by making redundant remakes?!?",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Great story with a unique turn on horror.,"Are your kidding me a 6.5? This movie is a great story offering a thriller in ways you are not expecting.

Just Absolutely Terrible - The Tooth Fairy Could Be Scarier Than This!,"Now - lets get this straight, even though I am very young (lets say 15-) I have seen more horror movies that I wish to count (I've been watching them since I was 3-4)and I've seen the good ones, the bad ones, and the ugly ones... But this is one of those pictures where the previews are far far scarier than the actual movie. Nothing in the film makes to much sense. There seems to be no logical reason for anything to be happening. It turns out to be a very simple 'ghost' story. The middle part and the ending of the film is what let the whole production down. For about an hour nothing much happens to advance the story...it is an hour of ""whoops...I see the 'ghost'...whoops it went away"" This central hour of the film goes on too long like that. The end, however, was just....god awful. It was painfully obvious that whoever wrote this movie had no freaking idea how to end it. The result of this? One of the worst endings to a horror movie I have ever seen In my entire life. They exposed said ""mama"" WAY too much. the CGI made this movie incredibly hard to take seriously. Even the representation of the 'ghost' was disappointing!I cannot believe how many good reviews 'Mama' has received. When I realised that Del Toro was the producer of this film, I had high hopes as I loved the Orphanage'. I was however, bitterly disappointed in this film which was not even jumpy. The plot did not make any sense i.e. why were the characters wandering around in the middle of the night when there was a ghost so obviously waiting to harm them? Why was the psychologist (or whatever he was) keeping mama a secret from the other characters. Plot aside, the CGI Mama was hilariously funny looking and not scary in the slightest. This one 'horror' had me in stitches!",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
first paranormal themed scary film in ages that actually scared me,"Like the title says, i enjoyed this movie immensely, the usual horror clichés are there but i still feel the movie felt fresh, and did things slightly differently from the norm. Mama herself is an excellent creation,they keep her image out of it until later for maximum tension, and then when she is unleashed its like all the dread thats been building explodes into fear. her movement etc is exactly what is needed to make this sort of film scary. There are a couple of moments that are pure terror and i was laughing after a few of the bits just because i was so amused and entertained by the scariness. My girlfriend actually moaned with fear at one point! Her face throughout the 2nd half was priceless :P i think some of the other reviewers are being overly critical, yes the end wasn't amazing but it think it did a much better job than a lot of other films like this, and seeing this gives me hope that there's still very scary things that can be done in this genre of horror. :)Its maybe not a 10, more an 8.5/9 but im giving it a ten to balance out the negative reviews.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

dreadful film,I rented this movie thinking it had the basis to be the kind of movie that would at least give me a decent scare and instead it was cheaply crafted and had poor acting and an even more dreadful plot. Nothing about it made any sense at all and it was tortuous just watching the young actresses in the film play their roles and even thought they did it rather nicely it was not enough to carry the story. I would not recommend this movie to anyone because I had a hard time trying to understand the story and was bored constantly the entire time the movie was going from one dreadful scene to the other and finally I even had to admit to myself that I no longer cared what happened when it finally came to its terrible and pitiful end. Sadly directed and written and a total waste of two hours of bad film.,1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Had good potential, but a trite ending","This movie had so much potential, but sadly peaked in the middle and went down hill from there.The beginning of the storyline was also badly explained (I still don't understand why the father went did what he did at the beginning) but that didn't really matter as the story developed.Overall I found the film well shot, with some genuinely jumpy parts in places. Some of the CGI was excellent and the performance of Julia Chantrey very convincing (it's the first time I've seen a film with her in).Sadly, however, the storyline seemed to move away from a horror and moved towards a fantasy thriller.

Who will mother the abandoned kids?,"Is it two well-intentioned but ill-equipped near relations, a state psychologist, or a space-time phenomenon?The film plays on childlike sensibilities meets extraordinary circumstances. Children take kindly to their protectors, however much it brings them trouble in the end. The film explores many facets of this, and like dark fairytales of the past takes its cut from the very young.Mama is a unique film that does a great job in many respects. The children do look terrifying at times and they also act naturally, sometimes brattish and difficult, other times doting.Some themes provoke thought. But the ending stretches a bit long. I am not sure this film nails all it's important themes (such as what ""wrong"" did the ghost want to fix?) or beats, but it is certainly a worthy film if you like Pan's Labyrinth (same director) as well as horror films set in modern times.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

It could do better...,"This is a difficult film to assess. I enjoyed it for what it was, which is an efficient horror film that'll give you the creeps and has child actors who WON'T make you want to gouge your eyes out. At the same time, I thought it could've gone further in terms of the scenario, but was limited in scope... both by trying to appeal to a mass market, and the need to get a low rating so irresponsible adults could take their kids to see it. Just like Chuck Norris refusing to take part in The Expendables 2 unless they ditched the bad language and graphic violence. They should have just let him go...Mama is not exactly a terrifying creation... we've seen plenty of nasties like her in this genre before. What makes the movie is the introduction, which is brilliant and sets the scene perfectly, and the atmosphere... full of dark shadows and foreboding... check out what goes on in the background, too. After a while though, an air of predictability descends, we are able to guess who'll survive, what each character will decide to do, where Mama is gonna appear next... and it all becomes rather humdrum. A very nice attempt, but lacking in ambition stops it from reaching it's full potential. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Bottom of the Barrel,"Make no mistake about it, this film was horrendous. Not even Jessica Chastain or Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau could save this stinker. Though they were good in their roles, (particularly Jessica Chastain) there was nothing they good do to save this stinker. To be honest I can't figure out why they took part in a movie with such a nonsensical script. Then there was the CGI, oh my god it looked terrible, scary? Jesus it was almost laughable, on top of that it relied almost entirely on generic jump scares with that stingy sound that you have seen hundreds of times before, instead of jumping I just cringed. Every time. I would have actually turned it off but I watched it in a friends house so I didn't wanna be rude.But then I wouldn't have seen the grand finale!

"A typical horror film, but not a typical drama.","Guillermo del Toro's Mama was one of the first horror films I saw in my youth, I was 7 at the time and it seemed really scary, interesting and terrifying. And strangely enough I keep watching it even at the age of 20, the plot feels typical but has its own ideology. Yes, the film may be full of clichéd plot devices like loud noises, but the story and the character of ""Mum"" compensate for them.The film opens with a father who has destroyed his family and job due to a bad situation in his life and has run away with his children to an abandoned forest cabin where he is going to shoot them and then shoot himself, but then a creature suddenly appears from a black wall and wrings his neck. From that moment on, the girls start living in an abandoned house with their ""mother"". They live there for 4 years, their 'mum' periodically feeds them cherries and looks after them, while the girls continue to live, chat and talk to her. Afterwards, a police patrol finds their closest relative, the girls' uncle, and the creepy creature moves in with the daughters.Despite the fact that the film can't be called new, still 2013, the special effects and the image of ""Mom"" itself impressed me quite a bit. The creature looks quite creepy and unusual, I always miss that in horror movies. And the story itself is interesting, not just some ""evil spirit that's been disturbed and is now obscurantist"". There's a fascinating backstory that even makes you feel a little sorry for ""Mama"". And there's a satisfying ending, too. It's there and it's not bad at all! What you don't often find in such horror films. Of course, the film is not without its flaws, but all in all I advise you to watch it on a cozy evening.Of course, the film is not new, but for 2013 the film is very good, especially because every year a very similar analogues or some interpretation of the film come out. The creature (""Mother"") looks quite creepy and unusual, that's always lacking in horror movies. And the story itself is very interesting and touching, not just some evil spirit who has been disturbed, but a caring mother who protects her children. There's a fascinating backstory of its own that even makes you feel a little sorry for ""Mama"".The acting: At the time, the actors were not as well known as they are now, for example the same Uncle became famous as Coster-Waldau from Game of Thrones. That's not to say they didn't play well because they were at the beginning of their acting careers, they acted very realistically, you really believed each and every one of them. The film did a great job of revealing each character, their story and their role in the film. While watching it, you really feel that atmosphere and already understand the character.To conclude, can drama, be horror, and horror be dramatic. We get the answer in the ending of this film. The film shows us incredibly strong characters and a strong story that can be both terrifying and very moving.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Nothing about this film is original, every scene reminds me of other movies.The woman in black, sinister and insidious, These are all movies that where wrote all over this. To go into more detail would ruin this movie, even if it is predictable, I will leave the door wide open to the small-minded individuals. On a side note the acting was nicely done, it saved the movie. I would have left the theatre otherwise.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

a lot of jump scene's and it looked great except for the ending,"Mama was the revelation of the film festival in Brussels. Everybody was screaming towards the screen and it even went so far that newspapers in Belgium were talking about THE horror flick to watch. So I did and I must say that I had mixed feelings about the flick.I don't have any problem with Guillermo del Toro. I liked his flick Pan's labyrinth (2006) and I even could dig his remake of Don't Be Afraid Of The Dark (2010). But there lays the problem for horror buffs. There's always something fairy tale attached to his creatures. Just look at Don't Be Afraid...The monsters did look scary but they were full CGI and they could come straight out of a Disney flick or Lord Off The Rings or The Hobbit. I think you know what I mean.Here the creature does look scary, even as it is done CGI, and the flick do has a lot of jump scene's that really worked. I even liked the story because the acting by the two children in the beginning in the cabin (after 5 years) was amazing. You just can't see what is coming and I sometimes even had the feeling that I was watching one of those Japanese ghost horror stories, you know, with the hair coming out of the wall or ceiling. We do have a bit of that too.I know that Del Toro was executive producer but that means that he delivers the money so his influence in the way it was made is clearly to spot.I was thinking, yes I can understand the hype but once everything comes clear about the mama ghost and the child it slowly turns in a bit of pathetic flick. For me the ending was a let down. I won't go into that part because a lot is already said about the ending.If you like horror flicks with a lot of jump scene's than this is surely your thing and somehow I enjoyed it too. It even became creepy at moments but the ending. You will love it or hate it. But watch it especially for Megan Charpentier (the red queen in the last Resident Evil) and Isabelle Nélisse as Victoria and Lilly.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 4/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
This was awesome!,"The scariest, most unpredictable film I've seen in a long time. Fantastic photography, sound and effects, with brilliant acting, especially Jessica Chastain as Annabelle.

From realism into cartoon,"Some movies progress from a cartoonish style into realism – think of the animated flashbacks of Krampus or Harry Potter. This movies does the opposite. In particular, the fiend looks like a fuzzy version of Snow White's evil queen, and we see more and more of her as the movie progresses. It is no surprise that Del Toro produced this movie and was set to direct it. The last scene, with its heavy CGI and exclusively blue color palette seems to have been lifted from Pan's Labyrinth. In other movies, stylization shows how the memory transforms the past into legend. Or how one mind disconnects from reality, like in Pan's Labyrinth. Here there is not much reason for it. It works to the movie's advantage however, as it elevates what threatened to sag into a classic scary girl story into a more memorable fantasy show.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Holy Mama!,"Holy Mama!! Guillermo del Toro has stayed true to his style with this one. It's a very creepy and dark flick which just might capture top notch this opening weekend. With a pg-13 rating, you can expect a lot of intense pop-out scenes. However, Guillermo del Toro doesn't disappoint the audience as he gives us something to look at too. That's because Mama is today's modern CGI ghost that isn't bashful to show her retched face to the characters in the film (and us).The brief storyline is that two girls have survived out in the wild after their father murders his wife, takes the girls and crashes his car off a cliff in the middle of nowhere. After being found by the father's brother, the girls are re-acclimated to society after 5 years in the woods raised by, you guessed it, Mama.There is a back story to mama that gets woven into the mix, which is the reason why good horror films are successful. However, the more interesting aspect of the movie for me was the brief transition from ""Wild"" to ""Normal"" life. There could have been more to this I think.I would love to see the little sister, Lilly (Isabelle Nélisse), get an Oscar for her performance. Seriously!! It's downright eerie and just isn't something you would expect to see from a 6 year old. And she nailed it.All in all, if you like to be scared, this will do it. If you like to be freaked, this will do it. If you like ghost movies, check this one out, but fair warning, this ""Ghost"" isn't like Patrick Swayze.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A favorite horror movie,"So in all honesty, I'm picky about my horror. If the film implies there's a monster it had darn well better be a monster, I don't care of it's Godzilla or something more paranormal. Seems to me these days 'horror' is less about those things and more about the scary thing being the product of mental illness or just some creepy but ultimately human thing. Or on a Saw level just blood and gore and guts and not anything else that's actually scary.This is where I wish there were more movies like Mama. It's a perfect balance of yes, there is actually a monster combined with the perfect amount of jump scares in just the right places. Not so many as to make them less effective over the course of the movie, but enough to keep you on edge as to where the next one might be.On top of that it involves children being the creepy ones in addition to the monster, and children being creepy always just seems to add to the scary factor of a movie.This has become one of my favorite horror movies over the years, one I keep turning to as a prime example of what the horror genre should be.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"MY REVIEW: Oh, What a Waste of Potential!!","Mama. Created as long feature film from a short Spanish film, Mama has everything that a horror movie asks for. Kids as the central characters so that you always want them out of danger, terrific atmosphere, a chilling mystery and few endearing supporting characters. Still movie never succeeds in pushing the envelope and fails to exploit its potential. Jessica Chastain a rock band member who is given the difficult task of caring about two little girls does good and holds the movie together. But movie belongs to little girls; elder one bridging the emotions of real and super natural world and younger one who enjoys a comfortable relationship with her ghost care taker. First half is good, raising doubts and questions and having few scary moments but second half fails to raise the stakes and summing up the story in a chilling manner. Showing the ghost doesn't work here. I am going with not bad 6 out of 10 for Mama. It could have been much more but restricts itself being a run of mill horror flick.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Guillermo del Toro... is just an executive producer in this film. Nothing more than that.,"There's a new gimmick in Hollywood these days. Recruit a famous writer/director of the past and gave them any crappy post in the movie and then publicized the movie using their name. Same goes with Mama. Guillermo del Toro's name has been used to promote the film heavily. But the matter of fact is that he's just an executive producer in the film. Nor he's the writer nor the director of this mindless CGI based crap. As far as the movie goes, its a disappointment overall. I had expected something lot creepier and mindful cinema but what i got was a total CGI based flick based on the premises of The Exorcist and god knows how many movies. See, frankly speaking those days are gone when a CGI created ghost in long gowns and disoriented faces used to scare the s**t out of audiences. Now as an audience people want more mindful and intellectual cinema, be it any genre. Mama's premises was very solid but it was ruined by some really loose script. And lastly, who in the blue is Jessica Chastain???? Is she some Meryll Streep or Julia Roberts? No disregard to her acting but the way the film is promoted as a Jessica Chastain movie is ridiculous. Grow up Hollywood. Audiences had already.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Supernatural thriller isn't bad but, needs more scares and less CGI.","Mama isn't a bad horror film but, it just isn't a very scary one. The story is good, two little girls are taken by their off-the-edge dad (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) who's just shot their mother and some co-workers. They crash off the road during dad's escape attempt and wind up in a decrepit old cabin in the woods. One that possibly has an otherworldly occupant. A few years later, they are found alive, somehow having survived and these now feral children are given over to their dad's twin brother Lucas (also Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) and his rocker wife, Annabel (Jessica Chastain). But, the girl's don't seem to have come alone and whatever has followed them isn't happy about sharing them. The problems with Mama aren't from it's story, it's that despite giving the film a nicely spooky visual style, director Andres Muschietti doesn't build much tension, suspense or scares. There are a few creepy sequences and some well executed jump scares but, the biggest problem is that ""Mama"" is revealed far too early and it is an obvious CGI specter that is simply not scary. Even when an accident leaves Annabel alone for a while with the girls and their adoptive spook, there is little suspense as Annabel tries to figure out why strange things are happening . It is very well done as Annabel goes from selfish bitch to someone who really cares about the girls and want's to solve the mystery of who ""Mama"" is but, it's never scary or carries much tension or suspense. Then, the final act switches gears and we go from a horror film to a Gothic fairy tale ending. I don't think the change in tone quite worked. Ironically I liked the last act very much but, not attached to the rest of the movie. The cast are all good here with Chastain standing out as the bass player wife and reluctant overnight mom. She comes across as a bitch early on but, believably transforms the character into a woman who comes to care about her nieces and is willing to put herself at risk to fight for them. The girls are wonderful too, Megan Charpentier as the older Victoria who starts to see ""Mama"" for the dangerous entity she is and Isabelle Nelisse as the younger Lilly who still is very attached to ""Mama"" and sees her as a friend and maternal figure. The script is good, it just seems director Muschietti didn't quite know how to give it the edge it needs and the switch in tone for the last act is a bit jarring. Overall Mama is not a bad supernatural thriller and there is a lot to like about it but, it just doesn't quite effectively give the material the strength it needed to keep us riveted or peeking through our fingers which is what a film like this is supposed to do.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Hidden Gem,"I have watched a LOT of horror movies, and it is always a genuine pleasure to come across a truly original and creepy movie that has not been over hyped. I am not a big fan of slasher movies like Halloween, or torture porn like Motel and Saw. But love a good supernatural horror. And this is one. The acting is first class, especially the two child leads, who are convincing and disturbing at the same time. The story line is original, which is no mean feat in itself, and there are some very creepy and scary moments. The ending is a little drawn out and over wrought , but that is excusable given the It would be hard to give a synopsis without giving anything away, but if you enjoy excellent supernatural horror you really should check this out.

Mama is a perfect get away for the horror movie lovers !!!,"""The degree of raising a child is always greater than giving birth to the child"". The story of Mama deals with the same concept with powerful story line and few chilling scenes. Annabel and Lucas finds takes the custody of their nieces who were left in a deep-thick forest alone for 5 years after their father was killed by unidentified person. Drama begins to unfold as they portrayed weird behavior during their stay in Uncle's house and tell the story of how did they survive 5 years in the black forest. From Guilermo Del Torro, Mama is a complete surprise as a ghost movie. After a long time , I watched a horror movie with a very powerful story. The film boast off some spine chilling moments along with great visualization. Cinematography is excellent along with good art direction. The film looses the steam in the later half but is compensated with strong climax. Jessica Chastian is dependable and gives a great performance. kid actors did fine job to their role.Overall , Mama is a perfect get away for the horror movie lovers. Good 3/5",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""Mama"" surprises with great scares and superb performances","The Guillermo del Toro produced ""Mama"" is an overwhelmingly creepy film, rich in fine acting and startling visuals. It tells the tale of two young girls who, after having lived alone in the woods for five years, are rescued by a young couple. What was keeping them alive? We soon find out, as a very protective ghostly Mama reveals herself at the family's house, and quickly begins trying to take ""her"" girls back where they belong. This is a solid ghost story, atmospheric and frightening, but softened by an overuse of unnecessary CGI and far too many cliché genre inclusions. But the amazing performances, especially those of the two young girls, summon this thriller back from the dead and into the realm of Good Movies.-Thomas Bond",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"New director, old ideas","Mama can be compared to the American horror movie ""the ring"". In its long static shots of suspense and excitement. But it does not deliver the same suspense that the ring created with the little girl. I myself am afraid of scary little girls more than scary little ... mamas.It opens on a scene of the father of these little girls taking them from their home saying ""mommy is not feeling well and we gotta go."" Driving through the snow at a very high speed. The father seems easily agitated and scared.Driving way to fast he falls off the road and his car hits a tree. Somehow he and both his little girls survive and they are walking in the woods alone until they see a cabin in these woods.Something is wrong. He has a gun pointed to the little girls head about to shoot. Something comes out of the darkness and takes the father. It stops. We then see the fathers brother and his girl friend.The uncle of these girls wants to find them. He has hired people to find them. When they finally find them they are in bad shape. The girls crawling on all 4's inside the same cabin seems a tad bit silly and you almost want to laugh instead of feel scared.It then kicks off what is about to come with Mama and the little girls.The movie will take you on a suspenseful ride wondering what is next. Very similar to the ring in which once you finally find out what this thing is it loses all its scary appeal. At that point the movie breaks down and by the end you are wondering why didn't you just wait til DVD.Mama will provide some good scares. They are not cheap and are well displayed on camera. Like most movies in this genre once they show what the thing is everything that was once scary loses its once freaky appeal.2.5/4",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Caucasian La Llorona,"Remember when you were young and your mom told you that if you didn't treat her well, then she would come back and haunt you from beyond the grave?...No?...Really?! Uhhh, welldirected by Andres Muschietti (NOT GUILLERMO DEL TORO) ""Mama"" is the newest January horror release attempting to not massively disappoint a wide array of critics. And while (as far as new age horror films go) I thought ""Mama"" was for the most part pretty effective and will be giving this movie a recommendation, I am also recommending that (for the most enjoyable experience) one walk out of this movie around 15 minutes before the final credits roll, when this film completely falls apart.There is a storyline here concerning two creepy little girls who are found seemingly alone in the woods (but in fact are being watched over by a jealous ghost named Mama) and are taken in by their estranged uncle and his hard rock, tattooed girlfriend (played by Jessica Chastain) but truthfully the more you pay attention to the quite sappy and overcomplicated plot, the more distracted (much like in last year's ""The Woman in Black"") you will be from the real star of ""Mama"", the scares themselves. In fact the parts that don't work here are the awkwardly clunky exposition and (as I alluded to before) the final 15 minutes when ""Mama"" becomes once again back-story motivated, with an inexplicably nonsensical and Disney-esque ""the ghost must learn her lesson too"" ending. And nobody wants to see that. In fact, most of the time the scariest things about some of the great horror movie monsters stem from their unexplained motives; a la, the less we (the audience) knows about the monster, other than it wants to kill and deliver scares, the scarier the movie becomes. Therefore, the back-story behind Mama being a sort of Caucasian version of ""La Llorona"" would have worked immensely well on scares alone, if not for a need by these filmmakers (Muschietti and writer Neil Cross) to give an overly dramatic character explanation, humanizing the monster and taking all of the wind out of Mama's sails.What does work in this movie's favor are the horror genre visuals which make up a large portion of the middle chunk of this film. OK, so while some of the scares may seem cheap, the Mama ""monster"" is pretty damn scary. Furthermore, what initially may seem like cheap scares, quickly turn into cheap yet effective scares throughout (clearly exceeding the classic 6 scare rule). There are even a few rather well constructed horror genre directorial choices that while won't be classified as scares, will be seen as rather creepy moments.As for Chastain playing the rocker chick/girlfriend/adopted mother in all of this (with her Misfit's t-shirt, black nail polish and her many, many bracelets) she gives a performance that while isn't a cinematic nose dive (the likes of Natalie Portman going from ""Black Swan"" to ""Your Highness"") it is one that can only be described as pretty much that of zero substance. Which is to say, she's not bad, nor is she good; she is more so wasted in a rocker chick role which will undoubtedly be forgotten in the years to come.Final Thought: All in all, if you are looking to see a horror (or date) movie that does deliver in the visual scares department and are willing to ignore the annoyingly distracting storyline, then ""Mama"" may be the movie for you. But if I said it once, I'll say it a million times, if you choose not to walk out of this movie 15 minutes before it's over, then don't come crying to me.

"Good, Creepy, Old-School Horror.  BUT...  You need to be able to suspend disbelief and enjoy some Fantasy elements in your Horror...","I really LOVE Guillermo Del Toro. THAT guy is truly talented. So, anytime I see where he has ANYTHING to do with a film, I definitely want to check it out. One VERY strong film that he produced recently was 'THE ORPHANAGE' which was excellent.This one though I would say falls somewhat short of that. It IS a good Horror film, but a Horror film with a strong Retro - Old School, low key style. Firstly, it IS indeed a PG-13, so if you are one of these hard core, Luv-2-see-m-tortured-wid-Lotz-of-blud, forget it. Secondly, and this is VERY important if you are reading this to determine whether you will like this film or not. You will only enjoy this movie IF you enjoy a fairly strong Fantasy element AND if you are able to submerse yourself into Supernatural stories. Sooooo... if you are one of these people who like there Horror 'Realistic' or true to life, you won't like it...The look and mood of the film is excellent. The cinematography and the direction are very well done. I can see why this guy caught Guillermo's attention. The style, especially towards the end, is VERY Del Toro-esque. This is almost like a faerie tale in a way. Thus, why I am saying that you really DO have to like Fantasy elements in your Horror in order to enjoy this film. If not, you are simply going to be bored, find it unbelievable, be rolling your eyes, and then you'll come here and write how lousy the film is. So, that is why I am saying it is important whether you like that element in your Horror films or not.The acting is excellent. At first, I didn't think I was gonna like the lead woman because I thought 'Oh, here we go with the Punk Chick cliché' But, I was surprised that as the film went on, I had to admire her subtle adaptation to the situation and her versatility. I looked up the actress here on IMDb and I didn't even RECOGNIZE her!Also, the children do a superb job. If you like Fantasy / Horror concerning children (not EVIL Killer children, simply about children) then you will certainly appreciate the excellent job done here by them. I was AMAZED at the youngest one, because she had to express so many primitive emotions and reactions and she did them in an amazingly believable way! Usually with a child actor this young, I would expect her to come across as too much, over the top, and VERY unconvincing. But, this little girl was frigg'n AWESOME and I found myself just sitting here, stunned with how damn good she was. She FAR overshadowed the older girl, although her performance was fine too.So, all in all, YES, this is a very well made and effective Horror film IF you like lighter, more low key Horror with some Fantasy elements included. You also have to be rather forgiving of some of the ghostly CG effects, because the story calls for them. So, if you are one to say 'GEEZ, what CHEEEEEEZY CG crap!' then that may diminish your enjoyment of the movie. YES, there are a lot of 'jump-scares', but they are mostly effective and had me changing my pants several times...",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Absolute rubbish!!,"6.4 is way too high!I'm not going to bang on about the story, others have covered that a million times over. Bland acting, rubbish story, filled with clichés you've seen a million times over and a complete waste of life.The CGI is too over the top to ever be frightening, never mind the fact its absolutely awful, as others (with any sense) have commented, I've seen scarier stuff in Disney pixar movies.The ghost doesn't behave in a natural (or indeed logical) way, it only serves to deliver cheap scares to the audience, by creeping up behind the main character and peeking at the camera over their shoulder before vanishing, or popping right up in front of the lens to peek right at you with shamefully predictable timing and so on and so forth. You will know exactly what I am talking about because you have seen it a million times before already.For those who are saying that this takes horror in a new direction... you are wrong. This is the same torrid rubbish Hollywood has been spewing for years now and couldn't be more by-the-numbers.Had this been produced with some integrity, not to appeal to the widest audience possible in order to make $$$$ and used clever animatronics and make up, it could have been a lot better but as they say, why bother to paint a sh*t house?I guess those who are easily frightened will be scared by any of this type of drivel that is laid out in front of them no matter how terrible it is and as such will be easily pleased by this... but really there is barely anything to praise!I hope maybe I saved at least one of you from wasting your life on this one!!",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
well done and beautiful,"In 2008, the Argentine Andrés Muschietti directed ""Mama"", a 3-minute short-film that Guillermo del Toro watched and liked so much that he decided to produce a longer feature. In the 2008 version, a little girl wakes her sister up in the middle of the night and tells her that ""Mama"" is back. They both go downstairs in an empty house. They see something that looks like a woman moving in a room at the end of the hall. The ""thing"" is threatening. The music is nagging and throbbing. Something is going to happen. Mama walks out of the room and runs at abnormal speed toward the children. She is barefoot and her body is deformed. The girls scream and run back to the first floor. The younger girl slams the bedroom's door and leaves the older out. She looks at Mama moving toward her. The thing's walk is dislocated, her face is hideous. The music panics. The girl screams. The end. The same scene is present in the 2013 movie, which is an enhanced and more explicit version of this primitive scene. After he lost it and killed his wife and co-workers, Jeffrey (best known under the name of Jaime Lannister) runs away with his daughters. They have an accident on the road and find refuge in a cabin by the lake in the middle of the wood. There, Jeffrey plans to shoot her daughters than kill himself, but the ghost in the cabin prevents it and takes care of him. Five years later, two detectives paid by Lucas, Jeffrey's twin brother, finally find the crashed car and the cabin with the girls. They are alive but they live in a wild primitive state and they pretend that they were raised by a supernatural entity they call ""Mama"". Lucas and her girlfriend Anabel (Jessica Chastain, the actress-chameleon) are thirty something but they live like teenagers. He draws and she plays the guitar in a rock band. Nevertheless, the psychiatrist in charge of the girls decide to give them custody and to lend them a house to raise the girls in proper conditions. As it is often the case, joint custody does not go well and Mama is jealous of the girls' new parents. Childhood is a recurring theme in horror movies. The child is innocent, fragile and defenceless against evil and the corruption of the adults' world. But what the horror genre is interested in is the reversal, and loss, of values, the devilish side of the angels' faces. The trope of the child-victim and child-killer is almost as old as the horror genre itself. After initial ambiguity, the film chooses one unequivocal representation of the child as basically pure and good. Adults don't need to protect themselves from them, they need to protect them. The film is actually pretty unsurprising and uses some of the genre's most common clichés and twists : a cabin in the wood, people visiting the cabin in the middle of the night, scary dolls, weird children, a ghost in the closet, a crazy mother, heavy music, etc. But ""Mama"" is a genre movie that fully acknowledges these stereotypes. And it works. Muschietti's directing is clever and effective. The main interest of the film is the characterization of Jeffrey, Anabel, the girls AND the ghost. Muschietti managed to find a right balance to make them ""real"" and make the viewer care for all of them. They are not mere embodiments. Even Mama is not pure evil, she is ambivalent, both motherly and destructive. The film is less based on violence than on anguish. Some ideas I thought were interesting, for example the physical concretization of the haunted house theme. The film is all about atmosphere, about something that is there, lurking, that kills not out of pleasure but because it is suffering. It lives in the walls, it becomes the walls, it corrupts them. It lives in corpses, but it is not really living, it's only articulated death. It takes possession of people's dreams, but it still remains estranged from the living world. Only the child can communicate with it, and love it, because only the child can see the living and the dead as two different but equal things. The end is not like any conventional Hollywood ending. Only that suffices to make the film interesting. But it's not only that. There's beauty in ""Mama"", there's an impossible love, there's black and troubling poetry.

Finally someone who agrees with me!,"I cannot believe how many good reviews 'Mama' has received. When I realised that Del Toro was the producer of this film, I had high hopes as I loved the Orphanage'. I was however, bitterly disappointed in this film which was nothing but jumpy. The plot did not make any sense i.e. why were the characters wandering around in the middle of the night when there was a ghost so obviously waiting to harm them? Why was the psychologist (or whatever he was) keeping mama a secret from the other characters. Plot aside, the CGI Mama was hilariously funny looking and not scary in the slightest. I am easily scared by horror films, but this one had me in stitches!",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Big Mama's house,"Mama's getting an unfair reception! I went in with somewhat low expectations giving all the heavily negative reviews from people. Mama wasn't a must-see film for me, it just happened that a red-headed warrior was interested in it. However, I was pleasantly surprised with what I got! Mama immediately grabbed me from its intriguing opening which was also beautifully shot and felt very Spanish so I knew that I was in good hands, directing-wise. The imagery was atmospheric and almost fairytale-like which was apparent from the opening letters, ""Once Upon A Time"" but don't get too excited because it's not as fairytale related as Pan's Labryinth or Livid. I was also surprised at the amount of suspense in this opening sequence too so once it was over with an effective jump scare, I was at ease.Mama plays out like a haunted house movie but it has a much deeper story than that. We're introduced to some likable characters and some surprisingly un-annoying child actors! The girls were actually really good and not as wooden as you'd think they'd be. Every scene is filled with tension and I found myself feeling quite scared in some moments, which is unusual for me and was also something I wasn't expecting. The director (don't know his name, some confusing foreign name I gather) certainly knows how to work his audience and I look forward to what he can conjure up next.Now, if jump scares annoy you for any reason then you might want to give Mama a miss because a lot of the scares rely on jump scares. Nevertheless, these jump scares are extremely well done and the build-up to them is done with nail-biting tension! Mama may only be offering cheap thrills, but they're done in a genuinely scary way and the film does also feature a string of effective and creepy moments which adds to the atmosphere. Mama is never boring either and never forgets its entertainment value or characters. I also found the look of Mama to be quite creepy which is contrary to what a lot of people believe. Sometimes the CGI did look a bit shoddy and some of the floaty effects were over-done, but her face was actually genuinely creepy.The sound effects were also top-notch and are really but to great use in the cinema. There's a moment where a character goes into the dark cabin and you know Mama's there, but you can't see her, all you can hear are these horrible groans and Grudge-like croaky noises and it's actually very creepy! Granted, Mama uses some clichés such as the old Rear Window flashing camera effect but that also conjures up one of the best jump scares in the film and really does fill the scene with tension. So although clichés are used, they're used effectively and do offer some great entertainment.Mama can be original too though. There's a really great flash-back sequence which I've never seen the likes off before. It's like an expressionist painting all in the point of view of Mama and it creates a great impact and allows you to gain verstehen for Mama's mysterious character. My only real complaint about the film is that it does lose its way with the ending. Mama stops being creepy because she starts to function too much like a human and we see far too much of her. Everything feels a bit silly and rushed and also gave me vibes of the ending for Hocus Pocus for some reason, which is not good. Don't get me wrong I love Hocus Pocus, but it's a Disney film and I should not be feeling vibes of a Disney film in a serious horror film.Ending aside, Mama is a great night out. It's not as amazing as Insidious or Sinsiter, but it has an original and interesting idea behind it and is played out in a superiorly creepy way to most ghosty films. Mama always kept me entertained and the tension-filled directing is sure to keep you on edge. The film is full of great atmosphere and imagery which stops it from being another forgettable haunted house movie. I think people are giving Mama an unfair time.

Completely spoiled by awful and over-used cgi,"Rented Mama from a local Redbox this weekend, grabbed a bowl of popcorn, turned out the lights, been looking forward to this since I missed it at the theaters.It started off beautifully, quietly setting up a solid tragic back story that flowed into opening credits that had a fairytale, mythic quality to them. It had the fingerprint of a Guillermo Del Toro masterpiece like The Devil's Backbone, even though he only produced it.It retained its strength through the whole first half, with kid actors that weren't annoying and Jessica Chastain putting in a pretty awesome performance as a conflicted caregiver being forced to grow up.Aaaaand then... cgi.And not even subtle cgi either... like, freaking ""nothing was real on the whole screen"" cgi. By the end I felt like I was watching a damn cartoon. Does this seriously not bother younger audiences today? I don't get it, here we had a potentially terrifying, potentially poignant film completely destroyed by cgi yet it gets decent reviews.So yeah, if you don't mind abysmal (and we're talking, SyFy channel level abysmal) cgi plastered all over your final act, then you might enjoy Mama. As it stands, I give it 7 stars for the first half and deduct 3 of them for the second half. 4/10.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Flawed but compelling.,"Guillermo del Toro presents and executive produces this decent psychological horror film, expanded from a three minute short by its co-writer / director Andres Muschietti. Muschietti manages to create a somber and creepy mood throughout. He's crafted a fairly touching story, and he gets very fine performances out of both his adult and child actors. The atmosphere is excellent at times, but what really works against his efforts is the overload of visual effects. They really help to kill the mystery. Also, some genre fans are likely to be less than pleased with Muschietti opting to go for the jump scare as often as he does. The result is a mildly entertaining horror film that falls short of its full potential.The versatile Jessica Chastain is solid as a rocker chick named Annabel - she plays bass - who's involved with Lucas (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau). Lucas is uncle to two adorable little girls, who were taken into the wilderness by their unhinged father (also played by Coaster-Waldau). Dad has already committed a few murders and looks like he will add his daughters to the list before *something* snatches him. Five years later, the girls are finally found, and having lived in the country for so long, have become quite feral. With the help of a dedicated psychiatrist, Dr. Dreyfuss (Daniel Kash), they become somewhat readjusted to normal life. However, Annabel becomes convinced that some sort of presence has returned with the girls, who claim to have been acquainted with a character whom they merely dub Mama.Some viewers feel that for whatever Muschietti is able to accomplish, he blows it with that finale, which admittedly disregards anything resembling subtlety. Still, there is an emotional centre to this film that makes it hard to completely dislike. The director really goes for broke with his imagery, using moths as a motif. Coaster-Waldau is likable as the uncle, who does some sleuthing, as does the good doctor. (It is nice to see Kash, who played Spunkmeyer in ""Aliens"" 28 years ago, in a major supporting such as this.) Megan Charpentier as Victoria and Isabelle Nelisse as Lilly are both appealing in the child roles.""Mama"" isn't exempt from trappings of the genre film, such as questionable character decisions, but all in all it's a reasonably affecting experience.Six out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Flashes of inspiration, but mostly disappointing","MAMA has plenty of potential, I'll give it that. It's produced by no less than Guillermo del Toro, a man who's had a hand in some of the best ghost stories of recent years (THE ORPHANAGE, THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE). It stars Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, an actor currently riding high thanks to the success of GAME OF THRONES. Unfortunately, though, there are simply too many problems with it to make it a truly successful movie.In essence, this is another clichéd ghost story along the lines of THE WOMAN IN BLACK or INSIDIOUS. Yet again we're treated to a pair of creepy children who have an invisible friend - except in this case it's a surrogate mother figure who's determined to look out for ""her"" wards no matter what. It all boils down to attempts at creeping dread, ominous shots of wardrobes and out-of-focus ghosts in the backgrounds of shots, and that sort of thing.What I'm trying to say is that it's all rather predictable and a little wearying in places. The cast work hard but the writing isn't particularly strong when it comes to the characters. Coaster-Waldau spends most of the movie off-screen in a hospital bed, leaving a clearly struggling Jessica Chastain to hold the reins. Unfortunately, Chastain is saddled with one of the most selfish, self-centred protagonists I've seen in a while, leaving a huge dead spot in the centre of the movie.Sadly, MAMA becomes increasingly silly as it goes on, with more and more of the CGI ghost (who looks like...a CGI ghost) appearing and failing to frighten the viewer. JU-ON: THE GRUDGE this ain't. And it all ends in a rather twee, predictable and unsatisfying way, which is a real shame. A film bogged down by predictability then, instead of genuinely novel ideas.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""Mama"" or ""Pacific Rim?""","Parts of this movie are genuinely scary. About as scary as any movie has been in a long time. Enough so that you wonder why Guillermo del Toro will not direct these movies instead of just signing his name to them. If Steven Spielberg is smart enough to direct a gem like ""War of the Worlds"", and Peter Jackson ""The Lovely Bones"" or ""King Kong"", when is Del Toro going to get smart enough to direct movies like ""The Orphanage"" or ""Don't Be Afraid of the Dark"" or ""Mama?"" The lonely, creepy, isolated atmosphere, the intense focus on the mother and daughter characters, the classic female character in jeopardy with little or no outside help or influence... Robert Zemeckis did this with ""What Lies Beneath"" and we can not be thankful enough. I hope that Del Toro will wake up from his ""Pacific Rim"" delusion of grandeur and treat us to a movie like ""Mama"" crafted with his own special directorial ability soon.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Disappointed,"I watched this movie because it is the It director's movie. I intend to watch It this weekend so would like to see first how he worked with his old movie, after all they are the same horror genre. I must say I am disappointed with Mama. It is just an OK movie. There were so many CG involved and it made the story unconvincing. Hopefully, he has already improved his directing skill with It. Let's see.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Mama... Please,"As specter/ghost movies go, Mama has entered a crowded market. How Mama would separate itself and make a scary movie unlike the others was the question. Or maybe Mama wouldn't even go the scary route.The title is very benign and unrevealing. Even the way the movie starts with the childlike scrolling of ""Once upon a time,"" lent towards a potentially light and jocular movie. Is the title related to the movie? Yes. The movie is about two very young girls that lost their parents and were subsequently raised by a ghost whom they called ""Mama"". Initially, like most ghost movies of this ilk, you don't know if the apparition is benevolent or malevolent. I mean, you could say it was benevolent simply because it took the time to raise these two orphans. At the same time you could say it was malevolent because it didn't bother to lead very capable flesh and blood people to these girls to raise them properly. In any case, it is a scary movie so you can watch to judge the spirit for yourself.As the movie goes, it was not too original and there were many flaws to it. Some of the flaws could be overlooked but then other flaws actually hampered the story. There were the occasional startling moments to keep the audience on its toes. The movie borrowed from The Ring and The Grudge as far as the new way ghosts get around: I mean the crab walk. Likewise, the movie borrowed from so many others in keeping the ghost hidden for the first half of the movie for maximum scare effect later on.Like I said, nothing original, minimum startle factor and a ho-hum ending.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Empathetic Fear,"Guillermo has a successful way of giving you only the most important plot details, allowing your mind to construct its own genuine fear. In the movie ""Mama,"" Del Toro, unlike many other modern horror directors, effectively generates fear and suspense while also inducing true empathy. The movie 'Mama' entrances you and brings you back to a true adolescent sense of fear, which bends your adult perception of reality. Mama was an EXCELLENT movie but (in my opinion) suffered from the same disease as many other big budget films-- overuse of CGI. Guillermo, we love your movies for inducing primal fear; please don't take away our capacity to use our imagination.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not quite horror, still quite good","To begin, I had little to no interest in seeing this film when I first heard of it. After a few reviews from friends I decided that I would check it out when it came out on DVD. I just finished the film and must say that I don't know where all the bad reviews are coming from. It wasn't quite as scary as a horror film should be, but that doesn't make it a bad film. I found that the story was able to keep my attention quite well. It reminded me of ""Ju-On: The Grudge"" and other Asian horror films. Mama's face was very creepy and her voice was down right scary. I wish I had taken the time to see this while it was still in theaters. The one and only true complaint I had with the film was that during scenes that were supposed to take place in the middle of the night, there was this bright light shining through the windows. Besides that, I had no complaints. Horror fan or not, you will most likely enjoy this film.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Started fantastic, CGI and plot direction ruined it","Mama is a distinct take on the ghost-with-a-past genre of horror films. This movie stands out with plenty of creepy scenes, jarring details, some unique shots and occasionally glaring filters.The lore seemed somewhat original to me, and what particularly intrigued me were the character behaviors - namely the strange disposition of the children, they essentially defined most of the film. At some point towards the end, however, it sort of stopped being a horror movie and turned into something else that, in my opinion, was spoiled by the lackluster CGI of the film.Mama does a good job building suspense to satisfactory jump scares, with 1 or 2 being quite good. Though towards the end when more revealing scenes take the stage, the CGI arguably ruins the whole mood of the rest of the film.I will say, with the way the movie began, it had the potential to be horrifying. Unfortunately, the plot was handled in a way where everything that made the film scary became unravelled and exposed, so much so that I felt like the ending would have made more sense in a fantasy film.The first hour of this film is great, but beyond that thanks to an increase in laughable scenes with the help of bad CGI, it sort of tumbled into mediocrity.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
dark and scary.......whoopee....,'MAMA' is basically a good horror movie. Though the story is not so realistic but the horror element overshadows that.There is no gore in the movie at all and that is good for a horror movie.The scary look of so called mama is really good. There are many JUMP OFF moments which makes this movie great.The dark atmosphere created is fantastic.you will never get bored during entire movie. Acting by both the small girls was really very good. The movie could have been more better if horror element was more. The ending left me a little confused and could have been better. these days this type of horror movies are difficult to find. All in all a good horror movie for all audiences.,7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Definitely Worth a Watch,"I'm a horror movie junkie, and I must say that my current favorite is Martyrs, just so you know my taste. (If you haven't seen Martyrs, it is a MUST see, I give it 10/10!) I really enjoyed this movie and went in with medium expectations, and I must say I was not disappointed. It didn't ""scare"" me, but it definitely has a creepy vibe. It also features one of my ALL-TIME favorite creepy scenes, with one of the little girls scurrying across on all fours (I know it doesn't sound creepy, you really have to see it to appreciate it). If you don't think it's worth watching the whole thing, DEFINITELY search out youtube for that specific scene! The CGI work of ""Mama"" took me out of it quite a bit, but definitely still worth a watch in my opinion. The pacing is quite good and there were never any moments when I was bored.

A decent attempt in the directorial Debut by Muschietti but the movie could've been more effective,"Mama is a horror movie directed by Andy Muschietti in his directorial debut and stars Jessica Chastain, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, Megan Charpentier, Isabelle Nelisse, Daniel Kash and Javier Botet.A decent attempt by Muschietti on his debut and apart from few missed opportunity and an unconvincing climax the movie is overall a decent horror movie to watch.The plot is based on the life of two girls who were abandoned in a forest cabin were fostered by a ghost whom they call Mama and who follows the girls when they were taken by their Uncle.The movie has stupendous start and I was expecting to watch an unconventional horror movie which might be different from another clichéd horror movies. The expectations were high but as the movie progresses it's again starts following the same path of regular horror movies with eerie sounds and jump scares. Although few of the scenes were very impressive but doesn't gives a wow factor.The acting in the movie is superb and both the kids were awesomely superb. They had played their characters were utmost perfection and were spot on. Jessica Chastain was also great and up to expectations, Nikolaj with very limited screen space was effective.Screenplay of the movie is uneven and gets slow in the middle, although the length of the movie is just 100 minutes but in my opinion it could've been trimmed to make movie more gripping.Climax of the movie is one of the weakest point of the movie as I was expecting a little more scary and terrifying climax. The best part of the movie is despite of being an horror movie the brutality in the movie is almost negligible.Overall the movie is a decent horror movie which could've been much better with little more tight screenplay and an effective ending. Horror movie lovers will not be disappointed.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Promising start and some nice sound and cinematography but story falls flat,"I didn't really care for this movie too much overall. It drew me in right from the beginning and it stays entertaining enough, but the CGI is not great and it quickly turned into a cheesy ghost story without anything original to offer.It reminds me a lot of other ghost story movies. It has a similar plot to ""The Ring"" in a way, but is less suspenseful and doesn't work as well. It shows the ""ghost"" a lot, probably too much, instead of leaving more for the imagination, which left me pretty bored in the second half. After it is shown that the ghost can appear whenever and do actual physical harm, it becomes kind of silly to keep dragging the movie on with close calls.The ending was terrible in my opinion, and I couldn't even finish the last few minutes of the film. I don't want to spoil it, but I will say that its overly dramatic and emotional.The sound design is great and the film has nice production value other than the CGI. I think this director shows a lot of promise and would do better with a better script.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

A very well made horror/thriller,"Movie review:I had to pick one for Mothers day, and since I wanted to see this anyway, it works perfectly. Very good choice. Knowing first off Guillermo del Torro has his name in the mix (he produced it, among other things I am sure) I was aware it was going to be a good film. The story is about a family that is torn apart by a massive collapse in the stock market. Well, that more or less leads into the actual story. When the father of two young girls goes on a murder spree, including his estranged wife, he packs up his children and speeds off to destination unknown where he intends to commit suicide. After crashing off the road, the three wander into a broken down house in the forest and just before he pulls the trigger, a strange ""figure"" snatches him away, leaving the children to fend for themselves. The oldest daughter, Victoria (Megan Charpentier) catches a glimpse of the ""figure"" flying out the door with the father in tow, but her glasses were broken, so she could not make out what she saw. The two kids are left alone for 5 years before they are found, but how alone were they to survive on their own? The search was funded by an inheritance from his brother to find them. Now after a short legal battle, it is up to Lucas (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) and Annabel (Jessica Chastain) to raise the girls that had become feral animals that were now under a psychiatrists care. Dr. Dreyfuss (Daniel Kash) arranges for the new family to move into a home where he would have access to this mysterious case. The children slowly become accustomed to their ""new"" parents but also it becomes apparent that ""Mama"", as the children call her, is also there. Mamas presence is known by an appearance of black moths and electrical disturbances that often go unseen. At first this is playful things like games with the kids, etc. but when Mama gets jealous and pushes Lucas down the stairs, putting him into a coma, it is up to Anabel to raise the kids she was hesitant to do in the first place. As Mama makes her presence more known in the house, she puts ""dreams"" into Anabels head so she can see what happened. From these dreams, we see Mama stab a nun and running away with a baby (named Lily) she stole. She is followed by the townspeople to a cliff where Mama and Lily dive off to their death. There is more to this which should be seen to put it together without writing all of it out. This may seem like other ghost stories, and in a way it is, but this has so much feeling as to the why Mama is so trapped and engaged with this children. The movie as a whole moves at a very nice pace and uses subtle times to develop the characters without taking up too much time. The use of Mama does start as more of a ghost-type figure but as it progresses, the anguish Mama is going through begins to show through.Since this is a horror movie, I would be failing in not pointing something out, this movie is very creepy. There are visuals and camera-work that are used that will really scare you. The entire production quality of this movie is top notch. Very little, if anything, is left untouched in the story. It was the little things that were done to create the atmosphere in this movie that really pushed it along and made it so enjoyable. All things done, including acting, cinematography, to editing all run us through this tormenting story of Mama and her sheer need for closure. This all leads up to a crescendo that cultivates into the finale of a story that even though may seem like the usual haunting, is nothing but usual at all. So if you are looking for a gorefest, this is not for you, but if you want a very well made horror/thriller that will say more to your mind than any blood splatter will give, this is for you. 7.4/10 IMDb 6.4 Boo, IMDb, I am normally agreeing with ya, but this film is highly recommended by me.

Doesn't quite fulfill its potential,"Some businessman goes crazy, kills his business partner, goes home, kills the wife, takes his two daughters with him. They crash down a snowy hill and walk in the woods till they find some abandoned hut. He tries to kill himself but doesn't have the guts so he decides to kill his older daughter instead but something grabs him.Years later, his brother still pays folks to look for his nieces. He is somewhat of a loser, drawing cartoons while his girlfriend is a bass player in a band. Eventually the girls are found and handed to him for custody, although some rich aunt of the girls wants them too. The girls are wild and underdeveloped, especially the younger girl. They do all sorts of creepy stuff at home. Not long after, a ghost has followed them home, a ghost they call Mama. It lives in walls or in large moths. At some point the guy flies down the stairs and ends up in a coma. With him gone this movie is basically all about the ladies- surprise, surprise.There is some psychiatrist treating the girls who discovers the secret of Mama, she was a nun who had a kid and pursued by the town jumped down a cliff. This movie tries to explain a lot regarding the ghost but fails to explain why she terrorizes people. One good explanation ends up being discarded for some reason. It is a surprisingly scary movie and has a few good jump-out-of-your-seat moments. Chastain's character is excellent, a true rockers chick that doesn't care all that much but will go through a transformation. Chastain herself looks lovely here. The performances are very strong in particular of the older girl, Megan Charpentier. Direction is good but flawed. The look is of your typical Spanish ghost story- overly gray. With this cast and crew and the good basics of a story a lot more could have been done and better.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A ghost is an emotion bent out of shape by time,"3 out of 4 B+Mama continues the happy trend of Horror masters mentoring little monster directors so as to let loose their cinematic spawn upon the world. It's a pretty good system ( it gave us last years underrated Sam Rami backed ""The Possession) and it allows us to get another Guillermo Del Toro project as the wait for Pacific Rim becomes increasingly unbearable. Though this one, unlike the underwhelming ""Don't be Afraid of the Dark"" has flashes of auterism. Andy Musichietti expanding his original 2 and a half minute Spanish language short has crafted a truly gorgeous looking movie that headily juxtaposes cool florescent interiors and trim sharp stylized wood exteriors. I'd say that this modest little film rivals Skyfall, Life of Pi, and Beasts of the Southern Wild as the best looking film of the last 12 months. He builds some excellent scenes (though toward the end it start bordering on self parody with it's large quantity of silly jump scares) and there are two ones that remind me of John Landis ( A chilling dream sequence) and vintage Steven Spielberg ( An quietly frightening sequence involving a blanket). He get's fine performances out of the two cute young girls and brings out a fun performance from Jessica Chastain. He could have used help on the script (which he wrote with his sister and another collaborator) that relies on a bunch of clichéd dialogue and rushed concepts ( the girls transition back to normledom, while well directed, feels really skimped over). But I believe that Musichietti, whom I'd like to see move on from silly horror movies to serious fare, has the chops and distinct and separate style to hit it big. I'll be watching him in the years to come. And overall it's a pretty creepy movie but the very loud teenage girl audience I saw it with seemed terrified so maybe you will be to.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
No Pan's Labyrinth but Not Bad Either,"I go into this movie with the recommendation of Guillermo del Toro, director of Pan's Labyrinth. I believe del Toro also ""presented"" the Orphanage when it came out. Since I really enjoyed both Labyrinth & Orphanage, I went to theaters for Mama. Mama never had the feel or felt on the same level as either Pan's Labyrinth or the Orphanage to me. It may have been wrong of me to go into this movie with expectations on such a high level as it's predecessors (so to speak).I liken Mama more toward the two similar Sam Raimi directed/produced fails (in my opinion) ""Drag Me to Hell"" and ""Possession"". Mama is more similar to the two Raimi tainted movies than the del Toro ones. Where Mama is better than the Raimi movies is that it's actually a horror movie that will get some reaction. I watched all three movies in theaters. Neither Drag me to Hell or Possession got a reaction from the theater crowd. That is unless you count me. I laughed a few times at the ridiculousness. Mama on the other hand was a very similar type of movie but was made well enough to be considered a descent horror film.My personal reasons with rating this movie only above average is that, there's been numerous movies of it's kind made in recent years. While this one is not bad, it also doesn't stand out with the best either. For my taste they showed the ""evil character"" far too often for it to be scary. Luckily the CGI was just good enough not to ruin the movie or anything but I did see a couple of scenes that looked like they were done just because they could do it. In my personal opinion, wait for video unless you just absolutely want to see it. When you do go into it, expect something along the lines of Drag me to Hell or Possession instead of Orphanage and Pan's Labyrinth.6 of 10 rating. Worth watching in my opinion but save it for DVD/BluRay/Netflix/Streaming/however you cheaply watch movies. It's a movie someone will mention to me in 3-5 years and I'll remember but only barely.

"Interesting concept, but bad film","The idea of a couple of little girls adopted by a vengeful ghost is very interesting and compelling. If it didn't all transform yet again into a ""family doesn't get what is going on with their children in their white picket fence house"", it would have been great. Add to it the ""fringe scientist"" interested in the girls and a mopey story about a woman who desperately wanted a child and you get a real punch down the throat with all the possible clichés that you could think of.But still, freaky children, insane motherly ghost, rock band surrogate mom, Jamie Lannister (twice)... it could have worked fine. However the lackluster script, the horrible CGI and the dull acting made it a terrible experience for me.Bottom line: Enough with the camera point of view scares and the CGI monsters that appear from nowhere!

Mama - A slightly flawed yet effective ghost story,"Annabel is not ready to be a mother. She's a bass player in a punk rock band, she's dating Lucas, who is a starving artist as well, and she thanks the lord above that she's not pregnant. But on that same morning of reassurance that an impending pregnancy won't interrupt her rebellious and free-spirited life, Lucas gets the call that his nieces have been discovered in a cabin in the woods. Five years prior, they disappeared with their father after he killed their mother, and have survived by developing into feral creatures. Lucas, and a begrudging Annabel, fight in court to get custody of the socially handicapped little girls despite the fact that their therapist, Dr. Dreyfuss, doesn't think either of them are fit to be parents. But the alternative is the girls go with their only other family member, a great aunt that lives on the opposite coast, so he strikes a deal. He'll move them all into a house the hospital uses for transitioning families, all expenses paid, as long as he can continue to examine the girls. They begin to settle into their new lives as the girls come further and further out of their shell, only to discover that the girls are as alone in their bedrooms at night as they were in the woods.Mama is a full-length adaptation of a two-minute film, both written and directed by Andres Muschietti. The film was so strong that Guillermo del Toro tasked the Spaniard with expanding the minimalistic narrative into a feature that is as scary and atmospheric as its inspiration. And I'm happy to say that, for the most part, he succeeded.First of all are the negative aspects. All of the clichés are alive and well in Mama. Flickering lights, late night explorations sans flashlights or logic, characters that explain aspects of the story to come and then disappear, cheap jump scares rear their ugly head, and orchestral swells and crescendos dictate when to be scared. Mama doesn't make any attempts to reinvent the proverbial wheel of horror.The good news is that all flaws aside, Mama ends up being very scary and surprisingly touching. Jessica Chastain fully commits to her role as Annabel and proves why she is one of today's rising stars. The development of her maternal instincts and emotional journey are wholly believable, and her chemistry with the two girls is excellent. Megan Charpentier and Isabelle Nelisse, as Victoria and Lilly, turn in equally believable and touching performances as two girls trying to find their place between their adopted and spiritual mothers. Neither one of them is tasked with easy jobs as the psychologically damaged children, but both of them succeed in being reasonably creepy and disarmingly innocent. The girls also provide some needed humor that is well timed to diffuse some tension and then serves ratchet it right back up. The real star of the show though is Mama herself. While she is more CGI than practical effects, Mama still makes for an effective creature that moves like a tortured marionette. And thanks to a disturbing back story, she also makes for a ghostly villain you can empathize with on some levels. She is not just your average boogey (wo)man.The cinematography in Mama is astounding at times. A lot of horror films utilize quick camera cuts and edits to provide scares or reveal what scares await off screen. But Muschietti goes through a lot of trouble to keep the camera rolling and keeping the characters in frame, which goes a long way to building the tension. There is a roughly 5 minute long tracking shot at the end of the 2nd act that is relentlessly intense. Mama also creates one of the most atmospheric and moving nightmare sequences in recent memory. And even if the flickering lights and dark hallways have all been seen before, they are still well lit and utilized.For what it's worth, Mama doesn't get everything right. There are plot holes abound, side characters are forgotten as fast as they're introduced, and the clichés are as present as they've ever been. But I urge you to look past the flaws and give Mama a chance. The scares are efficient and well earned without feeling too cheap. The principal characters are well developed and easy to empathize with when the terror hits, including ""mama"" herself. I walked in expecting a few halfway decent scares, but I found myself drawn in to a deep and oddly moving ghost story. Will Mama be remembered ten years from now? In all likelihood, no it won't. But while you're watching it makes for one hell of a frightening ride.I would score Mama as a 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"meh, watchable.","so, i'm not talking about the (poor) characters, or the predictable narrative. both are mediocre in this movie, but that's not the major problem. done.i got scared two or three times, the atmosphere was OK, and the storyline wasn't bad. the thing is, a movie can scare you with the power of suggestion. we are scared of things we don't see, we don't know. that's mostly why we are all afraid to die. when the film decides to show what we've been fearing, most of it is lost. we don't get scared anymore, the plot gets a little silly, the characters reveal they're a hand full of nothing, and even the end is not as catastrophic as it could be.if you want to see a scary film about sisters, go ahead and see ""a tale of two sisters"" instead. way better.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Gem,"This little horror movie is a gem. I didn't expect much, but when my ten year old niece was excited to watch it I decided to see it. Apparently younger folks knew all about this, but I didn't. It is a simple story. A father murders his wife and goes on the run with his kids. His car crashes. He walks to a deserted cabin in the woods with his two girls. It is there that mama appears when he tries to kill his children. Mama is a ghostly caretaker. She is the ghost of a woman who jumped to her death in the 1800's. She cares for the two girls for several years before they are found (she did away with the murderous father). The father's brother is searching for the kids and when he finds them he brings them home. However, mama comes home with them as well. I haven't seen a good horror film like this is years. For the most part it is understated. You only see glimpses of mama until the end of the movie. The creepiest part is how the younger daughter has not acquired social skills. She is literally an animal and walks on all fours. Unlike many horror films, the characters are intelligent and don't go around opening doors they shouldn't. The flashbacks give mama her back story. There are a few unexplained things such as the children surviving on gathered cherry pits and moths, but nonetheless it is interesting. Definitely see this movie. It's on the top of my list for a thriller.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Horror Flick which you should never miss....,"Yesterday I watched an English Horror flick ""MAMA"". My brother recommended it to me and as he told me,the movie is not so scary but really a creepy one.The story was also slight different.Although the movie was slow in pace at some different points of time and again the end was slightly dramatic as compared to other popular English horror flicks but overall watching this movie alone in a dark room was a great experience.Two most important things i like most in this movie is first its story telling which will make you sit through out even at some-point as i said previously the pace was slow and second most important thing was the brilliant acting of two child artist Megan Carpenter(Named Victoria in this movie) and Isabella Nillesse(Named Lilly in this movie). you can watch the movie for these child artists only,keeping every things apart.I enjoyed the movie very much.Watch it .Hope you guys will enjoy it too.....",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
We want more Mama!,"Guillermo Del Toro is certainly no small time director. Involved in epics such as 'Hellboy', 'Megamind' and 'Kung Fu Panda', Del Toro has experience in vast amounts of genres and the Spaniard is no stranger to horror with work entailed in 'Julia's Eyes', 'The Orphanage' and 'The Devil's Backbone'. So how does he fair here, collaborating with the Muschietti's over how to produce the anticipated horror 'Mama'.When a psychologically deranged man murders several of his working colleagues before doing the same to his wife, he whisks his children away with him in the back of his car, driving off in a seething rage. Out of control, he steers off course towards an abandoned cabin in the middle of the woods. Rounding his children inside he prepares to shoot himself - possibly even his children - until a spiritual being intervenes.Five years later, the children remain missing and their Uncle Lucas (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) is determined not to give up the search. However, when he finally finds them with girlfriend Annabel (Jessica Chastain), they may have picked up more than they bargained for.'Mama' begins excellently, full of mystery and suspense as we are brought together with an intriguing story line. After the early prologue and approximately twenty minutes of foundation building, rhetorical questions develop in your head and shivers begin to tingle up your spine. At this point, Mama (voiced by Jane Moffat) herself is full of mystery; we know so little about her and this is why she is so creepy.The film begins to fall into decline when it unravels. When you see Mama in her true form - yes it looks a little freaky - but not nearly as scary as before when you didn't know what to expect. This gripe also links to her looking too unrealistic. The CGI is good but looks too out of place in in the film.Other negatives include the black humour which allows you a breathing space to emit your terror away from yourself. It just gives you that breathing space - if you are so terribly terrified - to remember it is just a movie.However, my main frustration is the appalling ending which is utterly ridiculous and farcical! Jessica Chastain was superb in her role as the first-time child minder Annabel while Megan Charpentier was equally as good as Victoria - the two main stand-out performances in a decent cast set-up.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Unless Mama's happy ...,"Greetings again from the darkness. Ever since The Blair Witch Project and the influence of ""found footage"", which then transitioned into the endless sequels for Paranormal Activity, true creativity and ingenuity has been mostly lacking from the horror genre. One of those still devoted to creeping us out and generating seat jumping is Guillermo del Toro, who produced this film after seeing writer/director Andres Muschietti's three minute short film.Since the real joy in experiencing a horror film comes from the surprises and twists, very few details will be revealed here. Worth noting is the lead role of Annabel played by the incredibly talented Jessica Chastain. Yes, the same one who is currently nominated for her role in Zero Dark Thirty. This time out, Ms. Chastain is a tatted up bass player in a (lousy) punkish band and sporting a Joan Jett hairdo. Annabel is living a bohemian lifestyle (translation: nearly starving with no responsibilities) with her artist boyfriend Lucas, played by Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, whom many will recognize from Game of Thrones, and who appeared in the superb Headhunters (one of my favorites of 2012).Many horror film clichés are presented here including a cabin in the woods, a portal to the afterlife, buzzing bugs, unexplained lullaby singing through the air vents, an untimely ""fall"" down the stairs by a key character and ties to a long ago tragedy that holds the key to this current mess. Notable is the welcome absence of gross out and gore-out special effects. Despite the clichés, Muschietti and his co-writing sister Barbara, and Neil Cross provide us with some new touches (uncovering maternal instincts) and such a great looking movie that our attention is firmly held ... especially for the first 80%. As happens so frequently, the final act is a bit disappointing, but not enough to ruin the experience.Chastain is top notch here. Coaster-Waldau is underutilized. The two young girls are effectively portrayed by Megan Charpentier (Victoria) and Isabelle Nelisse (Lily). In fact, Lily scampering about on all fours may be as frightening as the spooky Mama, played by 7 foot actor Javier Botet. It's an unconventional horror film with an atypical ending, and certainly worth a look if you are a fan of the genre.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
No no NO!!,"Gave it one star only because zero stars isn't possible. It's all been said about the rest of the movie, but lets skip to the ending shall we? What in God's name was that?

None of the rest of the movie is worth being hit with that corny, fantasy, family-film ending, with some of the worst CGI I've seen in a modern, so-called great movie! Just don't do it.

A mother's love is forever.,"I'm not the biggest fan of this genre of horror because I feel like it has been oversaturated with so many movies that it's just not that interesting anymore. But every once in a while you'll come across one that seems to hold its own. Mama is a supernatural horror film that isn't exactly anything special up front, but is actually pretty entertaining in the end.Although it's not that original, (but what ghost story is anymore?) It still has some pretty good characters to help bring the story together quite nicely. The two young actors portraying Victoria and Lily did a fantastic job with their performances, and I felt that the flaws in the story didn't make it any less entertaining.It's not what I would call an amazing horror movie, but I definitely think it's a decent film that's worth checking out at least once.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Where did it go wrong?,"Originally seeing the trailer I thought this was a great concept and an interesting idea, I was really excited for this but when I actually saw it in theatres I was a little less than pleased.The children are by far the best actor's in the film, playing the role of animalistic kids fairly well but this also leads to a lot of laughable moments as they appear more like Gollum than anything truly scary. The movie is very laughable sadly, the appearances of Mama with her head half out of the floorboard looks like somebody put a wig on a roomba and let it scoot around.The film goes really down hill during that dream sequence, as it appears to be a video game cut scene out of a FPS Rail shooter, the over use of CGI in a terribly contrived ending makes the movie feel like it's running 20 minutes too long.Also, having a jump scare a minute and twenty seconds in doesn't help your case.It was a fairly decent attempt for a first theatrical release from the director but hopefully his next projects are a little better.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
"An unimpressive, unsuccessful attempt to expand a three minute long video clip into a hundred minute long horror movie","The recipe for a good horror movie is as easy to formulate as it is difficult to implement. Roughly speaking, a good horror movie needs to be a) at least somewhat original with a hint of depth; b) at least somewhat coherent without a too-strong artificial flavor; c) at least somewhat scary, but not in a cheap way.Unfortunately, ""Mama"" produced by none other than Guillermo del Toro miserably failed in all the three categories. Nevertheless, being a failure from a pure cinematic perspective did not prevent the first-time director Andrés Muschietti s movie from becoming a box office darling: with the production budget of only $15.000.000, ""Mama"" collected an impressively hefty $118,434,000 worldwide.A few years ago, Andrés Muschietti had already made a very short three minute long video clip also called ""Mama"" that was released in Spain in 2009.It looks like the amateurish short video had generated enough interest in big professional cinema to secure for Andrés Muschietti a golden opportunity of making it into a full-length movie.The original clip is available on YouTube and while somewhat cute (in a horror movie sense) it strikes me as not containing much substance to build upon.Judging by the quality of the final product, generating buzz about a three minute long video turned out to be much easier task than actually expanding it into a hundred minute long movie.The story (Andrés and Babara Muschietti) ends up being so hopelessly unoriginal that it is not even trying to pretend the opposite. It is extremely formulaic and almost exclusively consists of genre clichés. Those waiting for any unpredictable twist or turn of the story end up bitterly disappointed at the end.Even with all its predictability, ""Mama"" still somehow manages to remain generally incoherent and (especially, closer to the end) full of obviously contrived coincidences. For example, why was a certain character so stubbornly and shortsightedly trying to visit a scary, menacing location in the middle of a dark gloomy night when he could have easily waited until morning? There is no good explanation for that except the ill wish of the story writers.As if all of the above was not already upsetting enough, ""Mama"" generously throws another curve ball to its unsuspecting viewers - the quintessentially cheap kindergarten level scares. These ""when somebody jumps out of the corner or from behind your back and nastily screams ""Boo"""" kind of scares are not what we expect to see in a decent horror movie.I have to say that my expectations of ""Mama"" in that area were already reasonably low. I, for example, was not expecting from it anything even remotely comparable to the famous ""Mystery Man"" scene – a little masterpiece from David Lynch's ""Lost Highway"" where a potent combination of the subtle makeup, the background sound, and the mind-bending dialog creates a thrilling creepiness of enormous power.And still, even with the expectations as low as they were, ""Mama"" somehow managed to disappoint.It became one more flop in the mixed record of Guillermo del Toro who is generally considered an authority in producing and directing horror movies. What had started with the great ""The Devil's Backbone"", the powerful ""Pan's Labyrinth"", and the ultimate masterpiece - ""The Orphanage"" has regrettably morphed into the simply laughable ""Don't Be Afraid of the Dark"" and the utterly mediocre ""Mama"".The acting in ""Mama"" was only so-so, with the three notable exceptions.The memorable characters created by the wonderful child actors Megan Charpentier and Isabelle Nélisse were one of the very few redeeming qualities of the movie. The casting in that respect in my opinion seemed to be superior to that of ""Hugo"" where the wooden screen duo of Asa Butterfield, and Chloë Grace Moretz looked bland, lacked chemistry, and in general left an artificial aftertaste.Nominated for two Oscars in two consecutive years (""Zero Dark Thirty"" (2013), ""The Help"" (2012)) Jessica Chastain is undoubtedly one of the best actors of her generation and possibly (only time will tell) of all time. In addition, it looks like she might be one of the very few actors who always shine no matter what, even if they play in a weak movie like ""Mama"".While ""Mama"" 's thin plot does not leave much room for character development, Jessica Chastain somehow manages to go beyond what the clichéd story dictates and adds quite a bit of depth and strong, believable emotion to the otherwise undistinguished character.The visual effects in ""Mama"" are mostly solid, more or less imaginative, and even subtle when necessary, but overall they are not breathtaking enough to have any serious independent value. And without an independent value they simply become an unfortunate hostage of the poorly written and implemented movie they are featured in.In addition, due to certain questionable decisions made in that area, some of the effects in ""Mama"" look almost too smooth, cartoonish, and fairytale-like to be truly scary. As a result, in some sense they even seem to be inferior to the very basic, but genuine effects from the low budget original video from YouTube.Overall, ""Mama"" could have become so much better than what it ended up being! An emotionally involving tragedy, a haunting mystery, a strong trio of lead actors, solid special effects – all those valuable ingredients were essentially wasted on the silly, incoherent, and overall unsatisfying story.In my opinion, the only reason to watch ""Mama"" would be enjoying one more great performance of Jessica Chastain. Otherwise, the movie could be safely avoided.knowyourmovie.blogspot.com",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Standard horror with an underlying flair that never quite gets off the ground.,"Unlike some other reviewers this didn't completely blow me away. Certainly there were beautiful elements and disturbing imagery, but overall I felt there was too much scary movie and too little focus on the subtext.In a nutshell, I felt this was a film unsure of its own feet. It wanted to be a dark and atmospheric exploration of the ghost genre; something like Session 9 perhaps. Instead there was too much reliance on established scare tactics, what I call popcorn-pleasers as they satisfy the status quo cinema-goer but are simultaneously shallow, indicative of lazy direction and script. The best scares are those insidious, ongoing and creepy horrors that gradually drag you into the movie universe and leave you there with nowhere to run. That takes effort and talent, but neither were evident in Mama.There are many clichés too. The Japanese style is clearly an influence, but these days that's a tired reference point. Visual effects were stunning with some interesting techniques but again too reminiscent of films like The Ring.Characterisation was similarly lazy, little to no effort made to flesh out the initial cardboard cut out personalities of the 'rock chick' girlfriend and the 'cool uncle', though most of the players did a sterling job with the material available, particularly the child actors. Not so Daniel Kash who, apparently believing he was in a Hammer horror, hammed it up considerably.Overall, an entertaining film but ultimately disappointing when it fails to deliver on the promise of the first half hour and rambles off into familiar territory. Worth a watch, but not the epic classic other reviewers are suggesting.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

You've seen it all before... a completely forgettable experience,"I'm absolutely astounded by the amount of praise this film is getting from critics and audiences. Is this how far we've sunk as filmgoers that we accept whatever so-called horror is thrown our way even if it's a big pile of doo-doo? Mama is yet another jump-scare, cgi ridden, laughable cheese-fest just like so many other myriad ""horror"" pictures that have come out in recent years. It's not even cheesy in a good way. There's good cheesy horror comedies out there that are done right, such as Sam Raimi's Drag Me To Hell. It knew that horror and comedy go perfectly together and worked as a result. Mama is cheesy in that it tries way too hard to be scary and it comes off as silly and amateurish, more of an unintentional comedy. Everyone in my theatre was laughing their heads off constantly. I don't think that was the intention.Granted this film isn't a complete disaster like Boogeyman or Darkness Falls but feels very reminiscent of both those films. Besides the awful CGI ghost, one of the biggest problems with Mama is the overuse of loud noises. Every time something is supposed to be scary, there's an extremely loud noise and usually something flies at the camera really quickly. But it failed to even raise a single hair on my arms or make me scared even for a second. The acting is passable and Jessica Chastain is hot but the plot is nosensical, predictable and has a twist at the end just for the sake of having one in an attempt to save this movie from being completely forgettable. Please folks, don't waste your hard-earned money on sub-par horror movies like this.If you want a ghost story that is actually well-made and scary, watch the Spanish film The Orphanage. Or wait for the Evil Dead remake in a few months. Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell know that great horror isn't about cheap jump scares and by-the-numbers creepiness. Real horror has to get under your skin. It has to get into your head and make you question your own sanity. It has to spark some synapses in your brain and affect you on a subconscious level to truly be scary. See Mulholland Drive by David Lynch for a perfect example. Unfortunately, Mama did none of these things for me and just feels like yet another bargain bin 'horror' title. It's also overlong at 100 minutes and padded with repetitive scenes that add nothing to the film. This is Andrés Muschietti's debut as a feature film director and it shows. He fails to create anything original or worthwhile, simply borrowing from dozens of other horror flicks. 61% on Rotten Tomatoes? 6.6 on the IMDb? For shame.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Exquisite acting, genuinely terrifying, just a little short of a true Horror masterpiece!","This has been my second time watching Mama, the first was a few years back before I took a fancy to documenting my Horror viewing experiencing. I must start off by saying that while I had remembered the film as pretty good, I didn't remember how remarkable and absolutely exquisite it had been! In a genre plagued by mediocrity and lack of innovation, Mama is a well overdue ray of terrifying darkness, giving the most distinguished titles of the past decade a fair and honest run for their money.The story is creepy, discomforting and heart-squeezing from the start. In a dramatic and terrible turn of events two girls, aged around five and one, find themselves abandoned in an old secluded and decrepit wooden shack. About five years pass before they are finally found and allegedly rescued, five years during which they have miraculously survived. Or perhaps ""miraculous"" isn't the right way to put it, as whatever it is that watched over them might not be as benevolent as first thought to be. Then again, it obviously isn't evil (having been the sole factor responsible for the girls' survival)... Or is it?Three things make Mama stand out and flaunt its artistic and horrifying value. First and foremost, the acting. Wow, the acting... While I've always been easily impressed by professional and authentic character-portrayal by younger actors and actresses, little Victoria (Megan Charpentier, 12 years old) and Lilly (Isabelle Nelisse, 10 years old) are by far two of the most talented young Horror actresses I've ever seen. Following the instructions of writer and director Andy Muschietti, they delivered a masterpiece performance of two little girls removed from human society and deprived of their very humanity, moving, sounding and behaving like beasts of the wild. Even if you watch the first 30 minutes or so and nothing more - Victoria and Lilly's predicament and Charpentier and Nelisse's incredible ability to show and deliver it to the audience are as terrifying as they are amazingly impressive.Second, the smart use of audio effects. I've honestly never been as frightened by how a supernatural antagonist sounds, as opposed to how it looks. The guttural moans, the wimping, the cries and the shrieks of rage would make anyone uncomfortable at least, and terrified at most. Don't get me wrong, the antagonist and namesake of the film looks horrifying (I'll be getting to that soon), but it sounds even worse. Honestly, I could be blind and still have trouble sleeping after ""watching"" this.And last but not least, Mama herself. I've been a devout Horror enthusiast for 20 years or so (I'm currently 34) and yet no ghost or creature on screen has ever given me greater chills than Javier Botet as Mama. She doesn't really appear supernatural, more unnatural or even sub-natural. Deformed, revolting and disheartening, the fear of seeing her on screen becomes one of the key Horror factors after the first time she appears. It's like, I wasn't afraid for the characters and of the story as I was of seeing her again, and that's a feature very few Horror antagonist can boast.However, for the sake of objectivity and fairness, certain features of the film could (and indeed should) have been planned and executed better. First, as wisely noted by the review I've read here first (browser refreshed so I can't credit you, sorry!), the antagonist should have been kept more in the shadows, meaning appearing for split microseconds instead of 10 seconds. Seeing her for too long has really diminished her horrifying aura, which I find to be unfortunate. Second, while the ending is pretty realistic given the plot development and is as terrible and discomforting as a Horror ending should be, I couldn't help but feel the film missed the opportunity of a surprising twist (which to me is what makes good Horror great). Amending these two secondary yet significant shortcomings would have made for a solid 10 masterpiece.All in all, Mama is one of the finest, most impressive and most terrifying Horror films I've ever had the terrible pleasure of watching. While this has only been my subjective opinion and others might find this film disappointing - I'd be committing a crime if I didn't recommend it to anyone and everyone who enjoys the occasional good fright. For a 90 minute Horror film currently available on Netflix it's as rewarding as any Horror fan could hope.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
It's not so bad.,"I don't want to sound snooty but this is typical of those horrors made by big companies and marketing to a mass audience, not that the less mainstream ones are better or worse. It's very dark tinted, it uses that familiar style of score, it has a plot element where she goes to the place and find out all about the antagonist etc.It's better than it has a right to be though. It's got a good set up, I really feel for it's wannabe punk rocker heroine thrust into loco parentus. It's a visually engaging movie as strange things lurk always just out of clear view while never going down that actor-clearly-halloween make up route.It's an expensively made and well produced horror for a general audience that is no masterpiece that may not make sense on every level but isn't hateable.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Mama is making eyes at me,"An investment banker Jeffrey (Nikolaj Coaster- Waldau) has a breakdown and kills his wife and two colleagues. He takes his two infant daughters to a cabin in the woods and plans to kill them but they are saved by some entity that protects the girls and raises them. They call her Mama.For five years the girls' uncle, Lucas (also Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) has led a search for the girls and they are found in the cabin. Lucas faces a custody battle with the girl's grandmother but a doctor and a medical institute come to his assistance. Lucas raises them with his rock singer girlfriend Annabel (Jessica Chastain.) When Lucas is hospitalised after an accident, Annabel reluctantly looks after the kids but Mama has been visiting the girls.The film is produced by Guillermo Del Toro and has elements of a dark twisted gothic fairy tale where things certainly go bump in the night.

But I would not let that get you turned off this movie, I try to focus on the good points this movie has to offer, and they outweigh the bad. The overall experience of the movie and the soundtrack of this movie is great, and it offered some pretty good scares, so over all I would recommend.

"Great story, but lacking proper scare moments...","While I didn't find ""Mama"" to be a particularly scary movie, it was a rather nice story and quite well told. The story in the movie was quite interesting and well constructed.The storyline, with few words, is about two young girls who are stranded in the woods, and are found five years later, where they have to live with their uncle and his girlfriend. However, the girls brought an entity with them back from the woods, and Mama is a vengeful, jealous spirit.As much as the movie missed a profound element to make it a movie that will raise the hair on the back of your neck and scare you out of the seat, ""Mama"" does work out quite well. It builds up a good sense of thrill and dread, by the work of the bizarre story and the way it is shot.The effects in the movie were quite good, and worked right to the point. The CGI effects to portray Mama was rather interesting, making her seem human, yet dark, twisted and inhuman at the same time. Without these CGI effects, the movie would have been rather dull.I had initially expected the movie to be more scary, as I had heard a lot about it. That being said, I am not disappointed or anything, the movie just turned out to be something else than I had thought it to be.The ending was one of the better parts, as it is not your typical sunshine Hollywood ending. I am not going to reveal anything about the ending, but trust me, it is an ending well worth seeing and a great twist to an otherwise very interesting story.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Very different from the original short, but still fairly worthwhile","I absolutely love Andy Muschietti's 2008 short film; in three short minutes, it manages to be more excruciatingly chilling than many, many full-length features can claim. Even with Muschietti's involvement, I've been very ambivalent about this full-length adaptation ever since I first learned it was being developed. How could it hope to compare? How well would it maintain the spirit of its progenitor; how much unnecessary story would water down the material? I can't help but wonder from the start whether this 2013 picture is the vision Muschietti had in mind from the start when making the short, and he just lacked the means to fully bring it to fruition, or if it's the tale that was forged after Muschietti was given the opportunity to expand upon the short. Then again, maybe all this is beside the point; either the picture works or it doesn't. For my part, I do think 'Mama' is enjoyable - but it also falls short of the stupendous heights of the short film, and one can quickly begin to pick apart ways certain difficulties.At its best the film crafts sharp, unnerving atmosphere, and it does so simply but effectively. Sound effects, shadows and lighting, unnatural movement or physicality, and incomplete glimpses and suggestions of the supernatural can go a very long way to establishing and maintaining significant, haunting airs about a feature. This can be amplified by an appropriately taut score, as tends to be true here with Fernando Velázquez's themes. 'Mama' is wonderfully well made from a technical standpoint, with all such elements from behind the scenes lending to the uneasy ambience: direction, cinematography, production design and art direction, and the best instances of special effects. I think the cast give splendid performances, certainly including Jessica Chastain before her movie career really took off, and Daniel Kash as determined Dr. Dreyfuss. Hats off as well to Megan Charpentier and Isabelle Nélisse, who embrace the parts of troubled Victoria and Lily with gratifying skill, especially for ones so young.Beyond these facets, 'Mama' arguably becomes more troubled. Part of what made the 2008 short film so piercing and impactful was the curt declination of exposition or explanation, or even to provide major detail; the amorphousness lent to the disquiet. This 2013 movie expands on the short in every way, but the result is indeed some dilution of the most dark and absorbing potential. Don't get me wrong, the narrative as written is strong and worthy; it's a fantastic, unsettling ghost story. In execution, however, the end product is an exceptional, brief snapshot of fear made common. Charpentier and Nélisse act well, but Victoria and Lily here introduce the trope of ""creepy kids"" into the mix. Effects and abnormal manifestations we see in addition to the title character feel like possibly superfluous embellishments. As great as the entity looks in and of herself, and as jolting as she is at her spooky best, I don't think it's unreasonable to say that we see too much of her, thusly reducing the raw power she broadly represents; the scene we get around/just after the 80-minute mark is a prime example, and the climax is even worse in that regard.I do, in fact, like 'Mama,' and I think it's worthwhile. It also unfortunately shares more kinship with the average supernatural horror flick than it does with the monumental, charged bite of Muschietti's original short film. So far as that goes it's a fairly strong and compelling treatment of the genre - possibly no better or worse than its brethren, possibly a small step above. Such as it is, however, it's longer than it needs to be, and substantially dulled from what it could have been. When all is said and done I guess the question is how much one likes the genre, flaws and all: if you're a rabid fan and can't get enough, this is going to ably scratch that itch. If you're less than a diehard fan, and in particular if you're hoping for potency on the same level as the 2008 short film, there's a fair chance you're going to be let down in some measure. For my part, I'm glad I sat to watch 'Mama' all these years later, and I commend all involved for the work put into it - it's a solid horror flick. It also, however, is nothing terribly special, and there's the rub.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

General Review,"I am not ashamed to admit I really enjoyed this film. It's not a horror movie per se but is certainly full of suspense and not the end I predicted.Our story starts with the girls ending up in the woods with Mama making her first brief appearance.We then fast forward to uncle looking for them and eventually uncovering them in the very same cabin we leave them in at the opening scenes. Clearly feral these girls are going to need lots of therapy and care to return to some sense of normality.Uncle wins custody and moves into a new house but Mama is not far behind and taking an active part in the children's life. This is where all the jumps and shocks will start to happen, no unnecessary violence or gore but the thought of what has happened / is happening , you think as the story unravels the end is going to be predictable but thankfully it isn't.Sit down with a pillow if you of a nervous disposition and be prepared for a quite decent film",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Doesn't quite deliver,"Having seen the trailer I went to this with high hopes & a bit of trepidation as I know my wife scares easily when watching creepy movies . In a lot of ways this delivered but ultimately it left me with a sense of never quite following through. The set up for the movie is good the cast are extremely solid Jessica Chastain is very believable & the two young girls played by Megan Charpentier & Isabelle Nelisse are both excellent in their roles. The set piece scares are well delivered & while some may say clichéd , there are only so many ways that you can deliver a scare in a ghost movie so lets not get to hung up on how that's done. Again there are the usual points in any film of this genre were you find yourself shouting why are you going in that cabin in the dark , or why don't you switch the lights on in the house , but lets face it , its not real so you suspend belief. Where the movie ultimately let me down was in the last 20 minutes , the director could have played safe & given the ghost the resolution it desired , or he could have done something off the wall in the end it fell in a slightly strange nether region that just left me feeling dissatisfied. Its a decent movie that's worth a look but its been done better & wont live long in the memory.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Creepy but not really scary. At once depressing and creepy which really makes the movie that much better as it toys with you. I say B.,"""In order to survive such extreme isolation the girls created an imaginary guardian, a parent figure to feed them, sing to them, protect them. They called her mama."" After the stock market takes a down turn the father of two young girls panics and begins to drive off with them. After an accident leads them to a cabin he is about to do the unthinkable when something grabs him. Five years later the girls living with their uncle and aunt begin to see their ""mama"" again. I will start by saying that this movie is creepy but not full on scary. Anyone who has seen the other Del Torro movies will recognize his style. This movie is scary in the way that Pan's Labrynth was. I do have to say that the movie was also a little depressing which made the creepy parts that much more effective since it's playing with your emotions. The movie is good and worth watching but it is PG-13 so don't expect a jump out of your seat horror. Overall, good movie worth seeing but also a little depressing as well as creepy. I give it a B.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Frightening, un-gorified","Mama is a pretty frightening movie, even for jaded scare freaks, about possession and asylums and demons and whatnot. It's not that it's not for the faint of heart - it's only PG-13, for goodness sake - it's that the scares are as psychological as they are visual. It's very well crafted, with an atypical ending and top-notch performances by a pair of young girls. It does dabble in some horror tropes and lapses in logic, but overall it's very successful at what it tries to be - a movie that burrows into your head to make you wonder what is coming next.Victoria (Megan Charpentier) and Lilly (Isabelle Nelisse) are two very young girls whose father suddenly comes home one day and takes them away - ""Mommy's sick"" - to an isolated cabin in the middle of a snowstorm, and then he's gone. Don't ask me how or why; it'll spoil things. This leaves the girls - aged three and one (!) to fend for themselves. They are found five years later, and after the quickest custody battle of all time, they are handed over to their Uncle Luke (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) and his rock-band girlfriend Annabel (Jessica Chastain, seriously). To facilitate the handover, Dr. Dreyfuss, who has been studying the girls, sets them all up in a nice new house, the better to get unfettered access to them. After all, they've been feral for five years. Young Lilly almost never walks upright. Victoria retains some memories of life before losing her mom and dad, but even she harbors some very dark secrets - after all, who's been feeding the girls all this time?Shortly into the movie, Luke is incapacitated and endures a hospital stay, while Annabel - who had been considering leaving him - is stuck with two very unorthodox sisters with a mysterious past. Maybe some nurturing is in order, but it doesn't seem to be rocker Annabel's thing. Even so, she loves Luke enough to give it a go until he can return home. That's when all hell breaks loose. You see, readers, it seems something has followed the girls from that lone cabin in the woods, something that had been protecting it, something that sees Luke and Annabel as intruders, not helpers. Something...well, something not good. Things happen in the house that prove to be very unsettling to Annabel; the girls seem to have a new, unseen playmate but remain mostly incommunicado. It's not quite Amityville Horror-level, with bleeding walls and such, but it's not a relaxing environment. Only Lilly seems at ease; Annabel knows something is up but has no idea what's in store for her, and Victoria is caught in the middle, having known a life before the abandonment.One of the treasures of this movie is in piecing together what's happened to launch all events into motion. Why did the dad take the girls away? Where is the mom? You have to listen closely to news reports - which usually feel like nothing more than background noise - to learn the truth.One side note about Chastain - she is virtually unrecognizable. Gone is the flowing red hair. She looks more like Courtney Cox in the Scream movies. She does fine with the material she has to work with, in fact a bit better.It's a dark, dark movie, Mama is. Who is Mama? Is it the girls' mother, not really dead? Is it her ghost? Is it someone else? Is it no one else - an imaginary friend created by the girls to cope with living alone? It takes the adults in the movie about as long to figure it out as it will take the average viewer, and that's a good thing. Motives are not always obvious, and research - by Dreyfuss - is undertaken. This movie manages to pull off the trick of including a scary demon/ghost/whatever without showing her too fully (as in bright light or even fully formed). There are just enough unanswered questions - too many, and it's a flawed film, and too few and it's an overly neat film. And even though we can all guess where all roads lead in a geographic sense, the ending is a solid, plausible, emotional surprise.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not scary,"The father of two little girls kills their mother, and kidnaps the kids. Five years later, the girls' uncle Lucas (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) finds them abandoned, and the father long dead. He tries to raise them with his girlfriend Annabel (Jessica Chastain). Annabel isn't one who wants kids. Little do they know that the two girls have been raised by Mama.For a horror movie, there isn't one scary moment to be had. She is just a creepy CG creation. She's interesting looking but nothing too original. We know that Mama would never hurt the kids. That's half of the scary possibilities gone automatically. She really only kills one person and nobody cares about that person. Also we don't actually see the kill. The ending isn't scary either.

The acting in the film was good for who the characters were, and what they thought and wanted. The scares were good, but after the first three I picked up a formula. Listen to the music.

Art House Horror one creepy Ghost Story,"MAMA is a very surreal ghost story. The film has an emotional side woven into the supernatural thriller that a lot of horror genre films do not explore . MAMA goes there in part by the hardened character 'Annabel 'Jessica Chastain . Her character ark through the film shifts and it works very well in synergy with the two little girls 'Victoria' and to some degree 'Lilly' as there bond grows.I just have to say that Jessica Chastain is wonderful actress that really did carry this movie. A strong and someone powerful performance by her that really propels MAMA to a surreal dramatic piece of horror cinema.The supernatural MAMA is a very freaky and scary ghost .The film Guillermo del Toro presents was based on a short film he saw Directed By Barbara Muschietti, Andy Muschietti . Guillermo del Toro reached out and had Andy Muschietti direct MAMA and it pays off big in an excellent Art house horror film .",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Spoiler Alert! Great movie but..stick to the script,"This review contains one or two spoilerish statements. Look, I loved this movie. I loved the visuals, I loved the way it was sympathetic to the ghost (because ghosts are people too). But I have to foul it because my two most hated tactics were used far too liberally:1. Using the movie's description to explain the movie's plot. ""The stock market crashes and a distraught father kills his employees and his wife then turns the gun on his daughters""....am I the only one who saw absolutely none of this actually IN the movie and, having not read the write-up, was left wondering....why in the name of creation did this dude up and try to kill his kids? Also, if this movie is set during the stock market crash of the 1920's, which it certainly looks like in the beginning, why is it that five years later the girls' uncle is wandering around the current era? A little continuity would have been nice, especially for those of us who love period clothing.2. Using the storyboard to tell the story. The 11 minutes of children's drawings at the beginning were utterly pointless. I could have done without the scene where dad drives the girls off a cliff, finds some cabin, and tries to kill his kids by shooting them in the head, too. Realistically, if the movie had started with the brother trying to find his nieces and just EXPLAINING to his girlfriend that they had gone missing, nothing would be lost. Except a lot of confusion.The CGI was cool and I really loved the mini actress who played Victoria. She had a great range but unfortunately, couldn't carry off the entire plot by herself. The brother is missing from 80% of the plot and it seems like he's only there to show us that....to....I have no idea. It's pretty clear that the actor doesn't know why he's there either. I don't think it's his fault that he has like 11 lines and none of them further the movie in the slightest. At least he got more lines than dad, who has one, spoken in a weird dream the brother has about him: another scene the movie could have done without.This movie seems to be ""about"" the girls' stepmom, the contrast between her and mama. At the end of the movie, I ended up feeling sorry for the kid who went with her instead of the ghost, since throughout the movie she proves herself to be an unemployed, irresponsible, self-absorbed and generally uncaring addict. Literally the worst mother imaginable. If this movie was going for my heartstrings, it missed.I feel like ""mama"" was the only sympathetic character. And they killed HER off before the movie even started. The end result was a movie that is also a bad joke. What happens when a Canadian and Spanish film maker get together? The story is overly complicated, overly emotional, disjointed, and too long.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Great until the big ""reveal""","A creepy and mostly original ghost story. Jennifer Chastain is excellent as the goth and reluctant surrogate mother ... a nice change from the suburban mom that is more typical for these character types. The youngest actress who plays ""Lily"" does a great job juxtaposing cute and creepy as the most screwed up ""wildling.""You can clearly see Guillermo Del Toro's influence given his obsession with bugs. There is too much use of ""The Grudge's"" groaning sound effect -- someone needs to come up with a new and more original sound.When they eventually show ""Mama"" in all her glory it starts looking a bit cheesy. But of the three similar titles put out in the last six months (Sinister, The Possession), this is the best of that lot.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
When del Toro is involved (even just as an executive producer) you know you're going to get a quality film.,"'MAMA': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Guillermo del Toro executive produced this supernatural horror film about two young girls left in the forest to live on their own, with a spirit (they call 'Mama') watching over them. When they're found and go to live with their uncle, and his girlfriend, 'Mama' goes with them (causing lots of havoc of course). It stars multi Oscar nominee and 'it girl' Jessica Chastain as the 'girlfriend' watching over the girls. The film was directed and co-written by Andres Muschietti. Andres wrote the film with Neil Cross and Barbara Muschietti and it's also an adaptation of a 2008 short film he wrote and directed. As far as these clichéd ghost horror films go this is a pretty entertaining one, that delivers the spooks you expect it too.The film opens with a man named Jeffrey (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) suffering a mental breakdown, as the outbreak of the 2008 financial crisis is upon him, and he kills his business partners and wife. He takes his two young daughters for a drive, speeding down a snow covered road, and crashes in the forest. Planning to kill himself and his daughters he takes his two young girls to a cabin, in the woods, but is killed by a ghost before he can kill the children. The two girls, Victoria (Megan Charpentier) and Lilly (Isabelle Nelisse), are then raised by the mysterious spirit, which they call 'Mama'. When they're found, by a search party sent by Jeffrey's brother Lucas (also played by Coaster-Waldau), they're very animalistic (Lilly walks on all fours). After being examined by a psychiatrist (Daniel Kash) the girls are sent to live with Lucas and his punk rock girlfriend Annabel (Chastain). This becomes much more work than the couple is expecting, especially when 'Mama' begins making her presence noticed.The movie is spooky, creepy and full of great visual effects. While the film is light on actual gore, unlike a lot of other modern ghost films, you do get to see a lot of the ghost action and 'Mama' makes a pretty classic movie monster/spirit. Chastain is of course above this kind of work but her presence does make the movie that much more believable and effective. When del Toro is involved (even just as an executive producer) you know you're going to get a quality film and this one definitely delivers what fans of the genre should be expecting. I'd say It's a pretty pleasant surprise for ghost/thriller fans!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-onDgBMVyo",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good but not really good,"The problem is: I have seen far worse. I walked out of too many movies. I didn't walk out of this one. I had no complaints because my expectations were really low. Generic story with generic acting, bland CGI and a rather predictable ending. It's the Grudge meets the Eye meets the Others, meets god knows what else.Why did it have to be a ghost, though? To start in the woods with two little toddlers left there alone in the cold, and end up with a ghost story is so lame. However, it's not a movie with the major Hollywood poop that usually gets on my nerves and insults my intelligence, nah... just another drab story.It was a bit scary for me though. Because I am not a horror movie buff, and because I was always anticipating something to happen (which doesn't).If you thought the grudge (the American version) was amazing, you'll like this movie.

TheVidiot Reviews,"MamaThe hardest part of adopting feral children is getting them to stop sniffing strangers' crotches.Fortunately, the wild children in this horror have a mysterious entity to keep them in line.Five years after being abandoned by their suicidal father, Victoria (Megan Charpentier) and Lilly (Isabelle Nélisse) are rescued from an isolated cabin and placed in the custody of their Uncle (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau).But when he is suddenly hospitalized, guardianship falls on his punk rock bassist girlfriend Annabel (Jessica Chastain).Home alone with the undomesticated darlings, Annabel is introduced to a being the sisters call Mama - a possessive poltergeist that is growing increasingly jealous of Annabel's newfound fondness for the girls.A maternal ghost story, Mama's sinister aesthetic is accentuated by genuine scares provided by the rehabilitated wildlings and their forlorn phantom.Furthermore, with their growling, spitting and rudimentary English, Annabel's feral children could sing in her punk band.Yellow Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.com",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Mother of all mediocre horror movies!,"After a promising start, ""Mama"" descends into just another ghost story.For the first half off the movie, the film looks like its going to be an interesting mixture of what you'd probably expect. Mixing up the creepy kids, and the tall dark spooky ghost lady stuff, you would usually find in many other horror movies.The second half however, takes a more serious downfall. Throwing in un-necessarily lame dream sequences, plenty off major plot holes, and a good handful of ""its behind you but your not noticing it for some reason!"" moments. Plus, the human characters intelligence seems to go off the rails, in a part two that doesn't think it needs to explain anything that's going on, because it got its chat out off the way in the first half.There are more than enough scary moments In ""mama,"" but just as many desperate attempts too freak us out (moths, goofy CGI) plenty of random moments just thrown in too kill time, some bits that make no sense whatsoever, and parts that just don't work at all.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Mama just killed a man.,"'Mama (2013)' is a horror movie that's very obviously inspired by J-horror such as 'Ju-On: The Curse (2000)' and the sort of dark fantasy popularised by Guillermo Del Toro (who also acts as a producer here). The flick falls short of most of its inspirations (at least those I've seen), feeling as though it sits somewhere in between being a competent homage to those genres and a washed-out, generic example of ''The Conjuring (2013)'-lite' Hollywood horror. A genuinely interesting set-up makes way for quite a bit of thematic resonance, and the narrative is genuinely quite interesting for its majority. Once it's evident that the rushed opening is intended to be an elliptical entry point rather than a part of the actual first act (it's definitely a prologue), the picture maintains a consistent pace and perpetuates its atmosphere in a mostly satisfying way. It does start to get a bit repetitive as it heads towards its surprisingly subversive finale, wearing a little thin when it comes to its stop-start domestic horror. However, it's never dull and it keeps its characters, as lightly drawn as they are, front and centre. Where it really falls down is in its overt horror, as its scare sequences become far too overt for their own good and rely on a creature that actually provokes laughter rather than fear on more than one occasion. Perhaps it's due to the overwhelming amount of CGI used to bring the eponymous matriarch to life, or perhaps it's due to the over-the-top sound effects and almost absurd choreography that perforate the latter portion of the piece. Either way, the villain could certainly have been rendered more convincingly and frighteningly. The story deals primarily in clichés and, outside of its intriguing set-up and somewhat surprising payoff, feels like an amalgamation of tropes we've all seen before. This is perhaps more pertinent when it comes to the construction of those aforementioned scare scenes, which are about as predictable as they could possible be, but it also applies to the overarching plot. The cinematography leaves something to be desired, often feeling bland and uninspired. This is especially true of its few day-for-night sequences. Having said all that, the film is engaging and enjoyable for its majority. It's not a bad effort, by any means, and its predictability isn't a as big an issue as you may expect. It's a solid entry in its sub-genre, at least when it comes to those made in the United States.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Mama didn't follow me home,"I love that every movie i have seen of Guillermo's has a story i haven't seen before. I love the fantasy and distorted imagery. There is also always a great deal of sentimentality involved in his horror. I don't know why he's focused on the loss of children and their connection to living people, but it is always touching.Mama is not scary, however. It is sweet and a little creepy with some memorable scenes, even a little humour. Unfortunately i wasn't paranoid looking around my room after coming home at 10pm after the film had finished expecting a dead lady to be crawling out from the wall, though. It isn't something that played on my mind and that bothers me! Good horror always gets me psychologically and wakes me up in the night feeling like something is in the room.Mama didn't visit me.It is an original story, but there are bits which are very predictable, some bits which are just pointless, and some bits that didn't make sense. There was a gap left in the story, too, which i'm going to post a question about because i don't want to include spoilers here. That let it down for me. I was confused by it.To be honest i didn't like the men and their parts in the film much! It was all about the little girls and they are fantastic little actors.

Give it the benefit of the doubt...,"Well done in the heretofore Japanese fashion (which has been co-opted in recent years by filmmakers from every corner of the globe), MAMA teeters on the brink of excellence: it's well-crafted, with good music and sound effects, and a decent enough storyline. There are some genuinely creepy scenes (the youngest girl crawling around on all fours is startling), but the cgi- yet again- gum up the works when they are needed least- at film's end. Drama goes right out the window once the cgi start; lacking credibility (they LOOK like what they are: cheesy computerized effects), they yank the rug right out from under the viewer.

A lot of people I feel will struggle to understand the ending and with the slow build up if they haven't got into that I can imagine that the ending will leave people feeling they want more.

Boring,"So here's the thing about Mama: you can have all the outstanding performances, spot-on camera work and decent special effects you like, when you lack atmosphere, all is lost in the horror genre, and let that be what this film's weakest point is. The tricky bit about genuine fear is the thin line between tension and confronting whatever's lurking in the dark: most horror films nowadays mistake suspense with making whatever it is the movie's throwing at you go ""boo"" in your face. This movie, however, takes the other extreme: nearly nothing happens throughout the whole movie, aside from a few scary bits (first scene with the butterfly!), but the legitimately creepy moments are way too far in between to fully enjoy or even notice on first glance, for that matter. The movie's ending is the weakest of all. I won't spoil: but trust me, after you're done with it you'll wonder when the Disney logo'll appear in the credits. Don't waste your time on this, except if your 12-year old wants to see his first horror move THAT bad or something.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

Interesting take on the typical Ghost story,"I saw this being rated a 6 out of 10 on here, so I wasn't expecting a hell of a lot, but I was pleasantly surprised by how good this movie was. It's pretty hard to find a genuinely good, creepy, scary movie and they're all the same cliched crap for the most part, so I found this movie great in that it was a pretty fresh approach to the malevolent ghost angle. There's obviously going to be a couple parts that could have been done better, but the visuals of 'Mama' were creepy as all hell. The thing that makes a good ghost movie good are the jumps, the anticipation and the visuals of the protagonist, and this movie clicks those boxes. Again, it's not Shakespeare, but it's not meant to be. I would definitely, definitely recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good, creepy ghost story. Definitely worth more than the 6/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Morgan McGarry Was a Cutie,I've seen this movie 3 times now. I even saw the 3 minute short that came with the DVD with different actors playing the children as well as a commentary. Normally I can't stand children in movies but this movie had some very endearing little girls - 2 sets for 2 girls 5 years apart. I must admit Morgan McGarry who played the 3 year-old Victoria was the cutest thing I ever saw with those spectacles of hers that made her seem very vulnerable. She only lasted a few minutes into the beginning of the movie but still had an impact on me. She was even super cute with her car coat and hood on from the back as she was walking through the woods with her hand in her father's hand. Very touching moment - and believe me I don't get all squishy with kids in movies. The only way I like kids is barbecued so these children were very special.The older Lilly played by Isabelle Nélisse grew on me near the end with that incredible smile of hers when it was obvious that she was more enchanted with Mama than with Annabelle.The story line was different but no better or worse than any other ghost story I've ever seen and this one was at least original in many respects. I was glad that the steady cam was steady as most steady cam operators seem to be born with a tremor of some kind so you walk out of the theater with a bad case of the spins.This movie was tailor made for CGI as it produced an interesting ghost that changed shape - and color sometimes - in almost every sequence it was in. Also the ghost wasn't predictable every time it appeared.I enjoyed the way that the older Victoria slowly endeared herself to Jessica Chastain's character Annabelle and how Chastain tried her best to be close to both girls even though the younger sister Lily was much more difficult for her. There was a coincidence that made the story easier to deal with such as Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau who played both twin brothers Lucas Desange and Jeffrey Desange. That made it much easier and actually more enjoyable to see him bond almost instantly with Victoria as Lilly was obviously going to be more difficult.Look for Daniel Kash as Dr. Gerald Dreyfuss who played Spunkmeyer in Aliens!! It was a nice blast from the past.,7.0,Anonymous,Horror

There seems to be no logical reason for anything to be happening. It turns out to be a very simple ghost story. The middle part of the film is what let the whole production down. For about an hour nothing much happens to advance the story...it is an hour of ""whoops...I see the ghost...whoops it went away"" This central hour of the film goes on too long like that. The only good part is the representation of the ghost...they did a pretty good job of imagining her. All the actors are rather forgettable.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hilariously terrifying.,The movies beginning is quite good. but after a while things become shady and hard to follow. Finally coming to the end of the movie you feel like you're watching an episode of Scooby Doo. There are a few foul words used by the aunt but usually not around the little girls unless its a serious situation. there are some very funny spots in the movie but not many. there are also a few jump scares but nothing to scare you out of your skin. I recommend for beginners or those children who think they're ready for scary movies. The only reason the movie is rated pg13 is because of aunt Annabelle's bad language and there is a few kissing scenes between a husband and wife. but they soon come to a stop before anything could get out of hand.,6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Atmospheric but Uneven Horror,"Mama is a horror film that grabs you with its eerie atmosphere and intriguing premise. The story of two young girls raised by a ghostly figure in the woods sets the stage for some genuinely chilling moments.

The use of shadows, light, and sound is masterful, creating a sense of dread that lingers throughout.Jessica Chastain delivers a solid performance as Annabel, the reluctant guardian, and the young actresses who play the girls are convincingly eerie. There's a real emotional core to the story, especially as the bond between the girls and the entity known as ""Mama"" is explored. You can tell that Guillermo del Toro's influence as a producer adds a layer of depth to the film's dark fantasy elements.However, as much as I enjoyed the mood and setup, Mama falters when it comes to its pacing and narrative cohesion. The story starts to lose its grip in the second half, with the plot becoming increasingly convoluted and less frightening as it tries to juggle too many ideas at once. The CGI-heavy climax, while visually striking, lacks the emotional punch it needed to deliver a satisfying conclusion. And while the central ghost is certainly creepy, there are moments where the scare tactics feel a bit repetitive.Overall, Mama is an atmospheric horror film with some standout moments, but it doesn't quite sustain its tension or fully deliver on its potential. It's a decent watch if you're in the mood for something spooky, but it doesn't leave a lasting impression.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Mama elevates its qualities by trying to escape a little irrelevant scares and focus on a woman's relationship with her protégés,"The film has the words ""presented by Guillermo Del Toro, creator of Pan's Labyrinth (2006)"" stamped on its main poster. Much more than a paltry marketing ploy, it is really clear that Mama has several points in common with the brilliant 2006 work: lost childhood, early maturation, the supernatural and fantasy as ways of dealing with reality. Based on a short film of the same name, the feature film shows how the father of two girls, distraught by the US financial crisis, apparently kills his wife and takes his daughters Victoria and Lily (Megan Charpentier and Isabelle Nélisse) to a cabin in a forest, where he intends to take their lives and his own. This until interrupted by an entity. Years later, Lucas (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau), the father's twin brother, continues the search for his nieces, which remain fruitless. Next to her is rocker girlfriend Annabel (Chastain, gorgeous in a short-haired brunette version). The children, however, end up being found in an almost animalistic state and taken to a special house of the guardianship council, where Lucas and Annabel will learn to take care of the girls and try to bring them back to normal. But it looks like something or someone else has gone along with it.Despite the premise of yet another horror film with mothers and children dealing with the supernatural (The Ring, 2002, Black Water, 2005, Orphan, 2009, among other titles of this vintage), Mama manages to differentiate herself by paying less attention to scares and focus more on Chastain's character's relationship with the girls. In the first scene in which Annabel appears, we already know that she does not intend to have children any time soon. After all, she practically jumps for joy when her pregnancy test comes back negative. But it is precisely from the moment that she is forced to live alone with the two problematic children (because of an ""accident"" with Lucas), that her maternal instinct begins to emerge, causing her to deal head-on with the then Mama of the title, which can be the fruit of the girls' fantasy or something more.The film begins very well with the establishment of the scenario, and during much of the projection, it is effective in keeping us stuck to the narrative. The mystery surrounding the title character is what arouses the greatest interest, but the screenwriters see the need to make terms and phenomena explicit (bringing an absurd explanation to differentiate Mama from a ghost, which is literally thrown up in the air at its conclusion) and not can't even handle its narrative lines. Like, for example, the moment when one of the characters arrives during the day to explore a cabin in the woods and, for some reason, we see him in the next scene entering it at night...A newcomer in the field, Muschietti manages to show he has a good eye for direction and guarantees beautiful plans (see the opening that brings images of a mountain dominated by snow) and creativity in the elaboration of the horror, highlighting the scene in which we follow Mama's flashback in first person (which is frightening due to the intensity of the situation and the color palette chosen by director of photography Antonio Riestra) and the one in which the psychologist played by Daniel Kash looks for the creature in a dark cabin, using flashes of a camera as a guide. Of course, sound designers and composer Fernando Velázquez use and abuse their functions to generate the most cliché jump scares of the genre, making it very easy to predict when a scare will hit us; but being unavoidable to escape it when it arrives.Undoubtedly Mama is an intriguing ghost story filled with emotions and chills. It's enjoyable to watch, but doesn't risk the depth. Jessica Chastain's performance, a rebellious teenage girl who is by no means a caricature, is solid, but the spotlight is stolen by the premature talent and wild acting of Megan Charpentier and Isabelle Nélisse. The child actresses are replaced as the years go by, and each one seems to have been handpicked. The 1-year-old Lily and 3-year-old Victoria are so beautiful that they capture the viewer's heart without even having to try. Then the older ones, mentioned above, enter the scene and fulfill their role well.Megan Charpentier is no newcomer, having already appeared in Jennifer's Body, Red Riding Hood, and Resident Evil: Retribution, and she handles the heavy subject with poise and maturity, blending innocence and experience. Traumatized by the past, perhaps her heart became harder than most children her age, which helped her survive. Still, she shows glimpses of a girl who just wants a mother. Isabelle Nélisse is also flawless as little Lily. Fortunately, the CGI didn't dominate her movements much longer, and allowed her to create, on her own, a fascinating animalistic to watch. When she plays, eats or just smiles, it's like watching a real wild child in a documentary.Mama was the supernatural element that protected the girls all the time they were lost. Mama obviously doesn't like to see her children taken from her home and now, receiving help and affection from others, she hasn't turned away from the girls so easily. Although Victoria and Lilly's main bond is with Luke, he is completely sidelined in the plot, focusing only on Annabel, so well-played by Jessica. It is precisely this approach between Annabel and the girls, their conquest and the growth of feelings between the three that awakens the entire climax of the film.If the film sinned, it was in Mama's conception. Created in CGI and based on a very tall and thin actor (Javier Botet), her appearance is not efficient like the one presented in the short. CGI is not always the best tool, and this is clear here. It sounds too artificial, if not comical. Her face, eccentrically asymmetrical, is frightening and sad, but rather forced. When you finally look into their eyes, your expectations are bathed in cold water. I'm not saying the CGI sucks (especially in the final scene), but considering that the intention was to scare, the flaw is serious. There are scares, in those moments of ""make her face suddenly appear on the screen and turn the volume up to maximum, all together"". On the other hand, Mama is the only character with a deeper backstory. We never know, for example, what drove Lucas to commit the murders, or why Annabel looks so disgusted. Mama, in turn, gains a plausible legend of her own and is one of those villains who win the public's sympathy.The supernatural invades the plot in fact during Lily and Victoria's coexistence with the couple. There is a strong connection between them and the forest that translates into rationally inexplicable events, caused by the same title entity that, in the first act, ensured Victoria's survival. They are the true horror of Mama, which also offers slivers of suspense and a handful of commonplaces that, in the first instance, make the production another example of a genre that, so often, sounds like a kind of caricature of itself. In other words, the discreet quality of Mama comes much more from the interpretations of Chastain and the child actresses than from her script punctuated by some slips.Among the holes observed in the 100 minutes of projection is the exaggerated delay in locating the girls in that forest. It's been five years of searching for a result that could be achieved in much less time, considering that the place was not so far away. The sequence that shows Jeff admitted to the hospital in a serious condition to, in the next minute, accompany him in a rush through the corridors willing to help his nieces is another small slip of the narrative. When it comes to clichés, there is no shortage of the most basic and questionable ones. Danger always comes with the night and its inherent darkness, whether through strange sounds or violent deaths, especially of characters in search of the resolution of the mystery that accounts for the twisting of the plot. Not to mention the suicidal and unlikely courage of these characters, who approach the strange object completely unguarded.But Mama's problem lies in the need to devise a complex plot for her title character. Andrés Muschietti's short film (who takes on the role of director and co-writer, the latter with his sister Barbara) works much better than the long film precisely because of the mystery. The 3 minutes of duration portray a bizarre scene (which in the film is remade practically frame by frame) that remains unexplained, also impressive for its narrative competence. Here, the screenwriters create a whole backstory for the creature and still fill the story with poorly distributed figures, saved only by the good performances of their interpreters; especially the versatile Jessica Chastain, who builds a completely different subject from her previous performances - and it's not just the gothic look that helped, the actress is the only one who has the chance to properly develop her character.One of the reasons I love the genre is that it's not bound by the usual limitations of visionaries, say, Italian neorealist. Tragic stories are exciting and, at the same time, incoherent. Mama is original in narrating the mother-child bond. Of course, there is no such thing as a ""completely original storyline"", but there is an original vision. Although full of clichés, most of it is used correctly to immerse the viewer in the plot. The film is not a bed of roses. That's where a cliché can be put to good use: forcing a scare on those who watch. It might not be the most mature tactic, but it works in a way. Mama doesn't measure up to other supernatural thrillers, nor the original short. It's not one of the best horror films of recent times, but it elevates its qualities by trying to escape a little irrelevant scares and focus on a woman's relationship with her protégés. The narrative earns even more points for its courageous ending that escapes the usual clichés.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Good start, but fell flat.","I just got back from seeing it and these are my impressions. I prefer going to the theatres for horror movies, mainly because some of the scare tactics work on the big screen, I can't say the same for watching it at home. The movie had a Strong momentum through out, but at the end it loses it's drive. Once you see mama in full view, it is no longer scary, hell Lily was scarier than mama most of the time. Now I do not like cgi monsters, I was fine with the cgi up until they have her standing in front of the camera for long sections. If you were scarred throughout, don't worry, after the ending I guarantee you won't lose any sleep, I know I won't. The plot with the doctor was good, but it ended up serving little purpose. The kids did a good job, and they look especially creepy when they are crawling around like animals. There was some good suspense and plenty of jump scares to keep you tense. I wonder if the film would have benefited from having a real actress playing mama instead of the computer, I would have liked to have seen that. This is one of those films were the trailer was better than the film, I'm not saying the movie was bad, it's just that the trailer made it look like so much more. The only part I didn't enjoy about this experience was the two obnoxious bimbos' beside me, they were in their late twenties and were acting like 16 year old kids, that's why I like going to the theatre at 11:00am on a Saturday morning, no one to annoy me. Overall the film is a good waste of an hour and forty minutes, check it out if you are interested.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Ma Ma Mia,"This movie is creepy. The effects used felt original and put a new twist on ghostly movies. I went in with low expectations expecting rehashed jump scares... And while there are a few, no ghost movie would be complete without them, the most frightening moments for me came right out in the open developing and unfolding in thrilling white knuckle sequences. I watched this movie about a week ago and have seen several horror movies since but Mama has remained on my mind.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Could of been a great movie,"This movie had a good back story (about as plausible as movies of this genre get) and was handled very well pretty much throughout. There was a genuinely spooky spectre looming in the background in the first three quarters of the movie but when it came to the pay off i.e. when we got a good look at the phantom, it looked liked a cartoon character. If a bit more money had been spent on the CGI (or what ever effect was used) and the spook had looked more 3 dimensional this movie would have got a 9 from me. However, I found it more unsettling than the laughable 'The Conjuring' and 'Insidious' and it has that rare quality which leaves you feeling a little sympathy for the ghost.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Scary horror film with many loose threads,"Mama is a story about two little girls left alone in the woods after their father drives the car off a cliff. To survive, they create a fantasy ""mama"" figure who looks after them. After five years, their uncle finally finds them and, along with his rocker girlfriend, wants to adopt them. However the two girls are deeply disturbed and they must cut a deal with a psychologist who wants to study them.This film has horror themes, with all the predictable mainstream horror clichés, especially with the never ending shock moments, the inexplicable scenes where the heroes must stay in the house and the fact that they do any investigations at night. Let alone they don't seem to talk to anyone else in the whole movie.There are also many events, characters and information that happen that don't develop anything in the plot. And they aren't even red herrings.The strongest parts of this movie are those that made The Ring a great movie - beautiful dark imagery, scary children and a mystery to unravel, but unfortunately in a completely more illogical way with much shallower characters.Most of the situations were so ridiculous that I was laughing quite regularly. In fact, if it didn't have the ""it's so bad it's good factor"", I would have given it a much lower rating.It's certainly one to watch if you want to be entertained and it's very well shot and a beautiful movie. But certainly one that I will not be revisiting.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Mama has it's fair share of scarey moments,"(2013) Mama
HORRORI just want to say that Jessica Chastain's acting is much better in this one than she was in ""Zero Dark Thirty"" which is the type of movie the Academy would surely go for. Co-written and directed by Andrés Muschietti has a pair of little sisters of Victoria and Lilly becoming isolated in a creepy cabin in the woods after a scary looking figure saved them from their psychotic father who was bent on killing them after a killing spree in the city involving his wife and co-workers before crashing his car onto a ditch while driving away on a highway. I mean gee, if a search party is being instructed, one would've thought that someone could probably find a cabin, but no- that is not the case as they were not discovered until a couple of hunters stumbled onto it 5 years later. Meanwhile, the killer's easy going brother Lucas (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau)fights for custody of them and wins but has to agree on specific conditions by allowing the doctor to come often and check on them. As the two sisters act abnormal toward something unusual to something no one don't see except to it Mama hence the title. This creature would act similar to how the creature from ""The Grudge"" would act where at first the two girls would imitate how this creature would move around by also using their hands as feet. This is the beginning of irregular things to happened as police are hardly involved into a thorough search of the cabin where they happen to be found. As well as the Jessica Chastain character doesn't call the police to check the so-called closet, one would often wonder how a person can remain to be hidden for such a long time. And I agree with users that the ending is ludicrous but not completely all that sad but some of the scares still work. Some of the affectionate scenes are poorly done but Chastain holds this film together.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A prime example of modern horror,"'Mama' is the latest horror movie to receive a reasonable budget. That may raise it slightly above the hundreds of other B-movies out there, but the problem - in my opinion - is that is simply follows the typical (modern) horror structure.This is as follows... Creepy things start to happen to a family (mainly the children). The adults put it down to a rational explanation and call the police. The police do nothing. Slowly the adults except that something supernatural is happening. They seek advice from a convenient expert in the field. They confront the horror at the end of the film.Unfortunately, Mama follows this narrative structure to the letter. Yes, it is well shot. Yes, there are some 'jumpy' moments and yes the overall vibe is slick, well-produced and a bit creepy. But, at the end of the day, it's nothing that seasoned horror fans (which I'm including me in) haven't seen a hundred times before.It's certainly a decent offering in the horror genre, but it might be nice for film-makers to try something a little more out of the norm.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Well made and delivers a few chills, but not fully satisfying.","""Mama"" succeeds in generating a few genuine scares, but it predominantly provides some lingering, and creepy images--despite indulging into numerous clichés. It is a well-made film that delivers mild chills and thrills, with a solid cast to help gloss over the expected bag of tricks. It also helps tremendously to have Guillermo del Toro as an Executive Producer.In the prologue to ""Mama,"" we learn of a shooting at a financial firm after an economic crash. A distraught executive named Lucas (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) arrives home, quickly collects his two young daughters, Victoria and Lilly, and speeds off. They end up in an abandoned house deep in the forest, where Lucas apparently intends to shoot his daughters before he can kill himself. But that is not quite how it works out. Five years later, Lucas' brother Jeffrey (also played by Coaster-Waldau) has never given up hope. Jeff's team of searchers comes across the abandoned house we saw a century ago in a nightmare. Dad's long gone, but the girls are still there - crawling around on all fours and making noises like wild animals. How could they have survived on their own? They are taken into the care of their dead father's brother and his rocker girlfriend away from the cabin they've called home all this time. Mama is none too pleased about this development, as I'm sure you can imagine. The girls are kept in isolation for a few months as Dr. Dreyfuss (Daniel Kash) records their every move while helping with their assimilation, given that Victoria keeps making cryptic references to an unseen Mama. Lilly sleeps under the bed, still occasionally eats bugs, and screams whenever anyone tries to touch her. The girls hardly seem ready for ice cream and bedtime stories, but Jeffrey is determined to give them a normal life. Muschietti and his story collaborators Neil Cross and Barbara Muschietti, managed to keep an entire back-story up their sleeves to reveal it in teasing fashion, which works to a degree, maintaining viewers engagement with the film. In addition, there are some creative nightmare sequences--a highly stylized dream set in which we see a crazed young woman screaming bloody terror before leaping off a cliff with her newborn.Overall, the casting for the film is fine, especially the role of Annabel, played by Jessica Chastain, who slowly sheds her tough-talking exterior from ""Zero Dark Thirty"" (2012). Her nurturing instincts take over in this film, displaying her incredible range as one of the finest at her craft at this time. There are ideas and themes present in ""Mama"", but they are not quite fully developed to satisfaction, as the film does confuse at times when it seems to suggest that the idea of settling into a normal family unit could in fact be the real horror. Come the end, Muschietti may not have worked out all his own unresolved issues, but he does manage communicate his fears effectively. And besides, that's what sequels are for.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Guillermo del Toro impresses again,"The moment I saw from the opening credits that the movie was from Guillermo del Toro, I knew that I was into something good. I was not disappointed. The film is creepy and horrifying in parts. The child artists are very impressive and the murderous wraith, the 'mama' is scary enough. The film, however, belongs to Jessica Chastain, who portrays Annabel, a rocker chick, who is forced to become a nanny to two rather unwholesome, unholy kids. However, Annabel's character development is awesome. Not for a moment does she falter, even when her fiancé is confined to intensive care and the kids (and their mama) play all sorts of nasty tricks on the poor girl. The plot may be a bit thin, a bit outlandish, and may have the usual horror film clichés, but all in all, the film impresses. And that is a true compliment, because horror films seem to have run out of ideas these days.. one can almost anticipate the next move, the next scene, the next scare. Not so with this one.

True Love Story,"Spoilers: This is my take on the entire movie. #1 it was not a horror story, but a love story between a mother and child.This was a wonderful love story about a woman who is declared nuts in the 1870's and has her child taken from her. She returns and kidnaps the child from the authorities and is chased by a pitchfork and torch wielding mob over a cliff. Which is where her haunting begins. The townsfolk, in their evil nefariousness decide to box the baby up and stick it on a shelf for 140 or so years, causing the spirit of the mother not to rest until it is reunited with the child. On the way to the reunion, she discovers the love for another child which she has raised for six years. The father of this child is a homicidal maniac, and is killed when he decides to trespass on Mama's property. Castle Law - bitches! I can't blame the ghost for killing this psychopath, I mean, really, he was unhinged. Well, after raising the two girls for half a dozen years, the uncle's hirelings eventually find them and bring them ""home"" where a self-centered shrink decides to use them for his own experiments under the guise of ""helping them."" Of course this user is only interested in his own ends, and really doesn't care much about the girls. He discovers the remains of Mama's baby and doesn't even tell anyone about it. The Rock Band hot chick is forced to be ""mom"" to the two girls by a combination of guilt and shame, as well as association to the uncle. Meanwhile the aunt is trying to get custody, and eventually ""dirt"" on the ""mom"" so she can steal the girls away from the uncle. What a jerk. She decides that criminal trespass is a good idea, and CASTLE LAW! - Bitches! she is killed by Mama. So far the ghost hasn't done anything unlawful or necessarily even bad. Well, skip to the (near) end where she's trying to get the two young girls to walk over a cliff (because, apparently that's her thing, though she really hasn't been shown to have ever done it before, save her own child when escaping the wild townies mob in the 1800's). The ""mom"" brings her real daughters bones back to her and she is almost satisfied, until the youngest daughter cries out for her - she's the only mama she's ever known, after all. Well, this sets the ghost off, and the uncle and ""mom"" are put in peril. But through pure will force, the ""mom"" saves the older daughter while allowing the ghost to take the younger over the cliff with her (repeating history and destroying the ghost spirit). All in all, a great friendly ghost love story. Enjoy!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Could've been better,"I'm happy for those who really loved this film. And it's unfortunate I'm not one of these people, considering I can enjoy movies everyone hates - like House of the Dead (guilty pleasure).What does Mama succeeds is the story. It starts pretty interesting and the lore caught my attention. Surprising thing is the character development, especially in Annabele (hm, I've remembered most of the character's names - a good sign). The villain looks awesome - it's creepy, the CGI isn't something awful, and Mama has an interesting backstory. The actors give nice performances. Creativity is shown in some moments and concepts.Despite the positives Mama has its problems. In the first arc Annabel shares too little dialogue and her acts make her kinda unlikable. What really turns me off is that the scenes in darker enviorments are... well, too dark. I'm not sure if the problem is with my TV but following the chases and most moments with Mama gets hard.

They latest to tackle the subject comes in the form of Mama, produced by Guillermo del Toro and features Jessica Chastain, but is that enough to deliver something new or will it be just be another film that needs to be exorcised?Mama follows a man along with his girlfriend forced to raise his young nieces after the death of his brother that left them alone in the forest for 5 years. Taking on the difficult task becomes more challenging when it becomes clear that they may not have come out of the forest alone. Surprisingly this film delivers pretty well overall despite its standard PG-13 rating. Chastain does a fine job as usual, but the overall vibe of her character almost doesn't really seem to have a point, but at the same time doesn't affect the finished product. For this film to really work falls in the hands of the young girls who have to be likable and creepy all at once and they succeed. This aspect of the story is what helps to step it out of the shadows of every other film in this genre to deliver something a bit more fresh. For the majority of the film it works really well, giving some great build up and development, but loses a bit of steam in the finale. It doesn't ruin the movie or anything it just gets predictable and shows too much of Mama. Throughout the buildup you see here numerous times, but they keep it in the shadows and quick glances and it works perfectly to create a truly creepy character, but once she is fully revealed is a bit silly looking. With that being said, it still works and some of the direction they do go with the finale was a bit unexpected which makes up a bit for the disappointing reveal.This film is one of the better of the genre to come along in some time. While the trailers attempted to lead you to believe it might be scary, this film sports more of a creepy nature than anything scary, but still works fine. The little girls make this film especially the younger of the two who is just disturbing on numerous levels throughout the film. If you enjoy this genre, then Mama is defiantly one you will want to give a try.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
welcome to the cult of mama,"i titled this review as i did because yes MAMA is turning into a tried-and-true cultish hit, judging by what i've seen of its performances here lately. it remains for weekly late night shows only. endlessly bizarre and domestically nightmarish episodes, it has the potential at least of grabbing you early on. another post here claims ""the last 30 minutes shot itself in the head"", well i think the last 30 minutes steamrolls into a chasm of story tangents ridiculing all your narrative perceptions. the plot in a nutshell? ha! i defy anyone to condense or cogently summarize what develops in MAMA, beyond 'your 2 nieces--thought dead 5 yrs ago--have been found growing up wild in the woods, and now for the bad news....'",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Heart felt,"A fantastic story of a compassion and love. Even beyond the grave Mama's heart never stopped beating for those she loved. Through the veil this loving spirit raised two children as a single ghost to live and express themselves creatively in life through song and art. A true coming of age film about growing up and knowing when to let go of the parental guidance we have all experienced at some point. To start making your own decisions in life, to become more independent whist simultaneously remembering the loved ones who have guided you to this point. To become your own person. A must see for all mother's and daughters. Hands down a contender for a modern day cinematic canon. Five starts.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Pretty run-of-the-mill,"Pretty run-of-the-mill, none of it will likely be remembered by me.My main takeaway from 'Mama' is Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who is very good as Lucas & Jeffrey; the others do solid jobs in their roles in fairness.In terms of the plot, nothing really happened - I was waiting for something big to occur but it never came. With that said, the film's ending is fine though it doesn't connect on an emotive level.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Decent, but wasn't that memorable","I found this to be a decent movie that falls into the middle of supernatural movies. The story is a mixed bag with standard supernatural stuff that happened throughout, but it's interesting how two sisters are raised by a spirit and are feral state. There's a couple of plotlines that go on like the girlfriend looking after the sisters while experiencing supernatural, the doctor looking for answers to the sisters' claims, and the aunt wanting to take the sisters away The third part I mentioned goes nowhere interesting and could easily be removed. I do think it's interesting what the doctor finds about the mystery, and the backstory is pretty chilling. The actual story is pretty standard, with Annabel trying to be a guardian to the sisters and her noticing something strange going on. Now, the creepiness factor is a mixed bag with the dreams sequence, having an eerie vibe to it and having some tension, but the movie uses too many cheap jump scares. The characters aren't really that bad, but they aren't that much developed. The spirit herself is an interesting type of character who has a creepy backstory and has strange abilities. There's moths that appear throughout the movie, and I don't know if they symbolize something. I do think Mama has a creepy appearance to her with her design and motive on what she wants. Also, there are pretty good makeup effects on her, and the CGI looks pretty decent in this movie.Mama is a decent supernatural horror movie that isn't the most memorable but is a watchable movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Formulaic but enjoyable ghost story,"Finding their long-abandoned nieces after years in the wild, a man and his girlfriend learn the ghostly guardian the girls invented to watch over them is a real spirit and must try to save themselves from the supernatural threat.This turned out to be quite a nice if somewhat clichéd offering that has some rather decent moments to it. One of the main problems to go on here is the fact that the film makes no sense about what kind of woman the guardian really is. Some of the time, it appears as a regular, plain old ghost haunting the family and attacking them or just playing with the children, but there's other times where the figure is made out to be an otherworldly demon trying to access our world through the spreading-fungus-like holes in the wall that seem to be set-up in order to harvest souls around the house, which comes off nicely in giving us some scares but really has little purpose in explaining the story. As well, the film tends to meander in completely uninteresting scenarios, with the vindictive grandmother trying to get the girls under her custody and not trusting the couple to do so merely for her own good or the sentimentality of slowly winning over the younger, more feral sister with motherhood tactics she'd never prepared for before, which is a plausible intuition from the storyline but really comes off as tired and cliché from the continued usage of the tactic in other movies. Beyond that, the kid-friendly rating is a detriment in keeping all the potential deaths and violence almost always off-camera or shrouded in darkness to really keep us from seeing anything interesting, and the constant materializing of the ghost beyond the unknowing character for a scare gets old the third time it happens. However, there's some good things here, including the rather ominous way it builds up in intensity towards the ghost actually attacking with the games with the children, mistaking it for the girls or simply using the fungus-like holes in the walls to spread the fear, and with it being such a creepy-looking creature in it's own right generates some very chilling sequences in the later half when it's finally on the warpath after the family. These here really save it from the rather pedestrian and lackluster offering it could've been.Rated PG-13: Mild Violence, Language and children-in-jeopardy.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Mama will have you calling for your Mama.,"I went to watch this film in a theater and had very high expectations, due to the director and producer. I was not disappointed. The storyline was intriguing, but I expected more. Perhaps the DC on Blu-ray will have more substance. I look forward to it. I found the antagonist (mama) pitiable. Obviously she was mentally challenged, but loved her child - and any child- long after her demise. As a ghost, she managed to spare an innocent child's life, and helped raise 2 girls who were left alone in the wilderness. She was a good mama, but as movie-goers will see, she's also a very jealous one. After the 2 girls are rescued, they go to live with their biological uncle and his free-spirited girlfriend. They are given a large house and must make the best of things as a family. Soon the couple learns that the girls did not come back alone.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Fun creepy scares (and some surprising depth),"Just finished reviewing another film that was disappointing, and it made me want to write a review for this one.This was truly an excellent scary movie. The direction and filming created for some really great scares. I'm pretty jaded when it comes to scary shows. After you have seen enough of them you know most of the directors tricks, and you can see them coming. But for this movie, I was on the edge of my seat with tingles running up and down my back.But what made this really great was the character development. A lot of these shows don't have any, but even some of the less important characters had development and motivation. Which is really key, you have to believe that this character will do this thing, not because it moves the plot along, but because of something in that individuals make up.And the best part was, even the monster has this depth.I only wish I could have seen this in the theater. It would definitely been worth the ticket price.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Too Much CGI,"Two children are found abandoned in a creepy shack to the point where they're basically feral. They're adopted by their uncle and their aunt is forced out of her rock 'n roll lifestyle to take care of children she never wanted. Her parenting skills are tested when a vengeful spirit shows up, having followed the two girls, and wants to get rid of anyone else who wants to care for them.Mama has a lot of interesting ideas and it's best when it's being more subtle and quiet. It makes the deadly mistake of showing too much of the CGI monster too soon, giving the film nowhere to build to and robbing it of any suspense. Even worse, it's incapable of taking big risks to up the stakes for its characters and the whole movie feels bland and polite. The most annoying moment like this comes when a lead character is scared so much that they fall down the stairs, landing in a way that should have killed them, but they're kept alive in order to run from the hospital later in the film and join everyone for the big finale. A smarter, scarier film would have killed this character off and used it to raise the stakes for the other characters.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Superb Psychological Horror,"Mama is the story about two girls who have inadvertently been left alone in the woods to fend for themselves. Five years on, they are miraculously found alive and are rescued by a search party organised by their uncle. Unfortunately, as time goes on, it is evident that someone - or something - had been looking after the two children and that that something has been brought back with them.This movie was excellent and it was just as good as I was hoping for. It started off really well, and kept a nice steady pace going throughout all the way through to the somewhat sad ending. It most definitely picks up in the last 40 minutes as well. I'll be honest and say that at one point, about halfway through, I thought it wasn't going to pickup or get much better than what it had up to then. Boy, was I wrong! Mama is a very creepy movie (yet at the same time quite sad as well) and the way the character of Mama was done was impressive. The movement for that character is reminiscent in parts to that of the ""ghosts"" in Ju-on and Ringu which just adds to the creep factor for me. Also, the way the CGI was mixed with live actors for Mama was done really well, which makes me wonder what movie was being watched by people who complained about it being ""rubbish"". For a movie that had an estimated budget of only $15m it was anything but ""rubbish"".The performances were good all round, but the best by an absolute country mile were the two girls, Megan Charpentier (who played Victoria) and Isabelle Nélisse (who played Lilly). They both brought a real believability to their characters with convincing performances showing two girls who, for five years, had to fend for themselves and then have to try and adjust to living in modern society.Like I said earlier, this is an excellent film and I think it's the best horror/chiller I've seen since Sinister. If you love psychological horrors then I highly recommended Mama.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

"An Straightforward Timid, Horror Story!","This movie is scared in itself to scare people. It is scared to prove people wrong. The ghost is timid and a dumb spirit who doesn't understand the ethics of whatever world she's in because if the film- makers say that ""mother's love is forever,"" she wouldn't just do what she did at the end.I don't know how the ghost became a ghost in the first place, nor does the Pan's Labyrinth makers try to tell us.I admit, it has its share of scary scenes, but what it does is - move you to an extent warning us of a scary scene and when the scene actually is executed, it doesn't make us scream. CGI does that to some level. After watching Mama and not mentioning Chastain's name will be a sin. She is emo-sexy in it, truly phenomenal from her ZD30 role and a great performer. The girls are cute and induce some thrills.But to be frank, I just didn't enjoy watching Mama not just because it is tad lame, but also because the story is partially incomplete. The climax and some serious unanswered questions made me ridicule and write this review.BOTTOM LINE: Watch if for Chastain.

Every aspect of this movie is well-done besides one key ingredient!,"This movie had the potential to be a great ghost movie. The set-ups were well-done, the acting was very well-done (especially the little girls), the cinematography was impressive, and the directing was impressive. But then you see the ghost and you see computer animation! Which is fine if done in a way that makes it feel real, but while watching this movie you are fully aware that this is a computer animated image, which takes away from the creepiness of a movie. Computer animated monsters don't scare people. If a villain looks human enough to not make the viewer aware of special effects, that is what makes people's minds escape into the movie and truly be scared. There have been many movies over the last few years that would have been great horror films had they spent more time making the villain look real.

True, some details are vague, but I believe deliberately so. Also, some parts were explained very subtly if you pay attention.

But it was a well done ghost/monster story that won't make you fall asleep, trust me. In fact I was unhappy because it felt a little short to me. The mama thing is very gritty looking and whenever she would appear everybody in the theater would start freaking out. How much screaming there was made it similar to the paranormal activity commercials. Lots of suspense moments especially when Jessica Chastain's character would walk towards the closet.

"An Original Story With a Contrived Plot, Awkward Horror Elements and Too Much Mama","This is a film with an identity crisis. It tries to be a horror film complete with jump scares and the usual horror elements, but Mama doesn't generate any chills or thrills. The titular character isn't frightening at all and we see way too much of her. The film should have alluded to her presence more, rather than showing her in all of her CGI glory. The middle hour of this film is incredibly contrived and convoluted and filled with cheap jump scares that overexpose the films villain. Mama also throws in a bit of dark fantasy and actually succeeds more with these moments. The last 10 minutes are beautiful and I wanted the rest of the film to match the finales visual and tonal poetry. I also think the film would have worked better in a period setting, which I felt similarly about in another Guillermo Del Toro production, ""Don't Be Afraid of the Dark"". So, if they tightened up the script, used a more subtle approach to it's monster and embraced it's dark fantasy potential Mama could have been great.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

And all Game of Thrones fans will be glad to see Jaime Lanister... i mean Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, playing two characters.The atmosphere is dark and the scene that should frighten you will be really frightening. Otherwise we're encountering the the typical story about a curse that has to be broken. Meanwhile, our heroes will be harassed by a ghoul.I'm no big fan of horror (anymore), so i'd just say that Mama plays in the same league as, say, the Scream franchise or the Ring (both Japanese and US versions).

Mama - More Horrific Than Horror,"Read full review here: http://www.thewildbore.com/2013/02/review-mama/Del Toro seems to be doing this a lot lately. He seems obsessed with sticking his name to horror films with kids as the central focus. It's a strange hobby for him to take up seeing as his film Pan's Labyrinth eclipses all of them, but yet he clearly sees the passion in these directors and puts his own name, credibility and money behind them. It's an honourable thing to do by allowing the next generation to get a crowbar into an industry that only takes on it's own. However, it can be argued as a strange exploitation. After all, can you name the director of Mama? It's Andres Muschietti but you won't see his name splattered all over the adverts. It brings to mind the whole Poltergeist thing in 1982 when Spielberg's name was all over the film and poor old Tobe Hooper kicked up a fuss about it (and rightly so). Though Spielberg had taken over the set apparently. Bloody Spielberg. But this is besides the pointMuschietti had made a wonderful short of the same name in 2008 and Del Toro loved it so much that he gave him the opportunity to turn it into a full feature. It's a shame because it should have stayed a short and definitely had more of an impact in 3 minutes than it did in 90.That isn't to say it's a bad film. In fact, it starts with much promise. Two young girls have had a rather strange upbringing and their special protector is Mama, someone we see in the shadows but that becomes more prominent as the film continues. Jessica Chastain plays a rock chick having to turn mother with a very patient and supremely talented Nikolaj Coaster- Waldau as the uncle with a heart. The pairing of these two is a great heavyweight combo of new talent but unfortunately it's wasted here. The same goes with the little girls who actually do a very good job and show a lot of promise.The problem lies with the fact that this film is just a sequence of set-pieces, none of which are really scary but more 'jumpy' and at times laughable. Mama herself is given a backstory (do I care?), characters seem to do the craziest things (why does everyone keep going to the cabin at night? or wandering around lost?), Mama isn't really scary (is she giving people a hicky?) and so CG it hurts (if I see it, it isn't scary). There are a couple of good bits but it's not shocking and definitely won't make you scared of bumps in the night. The dialogue is clunky and the pace quite slow with an idea clearly trying to be fleshed out into a story that just doesn't work.Even if you take into account the metaphor of Mama being Chastain's embodiment of her fear of motherhood, the ending just doesn't make sense. In fact, it might be one of the worst endings I've seen in a horror for a while. It's supposed to be a beautiful, elegant ending but instead is irritable and stupid to say the least. The fact that it's so jumpy also means that it takes the value out of watching it again, which I might do on a Friday night with nothing to do, but wouldn't go out of my way for.I have to say it's better than Don't Be Afraid Of The Dark, which isn't hard to do but not nearly as good as The Orphanage. I was very excited about seeing this and I should have known better, horror is just getting worse and worse and not in a good way.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

Conventional ghost story with some stylistic flourishes,"A young man (Nicholas Coaster-Waldau), distraught at the 2008 economic collapse, guns down his ex-wife and kidnaps his two young daughters, dragging them to a deserted cabin in the woods, planning to kill them and himself in a horrendous murder/suicide.

Flash-forward five years when the girls are finally discovered by the killer's twin brother and brought back to civilization, having been ""raised"" by whoever or whatever it is that resides in the place. Needless to say, the girls are a mess psychologically, but that's only half the problem that the uncle and his girlfriend (Jessica Chastain) face in trying to re-acclimate the children to life in the real world.""Mama"" is a horror movie with a lot of elaborate bells-and-whistles but not a great deal of originality or insight. For beneath all the fancy genre trappings - the creaking boards, the creepy voices on the soundtrack, the half-glimpsed figures in the background, the high-tech CGI effects - it's still just the same old hooey about the spirit who simply can't rest until some personal injustice from the past has been rectified and who believes that scaring the bejeezus out of the living will somehow bring that outcome about.Yet, despite a really dopey finale, the scare tactics work reasonably well for most of the duration, and the movie succeeds in developing and sustaining a creepy atmosphere thanks to the direction of Andy Muschietti and the cinematography of Antonio Riestra.

Are you kidding?,"Who thought, of all the talent involved, this was a good script? Tragic? No. Stupid. Atmospheric , yes. But , so what?? No spoiler alert, but that's probably one of the worst scripts for a horror movie I've ever watched. Seriously.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Inconstant, it starts well, but it gets worse and becomes tiring and boring. The ending is bad.","Guillermo del Toro has already used us to visually striking and intense films, so I was little surprised to find his name attached to this film. I even thought that he would be the director, but the direction was in charge of Andy Muschietti, and Del Toro is just an executive producer, in a gesture that seems just a publicity stunt. In any case, the film is not bad, and it even manages to create some tension and suspense... but it is still far from being a truly good horror film, mainly because of its inconstancy.When I say inconstancy, what I mean is that the film changes radically in the middle, for the worse: the script starts with a good initial premise, which is the death of the parents of the two children, who end up alone in a cabin in the woods. Five years later, however, they are found again in a mental and psychological state that borders on the wild. However, and in the midst of the legal battle for their custody, it becomes evident to those who care for them that the two children have conversations with an invisible entity, which they call Mama. Intense and disturbing, the film creates an impactful situation, with characters that we can like and that hold us to the film. The supernatural situation is intriguing, and the creature created for the film is intimidating and truly terrifying. At various times, I noticed similarities with cinematographic works like ""The Exorcist"" and ""The Orphanage"". So far, all great.The problem is that, roughly halfway through, the film loses its momentum, so to speak. It's as if the director had changed, or the film's idea had been different, or they were different films. Everything becomes gradually more predictable, boring, uninteresting and tiring, and the scares and suspense gradually decrease. The creature, which before only appeared furtively and for a moment, is now fully visible, and that takes a lot of impact. The level of melodrama and sugar in the story also increases substantially. The end of the film is as unsatisfying as a sexual act interrupted midway because someone showed up at the wrong time. And I'd rather not talk about the various glitches of logic that start to appear, big as mansions, when we start to seriously think about all this!The cast does what it can, and there are some efforts here that deserve to be highlighted. At the head we have two excellent child actresses, Megan Charpentier and Isabelle Nelisse, who do everything impeccably and authentically surrender to their characters. More than any adult, they are the ones who deserve to be highlighted in this film, for the way they lived it all and contributed to the final product. Right after that, we have Jessica Chastain, who gives us yet another good, albeit imperfect, performance. I got the serious feeling that the actress wore a wig. If that wasn't the case, at least it looked like it. And she never seemed to fit that character well either. Javier Botet also deserves praise for the commitment and patience with which he put up with hours of make-up. The rest of the cast isn't so happy: Daniel Kash should have had more relevance in the plot, but we get the feeling that the character is dropped as quickly as possible, and Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau wasn't used happily either, despite the talent and abilities of the actor.Technically, the film has several points of merit that are worth watching carefully. This is the case with cinematography. The entire film was shot excellently, with careful and meticulous work from the cameras. The sharpness, the shadows, the lighting work and the dark and sometimes washed-out colors accentuate, in certain scenes, the atmosphere of tension and abandonment that can be felt by the audience. The visual effects work quite well, especially everything about the creature, which only loses interest when we can see it well. A good choice of sets and costumes also helped, and the CGI is elegant and satisfying until you reach the middle of the film, where it clearly loses quality and impact.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Don't waste your time (and especially money) like I did,"What can I say that others haven't already said? Cliché scares.(Literally going as old school as the lights in the bathroom turning off, then they come back on and something is in the mirror) No logical answers at all to the ending. No build up or on-edge seat suspense at ALL in this movie, besides the cheap scares, to the point where the only reason it scared you was because you were expecting it. Characters are so hollow, they really didn't put much effort into making anyone in the movie memorable. Not even the Uncle, he was just the guy who found stuff out at the last minute. Oh yeah, that happens too. And no, it isn't done well. People not turning lights on in a house in the middle of woods late at night. People going in alone to a abandoned cabin late at night, just classic stupid stuff we hate. No depth or real answers for the beginning of the movie, usually they at least explain in detail why something tragic happens in the start of a movie. Generic plot, really, they rushed the ending and just didn't do enough for this movies story or characters. Just don't do it. I wanted to take my chances with this movie since it had 6 stars, looked like a hit or miss, but no, it's a miss, Ill give a 3/10 for effort but it's really disappointing. Most of the people rating this must be the ones who went to see Paranormal Activity 3.I don't care who made it or who was behind this movie, this is not good.

An amazingly fresh idea,"Initially I was not too enamored with the plot line but interested enough to give the movie a shot. So many horror movies have promised much and delivered little to the point that I have given up on watching a movie that entertains and surprises me. Whilst Evil Dead served up bloody gore with a reasonable storyline and some really good acting, Mama has finally delivered what all other movies have promised. I'm not one for writing spoilers so rest assured that this review won't have any.Mama delivers some good shocks, moments where you'll be telling the actors 'not to go in there' plus a very unique and interesting twist that I have not witnessed in any other movie. It is this twist that makes the movie stand out from its peers and has encouraged me to endorse this movie for others to watch and to make their own decision.This movie takes the ghost movie genre to a different level that once repeated will immediately lose it's appeal, and as such has made it's mark on me.I hope that you enjoy this feature for the originality it offers.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"By ""serviceable"" I mean mediocre","Mama is like a walk down memory lane, but when I say ""walk,"" I employ the word more like a trudge and by ""memory lane"" I mean the lane of rehashed ideas. Certainly a gifted performance by Jessica Chastain, one of the strongest female character actors working today, and some delightful atmospheric shots buoy it to a more watchable level, but this is a basic tutorial suspense filmmaking in 2013. And by ""basic tutorial"" I mean Cliff Notes.I suppose for the least-demanding, Mama works as a completely serviceable diversion from life's tribulations. We begin by seeing a distraught man named Jeffrey, who, in the wake of losing nearly everything in the bitter financial crisis of 2007, kills his business partners, kills his wife, and then takes his two small children (a three year old and a one year old) out to a remote cabin to kill them too.They survive a crash after Jeffrey drives recklessly on a road covered with snow, and proceed to take shelter in a rundown cabin. Just as Jeffrey is about to pull the gun on the children when a demonic figure attacks him and kills him almost instantly. Five years later, they are found by Lucas (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau), Jeffrey's brother and his wife Annabel (Jessica Chastain), his wife. Both children are severely ill, savage, and appear to be haunted by a figure they call ""mama."" Annabel agrees to take them in and try to give them a safe, viable haven, but as we all know, these children are seriously not right and they rightfully belong in a private institution. But don't worry; she's got this.It's no wonder why Mama is January-fare; it is practically a poster-child for why the horror genre is such a disappointing venture today. Everything is inclusive here from creepy children, to eerily offputting home, to brave woman at the center, to foreseeable jump scares that have continued to not pose much of an effect on me. There comes a time when techniques tread from seriousness to self-parody and all of those techniques have well walked past the boundaries of self-parody and are almost entering the territory of being laughable.Chastain is a terrific woman, who has already made herself marketable, being featured in projects from The Help to Zero Dark Thirty. Here, she is simply left with not much to do, and all we get is a blank character with an attractive Goth look and a big enough heart to allow two unhealthy children in her home. The other characters we get are pretty archetypal; either victims or redundant creepy caricatures. The two little girls, while seemingly decent young talents, scared me about as much as your average Scooby-Doo episode.Mama benefits from Andy Muschietti's smooth, conservative camera-work that takes something of a less-is-more approach to the material, before quickly abandoning it in the later acts and some interesting musical choices to alleviate the environment and surroundings. Yet it includes many clichés that simply can not go overlooked, even when the aesthetic material is above average. And by ""includes"" I mean ""is plagued by.""Starring: Jessica Chastain, Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, Megan Charpentier, Isabelle Nélisse, and Daniel Kash.

"Sorry, this horror flick is for kids","Mama is an unfortunate misfire, a film that's too contrived to be called effective and truly scary. The grim fairy tale aspect of the film just didn't work for me at all and the story though intriguing, sad and startling in the beginning, became scattered and not focused on which direction to take. The CGI ghost was horrible and unintentionally laughable, I rolled my eyes every time it came popping on screen, in a horror movie that is not a good sign. The scares were nothing new and way too predictable and the characters were underdeveloped that there was not much connection to care. Mama could have been one of 2013's scariest horror films, but its solid potential melted away as fast as The Wicked Witch Of The West from The Wizard of Oz.The performances are the best part of this teetering film, even if the script fails them. Jessica Chastain who plays Annabel, is probably the hardest working actress of today, she gives her all to her roles even if it's as thin as this. She always brings a sense of empowerment mixed with vulnerability to her roles that is always compelling to watch. The real stars of this picture are the child actors Megan Charpentier and Isabelle Nelisse who play Victoria and Lilly, orphaned girls that were found living in an abandoned cottage in the woods for years after their dad goes missing and mother dead. Their performance in the movie had so many layers that add some depth to their roles and were engaging, spooky and heartbreaking. I see them as future stars in this business.Director, Andrés Muschietti who also created the short film Mama that started it all, definitely knows what a horror movie should look like and crafted a haunting atmosphere filled with grotesque images and nightmarish shadows and lighting. The director just doesn't quite know what a scary film should act like, he seems to have a lot of solid ideas and an semi original premise, but somehow got lost from the journey to paper to film. Andres Muschietti has so much potential as a horror movie director; he just needs to create a better script and a more balanced story. Mama just fell short of becoming truly great.Overall, Mama just wasn't terrifying as one might think. It had fine performances, a startling and fresh premise, some creepy moments, but the CGI ghost was asinine, the scares dull and ineffective and has an unconvincing ending.

A slappable ghost,"I found this movie dull most of the time with cliche ridden instances and uninspired script or dialogue. Jessica Chastain's character does not elevate this film an iota maybe because she is not believable as a rock star either
All the decade old angles and well trodden formulas of horror is put in this dull mix, whit the ghost appearing behind the actor's back all the time, ready to strike or a funny episode soon after a tense moment etc. Infact this film must be aimed towards horror dumbos, children or a matinee for the family
I did not mind the ending although the director/screenwriters did go over the top to make this trudging piece somewhat memorable

I liked it a lot.,"MAMAThis was a good movie. I really enjoyed this one.This is a horror movie about a guy who kills his wife and takes his 2 kids away... but when his car crashes, he gets lost in the woods until he finds a cabin. He takes his children inside, but there is spirit in there protecting the children. The spirit then follows the children into the city when they go and live with their uncle.It is not very scary... there were a couple of attempts of jump scares, but not too many... and none of them made me jump anyway.The story was very good and there were quite a few emotions throughout the film. At some points of the film I felt so sorry for the children, but then something would happen and the next minute I would think the kids are evil. All the way through you don't really know whether the kids are good or not.There was one scene in the film that was really horrible. There was a woman who had a dream and this dream was horrible. There is a baby in the dream and I felt so bad for this baby. It looked so scared.The effects were not brilliant at times, but that didn't ruin the movie. The story and the acting carried it through well.The actors were all really good... especially the children. Normally I find child actors very annoying and too young to have much talent. But not in this case. Both kids did a great job. The stars are Jessica Chastain, Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, Megan Charpentier & Isabelle Nelisse.I will give this film 8 out of 10.I really liked it.

The two girls are the real stars,"This was a very decent horror movie, with a few good jump out of your seat scares. The two little girls are of course what the plot centers around, and they act their parts very well for their young ages. The youngest girl in particular deserves extra credit for her efforts. The scenes of them crawling around like monkeys are very well done, especially the scene when they are discovered for the first time after being missing for so long. The CG effects and Mama character are first class and very convincing. Mama herself is scary enough, at first. Unfortunately she appears too often throughout the movie and this waters down the suspense and her scare factor, a clear case of the bad guy being over utilized. This type of movie is in ""The Ring"" category, but doesn't have the sense of dread that we often feel with these kind of movies. The ending was a bit sad and that was the only real thing that kept me leaving the cinema fully satisfied.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
"this movie ruined the sweet word ""mama"" for me. Creepy.","Mama may not be the perfect horror flick, but it sure has all the right elements of a good movie. The horror is palpable, the story is well- crafted, the cinematography is perfect for the setting, the music/ambient sounds are chilling, and while I can't say that the whole cast gave a solid performance I think it's safe to say that the two girls are the stars in this movie. I love that the terror is almost tangible perfectly backed up by the dark yet stunning visuals reminiscent of Del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth. Not a disappointing first film for Andy Muschietti, because even though the elements in this movie are not original, he has managed to put in his own flavor, twist an already familiar bits & pieces from popular horror movies and turn it into something effectively chilling without making us feel cheated.

Funny,"Welcome to the Hollywood big cliché (although with crappy CGI more often than not). Here you shall not find creativity, horror or imaginative writing. The acting is alright, pity that it doesn't save you from the lame story. The ending tries to be some sort of bitter sweet sentimental nonsense and, allow me to repeat myself, the CGI is laughable, most of the times. Hell, even the prosthetics are bad. I found myself laughing and smirking when the movie show us the girls running around in their fours at the beginning, when we discover the (supposedly) scary entity or with the priceless scene of the crawling wig. Honestly, is this a Disney production? I watched one of those parody movies before this (can't remember if it was Scary Movie 5 or what) and they are both competing for the title of most stupid comedy. The spoof could have taken scenes from the original directly and you wouldn't notice the difference.A very annoying issue is that, lacking any real scary moments, the movie tries to do the cheap trick many other bad ""horror"" movies insist on pulling: use a sudden change in the volume of the soundtrack - due to the very low volume of the conversations, a sudden extremely loud noise will surely make your ears bleed; at least some reaction from the viewers, since the silly attempts to scare the audience like this will fail miserably. Unless you are in kindergarten, perhaps.Alas, completely forgettable movie.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
A horror movie worth watching,"I have no clue why IMDb has this at a 6.3 rating; or why IMDb has the new Evil Dead at 6.something rating. You shouldn't watch movies like these, if you don't like horror. This is a good horror movie (so was Evil Dead). Horror fans will like this.The basic aspect of the story is kind of cool, but the twists are really amazing. I actually would have enjoyed having the doctor guy's secretive involvement panned out more.We all know that it is the story of a ghost raising two children who were lost and abandoned in the woods; then they are found and rescued, and the ghost mother follows them and kills, hurts, or haunts, the people around the children. But the way that the human characters learn about the what the being is, and how they confront it in a way, and interact with it, is really good.It wasn't the best movie of all time, but it was definitely worth watching. One of the better horror films to come out in the last few years. I would give this a 9, because it really was that good, but there were a few cheap scares in this movie - you know everything is quiet and then SCREECH as something comes into the camera frame. I really dislike that when its done for that reason alone, rather than having it represent how the characters realistically would feel and interact (like when the boyfriend wakes up in the dorm room, in that movie Exorcism of Emily Rose :)",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Trailer was much better than the movie,"This is not a good movie. How can an experienced, talented director show the villain/ghost/bad guy/girl so early in a movie? At that point, almost all suspense is lost. If we didn't know if the 2 girls were imagining things, or if maybe some other character was doubling as Mama. . . . if the plot had some uncertainty then the movie would have been far better. Instead, it is rather full of clichés, often makes no sense and is on the whole a big disappointment. The trailer was genuinely more frightening than the movie. You know a movie isn't good when you start looking for and counting the number of things that don't make sense (visiting dark cabins after 10pm rather than at 10am, etc), and I did that a lot. The only interesting thing is Jessica Chastain's face, which is oddly complex and bony.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Well done creepy thriller with some heart,"Many reviews already written, so I'll keep this simple. I enjoyed this horror/thriller movie from start to finish. The atmospheric shifts from the real world, to the 'dark' were well crafted and definitely felt visceral. Lighting was used to the same effect. The acting was believable throughout, and character growth, especially with Jessica and the children flowed naturally. Excellent supporting cast as well. Creepy 'mama' entity, sometimes flat out disturbing to look at as she moved & writhed about. Often scares would come quietly and out of no where. Rarely have had a horror movie that could move you to at least a tear at the end, but this one will do it. No need for idiotic excessive profanity, gore or useless nudity in this picture. It's crafted to stand on it's merits as a horror thriller with heart, and succeeds at that quite well. Lastly the story itself was well executed & kept you waiting for the next piece of information. Certainly not perfect, but far above so much that's been released. If you like this genre, pick this up, sit back, & be prepared for a ride.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Yo mama so ugly...,"Another dark fairy-tale horror from the Guillermo Del Toro stable, Mama is an initially touching tale of despair and abandonment that unfortunately develops into a frustratingly mediocre ghost story severely hampered by the usual culprits—bad CGI effects, digital colour tinting, and worst of all, incredibly cheap scares.As a director, Andrés Muschietti clearly has a keen understanding of his medium, delivering some striking imagery, effectively conjuring up a creepy atmosphere, and commanding superb performances from child stars Megan Charpentier and Isabelle Nélisse, but his writing isn't as strong, his derivative script failing to bring much in the way of originality to the tired genre.

Janie's Got A Gun,"MAMA (dir. Andres Muschietti) This movie is an unparalleled, super- terrific 'thrill ride' of a ghost film. It's executive producer is horror master Guillermo del Toro, and the film provides a maximum of mind blowing excitement and terrifying images that are solidly backed by an unforgettable storyline.After a mysterious shooting, two very young sisters are abandoned in a creepy cabin deep in the forest and raised by a ghost who they refer to as 'mama'. For nearly five years their uncle and his rock-chick girlfriend have been unsuccessfully trying to locate them. Finally the girls are rescued, and brought back to suburbia to reclaim their shot at a comfortable middle-class life. But these two siblings are very rough around the psychic edges, and unearthly mischief and mayhem sticks to them like paranormal ectoplasm.The film's superior production team employs unbelievable dream sequences and computer generated special effects to propel the story that were widely popularized by Japanese and Korean filmmakers such as Kiyoshi Kurosawa, Takashi Miike, Bong Joon-ho, and Kim Ji-woon during the 90's.

The pair are brought to be examined by a psychiatrist, and eventually a judge rules they can be ordered to the care of Lucas and his girlfriend Annabel (Jessica Chastain). Once the children are moved in, it becomes noticeable that they have brought something sinister with them from that cabin in the woods.Sometimes when you read the premise of a horror movie on paper, they sound pretty ridiculous. So as I write these next few sentences on the plot of Mama, I can understand how over the top the movie sounds. Without giving too much away, the spirit is actually what has taken care of the girls for the last five years while they were missing. She is now a maternal figure of sorts and jealous of anyone else who has come into their lives. Reading that, I know it all sounds outrageous, and it is. But it actually works in the context of the movie. What doesn't work is the ho hum pace set by half hearted scares that we have seen before in movies just as bland as this one. These are what would make Mama an around average horror flick. What makes it a bad watch is the moronic ending to close all the averageness.

and the ghost is not even looking good get inspirations from sundar.c director. Mama"" Review: A Fearsome DisappointmentWhen Guillermo del Toro's name is attached to a film, expectations naturally rise, especially when the project is helmed by a relatively new director, Andrés Muschietti, who made his directorial debut with ""Mama."" The film, however, is a prime example of how even the most talented individuals can falter when it comes to translating their vision into a compelling final product. Instead of the chilling experience one might anticipate from a del Toro-influenced horror film, ""Mama"" is a jarring, uninspired mess that fails to deliver on almost every level.The premise of ""Mama"" starts with a promisingly eerie setup. It revolves around two young sisters who are found in the woods after being missing for five years, only to be haunted by a supernatural entity they refer to as ""Mama."" The story has the potential for a spine-tingling exploration of grief and the supernatural. Unfortunately, the film squanders this potential with a plot that is both predictable and laughable.One of the most glaring issues with ""Mama"" is its excruciatingly bland script. The dialogue is stilted and unnatural, stripping the characters of any semblance of depth or relatability. The attempts at emotional resonance fall flat, leaving viewers more perplexed than moved. The characters, including the supposedly sympathetic father and the increasingly erratic aunt, are mere caricatures who seem to exist solely to propel the plot rather than to engage the audience on an emotional level. This lack of depth makes it impossible to care about their fates, which is a fatal flaw in a horror film.The film's pacing is equally problematic. ""Mama"" stumbles through a series of clichéd horror tropes and jump scares that quickly become tiresome. Rather than building tension, the film seems to rush through its scares with a clumsy eagerness. The result is a series of underwhelming moments that fail to generate genuine suspense. The attempts at atmospheric horror are undermined by poorly executed CGI and overused sound effects that only serve to distract rather than terrify.Adding to the disappointment is the portrayal of ""Mama"" herself. The creature, which is intended to be a fearsome and tragic figure, ends up being more laughable than frightening. The CGI rendering of ""Mama"" lacks the necessary subtlety to be genuinely disturbing, and the character's appearance quickly becomes a source of unintentional comedy. Rather than instilling dread, ""Mama"" often elicits chuckles, which is a significant misstep for a horror film that relies heavily on its antagonist for scares.Moreover, the film's resolution is a letdown, offering a finale that is both predictable and unsatisfying. The final act attempts to inject a sense of closure, but instead, it leaves viewers with more questions than answers. The attempt to tie up loose ends feels rushed and half-baked, resulting in a conclusion that is both confusing and unfulfilling.The performances in ""Mama"" do little to elevate the material. The actors, despite their best efforts, are hampered by the film's lackluster script and direction. Jessica Chastain, known for her strong performances in other roles, is particularly underwhelming as the film's central figure. Her portrayal is stifled by the lack of substance in her character, rendering her performance forgettable.Overall, ""Mama"" is a textbook example of a horror film that misses the mark. What should have been a haunting tale of supernatural terror ends up being a shallow, predictable, and uninspired experience. The film fails to leverage its intriguing premise into a coherent and engaging narrative, resulting in a final product that is more frustrating than frightening. For those seeking a genuinely unsettling horror experience, ""Mama"" is a disheartening reminder that not all promises of terror are fulfilled.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

The CGI that was used throughout the movie, really brought the film to light, but the beginning was left for the audience to piece together because it was a bit unexplained. The other weird thing about the film is that people just go missing and no one ever goes to look for them. Apart from that, it's a great movie for its genre. Watchable!Round-Up: If your a fan of some of Guillermo del Toro's work, which includes the Hellboy franchise, Blade 2 and Pan's Labyrinth, then you well be used to the whole look and feel of this movie. The epic ending was great and some of the scenes were a bit scary, but nothing major. I also liked the moral of the story of a mothers love for her daughters, which is what the movie is basically about. It did seem to be in and out of the limelight pretty quickly because there are quite a few movies out in this genre so it might be quickly forgotten.Budget: $15million Worldwide Gross: $146.5million (What a profit!)I recommend this movie to people who are into there horror/thriller movies about a broken family. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Finally, a modern horror flick worth watching!","I have to say, this was a surprisingly intriguing and well-made horror movie!The story is a little different, and I think that's the reason why I really got into this movie. On top of that, I loved the design of ""Mama"". It reminded me of some kind of Silent Hill creature, blended with The Grudge and a witch, if that makes any sense.The acting was great! The child actors did a very good job, especially the older one. It had some really touching scenes and I even got some watery eyes near the end. Almost crying, from a horror movie? Now that's rare.But has the movie flaws? Yes, unfortunately it does. I would say the movie has seven characters. That's not that much, but the movie choose to focus on our main protagonist and the two children, which it definitely should! The problem is that the other characters don't get much screen time, and therefore they become less interesting, which means you don't care for them as much. I wanted to root for everybody with this kind of character development dammit! Oh well.It also has some very predictable jump scares, and that bothered me because this movie would have been just as creepy without the jump scares! On a positive note, there were no cheap boo-right-in-your-face scares. Most of them had some sort of cleverness.Overall, this movie did really satisfy me, both in story and thrill. It's not for every horror fan though.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Lilly go,"Two little sisters are rescued from their feral existence by their uncle and his girlfriend, but arrive hand-in-hand with a force from beyond.Conventional horror that draws on various sources, but is ultimately a creature of the sentimental fantasy of the producer, del Toro, along with his signature special effects. If indulgence of the latter isn't to your taste, then I'm afraid the movie is quite a failure.The establishing scenario is overwrought, the ghost's form is revealed far too early, the ghost itself is all CGI and guttural noises, the jump scares are crude and the dream sequences unsubtle, there are several characters whose role is purely to nail plot points or exposition (in fact the hero plays no real part in the plot), groans of disbelief are heard when characters thoughtlessly enter the woods as night is falling, and much of the sensibility is derivative of earlier J-horror: The Ring for its unquiet grave, The Grudge for jerky-limbed apparitions.The performances are good, particularly from the youngest child, who pulls off a convincing scene where the heroine subdues her. That scene provides the character arc for the heroine, who initially for all her grunge vibe might as well be a straight-laced spinster lacking in all affection and joy. And yet, a conservative instinct comes through in the disapproval of the heroine's lifestyle, which just reminded me that Pan's Labyrinth too is about people knowing their place despite its reaction against authority. Apart from that, the pace keeps us chopping along, while the score is passable.The stated theme is really ambitious. One throwaway character describes ghosts as emotions bent out of shape, needing to be righted, which opens wide the door for a psychoanalytic journey to the origins of horror. And the psychiatrist ventures forth with the notion that science can only advance by exploring new realities. Plenty to chew on there, but this screenplay is nowhere near sophisticated enough to pose the necessary dilemmas.Overall: Sentimental tragedy dressed up as horror.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Disappointed!!!,"I was really disappointed with this film and its lack of scares. The quality of the film was good and its definitely worth watching but its not something I would put in the horror genre. The story and the concept of the film was good but it was missing the element of horror which defines a horror film. The acting was actually pretty good and the few ""horror"" scenes where well placed. Overall I give this movie a 5 out of 10.

Good Acting and Good Atmosphere But.......,"This movie ticked all the boxes for most things.....
Backgound story , characters , atmosphere , and actors , but ..... I have to say that the Mama aparition was a bit unconvincing for me.She was shown way too much throughout the movie and I think that , sometimes, what you can't see is far more effective.Also a lot of stuff is not explained, I really did'nt get Mamas whole reason for terrorising everyone, and the Aunt's role in it seemed pointless, also .I think it had great potential , but was , for me , a bit all over the place and disjointed .Good watch , but missing that something .",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

Interesting but spoiled effort,"Mama presents an enticing story and has several scary moments. However, it also has an unlikely plot with some overused (yet underdeveloped) clichés and too many characters, resulting in serious plot holes. Besides, the conclusion really sucks.The first two-thirds are by far the best. Like so many horror movies, Mama is better at building suspense than at solving it in a coherent whole. The monster is originally made in comparison with most ghost flicks and scary enough but only as long as it is hinted at -- as soon as it is fully displayed it looks weird and almost funny.Recommended only for those having no problem in belief suspension, or for women interested in the dramatic line underlying the main plot.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Grown up Mama,"It's interesting seeing where a short movie led to. This is based on a short the same director made and was found by Del Toro who produced this movie. Obviously the story did get a revamp and the interesting idea got worked out into a feature length. Which worked out very nice. And it's not only the cast that helps here, the director shows, that he is able to handle a bigger budget as well.There are some genuine creepy moments in this and Jessica Chastain has one major role to play even though she seems to be second fiddle (in more than on sense). There are many things in this movie that get touched upon and they do work nicely (parenthood, growing up, responsibilities and more). The director is one to look out for.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Solid,"This is yet another just ""ok"" horror flick. It is decently imaginative and creepy, and I was surprised at how dark it was for a PG-13 movie.

AWESOME Movie!!,"This is one of the best suspense films I've seen in a very long time! It kept me engaged throughout the entire movie! That's saying a lot for me, as I almost never simply sit and just watch a movie. I'm usually doing a dozen other things! This is by no means a carbon copy of the standard ghost stories! I am very impressed with how well the writers, producers and director emphasized the fact that you do not have to be related by blood in order to be a family. Not to mention the extent that one is willing to go through in order to protect those they love.Regardless of your own opinion of this movie... ask yourself honestly, how far would you be willing to go in order to protect those who are most important in your life!?",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
The story was fresh & it was scary-ish!,"What I liked about this movie was in the list of scary movies I've seen, ""Mama"" was not the same typical hypnotizing vampire, run for your life zombie, or naked ""pretty"" blonde being chased by a murdering bad guy. In a way the story was sad & beautiful & scary, & that's why I gave it a 5/10 & me rating something 5/10 isn't an all the time thing either. Normally I rate movies I liked a bit & would watch again 4/10. 5/10 means that I actually liked it. So if your a horror movie person like myself, I think you may enjoy this.

"Good scares, lack of everything else for the most part.","I think it is hard for me to review a horror film. Much like comedy, horror depends on it ability to elicit a specific reaction from its viewer, and sometimes it seems as if this reaction is dependent on the viewers own tastes, or perhaps the state that they are in. I found Mama to be truly terrifying at times (even though the horror tapers off at the end), and I suspect that most viewers will feel some of the fear that I did. Unfortunately, most of the terror is balanced with a dumb story, characterless characters, and a tendency to show too much toward the end.""Mama"" is the story of two sisters found in a cabin in the woods after being lost for years. Their father had brought them to the cabin after killing his wife, and planned to murder the children along with killing himself. He never gets the chance though, as he is soon dispatched by a mysterious entity. The uncle of the children, Lucas (Coster-Waldau), has kept up hope of finding his brother and the children, eventually a group of hunters he hires to comb the woods finds the children alive but feral. After some pop psychology, they move in with their uncle and his girlfriend, Annabel (Chastain), where it soon becomes apparent that some malevolent force has followed the children out of the woods.One of the better aspects of the film is the relationship between the two sisters. The older sister, Victoria, is able to more readily adapt back into normal life and drop her previous feral attitude. She also becomes more attached to her adopted family, and more wary of the entity that the two sisters refer to as ""Mama."" Her younger sister, however, is more unwilling to adapt to modern life and sees Mama as a protective and motherly force, drawn to it instinctively almost. This sets up a lot of what happens in the film, and the dynamic serves the movie well. But, they spend too little time on this relationship; instead focusing on other characters or strains that ended having little interest to the story itself.Perhaps the main reason to see this movie is because of the scares, of which there are plenty. The entity, and even the younger sister, moves in a terrifyingly fast and disjointed fashion. The action to these scenes are rightfully kinetic and the sense of fear is real. There are also some disconcerting scenes, that are not scary, but off-putting. The camera work all around is well done during these horror moments, there was real sense of space to the house and the every character was framed well. All of this said, the horror did die down toward the end. The decision to show the entirety of the monster was a mistake, as my horror at contorted figure changed to mild amusement. Further, the story itself made some of the decisions made by Mama appear odd or just downright stupid.The acting by Chastain is horrendous, as her character is played as stiffly as possible and her connection to the children is more or less ham-fisted. Further, besides the sisters, every character is uninteresting. Annabel is shown earlier in the film rejoicing at the fact that her pregnancy test was negative and more or less lived a care free lifestyle in rock band. This should have set up some tension when her boyfriend decided to adopt these kids. But it doesn't. In a hilariously bad scene, Annabel sits with her band mates and explains that she has to quit the band (it is never stated why, since she really does not do much). One of the band member retorts that she could just leave her boyfriend. But no, she loves him too much to do that. And that is that, no tension, no drama, I guess she will do anything or drop anything for the one she loves. There is no reason why Annabel is the way she is, and has no depth of character whatsoever, making her eventually warming up to the children hollow.""Mama"" is probably one of the better contemporary horror films out there, and is worth a watch if you like the genre. Unfortunately, it is brought down by too many pitfalls that other horror movies find themselves in. There are good elements here, scary moments, good camera work, and some convincing acting by the sisters. It just feels unfinished or rushed.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Those bankers have a lot to answer for,"This chiller benefits from the name of Guillermo Del Toro amongst the production credits and will be the reason many will view it, including myself who took the bus to Cineworld.The plot begins with a father and his six and three year old girls crashing the car they are in off an icy road and fleeing to a long abandoned cabin where he pulls a gun to seemingly kill them. Pop has had a pretty rough time of it in the recession and has already killed several people including the girls' mother; those bankers have a lot to answer for. At this point the titular Mama; a maternal ghost makes her appearance and saves the girls.Five years later and the now feral girls are discovered in the cabin by a couple of huntsmen in the employ of the sisters' uncle and his rock chick girlfriend played by Jessica Chastain. The pair of whom, after a period of assessment are entrusted with the care of the siblings (along of course with the maternal ghost). The scares and chills are ratcheted up from here on as Mama becomes a we bit overprotective (think psychotic Jewish mother on amphetamines with a taste for nursery rhymes and neck snapping) and there follows some moments that genuinely sent chills down my spine. However the director overly relies on the sudden movement loud bang kind of scare which I see as lazy horror film making. As the movie goes on we see more and more, literally of the motherly spectre which to me is a lot less scary than the glimpses we glean of Mama in the earlier stages of the movie.The movie creaks to a finish with some amateur investigating by the Dr that assessed the girls and their would be aunt into the origin of Mama. For me the denouement was overblown,overextended and ultimately unsatisfying. Which is a bit of a shame as the cast put in solid performances and are deserving of better. The bus fare and entry fee were justified, and overall I think fans of both the genre and Guillermo will be satisfied.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Absolutely Amazing!,"To start off with, I just want to compliment the psychological side of this movie. It's amazing in that, like the Saw franchise, you can get into the head of Mama. Both movies have an extremely different way of making you empathize with the ""baddie"", Saw having what I think is the more interesting way, but both are something special. In most movies the aim of the game is to make you despise the bad guy and put all your heart for the good guy, but in this movie you see both sides and you realize that you would be happy if either side got what they wished. In the case of Mama, both sides got half of the prize and I think that in itself is an entirely unique concept. Amazing! I would give ten out of ten but I can't claim to have seen all the horror movies in the world so I couldn't really say if it's one of the best or not. It's definitely a contender though!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

The actresses playing the little girls are absolutely fantastic and, as always Jessica Chastain delivers a spot on performance. There are few missteps in the plot line but the suspense continues to build throughout. It is filmed with just enough creepiness to keep you enthralled. I was in a theater that had NO empty seats and the collective GASP during certain scenes showed just how much we were all enthralled and into the movie. Can't wait to see it again to watch and catch some of the nuances I'm sure I missed during the ""hide-your-eyes"" parts. There is NO gore in this movie, just a few ""icky"" parts, it is pure suspense.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Something a bit different,"'Mama' tells the story of two little girls who are abandoned in the woods for five years and somehow manage to survive. After being found and put back into society under the care of their uncle and his girlfriend, their carers begin to realise someone had been taking care of them all along.The film is certainly not the scariest film ever; it won't exactly give anyone nightmares. However, there are a few jumpy scenes – but these aren't anything special, this kind of scare is all too common in horror films these days. The story itself is quite interesting; stories of children being cared for by overly protective ghosts appear frequently in TV shows but not so much in films. The story works quite well in feature film length and it doesn't feel too bloated or drawn out. You can tell this is not your average Hollywood horror film; the suspense that builds up works really well and the unconventional ending shows that there is a lot of Spanish/ European horror influence here that has made 'Mama' so unique.The acting in this film is extremely well done. Jessica Chastain is fantastic here and has proved her skills yet again, this time playing a bass player in a rock band with an attitude. The two little girls also perform really well here – particularly Isabelle Nelisse who played the younger girl, Lilly.Overall, 'Mama' is a pretty good film with a few decent scares and a plot that goes against boring convention. It's unpredictable, interesting and different from what we usually get.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Thrilled and entertained,"These are the two words to describe how I felt watching Mama, and those two adjectives resonate how pleased I was with this film. Horror can be done in flashy style with lots of gore and screaming that rattle your ear drums to exhaustion. Sure the screams are an integral part of this genre, but when done with a touch of mystery, a movie can rise above others as a must see experience that shows what the genre is capable of. The plot is about two children that were abandoned in the woods, where they found a way to survive for 5 years. With their uncle's continuous efforts to find them, eventually the children are rescued and brought home to their relative's care. However they seem to have grown attached to a mysterious entity which they name Mama. This figure will create a lot intense moments and the result is an emotional roller-coaster that will take you to a breathtaking finale. Continuing her string of strong performances, Jessica Chastain once again shows her maturity in a lead role that while not challenging is played with a lot conviction. The child leads reveal their acting abilities as well, as their fears and distrust towards others convey their state of mind quite well. I find Mama to be one of the best in the genre and congratulations are in order to those involved. This movie delivered on what it was supposed to deliver. It thrilled and entertained me.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

While watching the movie I had no idea what was going to happen and how it would end. To me that is the definition of a good horror/thriller movie.

Giving us a sorry excuse for low budget by giving us found footage or shaky camera stuff? When I first caught great film maker's movies(I don't want to mention them all as they are a staggering number) I knew that mostly creativity can go a long way even with low budget. Listen up wanna be's, try to create something like what the director of this movie has achieved. No lame excuses. This movie floored me. The transitions were perfect, and blended seamlessly. Rarely have I seen such craftsmanship from film makers these days. I wasn't disappointed and I got what I needed for so long. It gave me hope that there will be better films out there to watch out for. I thought I was lost with all the crap shoved at me nowadays. The actors were pretty good, with very special mention to child stars Megan Charpentier and Isabelle Nélisse. Do I see the next finest actors of the future? Indeed.

This one gets a grip of you from the very start and does not let go as things get worse and worse. The ending is the only part I would take issue with and I feel that here the master probably leaned a little to heavily on Muschietti as it lacks the minimalism of the rest of the film.

Yes your looking at creepy ghosts in the closet, haunted houses in the woods blah blah. Its no lie that its all been done a thousand times before, but its done cause those things are spooky. Its always going to be hard to make an original horror movie, however Mama is substantial and consistent throughout. Its a very good modern day horror with a scary mother's worst nightmare theme. After some good building in tension and a few cheap jumpy moments it DOES unfortunately loose its fear factor towards the end but it has a rewarding ending to make up for it.

The First Great Horror Film of 2013,"When 'Pan's Labyrinth' creator Guillermo del Toro puts his name to what seems to be a routine horror flick, you know there must be something different about the film. Also having recently Oscar nominated Jessica Chastain in the lead role is another huge selling point. These two names are what new horror film 'Mama' are boasting in order to get audiences to come back to the cinema and believe in horror films again, after a mediocre 2012 for the genre. Whilst big names may be enough for the film to succeed at the box office, what horror fans really want is for the film to be actually scary. I'm sure they won't be disappointed.'Mama' follows two young sisters who have spent most of their lives living in the woods and when found are convinced they were nurtured by something they called Mama. They are rescued and move in with their uncle played Nikolaj Cosat-Waldau and his girlfriend played by Jessica Chastain. However, once they have moved into their new home, it seems that Mama hasn't been left behind in the woods, has followed the girls and doesn't want to leave them anytime soon.The first thing to say about 'Mama' is that it is very creepy. Whether or not the film will genuinely scare you depends on how you react to these type of films. If you suffer from paedophobia (a fear of children) in the context of horror films, then 'Mama' will have you covering your eyes in the cinema. The performance from the children are genuinely creepy yet also impressive at the same time. Jessica Chasteain is very strong and shows audience just how diverse her performances can be, from this to 'Zero Dark Thirty' and 'Lawless'.The film may not be the scariest film released in cinemas over the past few years, but it is one of the most original. The script fleshes out each character and a real sense of spookiness stays with you long after you leave the cinema. I personally see the film more as a supernatural thriller then a horror. They is no fake blood and gore to be found here. Just genuine chills and thrills.'Mama' may not be a ground braking entry to the genre, but its an original ghost story that i think does its job rather well. Definitely worth seeing on the big screen and guaranteed to make you jump, 'Mama' is a solid, creepy thriller.Final Score 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"One scary ""Mama.""","""Mama"" (2013) was quite good; I'd give it an 8 out of 10. Jessica Chastain does a great job with a well written character arc — initially unlikable, but then a surprising heroine. And it's great that she got top billing, instead of the film's obligatory telegenic male protagonist, who actually spends a lot of time off-screen.Guillermo del Toro actually didn't direct this, as I thought — he was the executive producer. The director and screenwriter was Andrés Muschietti. But I swear this has the feel of del Toro's work. It could stand as a thematic sequel to the wonderful ""Don't Be Afraid of the Dark"" remake, for example, which had strong elements of childhood fantasy and motherhood as a theme.And what a great and beautifully creepy use of CGI to render the title baddie. In fact, the whole movie was visually terrific, with a fairy-tale-ish use of movement and color that was cool, creative and different. There are really clever flourishes for fright-flick fans — I personally really liked the tug-of-war scene.I occasionally noticed some plot-convenient mysteries  one character is assaulted but survives? And ""Mama"" can move with either lightning speed or plodding slowness, depending on what the story calls for. And  at one point  do we actually have a zombie? Do we need to call on Rick Grimes and his band of survivors from ""The Walking Dead?""This was fun. Check it out.https://ericrobertnolan.wordpress.com/",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

A truly great horror. Beautifully done.,"This movie showcases the genius of this Director. The story grips you from the first scenes, the characters make you fall in love with them from the opening scenes also. I was pulled in to this world that is frightening, intriguing, and confronting.

You couldn't help but feel for the characters, I had never been so in to the characters of a movie like this in years. Even the so called ""bad"" people, the way that Andrés Muschietti melds the story to each of them had me invested in them and their plight. I couldn't help but want to see this movie again.

This movie is a good change from most of the horror jump scare movies they have been showing recently.Last but not least, I would like to say that little Isabelle did an amazing acting job in her role. Very good performance for such a young actress.I recommend this movie!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"If you're into anything Horror, Thriller or ghost related, then you'll love Mama","In theaters now, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic Raven Devanney bravely went to see a screening of the new thriller/chiller, ""Mama."" This PG-13 rated movie isn't for everyone, but if you are a fan of horror, and like to be scared silly, you shouldn't miss it. Though not the most original film, it packs a heavy fear-factor for every ghost-loving movie goer.Mama Reviewed by Raven Devanney, age 15, KIDS FIRST! Film CriticGo here to see Raven's full video review! http://www.you-tube.com/watch? v=HMV5t7V1V3U""Mama"" tells the story of two young sisters, Lily and Victoria, who are abandoned in the woods for five years. When the girls are found and taken into custody by their uncle and his girlfriend Annabelle, everyone begins to wonder how these toddlers could have survived for so long on their own. The girls' strange behavior leads Annabell to believe that the girls weren't alone in the woods after all, and in fact, a troubled ghost called Mama was caring for them. But when they leave the forest, they don't leave Mama.I really enjoy this movie. It is definitely scary to watch, but when it is over it doesn't leave you feeling afraid. I'm convinced this movie is a mix between ""The Woman in Black"" and ""The Possession."" It has a very similar ghost with the same motives as The Woman in Black, and has the same creepy bugs from ""The Possession."" The ending is especially similar to ""The Woman in Black."" No spoiler alerts or anything, but you think all will be fine but it's not. I guess you shouldn't go to a horror film if you're looking for a happy ending.I like the cinematography, and the use of lighting and sound track, to set the ominous mood for this film. The dull colors and grey wash of the scenery really helps the spook level of the movie. The one thing I have a real problem with was the animation of Mama's face in the last few scenes. This is supposed to be the height of the horror, the film's climax, but Mama's face is so unrealistic that it pulls me out of my horrified trance and I am no longer scared.My favorite character is Annabell (Jessica Chastain), because she isn't too enthusiastic about suddenly having to take on a motherly role, especially since the girls have serious social problems. Her boyfriend, the main caretaker of the kids, gets seriously injured, leaving Annabell in charge. I love watching her relationship develop into love for Lily and Victoria, and when Mama comes to play, she does a wonderful job showing her fear.My favorite scene is in the very beginning of the movie, when it shows how one-year-old Lily and three-year-old Victoria end up in the woods. It is a very twisted scene, but I like how they show the girls adapting to their new surroundings. They adapt through crayon drawings on the walls, which is very creative.I give Mama 4 out of 5 stars because it is definitely thrilling, but since it is so similar to some other films in this genre, I have to take a point away for lack of originality. I recommend ""Mama"" for ages 13 and up because of its intense content. If you're into anything Horror, Thriller or ghost related, then you'll love Mama so go check it out!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Every moment counts,"Making a decision about whether to watch a horror movie or not takes a lot of thoughts compared to other genres. Mostly because the level of getting the fear is different on individuals. Some may find the Final Destination series scarier than the Seed of Chucky due to the common car accidents that they can relate to in real life. Or it could be the other way around if someone is hypochondriac enough to imagine a doll moving itself.The ""Mama"" contains a plethora of exhilarating and nerve-wrecking moments that easily make audiences petrified for 108 minutes. There are extraordinary conflicts revolve around every character as the story carries to the cliffhanger.The acting isn't the best, but the chemistry among the cast works well, especially Megan and Isabelle who execute difficult roles of brainwashed nieces who are capable of bouncing off the wall as four-legged animals and going back to acting like innocent children whose favorite foods are moths and moldy cherries.A round of applause goes to Jessica Chastain whose memorable performance that requires a dramatic transformation to play the role of Annabel that evolves from an insolent girl with no interest in looking after girls into a caring and loving woman. And Mama, I don't want to go too far with her role because it will turn into a spoiler, but let me just say ""Bravo.""By looking at the critics and reviews so far, it does not seem highly positive as a few hardcore horror movie fans have given some crucial feedback about the realism, originality, and how the movie is kinda predictable. But despite those facts, I have never seen a movie that dissipates so much intensity and nervousness on the cusp and still manages to reach the climax. It is really worth watching it.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""Mama"" is a satisfying horror tale that demands multiple viewings","The first time I watched ""Mama,"" I walked away disappointed. For some reason, the special effects looked extremely artificial to me. That was my only real complaint, but it hindered my enjoyment of the film.As I was getting ready to write my review, I had this nagging feeling I needed to watch ""Mama"" again. Rarely do I watch a movie twice in such a short period of time, but I was drawn to give it another chance. I can't begin to tell you how glad I am that I did.Two little girls stumble upon a cabin after a car wreck. Five years after their disappearance, they're found and taken into custody by their uncle Lucas and his girlfriend Annabel. The two bring the children into their home and attempt to give them a normal life. As bizarre circumstances unfold, Annabel starts to get the feeling something sinister has accompanied the girls and is ""protecting"" them.For the most part, director / writer Andrés Muschietti adheres to the saying ""less is more."" We get quick and creepy glimpses of the supernatural entity. As the movie moves along, we are given longer and greater detailed glances at her. What looked very CGI the first time I took it in proved to be more convincing and practical at second look.I found ""Mama"" full of great moments of genuine thrills and chills upon giving it a second chance. You'd think a horror movie you've seen before wouldn't hold as much tension when watching it again, but that's not the case with ""Mama."" It had more of an effect on me the second time around.Every actor in the movie is convincing in their role. Jessica Chastain transforms from a 1960s blond southern belle into a black-haired punk rocker incredibly well. The girls are absolutely phenomenal and their authentic reactions to the events occurring to them are noteworthy.""Mama"" isn't going to satisfy gore hounds with its ""less is more"" approach and lack of gore. However, Gothic horror enthusiasts and those who love a good ghost story with substance will thoroughly enjoy this. It's a creepy suspense-filled tale that you'll find yourself wanting to watch multiple times.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Fantastic,"I absolutely loved this. So many horror movies are just an excuse to use CGI without really having any decent storyline or characters that you could care less about. Not so 'Mama'. With a really solid plot and characters that were rounded and likeable, along with a really eerie atmosphere and a great-looking ghost, this scores on all levels. I was gripped throughout and there was actually an ending that made sense. The thing which makes it a 10 for me is that it's actually believable and you really care what happens in the end.

scary,"This is one way to make a scary horror film. A while I wrote a review for Scarecrows, and I would rank both these movies as examples-with shocks and thrills. Leonard Maltin was right when he called this film ""genuinely scary."" This movie deals with a father and two small children who survive a car accident in the woods, and they find a cabin, and the father gets ""dragged away."" Five years later, the father's brother finds the cabin and the girls-feral, filthy, and like wild animals. He and his girlfriend (part of a rock band) take them to a psychiatric facility, where they reveal that someone (or something) named ""Mama"" has been looking over them. They then get charged with looking over them.What happens next is unforgettable. I loved the creepy atmosphere, the scenes with the slugs, the holes in the wall, the ""creeping hair,"" and the shadows. You will never forget the final showdown scene. I truly mean that.This was one of my favorite movies, horror or otherwise. I really recommend it.*** 1/2 out of ****",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A dark and unusual faery-tale like horror flick,"Seemed like a pretty standard run-of-the-mill horror movie when I first read about it and saw the trailers, but as I saw it (about 3 weeks before official release) it's actually one of the new millenias most unusual film in its genre.

This has to be one of my favourite modern horror movies.Though I think they showed mama too early and it could of been interesting if they kept you guessing as to what mama was, a ghost, hallucination or fractured personality but they show mama to be a ghost right from the start.That is my one complaint but like I said a great movie and one of my fave horror movies there is.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

One of the Best Horrors in a Long Time,"I could have a chance to look at this movie with a friend of mine yesterday, we are both great fans of fine horror material.Needless to say, both of us were left almost stunned already at the beginning of the movie - I haven't seen a good horror movie with a such a big budget (or outstandingly effective use of it) for a really long time by now.Not only the characters are lovable, the main scary element is stunningly beautiful (read: scary and creepy as hell) in design and appearance. I could say it is one of the best designs of all time.BUT! The movie does not overdrive the horror element, it doesn't grant a typical, unpleasant experience. In fact, it's quite the opposite: it's entertaining and fine to watch.Mama (2013) also offers emotional slices of various depth which are easy and convenient to embrace due to good filming and character features.Full throttle, no-brainer for those preferring mystic horror. 9/10, many producers should take this as a good example of what horror is.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Children in Horror movies are creepy (Review for my Films and Theatre Class),"Children in horror movies are always creepy. From creepy orphans to children's laughter, it has been socially accepted that children makes any horror movie creepier than it would be without it. A new psychological horror masterpiece that takes advantage of eerie environments and spine-tingling sound-effects is the first feature length movie of Andres Muschietti. Based on the short film he created a few years back of the same title; Mama (2013), tells the story of two orphaned girls that miraculously survived five years in a cabin in the wilderness because of a sorrowing mother who feeds them cherries and protects them from danger. It truly shows that a mother's love goes beyond life itself.Victoria (Megan Charpentier), and Lilly (Isabelle Nelisse) are left for dead after their estranged father went ballistic after his company went bankrupt killing his partners and his wife. Their uncle Lucas (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) and his girlfriend Annabel (Jessica Chastain) won the custody of these almost feral children, after five years of searching in the woods; as well as a supernatural being, the children call 'Mama,' that will haunt them until they figure out why Mama is so attached to the two girls and how they can bring Mama to peace.Chastain's character is the rocker girlfriend that did not want to be a mother yet learns to love and understand the two girls. Charpentier's character is the older of the two sisters that becomes the bridge between Mama and Annabel. Charpentier's acting is impressive, however; Nelisse, the younger of the two, is even more impressive. Her character is the most feral of the two where she reverted to animalistic behaviour. Acting in an animalistic manor, including making animal noises and walking on all fours, is difficult especially to a young girl.The direction of Muschietti is superb for a new director especially for a psychological horror that follows the generic plot of other famous movies such as The Orphanage (2007) and Orphan (2009) where orphans are usually associated with a super natural being or power that causes havoc to the people around them. Cinematography is as equally important as direction. Mama (2013) does some cool things when it comes to scaring the pants off of its audience. It uses its sound effects very well, and one sound might have been inspired by Ju-On: The Grudge (2002). The sound of a creaking door became associated with fear right after Ju-On: The Grudge (2002) was released. In Mama (2013), the sound that signifies that Mama is near is the cracking of bones. The movie created a scene that is similar to the Hangar 51 scene at the end of Indiana Jones: Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981). The atmosphere of the storage on both scenes was similar where it shows that any of the boxes in storage holds their individual mysteries.Mama (2013) is different from the recent horror movies where blood, gore, and a madman were the main way to scare the audience. Mama (2013) is your classic psychological horror where jump scares, eerie environments and sounds dominate the scene. Mama (2013) is a must see for any lover of psychological thriller.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the few horror movies that actually kept me up at night,"This movie genuinely terrified me... The plot was excellent and very well thought out! Not only was it scary but it had a very solid story to go along with it. I'm not sure how this one was different from other horror movies but it is one of the best ones I've seen. There was TONS of jump scares which really kept me alert and interested because at the time, I was watching this around midnight (which I completely regret). The actors were also extremely talented: especially Megan Charpentier and Isabelle Nélisse. They did such an amazing job portraying those troubled characters. Overall, the acting, the creative story, and the surprise moments throughout the show is what really impressed me and I would give this a 9/10 :)",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
So flawed but beautiful,"There's so many conflicting emotions I felt about this film. Let's start with the negatives because there were quite a lot. The screenplay needed to be a lot better. Some of the plot developments feel completely forced, and the characters seem to make some truly stupid decisions. I usually overlook this in most horror films, but the fact that I found myself rolling my eyes several times at what the characters were doing is a huge flaw.Despite the screenplay not being all that good (or maybe decent with just way too many problems), there's an originality to its tone and to its final act that make it stand out among other recent horror films. Sure, it has several jump scares, and for people not a fan of that it might not work. But the jump scares were effective and always seemed creatively executed that it just made up for the other screenplay factors. Despite the writing not being very strong, the central plot here is. The backstory to the ""evil"" is very interesting, and the climax is rather beautiful and very touching.The other thing that made the film work as much as it did despite being completely problematic is Jessica Chastain. She's already one of my favorite actresses working right now with only a few films that I've seen her in, but there's no sense of naivety or immaturity in her acting. She feels completely in the zone every time I see her in any film and this is no exception. And although the circumstances by which her character becomes the lead is one of the most contrived plot developments in the film, once she's the lead you really don't mind at all.Overall, the climax bumps my grade up even more. Definitely a creepy film with some truly fantastic visual imagery and a truly fascinating ""villain"" that perhaps warranted a better film, but still works nonetheless.",,Anonymous,Horror
Doesn't Stink!,"This movie's been out a long time now. I've just finished watching it here in the throes of coronavirus pandemic March when it's a 2013 piece and I only learned of it via Cordery FX and his excellent YouTube channel.I still put off watching it quite some time. I watch so many dreadful movies. This one though, is actually one I can recommend. It's reminiscent of Nell, the 1994 Jodie Foster movie - if Nell and her sister had been raised by the murderous ghost of an escaped mental patient from the Edwardian period. If Nell and The Babadook did the fusion dance. Glad I finally got around to seeing it.I love ghost stories, I'm fascinated by feral children and this movie actually made me feel things. I see so much pure garbage, I forget that movies are supposed to make you feel things.
The child actresses were uncommonly brilliant, there's no happy ending, the Mama is left morally ambiguous.I had some issue with the CG effects. The schitck to this movie is, the Mama comes from a CGI hole in a wall - which moths fly out of. The Mama moves in that scrawny, jerky, twisted way ghost effects are created these days. Sure, she's creepy, but we've seen this method too many times to be frightened. The Mama's voice is something between a bear and a pigeon, a coo and roar at once, which when phrased that way is symbolic.The main character in this movie is the uncle's girlfriend. Not only is it refreshing to see an uncle be treated as a sympathetic character in a movie, the girlfriend is pushed to the forefront when the Mama tries to kill him and he is sidelined in hospital. I enjoy those different sort of treatments in character writing. Though there is a scene where we area asked to believe a Bloodhound could track a 5 year old trail (I'm a former dog trainer - that's so absurdly a c'mon, man - that well, just forget about it) but those are my only gripes. Mama is one of the better movies I've seen in a long time.Yes, it has predictable components, but it's far from the same old same old in ghost stories.""It's about family.""
Family and obsession and love and torment and death.",,Anonymous,Horror
"'Mama' May Be Clichéd, Contrived & Conventional But It Still Boasts Some Genuinely Unnerving Moments","Marred by our own familiarity with the genre yet managing to be quite effective when the occasion calls for it, Andrés Muschietti's feature-length adaptation of his short film of the same name is consistent in its delivery of old-school scares, and brilliantly keeps its eerie vibe alive for the major portion of its runtime but what brings it down is its overly sentimental & underwhelming ending.The story of Mama concerns two young girls who were abandoned in a forest cabin and are found 5 years after their disappearance by a rescue party, that was sponsored by their uncle. Kept under psychiatric care for a while, the two girls prepare their return to domestic life under the custody of their uncle & his girlfriend but the young couple soon finds out that their nieces brought someone else with them.Co-written & directed by Andrés Muschietti, Mama is crafted with care & affection and sets up its premise with an interesting, if far-fetched, prologue. Muschietti's direction is impressive for a first feature but his inexperience also surfaces, for he has no idea of how to handle the origin story of the ghostly figure we encounter in the story and ends up revealing too much, which in turn takes away the mystery and lessens the overall impact.But Muschietti does exhibit talent when it comes to creating & sustaining a foreboding atmosphere and expertly carves out some truly chilling segments from time to time. The slow, steady & smooth manoeuvring of camera brings a discomforting element into the story while those sudden bursts of startling immediacy delivers the jump scares. Sound is brilliantly carried out & effectively utilised. Editing could've been better while its background score gives it a fairy tale vibe.Coming to the acting department, the cast comprises of Jessica Chastain, Nicolaj Coaster-Waldau, Megan Charpentier, Isabelle Nélisse, Daniel Kash & others, with Charpentier & Nélisse stealing the show. Chastain also chips in with a sincere performance, and her chemistry with the two girls is a treat to watch. Both youngsters exhibit a great comfort in each other's company, because of which their relationship feels authentic & highly convincing. Coaster-Waldau doesn't have much to do but does fine with what he's given.On an overall scale, Mama is clichéd, contrived & conventional but it also boasts some genuinely unnerving moments. It isn't difficult to see why Guillermo del Toro endorsed this chiller, for it has a fairy tale quality to it like his own features, is reliant on its ominous ambiance to deliver the scares, brims with rich themes, and chooses practical effects over CGI. Both its title & tagline hinted that emotions will come into play in this feature at some point but that very sentimentality also turns its final act into a bland affair and concludes the film on an unsatisfying note.In short, Mama is another addition in the long list of horror films that started on a promising note, took a few turns that were simply uncalled for, and wrapped itself up with a climax that failed to deliver the impact its viewers were hoping for.",,Anonymous,Horror
Stong supernatural thriller with a dirt tack final act.,"After an accident in which their father dies two young girls become feral, when they are rescued they are looked after by their uncle and his girlfriend, soon it becomes apparent that their survival was due to a spirit who won't let them go and the terror begins.Thankfully the child actors are impressive, actor Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau is excellent in the dual role of the uncle and his twin although his screen time is sporadic. Lead roles include an almost unrecognisable Jessica Chastain as Annabel along with Daniel Kash as the doctor. There's also a strong supporting cast of worn faces, for a horror film the acting is far above average.As supernatural thriller the first half is finely crafted by director Andrés Muschietti and packed with tension and chills. The sound design and music by Fernando Velázquez complement the scares and eeriness. However, the second half chooses to reveal the ghost too often and steals the fright factor of what Muschietti had created earlier, especially in the closing.What starts as an intriguing mystery with genuine creepiness unravels becoming a special effects fest by the end (more finely tuned but reminiscent of The Nun (2005) effects). Mama is a solid ghost story with an interesting premise that revolves around the two girls and the back story of Mama. There's a cabin in the wood, a large house with a disgruntled spirit, creepy kids, the clichés are there but they are delivered efficiently. Nevertheless, Andrés & Barbara Muschietti's story leaves a few niggling questions unanswered, not around the antagonistic 'Mama' but some of the other characters.Overall Mama is special effects laden which is a shame considering the added intricacies and strong retelling of a classic-esque ghost story. Still it's a strong well made addition to the genre.",,Anonymous,Horror
Energetic but easily freudened,"As a lifelong and avid watcher of horror, I've come to know what generally works for me.One thing that puts me off is horror that spend more time tinkering with the wrap than the actual thing inside; a smart script, attempts at drama, good acting, polished visuals in a general sense, it is neither here nor there if a film has these for me however professional-looking the end result, and the same is true for nonhorror. That is all superficial attention to appearance.What I do care about, by contrast, is ecstatic energy in the gears of narrative, raw edges; Texas Chainsaw, Suspiria, Halloween, Alien, The Funhouse, Evil Dead are all prime examples in horror. Drag Me to Hell more recently. They can be stylized or meticulously designed but that's not the point. The point for me is this visual energy that exhilarates, usually starts slow and builds to ritual dance.My other parameter is that, generally speaking, horror is a matter mental urges, the story of ghosts is how we try to explain and reason with what just rose in the mind. So is this inner life of images clean apart from outside reality? Do we have for instance a portal to the horror dimension as normally in Stephen King? Or is it inextricable from mundane life, the same fabric? Do the images create the life? On this end we have all the ambitious stuff, from Videodrome to Inland Empire.So what Del Toro puts on the table is just not for me. He is polished, professional, but the finished thing is usually meek and ever so reasonable, there is no letting go of mind. And the other-world of urges is always apart from life. So I have no use for his Devil's Backbone or Labyrinth. And whether because he attracts similar-minded talent or he has sway as a movie man, his produced films feel to me as tepid as his own—The Orphanage above all, well-made in a general sense but where's the passion?This is well-made and at least the premise is effective, missing children are mysteriously rediscovered years later in a log cabin in the woods, having regressed in an animal state.But again the main story, swathes of backstory about a mental asylum in the 1800's and psychological nuance are contrived, too much is cleanly explicable. We have some polished visuals, especially near the end. But the implications, the what-it-all-means, is sophomoric at best—as with Insidious last year and Del Toro's own stuff, the psychological world is its own fantastical realm, taken at face value. The aural effect may appeal to the teenage audience but it's a reduction from my view, or to quote from Joyce: ""when they were jung, and easily freudened"".It may be the tipping point in this type of film was Poltergeist, where ever so dull Spielberg used all sorts of sfx gizmos to clarify Hooper's metaphysical force in the walls of the film.Still, deep down there is some marvellous energy here, some startling occasions. For a while, this is as creepy as some of the Japanese stuff, where the point is a negative void. And then we have the swelling of jump scares, the forward motion—it is a dynamic effect. But all the other stuff works against this burying itself deep, we see and reason too much so the thing is made whole outside of us. Was a talent stifled here? We'll see in the future.",,Anonymous,Horror
Should be R not PG 13 - note for parents.,"I looked at the parental advisory last night before allowing my nearly 13 year old daughter to go. She is not a sheltered child at all. In fact, she is all but fearless. Her favorite shows are Supernatural and Doctor Who. She has seen all the Scream movies as well Psycho (the original). She reads mystery books. She was completely traumatized by Mama. She ended up sleeping on the floor next to me all night.The language and sexuality, according to the parental advisory, are acceptable for a PG-13 rating. The listing of scary moments evidently do not do the fear factor of the film justice. Parents using the MPAA rating for this film will be disappointed.",,Anonymous,Horror
