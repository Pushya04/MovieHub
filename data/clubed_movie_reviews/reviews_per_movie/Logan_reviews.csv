A comic book film done right,"Gritty, honest and brutal. Just like a movie about Logan should be. This is by far the best X-Men film as far as I'm concerned. Logan doesn't hold back at all which I absolutely loved. For the most part, there is just an onslaught of awful things happening. And apart from the relationship between Laura and Logan, nothing makes you go 'oh, that was nice'.Very early on in the film, I got huge John Wick vibes. The action was very reminiscent of those films. It was fast, it was brutal and graphic, and it wasn't afraid to show everything. Indeed, you got the sense that Mangold was trying to find more and more interesting and gory ways to kill people. Something that the John Wick franchise also does. This comparison between John Wick and Logan is nothing but a positive one. If you ask me, the John Wick films are some of the best action films to have come out in recent years, as is Logan.Where Logan really shines though, is not in the action, but in the story of Logan. It's a depiction Logan that I think a lot of people have wanted to see. Although I'm by no means an expert on the comic books, I have always had the feeling that Logan is a much more complex and difficult character than the previous X-Men or Wolverine films have led to believe. Logan is just as brutal with its depiction of the character as it is with its action.Logan really should be used a case study on how to do a comic book film. The only problem it faces is its R rating. I absolutely loved the rating as it allowed the film to go as dark as it needed and wanted to go. But comic book movies are, of course, supposed to be the highest-grossing films studios make, and an R rating will automatically lower revenues.If you have been looking for a comic book film that isn't just like all the previous ones, Logan is the one for you. As mentioned, it is brutally honest and gritty, and the action is more brutal than you would ever dare to expect. It's a fantastic action film but it also manages to create such an impressive story that you will find yourself amazed with the depth of it.
Is it my favourite comic book movie ever? No. But is it easily one of the best ones? Absolutely.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Rewatching Logan, I can't help but feel a rush of emotions as Hugh Jackman says goodbye to the role of Wolverine... or so we all thought, including Hugh himself. James Mangold teams up with Jackman for their second outing focusing on Logan, and this time it's a decidedly more introspective event, wholly unlike any other X-Men film. Taking cues from his 3:10 to Yuma remake, Mangold turns this into a western of sorts with sci-fi embellishments, creating a unique and compelling atmosphere.Jackman delivers his most nuanced performance as Logan, portraying a character who is older, wearier, and more vulnerable than we've ever seen. It's fascinating to watch him bring depth and raw emotion to the role, making it a fitting swan song for his iconic character. Patrick Stewart also gets plenty of scope to do something entirely different, and his portrayal of Professor Xavier is both heartbreaking and powerful.Even the plot points that usually come across as generic, such as certain action set pieces, have a different tone and feel in Logan. Mangold manages to infuse these scenes with a sense of realism and grit that makes them stand out from the typical superhero fare. The action is brutal and unflinching, but it never feels gratuitous. Instead, it serves to underscore the themes of mortality and redemption that run throughout the film.What I love most about Logan is how it successfully blends genres, taking elements of the western and the sci-fi thriller and melding them into a coherent and engaging narrative. The film's introspective nature allows for character development and emotional resonance that are often missing in superhero films. It's a fitting way to say farewell to the role of a lifetime... for now.Overall, Logan is a remarkable achievement, a film that transcends its genre to become something more profound and meaningful. For me, it's a deeply satisfying rewatch that reminds me why I love the character of Wolverine and the world he inhabits.FORMAT: 4K Ultra HD Blu-rayVIDEO: 10.0

"If there was ever a comic book movie deemed worthy of perfect, Logan is it.","The word 'perfect' is very objective especially when it comes to film. While Logan may not be a perfect film, it is most certainly a perfect comic book film. It is a masterpiece of the most epic proportions and leaves us with a brilliant swan song for producer and star Hugh Jackman in his final outing as Wolverine. The film, directed brilliantly by James Mangold, is a two plus hour comic book fan's wet dream as we see the version of Wolverine every fan has wanted to see for nearly two decades. While many will be very sad to see Jackman step down from the role, he couldn't have picked a better or more satisfying film to end his cinematic legacy with.The film takes place in 2029 and shows the world in shambles. Mutants are nearly extinct, water is scarce and the world is just an overall wasteland. This is where we find Logan. He is a limo driving cantankerous caretaker to an even more cantankerous Professor X, who is now suffering from dementia and seizures. He is a borderline alcoholic suffering from a mysterious illness that limits his mutant abilities. Due to this, he lives this quiet life until he meets a young girl who he feels he must protect. Without giving too much away, there is much more here than I can go into but I will say, if you are a fan of the Wolverine comics, this film will bring a tear to your eye. This is probably the most faithful adaptation of a comic book character EVER, Marvel and DC combined. The way the story goes, the way Logan behaves, the selflessness and the rage, this is an all around realized version of this character. While it may have taken a little longer than it should have, this film was worth the wait. James Mangold does a fantastic job at creating the world Logan knows now. This is more of a film like Mangold's 3:10 to Yuma. It is bleak, violent and absolutely heartbreaking. This is far from the PG-13 character we're used to. This is a foul mouthed, miserable and very VERY bloody rendition of the source material. This is a film very much like The Guantlet or Badlands, a crime thriller and on-the-road drama. It very much embodies the look and feel of a film from the mid-70s and it plays to this very well.The performances in this film are amazing. Hugh Jackman's performance here is the best as the character and may be one of the best of his career. He is miserable and broken in this film and to see him like this as the character, it is bittersweet especially because Jackman has been so attached to this role. If he hurts, we hurt. If he's mad, we're mad. It is a true testament to Jackman as an actor to make his audience feel this connected to someone who is, by traditional standards, completely unrelateable. Boyd Holbrook brings a sinister performance to this and continues to build a very impressive resume. Holbrook is someone who you'll love to hate. The real standout performance here is from Dafne Keen who plays Laura. Without giving away any spoilers, she is BADASS in this film and even gives Logan a run for his money on the brutality.Overall, Logan is a perfect comic book adaptation that is as heartbreaking as it is visually stunning. Mangold and Jackman create a special film with this that should be talked about for years to come. Believe the hype, Logan is a seriously amazing comic book film that just may be the best ever made and embodies the definition of a perfect adaptation.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Just A Flat Out MASTERPIECE!,"Holy Cow! We've finally got the Wolverine movie we've all been waiting for and then some! Mr. Mangold has nailed the character and the action, and Hugh Jackman is truly a part of a Wolverine movie that has showcased the true character that the fans had hoped to see full on. Yes, we've seen superb runs and flashes but nothing this deep or this epic.How could any movie fan in general not just adore this film? It brought elements of a lot of great genres.Logan has to be considered genre-defining. The characters, action and story were all beyond outstanding in this movie. We are taken for a ride and can relate to Logan once again. The acting is superb and the dialogue is perfect for the level of each character. Every single character feels believable. You follow the story through Logan's eyes and what a ride it turns out to be.This movie is emotional and moving in every single way that matters and is unique and is as far away from anything X-Men we've seen before. In this case, that's a very good thing. The fight scenes and pace are superb. I honestly could see Oscar nominations here on multiple fronts.This movie is sophisticated and delivers a grand, tragic story. The action fits in nice but serves the story first. Unlike other ""dark"" films, the tone is perfect and fits the character. The supporting characters are utilized in a comprehensive and cohesive manner and are wonderful in and of themselves.I loved everything about this movie and they left it as if this was the perfect end to Hugh's run.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"The Best Wolverine Movie, Hands Down!","This is a wolverine movie aimed at adults and definitely not for small children. The story is set in the future and Logan is taking care of Charles Xavier who has grown old and is incapable of taking care of himself. Logan, himself is now older and his health is slowly deteriorating as well. A young girl mutant enters their lives which sets off a story, which is not about super heroes fighting bad guys, but one that is on a more human level. ""Logan"", is a beautifully made X-Men film that deals with themes of importance of family, loyalty, and ultimately how Logan himself deals with new found emotions which he is experiencing for the very first time in his life.This is the crowning achievement in Hugh Jackman's role as Wolverine. It is the movie he and director, James Mangold had always wanted to make. It is a dramatic work of art and for X-Men fans, has plenty of action and special FX which are a definite cut above anything that has been seen before in Wolverine/X-Men films.A MUST SEE FOR ANY FAN AND A GOOD ENOUGH FILM TO STAND ALONE FOR ANYONE!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Logan is another level,"The best X-Men film alongside First Class. It felt gritty, it felt real with a sense of dread and hopelessness you don't often see in this comic-book blockbuster adaptations. It should be praised for doing things differently and really pushing the edge with what can or can't be done in the genre. The triangle between Logan, Charles and Laura works as the driving force of the plot, and is very well developed. Logan's character arch is quite pleasant to watch, though obviously predictable. With that said, the acting is clearly masterclass. You can feel the dilemmas, the emotions and feelings that the characters are put through, specially those three. And another thing it does really well is alluding to a previous event - the Charles incident - but never fully explaining it to the audience, leaving you wondering. The action is nothing like you'd expect from a tenthpole - the R rating really makes up for wonders - being quite visceral and impactful. ""Logan"" probably deserved a better villain, although one could argue that the real villain here is not the typical multinational corporation, but the inner demons of the characters. Demons that prevent them from living albeit normal and somewhat stable life.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Come on folks... It's not a 10/10,"I don't know what everyone's seeing in this movie that makes them think its such a masterpiece. Everyone's giving it 9's and 10's, but I'd give it a 6-7 at best. A 10/10 should only be reserved for a film that is flawless in every way -- whether it be acting, directing, cinematography, story and everything in-between. For it to be perfect, the story has to be gripping throughout the 140 minute run time, and that's where I felt it was weakest. It's serviceable, but it isn't perfect. I have a feeling that the people who are giving this film perfect scores are doing so because its much grittier than any X-Men movie in the past. It's definitely savage with the violence, which was refreshing to me and I appreciated them going all-out with the hard R rating. It starts out freaking great when it's setting up the overall plot, but then it REALLLLY drags along for the 90+ minutes in the middle. During the second act, the story spent so much time focusing on little moments with minimal significance to the overall arc, that I found myself feeling really underwhelmed when the big emotional moments finally happened. Don't expect to be heavily invested in the villains either... they're given very little development on screen, and as soon as any meaningful dialogue starts happening to give the audience some exposition into what's been going on for the last 20+ years in this universe, it comes to an abrupt stop. If you're looking for action, you will be happy with the beginning and the end. Other than that, it's nothing more than a mediocre country western style ""road movie"" about Logan and the girl. I also left with more questions than I had going into it, which I'm assuming will be told through a new series of prequels. Overall, it was a so-so experience that wouldn't be getting such high scores if it weren't for the fact that it's an R-rated X-Men movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
The Last Cut Is The Deepest!,"SPOILER: Did we need another X-Men movie? In fact did we need another Wolverine movie? Well the result is there for all to see, with Logan not only showing itself to be undoubtedly the best Wolverine venture by far, but arguably the best X-Men picture as well. If, as expected (and surely to god it's hoped so), this is the last we see of the grumpy metal clawed superhero, then what a fitting and triumphant bow out it is.James Mangold, the director, has managed to create an adult superhero movie without it really being a superhero pic, for he has created a film noir Western that happens to be about a superhero. Mangold's love of noir and Westerns bursts from the screen, which for those who follow those wonderful stands of cinema, will come as no surprise having seen with notice his Copland and 3:10 To Yuma redux. There's a perpetual grimness to the narrative that belies the quite often stunning surrounding locales, heavy themes such as men out of time - with destinies written (cue a deft comic book movie within a comic book chunk of metaphysics) - surrogates, mental illness, human ignorance, and on it goes, the narrative strong on intelligence as much as it is in wrought emotion. Western fans will also be buoyed by the part that the 1953 classic Western Shane has to play in things, considerably so as its importance narratively, orally and visually is mightily strong.Logan's Run!Ah yes, well being ""adult"" is all well and good, but is Logan thrilling? Do we get pumped up Wolverine action, blood brains, splatter and mucho muscle flexing and pained roars of anger? Oh yes! Action from the off is never far away, and wonderfully staged and choreographed it is. Lots of memorable set-pieces, while also some cleverly constructed sequences such as Xavier's mind seizures hold court and enthral. Yet the kicker with all that is we are clued in to the emotional baggage that the side-burn sporting protag carries with him. With each fight we sense the bigger picture, even as we watch in awe the emergence of Laura (ironic film noir name right there as it happens) - and her part in this very ""human"" story - the thrills and spills are propelled by a meaningful but battered heart.Tech credits are superb. Acting honours go to Jackman, who after giving 17 years of his life to the character, gives it his all and this multi faceted performance, in a perfect world, deserves Oscar recognition. Patrick Stewart, also, is immense, playing the nonagenarian Charles Xavier with such class, gracefulness and storming emotion that one can only admire. Film debutante Dafne Keen as Laura is utterly engrossing, quite a debut indeed, whilst Stephen Merchant as albino mutant tracker Caliban is effective to the point we hanker for more. Although the villains fronted by Boyd Holbrook (rote henchman leader) and Richard E. Grant (smarmy scientist git) just about pass muster, there's nothing to damage the piece. Cinematography (John Mathieson) is ""A"" grade, the filters set on neo-noir, with the splendid film noir black and white version a fillip for the heart of noir lovers. All that is left is for the sound mix to boom and the director to steer with heart, brain and soul, without doubt both come up trumps.One of 2017s best films, a genre splicer that ticks all the boxes of great film making. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Knocked it out of the park,"LOGAN - SPOILER FREE REVIEWAs most of you are aware I have not been a huge fan of the latest X- Men outings, but THIS WAS AWESOME!In a rather bleak entry we see a Post X-Men Logan, something has happened and the mutants no longer exist or there is a few of them out there. Director James Mangold chose to make the film almost colorless with much, much more character development than previous Wolverine and X-Men movies. We see a tired character that no longer belongs in a world that has feared him for over a century.While Hugh Jackman in his last outing as Logan does an amazing job and proves once and for all why NO ONE ELSE can ever be Wolverine, the supporting cast does a superb job as well starting with Sir Patrick Stuart who returns as Charles Xavier, Boyd Holbrook (Netflix's NARCOS) as an astounding and dangerous antagonist and newcomer Dafne Keen who is a rather sweet but incredibly deadly Weapon X-23.The movie is filled with gore and violence, but it does not feel forced at all in such an obscure movie. There is a rather new trend in Comic Book Movies after DEADPOOL, make them as brutal as possible, and while this started in the 90s with THE CROW and BLADE it has gained some track and more R Rated CBM are being developed as we speak.I HIGHLY recommend it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
so much more than i expected,"Being a huge X-Men fan, I really hoped this movie would be good and all of the trailers looked amazing, so I went into the cinema with impossibly high hopes, even preparing myself for tears. What I got, however, was an actual punch in the stomach and, like, an hour of crying. This movie exceeded every hope I ever had entering the cinema.I'm actually having a hard time finding any negatives in this movie whatsoever. I wasn't particularly crazy about Dr Rice, but he's such a minor presence in this movie that I barely even noticed him. There are several villains in this movie, Dr Rice, Donald Pierce and X-24, but what I genuinely believe is going fairly unnoticed in all of the reviews I've read is Donald Pierce and Boyd Holbrook's portrayal of him. Honestly, I don't believe we've had such a good X-Men villain since Magneto, and that to me is really important now since we barely get any good villains in movies these days. Villains can be the most interesting part of a movie. I'm excited to watch Boyd's show ""Narcos"" now, and I plan on following his career from this moment on. X-24 is also a much better villain than I expected, serving as a sort of a shadow to Wolverine. Another highlight of the movie was Dafne Keen, the little girl that plays Laura. She is absolutely amazing, and I can't stress that enough.I want to briefly discuss the R rating. Honestly, it adds so much to the movie, and it's amazing to finally see Wolverine cut loose, swearing and slicing people up, it's amazing. And there is a lot of blood and swearing in this movie, which just adds on to this gloomy, gritty feel that lingers over this entire film, further pushing the notion that the dream is dead, that this is the end of the X-Men. It's truly depressing seeing this world where all of your childhood heroes are dead. In a way, I'm almost angry with the creators for twisting the X-Men so out of what we're used to, and that's another thing that I sort of have a problem with, even though nothing really could have been done about it. I don't really feel like the message of this movie, to give up after so many years of fighting, to just kill off everything goofy and colorful about the X-Men and shatter all of our hopes is necessary in a time like this. I think that as goofy as they are, X- Men movies and superhero movies in general just need to do what they were created to do - to raise hope in people that things will get better if we all work together and that we can find a family no matter how different we are. That's an important part as to why X-Men were created in the first place, to show minorities that they're not alone. Now we have a movie that shows mutants, a minority already hated by most of the ""normal"" people being killed off by the government, and I really don't think that's the message that was needed right now. However, ""Logan"" is a typical example of the director giving the audience what they want (a nostalgic, gritty Wolverine road trip movie) instead of what they need. In this case, it absolutely works because everything is so masterfully crafted, the cinematography is beautiful, the performances are amazing (Patrick Stewart and Hugh Jackman should seriously be up for an Oscar), the action, gore and script are ridiculously good, there is a compelling villain and it managed to hit an emotional nerve for me. I can't even consider giving it a lower than perfect score.I'm excited to see what Logan means for the superhero genre. It's definitely up there with the likes of ""The Dark Knight"". However, this movie can stand alone as something more than ""just a superhero film"", and as I've heard so many times before, superhero movies get old. It's time for a little change in the genre. While I can't say I'm particularly happy with the implied direction that the X-Men movies are taking after ""Apocalypse"" (even though the X-Men are my favorite superhero group ever, though people tend to forget all about comic books and animated series), I'm more than excited to see if they will ever again reach anything close to the masterpiece that is ""Logan"".",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A masterfully orchestrated film,"The final outing of Wolverine by Hugh Jackman is one unforgettable ride and one of the best comic-book movies in recent memory. Directed by James Mangold-who was also at the helm of ""The Wolverine"" (2013)- Logan creates a character-driven, violent and emotional film, which benefits from its rated-r rating. The acting, action and story of Logan are one-of-a-kinds in the superhero genre, as the cast, headed by Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart and newly- introduced Dafne Keen, play their characters to the fullest. It is unlike any other X-Men film, definitely the best in the series and deserves the praise it's getting.When I saw the first trailer drop, headlined by Johnny Cash's ""Hurt"", I instantly knew we would be getting something different from everything else that has dropped since the first X-Men film in 2000. The brutality and intensity of the characters pay off in this almost two-and-a- half hour that redefines the superhero genre, and I hope pays dividends for future movies to come.The introduction of X-23 was a big win as well. She is played by Dafne Keen, and though doesn't say much, plays her role very well. Her connection with both Hugh and Patrick creates a family-orientated environment that makes the movie a whole lot better, especially seen in certain scenes.Lastly, as much as I want the character of Wolverine to continue being played on the big screen, it would be better for everyone if they didn't re-cast the role, as no-one would be able to play the role much like the legendary Hugh Jackman.Overall, Mangold and the cast, create a masterfully orchestrated film that will be remembered for years to come. Not only is it a great film, but it is the last time we will be able to appreciate and witness Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart in the X-Men universe.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Wow - Can't believe this was rated so high,"This is a 7 movie at best. Way too long and the emotions at the end were ridiculous considering the 10 days the characters spent together. I'm not a comic book reader, so I can't really account for he accuracy of that. It was a decent movie that sagged in the middle and had some silly villains. Who cares about the magic border? It was a slasher film with a kid. If this is the best XMen movie then the other movies must be pretty sorry. I'm rating a 6 since so many are giving it a 10. This isn't a perfect movie.

Here's to 17 Years,"Without question, this was Hugh Jackman's movie, from start to finish. No matter how you view it, or who the mantle is passed onto next, Jackman will forever be Wolverine, and this film proves it once and for all. Logan dives deep into the hearts of its viewers, twisting and turning until every emotional string is pulled, and in the end, delivers a superhero film like no other before it; a perfect swan song.Logan heavily, and fittingly, borrows from Marvel's iconic 'Old Man Logan' comic to tell the story of a grim and desolate future, where mutant-kind is all but extinct. Director/writer James Mangold was finally given all the tools necessary to tell a truly compelling Wolverine story, and arguably the biggest tool in the box was the 'R' rating. It pushes the film into an extremely dark and forbidding tone, which helps carve the movie into one of immense intensity and emotion. The 'R' rating, of course, also allows for studious amounts of gore and profanity, but those elements don't feel like they were added just because they could be, they only added to the atmosphere Mangold created for this film, and in turn helps set the narrative to be nothing short of enthralling. The pacing is spot on, the dialogue is stellar and the emotional weight is that of a moving mountain. I applaud Mangold for his brilliant writing, and subsequent directing, as he was at last able to produce the Wolverine story every fan has been craving for the last 17 years, one of raw emotion, brutality and pure magnificence.Hugh Jackman has devoted the last 17 years of his career to this beloved character, and now, he leaves it all on the table, giving the performance of a lifetime, one which could seriously garner some looks at an Oscar nomination. The writing of the characters, Wolverine specifically, stand out the most in the gritty setting, because few superhero movies have ever done what Logan is able to do; make the characters vulnerable, make them real and to make you truly care like never before. Wolverine is worn down and beaten, looking for a way out, and Hugh Jackman gives you every reason to want to feel for his character. His action scenes are nothing short of powerful, none more than his final, and the emotion he displays in every aspect is worthy of an award-winning performance. I genuinely cannot express my praise for Jackman enough, he gave it is all.Wolverine is accompanied by two spectacular supporting characters for most of the film in franchise favorite Professor X and the ferocious X-23. Both characters add tremendous layers of depth to both Wolverine and the film as a whole, with exceptional performances from Patrick Stewart and youngster Dafne Keen, who's X- 23 is an absolute showstopper. The main villain, Pierce, isn't anything too special, but doesn't have to be in a story like this. The core cast of Wolvie, Professor X and X-23 are what drive the film and the performances by their respective actors are outstanding. The father figure that Professor X is to Wolverine and the subsequent father that Wolverine is to X-23 is a deep, touching addition to their characters. This is no-doubt a character driven film, and with Wolverine in the driver's seat, and a pair of dynamite supporting characters, the ability to connect with these characters is real, and that is a treasure few superhero films have ever held.The film's action is gloriously vicious, showcasing what a hacking from Wolverine or X-23 would actually look like. But it's not just the heavy amounts of gore that make the action so amazing, it's again the feeling that these characters are in true danger and every move they make could cost them their lives, none more than Wolverine himself, whose reduced healing factor forces him into a different mindset that, outside of briefly in ""The Wolverine"", we've never seen before. He's not invincible, and even with X-23's relentless attacks, he still has to play his cards differently, and it translates into an emotional roller coaster. All together the action sequences and sheer amount of violence were a sight to behold, entertaining and fierce.17 years it has been, since we first watched a young Hugh Jackman don his X-Men suit. 17 years of stories, character development, action, hardship, humor and emotion, come together to deliver one final journey. The final scene alone may move you to tears, as Hugh Jackman's time as the iconic Wolverine comes to an end. One final epic masterpiece of superhero cinema; Logan.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Logan: Not the most fitting send off,"After countless delays and due to my stupidly swollen watchlist I finally got round to seeing Logan which at time of writing currently sits at #155 on IMDb's Top 250 list.Though never really a fan of the X-Men movies due to the lack of consistency and shifting timelines I've always loved Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. The man has taken the character and made it is own as the likes of Robert Englund did with Freddy and for this reason I hope we don't see Wolverine again as a recast would be a travesty.Due to the high rating, rumours of the film & Jackman claiming this was his last film as Wolverine I went in with very high expectations and truth be told they simply weren't met.Don't get me wrong Logan is a good movie, Jackman is great, Keen is surprisingly competent and the movie flows nicely but it all felt very familiar and rather anti-climatic.Wolverine has become of the most iconic movie characters of the last few decades so if this was destined to be his last film we truly needed something special and I don't believe this comes under that category.Even with fantastic actors like Patrick Stewart, Richard E Grant & Stephen Merchant the movie never came close to reaching its potential and left me more than slightly let down.The ending, arguably the worst part of the film. No spoilers to be found here just wads of disappointment.After 9 films as Wolverine I salute Hugh Jackman for literally becoming a character, all the respect in the world. One does have to wonder if he'd have had as much success if he'd worn the proper Wolverine yellow spandex though!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
This Movie Stands on its Own,I was pleasantly Surprised on this movie. What held it for me is that you didn't need all the other marvel comic characters in the film. Story Arc was well produced and adapted to the big screen. As another reviewer mentioned I also wished there would have been more fight sequences between Logan and X-23. I thoroughly enjoyed this film.,8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Like any typical linear action based drama,"Some say it is a masterpiece, if it is a master piece what was Godfather? I know the genre is different, but every genre has to achieve that high bar in order to be called masterpiece, so anyone who says it is a masterpiece has no idea of how a masterpiece looks like.Many said it is depressing, again I felt it is not at all depressing, it is a very simple script, very linear ,no twists, no mysteries, sometimes funny, just the bad guys chasing a mutant girl who is being protected by Logan. Everything else around are to spice up this very linear moments in the life of decaying wolverine.If you are thinking this is a movie that you will remember after even like a week and miss, then you are wrong. This movie is worth watching one time, just one time. But is it necessary movie that I will say you should watch this before you die kind of movie? Not at all. You can miss out on this one and you will miss nothing important in life.I give it rating of 6 because I have seem better and more deep movies which kept me thing hours after watching the movie rated less than 7. So 6 is a good rating for this movie. Now why is it rated 8 or more? I have no clue how IMDb works who comes and reviews these movies, it got a 8 because I suppose it is Wolverine.Wolverine is a character already developed, new characters in the movie had no emotional influence on me at all including the girl. If I think deeply about that I will rate it less than 6 but I am just gonna be generous and keep my 6 rating.Thank you.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
What Happens When Superheros Get Old.,"What happens when superheroes get old is the main and interesting question this movie answers. It's a question when you think of when you place superheroes in the real world. Logan is a great movie and I think one of the best superhero movies ever made. The movie so adult in its approach that I think even youngsters who read the comics will learn to grow into. The script, the action, the acting is all great and goes to show that you don't need over the top action and effects to tell a great story. This movie gave me what I wanted...a movie. Something you can watch, be taken away and talk about hours after you watch it. And you don't have to know anything about the mythology of the Xmen to enjoy this film.This movie has heart and is directed wonderfully by James Mangold. Hugh Jackman's final performance as Wolverine is his best performance to date because of the range of emotions he has to go through in this film. Great film, highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Logan is a more than excellent final chapter of the Wolverine saga!,"Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend who had previously seen this several times before. He must have liked this a lot if he agreed to watch it again with me as a first-time viewer. Indeed, this was quite different from many previous Hugh Jackman/Wolverine movies as it's a bit more intense and a little more explicit in language as well. This time, it's a future timeline in which he has to take care of a somewhat sick Charles Xavier (once again, Patrick Stewart) in some desert town while he works as a limo driver. Then a woman asks for his help which he at first refuses before a mysterious little girl appears. I'll stop there and just say this was quite a dramatically compelling narrative with plenty of exciting fight scenes along the way. So on that note, me and my friend highly recommend Logan.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Short Changed...,"Riven by some cavernous plot shortcomings you feel the characters, having provided such robust, beguiling and generous entertainment in the past perhaps deserved a little bit more circumstantial authenticity as they spiral their way to the final curtain call. The Cornish Caliban was a big ask to accept and take seriously, and I only see the camp and drunk Withnail whenever Richard E. Grant pops up, which makes playing the bad guy a bit more of a challenge in my eyes. Plenty of violence and dismemberment if that floats your boat and a finale that might leave more questions than answers.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Gritty, dark, and everything missing from the rest of the X-Men franchise","Superhero films typically have to go down one of two avenues: colourful and humorous (e.g. Avengers, GotG) or more realistic and tough (e.g. The Dark Knight, Watchmen). Logan opts for the latter, producing a film worthy of Hugh Jackman, an actor typically starved of decent screen roles when playing Wolverine. Previous instalments in the Wolverine franchise have been average to poor, making Logan an important film for multiple reasons (especially given X-Men's loss of ground to the rest of the Marvel universe). By stepping away from the rest of the Marvel universe, the story doesn't become saturated with other characters crowbarred into the plot, giving Wolverine what he deserves.To merge these two themes of darkness and lightheartedness is near-impossible, as pandering to child and adult audiences is more than difficult. Logan does as good a job as can be expected, using humour sparsely without ruining emotional moments that make up the core of the film. Jackman is unshakeable in his titular role, bringing the same intensity he has to the Wolverine role he had for the previous 16 years; this film allowed him to flex his acting muscles slightly more freely, not constrained by superhero films' typically wooden scripts. Patrick Stewart is also excellent as Professor X, reduced to an ambling shell of what he used to be, but ultimately Logan's only friend.The storyline of Logan isn't a world-beater (Wolverine seems to suffer from a lack of decent plots), but for someone who has stuck with the franchise for its duration, it will surely satisfy any hardcore fans. As a standalone, Logan holds itself in higher regard than almost any other superhero film, delivering emotional punches successfully without cheapening scenes using ill-timed humour.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Predictable, weak plot, excuse to end the Wolverine franchise","Hugh Jackman was made for the role of Wolverine, even though he is a tremendous actor in his own right. However this swan song was one of the weakest X-Men film and it suffered from numerous obvious plot holes that made the audience go ""what?"" At the end of the movie, someone in the audience yelled out ""that ending sucked!!!"" and the entire audience laughed heartily - because most did feel that this was a mediocre tearjerker that wasted some great performances and superb CGI.I won't give away too much in this review, just enough for you to set expectations. It sucks when characters do stupid things which you know occur solely to continue the plot. For example, if you know someone is coming after you to kill you and it will be worse then next go round, you don't just let them hang around as if you're just a little careless - especially after a bloodbath. And it happens too often.What was truly terrible about the ending, without giving it away, was that it seemed as though the writers were trying too hard to figure out how to work in the ensemble shot reminiscent of a stage play that Hollywood cannot seem to stop itself from doing. It's phony and ludicrous. And I won't even describe the action, which basically happens throughout the movie. Characters will ""forget"" their abilities to do something smart or dangerous because if they do what you expect, it will ruin the scene from going where the directors want it to go.The other aspect I didn't like about this movie was that Logan's character doesn't really get developed at all. It is manipulated and you'll appreciate what I'm saying when you finally get there. Please... we're all pretty smart. Don't insult our intelligence with yet another breathtaking spectacular moment where you can feel the director just praising himself endlessly for creating an emotional moment that is right up there on par with, oh... the climax of Saving Private Ryan. After taking forever to get to the ending, they rush right through it, as if they blew too much of the budget drawing out the first 2 hours and 10 minutes.It's all watchable although completely unnecessary and milked for one last haul of cash. The young girl is very good but they seem to have kept the mystique for absolutely no reason whatsoever but to... well... make it super mysterious. It's OK but don't expect anything near the 8.4 on the IMDb ratings. This is another X-Men B-Movie, not really worth multiple viewings but something you might catch on cable. Farewell to two of the great actors who graced the screen with some great moments in cinematic history.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A let down,"Logan - Touted as a sci-fi western, it definitely lived up to the moniker. Far-reaching deserts and a minimalist score really set the stage. James Mangold wrote and directed it, but I wish he had put down the pen. Each scene is thoughtfully shot, but it's the story within those shots that left me wanting. The positives for me, beyond the ambiance, were two standout performances by under the radar actors. Stephen Merchant, who is usually in English sitcoms, went way off type with his character. Given his past roles I thought it was an odd casting choice at best, but now I couldn't picture anyone else doing what he did. The other was Boyd Holbrook, who played the main antagonist. The subtle choices he made in line delivery and how he carried himself made him a magnetic presence on screen. The film was much more engaging while they were involved in a scene. And then there are the negatives...As I alluded to earlier, the story was just not there. There's weak motivation throughout for both Wolverine and the villains. The movie creates its own plot holes unnecessarily and leans on tropes and off screen happenings to propel it along. The action scenes are an exercise in redundancy. Slash this guy, stab that guy, try stabbing and slashing this person, now mix it up a bit and slash THEN stab this guy. Once you see the first fight you'll have seen them all. And finally there are the inconsistencies with the special effects. They could create extremely detailed battle damage, but couldn't remove the prominent scar on the forehead of the self- healing girl. They could green screen prosthetic arms for multiple characters, but couldn't remove the reflection of the camera in peoples' sunglasses. These, and other details, while minor, added up quickly. Suffice it to say, this western did anything but ride off into the sunset. 4.5/10.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Re-tiring,"The Wolverine movies did not have much luck. While we got used to Hugh Jackman and his performance will be burned in our heads, the stand-alone movies never really stood out that much. Well that is until Logan came along. And Logan has another member of the X-Men family in it, portrayed by Patrick Stewart in this case. And while Logan/Wolverine does not age, both are retired.A broken down Logan takes care of his former mentor and Professor at the Mutants Academy/school. Especially the Professor has lost a lot of his power (no pun intended). Those two are forced (you could have guessed that even without seeing the trailer) to go on one last road trip. And they have to because of a young girl. And while Logan seems not to care, circumstances do not leave him much choice.There are battles, there is drama and it is one of the best X-Men movies that has been made. There is also a lot of violence. This may be a comic book adaptation, but it certainly does not shy away from the brutality of its source. And this rawness helps it elevate, helps it become even more emotional, in more than one instance. Set in the future this is a good movie to end the Wolverine .... Trilogy",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Different ways to give rise to world,"I admit I was taken aback with this one. I hadn't planned on watching as Wolverine films tend to be a bore to me. Not long into it, I was sure I had missed a previous film, one that would explain for example how Xavier ended up broken and hidden away, how Wolverine has washed up as an alcoholic limo driver.But no this is it apparently, and this is the thing.We can be lowered late at night in the middle of a world that has long now been spun in motion. We can discover as we go. We can catch glimpses of a larger world as we move through it. We don't need to be racing to save the world, making it out of this room alive is enough, wondering and having no idea where to turn to next are fine.None of it is novel, in fact all of them mainstays of 80s film, from Bladerunner to Terminator. But after a glut of samey, mechanized Marvel and X- men movies obsessed with 'universing' a greater story, this one feels welcome and fresh.Another obvious influence here are western films and this probably sheds some light on Wolverine's popularity. So many of the other X-men have awesome abilities to alter the fabric of reality; Wolverine is just a gruff who kicks and punches his way through. It seems there's always going to be a hankering for the simple, uncomplicated guy.So what more obvious choice than to cast him in the light of cowboy? It works but you'll note it's not any cowboy. They could have used Red River as template, or The Searchers. They used Shane. The flawed guy who risks all to ensure there are 'no more guns in the valley' but must ride off again at the end because his kind has no place in the world of loving farmsteads.It's always indicative of a broader sensibility when I see this type being used, the resignation that someone has no place in a changing world and is better off being swept away with the old, this seen as 'honorable' and heroic.But from the little girl (and her friends') point-of- view we have what? A fictional Eden they only knew as stories in a book but their desire for it has inspired an actual one.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
This version of Logan becomes tiresome,"Logan's calling card is his anger and annoyance with just about everyone. Jackman excels in this emotional space. In Logan, he's more 'perpetual grumpy old man"". Just feels unnecessarily forced and for me, zaps most of the energy out of an otherwise enjoyable film for long stretches. The movie itself works on just about every level- though a livelier Charles would have been sweet and one more veteran X-man (extended cameo) would have livened things up a bit. Boyd Holbrook was a pleasure to watch as the antagonist. Secretly hoping Jackman comes back for one more x-men (non-deadpool) full-length film to wrap things up (again) 7 shining stars it is for this one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Hugh Jackman Steals the show,An epic tribute to Hugh Jackmans end of career as wolverine.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Claw Father,"Much like with Thor Ragnarok, there is a lot of hyperbolic praise thrown at Logan, most of which is undeserved.Previous two Wolverine movies were terrible and the bar is very low, one can't help but feel there's some overcompensating at work. Throwing words like ""masterpiece"" is really pushing it. Makes you wonder if these people watch anything other than capesh1t.A year earlier, a Mel Gibson movie called Blood Father came out with a very similar story, minus the mutants. Now, the accusation of outright plagiarism is unfounded, but Logan, let's say ""borrows"" heavily from it.The movie's central theme is a half-baked allegory for growing old and dying, sprinkled with CGI blood. In order to expand on this allegory, the best thing the filmmakers could come up with is for Logan to fight a younger clone of himself. The intent is obvious, but the result is underwhelming and anticlimactic. An honourable if failed attempt to add some depth to a movie about a guy who has retractable claws in his knuckles and who can heal himself almost instantly.The primary antagonist Donald Pierce, played by Boyd Holbrook is the weakest part of the movie, he doesn't have enough screen presence and his performance is forgettable. The director probably didn't want anyone to overshadow Jackman, but a more memorable villain would've added instead of detracted from the storyline.The last hurrah for Hugh Jackman's Wolverine, until Marvel Studios decides they want him to reprise the role.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Easily the best ""X-Men"" Film from Fox","Although definitely not for children or younger audiences, Logan is the culmination of 17 years of cinema and comic movie history that matured with it's original audience and ties things off perfectly.Sad, brutal and well-crafted in all aspects.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Finally,"No punches pulled in this one. All the fat is trimmed from the regular, ensemble X-men, end of the world plots that bogged down previous entries in the franchise. The action is realistic and the characters behave like real people instead of just vehicles for superpowers. The choice to focus on just two of the previous mutants, Logan and Charles, catalyzes the chemistry between them. Above all it celebrates what makes these movies entertaining: they aren't blessed with powers, they're cursed with mutations.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

An Exceptional Send Off For Earth-1 Wolverine,"Rewatched this again before Deadpool and Wolverine and man this truly is still not only my all time favorite X-Men movie but one of my top drama movies of all time. It was just so well scripted and crafted that delivered such a rewarding and fulfilling journey from start to finish. Besides the phenomenal acting from the likes of Jackman and newcomer Dafne Keene, who absolutely gives the likes of Hit Girl from Kickass a run for her money, the entire tale and action set pieces were simply breathtaking to behold. An aging Logan on the verge of drinking himself into a coma has to deal with protecting the last surviving mutants including a dementia ridden Professor X from an organization hell bent on wiping them out once and for all. Along the way he meets up with his clone kin and has to face a younger version of himself that's superior to him in every way while staring down the barrel of his own fading immortality. Logan is a tried and true testament and love letter to the character that manages to give the fans one 'last' ride with the iconic hero that makes him go out with a Wolverine adamantium berserker barrage raging howl and it ends up creating a film with the only version of this character being displayed that you'll ever need thanks to it's hard R rating and expertly crafted screenplay.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Hack, slash, stab, repeat.","Logan certainly delivers in terms of hacking, slashing and stabbing, but the wounded bear routine of the titular character wears pretty thin. Logan is the antihero stock character very much in the brooding, world weary style of John Rambo. The zenith of the cliché occurs when Logan remarks that familiar tortured line: 'Everyone I care about gets hurt'. Jackman does transcend the limitations of his character with moments of raw emotion, but these are few and far between.The rest of the performances are fine, passable; although I would have liked to see Richard E. Grant chew some scenery. If you're going to cast a British baddie, let him go full blown Gary Oldman - what this bleak spectacle sorely needs is some charisma.Alas, the bland characterisation isn't saved by the narrative, which follows a monotonous cat-and-mouse formula that's bereft of any suspense. A viewing of 'No Country For Old Men', a preeminent cat-and-mouse film, will remind you just how tiresomely loud and noisy 'Logan' is.What we have then is a dumb and decidedly average action film with a filter stripped right from Johnny Cash's 'Hurt' video and a litany of brutally repetitive fight scenes.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Resolutions and well done,"I am not a big X-Men fan, but I have seen most of them. Compared to most of what passes for movies these days, they are well done and have good story lines. This one was no exception. Put upon people of any kind tend to just wish it could all go away, and would those a-holes just STOP? Drama galore and violence galore here, in a fairly basic plot, but one fleshed out well.I rated it a 9, and it deserved it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
When is a superhero movie not a superhero movie?,"Logan is a gritty tale of a once great man, now struggling with his existence, angry with his past and tired with the world. It's very different from any previous superhero film that I have seen (although thank you Deadpool for opening the door to 'R-rated' superhero movies). I'm not a huge fan of the X-Men series of films, but this feels like the 'true' version of Wolverine. He's not a superhero, he's just a man who begrudgingly tries to find redemption by helping a young girl find sanctuary.I love the tone of the movie, the cinematography is outstanding, the characters are beautifully written and outstandingly portrayed. The action scenes are phenomenal, although the movie is not dependent on them one bit like other superhero films. The film even managed to give Stephen Merchant a believable, bad-ass action line!8.9 - Everyone should watch this film, superhero and non-superhero fans alike!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

"Dismal, Violent and Sad","In 2029, mutants have been extinct and Logan (Hugh Jackman) works as a limousine chauffeur in Texas near the border with Mexico. Logan lives in an abandoned plant with the mutant Caliban (Stephen Merchant), who was a tracker, and they take care of the senile Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), who does not have control of his telepathic ability and needs to use drugs to stay calm. One day, Logan is attending a funeral and a woman called Gabriela (Elizabeth Rodriguez) call him Wolverine but he does not give attention to her. Soon the bounty hunter Donald Pierce (Boyd Holbrook) meets Logan and asks to help him to find an eleven year-old girl called Laura (Dafne Keen) that is with Gabriela. Logan is contacted again by Gabriela and she asks Logan to drive Laura and her to a place called Eden in North Dakota and she offers to pay for his service. The reluctant Logan accepts the job but Gabriela is murdered. He returns to the place where he lives and finds Laura there with Professor Xavier and Caliban. However Pierce returns with a group and Laura uses abilities similar to Logan to escape with Professor Xavier and Logan, but Caliban is captured by Pierce and his men. While heading to Eden. Logan discovers that Gabriela was a nurse in the Transigen Corporation taking care of children developed with abilities by Dr. Zander Rice (Richard E. Grant). When the Transigen decided to shut down the program and kill the children, Gabriela and the other nurses released them and now Laura intends to join her friends. Will they find the sanctuary?""Logan"" is the swan song of Wolverine and Professor Charles Xavier in a dismal, violent and sad film. The plot is totally different from the genre with a dark story and unpleasant hero. The road trip showing two former superheroes protecting a girl with abilities is not original, but the cruel fate of the family that welcomes them in their home is.

"Great movie, even if you're not an X-Men follower","It is 2029. The X-Men are no more and no mutants have been born in 25 years.

Film Version of The Last of Us,"Riveting, Gory, and Well-ActedHugh Jackman gives a terrific performance and works well with Dafne Keen. Their relationship has heart and care for one another. The action sequences are amazing and from the opening scene you can tell this will be a superhero movie that is not going to hold back on its action sequences. I do wish Wolverine and X-23 could have done more fight scenes together and complemented each other in combat, yet the scenes were still entertaining. From the emotional relationship to the plot and character of wolverine this film had my interest most of the time. This is a great superhero film that is not like most where it has the need relate to other superheros or other films, but instead has its own movie that excels.

"A Milestone in the X-Men story, but not a truly great movie","45 minutes of this movie elapsed before there was any significant attempt at a plot other than the fact that Logan and Xavier were very down and out. During that 45 minutes there was extensive gore and violence including several cases of men stabbed in the head by Logan's claws. There was one scene where the child, Laura, rolls a decapitated head which presumably was a result of her own fighting. I think Logan said either the F word or S word more frequently than any coherent sentence. Since there was no chance this movie would not be R rated, there was also a short flash of women's breasts just so the movie could be labeled as having nudity. (There are cases where producers actually find this advantageous.) Logan repeatedly uses either drugs or alcohol.The movie improves from there. We get some plot to explain where the movie should go next and why. The goal is to try to get Laura to Eden.All the violence and vulgar language continues through the rest of the movie, including at least one blood-spurting decapitation. It also includes the unnecessary killing of a mother and her teen son and then later torture of ""mutant"" children. Even the ""mutant"" children commit extreme acts of gore. I cannot overemphasize how much gore and violence there was.We do learn more about Laura's origins and there are several other significant events that occur that are extremely relevant in the ongoing X-Men story.In the ratings, I see a very high percentages of 10 votes, 9 votes and 8 votes. I have to assume that the people gave those votes did so because of the significance of events that take place in the story and their enjoyment level. This is no where near an all-time classic movie. I don't even rate it among the best of the X-Men saga.The villains were all cliché and overplayed. Hugh Jackman did nothing in the way of credible acting. I don't know if Patrick Stewart was acting like he was feeble or if he is just actually getting old, but even so, not his best performance. For much of the movie Dafne Keen did not speak and tried to look fierce and vicious a lot, which is a little hard for the size of girl she is. Later, she showed some promise, especially with events at the end. Basically, IF there was any acting in this moving, it was done by the children.I still give this a generous rating of 6. This is because after the first 45 minutes the plot became much more interesting.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"A worthy, respectable finale to a storied franchise","Marvel's 'X-Men' universe has come a long way since its debut on the silver screen back in 2000. 17 years later, audiences get to experience 'Logan,' the final chapter in the franchise as we know it.In 'Logan,' we have a much darker, grittier story in which Logan/Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) is faced with helping a young mutant (Dafne Keen) escape the anti-mutant strongholds of Mexico and the USA to Canada. In this sense, the film should not be considered a traditional superhero story, but instead a violent drama. There is much more of an emphasis on character development and dialogue as opposed to special effects and cheesy one-liners, as we see how the physical and emotional wear-and-tear that Logan has experienced over the years has finally taken its toll on him.In addition to Jackman and Keen, we get to see strong performances from Patrick Stewart reprising his role as the venerable Professor Charles Xavier and Boyd Holbrook as the bounty hunter Pierce. This core cast is enough of a foundation on which to build the rest of the film, and is a better way to create a more meaningful film compared with stretching screen time too thin in previous 'X-Men' offerings.There are also a few themes that are explored through 'Logan,' including perseverance, sacrifice and faith, which elevates the impact that the film has on audiences. Through all of these, it's really the metamorphosis that Logan undergoes as an individual based on the challenges he confronts that really puts an accent mark on the film.While it's bittersweet to see this franchise likely end, 'Logan' is a worthy, respectable finale that does enough to satisfy fans.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Amazing,"In the near future, a weary Logan cares for an ailing Professor X in a hide out on the Mexican border. But Logan's attempts to hide from the world and his legacy are up-ended when a young mutant arrives, being pursued by dark forces. Logan is the best X-Men movie ever made so far. It's spectacular but intimate, brutal but human. It has high level performances from both Hugh Jackman and Dafne Keen. Masterfully directed by James Mangold, it's an epic, emotional and violent western full of hope. A must see

"""Not with a bang, but a whimper.""","When I think about superhero movies in general, I just feel sad about how stupid and bold they are. There are lots of incidents, threats and thrills, but in the end, you know what's going to happen. That especially goes for all of the X-Men movies, I just feel pain because of their obvious stupidity.
That's when Logan comes into the place. There is no life ending threat to humanity, there are just Logan and those he loves. I liked how the villain can't be called a proper villain, who is just a younger version of Logan himself. The characters are not hilariously powerful, Logan is old and irritated and his actions are lot less destructive than before. And his greatest villain is himself.

Can't believe this was rated so high,"This is a 7 movie at best. Way too long and the emotions at the end were ridiculous considering the 10 days the characters spent together. I'm not a comic book reader, so I can't really account for he accuracy of that. It was a decent movie that sagged in the middle and had some silly villains. Who cares about the magic border? It still is not deep enough to be compared to the quality superhero TV series, of which there are many. And it loses some of its dramatic heft near the end due to lack of variety (not enough different stuff happening, the same type of events are always recurring).

emotionally it gets it so right that one can mostly look over story flaws,"I have to wonder how people will react to Logan even a year from now, much less years from now, when some of the story flaws in this become more apparent. Some of the things in Logan may seem like nitpicking (how does one drive a bullet-ridden limo through Texas into Oklahoma, for example, without anyone noticing until the minute it's pulled up to the hotel to be uh parked), some things may be sort of griping about the logistics of things (i.e. the comic book of X-Men is a plot element in this movie, like the X-Men comics exist, which would be a clever meta moment if it wasn't in the midst of the one of the darkest comic book movies ever made), and there are other beats that just have to do with how quickly (or, really, not) the villains don't catch up with our trio of main characters, Logan, Xavier and Julia, even when they literally have the coordinates to get to them. Not to mention some things in the last third of the movie that make things while not necessarily less violent or intense, a little more standard as a comic book movie, certainly as it's the 10th film in 17 years with an X-Men character from Fox.All of this noted... this movie is really good. The reason for that is James Mangold, the director, taking a second (ahem, sorry, I can't resist) stab at this character and as it's the end he takes almost a rough R-rated Clint Eastwood 70's Peckinpah spaghetti-ish western approach to it all. And this is an BIG R rating, so parents take note, if you don't care about your kids hearing ""F"" and ""S"" words (and there's a lot of them, it's not like this got the rating for going over the 1 or 2 time minimum of PG-13 movies), then you might care about the various dismemberments, beheadings, stabs through the head, repeated stabbings *from children* onto nameless bad guys. Or maybe that won't be an issue either; in that case this is a dark tragic western for the whole family about a mutant who is slowly dying from adamantium poisoning driving his 90 year old dementia-ish father figure with a little girl so they can find a possible Eden. If one feels a Children of Men vibe too I wouldn't say that was unintentional.But alongside Mangold's commitment to going for something we haven't seen before, what matters most in these movies to me more than the plot or stories more-often - the interactions of the characters, the emotional weight, how characters do (or don't) grow since, you know, once an a-hole always an a-hole - that works spectacularly. This is maybe the most deeply felt of the X-Men films, or at least as close as Days of Future Past was, as far as showing us how these characters are in great pain and danger and grappling with things, but we also get to see more dimension than before. With Xavier, for example, a lot of time in past movies (certainly the first three) while played by an actor with gravitas like Stewart, he was an exposition machine. Here, Xavier gets to show anger, resentment, sadness, pain, misery, confusion (genuinely, remember he's 90 here), and even a moment where he gets to help a farmer coral his horses (it's a minor but important one). And damn if Stewart doesn't deliver the goods; I can praise Jackman high as he does deserve it, and the young newcomer playing the mutant Julia is incredible (mostly in how she listens and her subtle moments in silences), this is Oscar-worthy s*** from Stewart.So I think if you have really enjoyed most over the years how the actors and characters have interacted the most, regardless (or regardful) of how it strays from the comics (a touch that gets commented on here, for better or worse), Logan gives that score with moving fashion. If you are interested in a coherent story, that's here too... up to a point. It's a good send off for these characters.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Wolverine and the Little Girl...,"Marvel was smart enough to market this as a coming together of two fascinating entities: Wolverine and a pretty little girl mutant. But what they failed to tell us, sadly, was that the story was going to take a tragically ill advised left turn later on, until the refreshingly simple concept of grizzled, battle weary Logan and his pretty little companion wound up in some Mad Max looking alternate world, where too many annoying, dull characters were wandered into the story and brought the whole production down a level. This had its moments, mostly from the concept alone, Wolverine and The Little Girl, but ultimately, it was a promise left frustratingly undelivered.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Logan - First Non-Superhero Movie Featuring a Superhero.,"Logan unlike most movies featuring superheroes and villains; unlike movies from Marvel Studios, Logan takes itself seriously and at every moment, with perhaps one of the most serious tone not just among superhero movies, but cinematography in general. Logan tells a gripping, yet depressing tale about the fall of the X-Men and Logan's attempt to adjust to the world around him. The movie does not glorify superheroes, but in fact portrays the world as it is; grim, evil and oppressing. Whereas most superhero movies contain the general, hero's journey plot, with a more positive tone (sometimes to the point of absurdity), Logan disregards the common tropes, breaking most of the rules common to superhero movies, and it does so with great success.
Truthfully, Logan cannot and shall not be deemed as ""a superhero movie"", as the focus of it lies not in the superpowers of the main character or the collaboration between characters in flashy costumes and red capes (yes, The Avengers, I'm taking about you) to achieve a common goal of defeating the typical bad guy. Instead, focus lies in such aspects as visual storytelling, strong character development and realistic relationships, as well as realistic portrayal of the world.
In a few words, without spoiling the plot, Logan is mainly about a broken man, oppressed and persecuted by the world around him and about his transformation from a broody, ruined Logan, into a respectable and caring person, showing that even the most broken of people have a bright side to them. Fortunately, that is where the lighthearted tone ends, as the movie quickly transforms into the gripping, grim tale it is. The R rating given to this movie only supports the point it is trying to make, and is not for the faintest of heart.
Logan's realistic portrayal of the world we live in as well as Logan himself sets this movie apart from many movies I have seen, and especially its superhero ""competition"". There is enjoyment to be found for both dedicated fans and casual viewers, although I strongly recommend viewing every movie in the X-Men universe before viewing this, as this movie marks an end to the series (so far), at least timeline wise, as it is Hugh Jackman's very last performance as Logan, and the movie thus acts as a perfect and fitting closure for his long, developed story. While X-Men fans will enjoy the movie more, casual viewers will find it enjoyable too due to the fact that the story is self-contained and sparsely based on and related to previous films, making the story quite easy to understand and follow, without prior exposure to the X-Men universe.
Overall, this is a great movie about a realistic depiction of the world around us and how even the most broken people can redeem themselves. This movie gets 8 out of 10 starts from me, which places it in the 250 best movies of all time, and that is an achievement to be proud of. It does not get higher rating because although however great it is, it isn't the greatest movie of all time and cannot and shall not be compared to the likes of The Godfather or The Shawshank Redemption, arguably two of the best movies of all time. Either way, 8 stars is an appropriate rating for this movie and I strongly recommend it to both hardcore fans and casual viewers.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A mature comic book movie,This is James Mangolds second take on the wolverine character and it's brilliant. Mangold took inspiration from the old man Logan comic and nailed it on the screen. This is not your typical super-hero movie with the world destroying threat but a story about human struggles and personal stakes which made it feel real. A story about a man that has been represented as a animal who now is at a point where he just want to live in peace. It's a mature comic book. This movie has fantastic quiet moments that braces the sympathy each character has for each other. Logan now the only student left to take care of the professor that now suffers from Alzheimers that gives Charles and Logan a harsh relationship.

Not bad for a superhero film,"I usually can't stand modern superhero films, the only exception being parts of Nolan's Batman series. But the mood of the first half of ""Logan"" is quite reminiscent of Nolan's work, as it brings a realism and humanity to these familiar, fantastic characters. There's something fascinating about an old, broken down Wolverine limping around half-drunk. Maybe I'm strange, but I almost wish the entire movie was just like the beginning: documenting the uninspiring life of washed up superheros. However, they just couldn't help themselves and the film's final act devolves into the typical kind of nonsense I've come to expect from Marvel movies. It almost seems like a different film at the end from the one that started.I can't help but feel this was a missed opportunity to make a true statement and break the mould of superhero movies (a rare thing indeed in today's world of movies by corporate committee). While ""Logan"" is entertaining and certainly worth watching, I was reminded of the 2016 film ""Midnight Special,"" which also features a strange young child on the run, and perhaps does a better job of it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
100 percent Wolverine,"If you look at the X-Men series, 'Logan' stands out very clearly from its predecessors. It's more brutal, more melancholic, and confines itself to the essentials.You realize relatively quickly in which world Logan lives, in a harsh, doomed world. The excesses of violence serve as a deliberate stylistic device to show what it's really like to fight for survival. Logan himself says that reality is not comparable to what is shown in comics.There are occasional references to comics in the film. Of course, this is fanservice in a way, but I found it very fitting and helped to show this contrast between the ideal superhero world and the harsh reality.The slow narrative pace, the dreary world, the dialogues and emotions reduced to a minimum can unfold their effect on the viewer. In terms of genre, the movie is reminiscent of a modern western in many places. Logan has never been known for his emotional outbursts or witty humor. He has now come to terms with the fact that his life is different from that of ""normal"" people. He's used up and that's exactly what you notice from the first minute.'Logan' represents a worthy end for Wolverine, or for Hugh Jackman in his parade role. I can't imagine, in the best sense of the word, that there will be an actor in the future who can embody this role better.'Logan' is, for me, one of the best superhero movies out there.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Let the new game begin!,"Logan is one of the warmest superhero movies I have seen. James Mangold, who is known for extracting some really heartwarming movies like CopLand (Sylvestor Stallone's finest performance), Girl,Interrupted (Angelina Jolie won an Oscar) & Walk The Line (Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon give outstanding performances) and also thrillers like Identity (mind boggling thriller), 3:10 to Yuma (remake of a classic western) & Knight and Day (Tom Cruise all the way), makes a movie that possesses both these qualities in equal proportion. It seems that the 'blue potion' helps unleash the Wolverine out of Logan giving us one of the most dynamic characters in the Marvel series.Logan is about this junkie cab driver whose past does not seem to let him go. The movie LOGAN shows us how sometimes even a super hero has to deal with his inner demon. The movie revolves around the impeccable character Wolverine and his undefined love for Professor X and the new mutant Laura (Dafne Keen). The chemistry between Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart is to die for making this superhero franchise a more human touch.  The movie in many parts is inspired by one of the classiest Western movie ""SHANE"" (A highly recommended movie by Chapter 8). Much like Shane, this movie also defines the untold duties of a man and his quest to differentiate between right and righteous. The new mutant played by Dafne Keen has risen hopes for all the fans and to look forward for the next X-Men movie.Hugh Jackman has really molded the character of Wolverine as per his convenience and it is difficult to see any other actor play this 'lone wolf'. The story focuses more on the next generation mutants who look out for Logan as the guiding force. The action sequences are spot on, and it is the claws that bring out the real wolf in Wolverine. The best part was the director's little references to X-Men comics and when the cross becomes the 'X' symbolizing X-Men at the end of the story.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Wow.,"For over 30 years, the X-Men have been the concept, fictional characters, stories, genre IP, or whatever you want to call it, closest to my heart and my soul.When the first two films came out, I was in awe that they had gotten so close, as close as I could ever expect, to bringing them to life onscreen. Time and comparisons of what has come since have not been kind. The series has had its ups and downs. And they had to start somewhere in creating a universe with a diverse cast of characters and rich storytelling history. But they will always have a special place in my heart.The series had gotten to the point where I haven't even seen the last 3? 4? 6? in a theater upon release.That includes ""Logan."" I'd heard it was good, but I never felt an urgency (or even an urge) to make it a priority to watch, even as I caught up with the other ones. I've been waiting for like 2 years for it to leave FX so I could watch it without commercials. I got over it and watched it on FXNow this weekend, which somehow I still have access to through the cable company even though I don't pay for the TV side?Anyway, I'm glad I waited. Waited for Fox to finish mangling the franchise into whatever b*st*rdized and bowdlerized nonsense they could imagine.This serves as the most fitting capstone and epitaph to the film franchise. Not so much as it was, but for what it could and should have been in more capable, caring, careful hands.And damn, it is a great film. As a film, it may be the greatest single comic ""adaptation"". Including ""The Dark Knight"" which I have always felt is overrated (outside of Heath Ledger's performance). It's not the most satisfying, the most fun, most exciting. But as a film, it takes you exactly where it wants you to go, without any flaws.It made me emotional, obviously, or I wouldn't have written all this for an almost 4 year old movie. And that's not anything new for me and comic book movies. But it made me emotional in ways that none of the others have. Not at the wonder of finally seeing all this on screen. But through the pathos put on screen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Succeeds because it makes you care, and gives the viewer grit and consequences","This film has had a lot of praise, and I think most of it is deserved. However there is an element where comic book movies generally are not consistently interesting or engaging enough, so whenever one comes along that offers a bit more then we go for it; certainly I know I have enjoyed some of them more than they probably warranted on this basis. With Logan it is that there are consistent touches of maturity, character, and plotting which make it something that I actually cared about. There was scope for much more of this, and it was a shame the characters did not have more quiet moments in between the violence, but there were enough to make us feel for the characters and their relationships.I am not sure that the father/daughter side of things plays out as impacting as it could have, but certainly the relationship between Logan and Xavier is rewarding in its moments. These elements add to a feeling of grit, hopelessness, and grind, which the characters fit and the film embraces. I particularly enjoyed the consequences, the action had heft and impact and major characters suffer and die as it goes ahead. I will borrow a line from another commenter and say that the action scenes are justified or ""earned"" by this base, because they don't just feel like mindless spectacle (even if they are very well done).While Logan is not as good as the high praise suggests, it does offer a lot of darkness, character, violence, engagement, and entertainment – very much worth seeing and it does stand above what the majority of this genre is doing.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

More of the same while trying to do an Eastwood flick,"James Mangold and Hugh Jackman teamed up to make a different Wolverine movie: more serious, inspired by westerns, in which our hero has to deal with mortality and regret, while being on the lam with a girl. That movie was called ""The Wolverine"". For ""Logan"" they decided to do something bold and different by... doing exactly the same, while adding nothing to Wolverine's story, except an ending. Okay, this time the girl is a child with special powers (you know from the trailer and the DVD jacket that she is connected to Wolverine; I won't spoil details), which makes the plot go exactly in the same beats as as every adult-with-child-on-the-lam flick, from ""Escape to Witch Mountain"" and ""Firestarter"" to ""Midnight Special"". The villains in their vans and helicopters behave like all those on-the-lam villains who somehow always arrive quickly to wherever the protagonists are, even at times when there's no plausible reason. Innocent people are befriended on the way, and pay a price.But yes, it is well shot, with well directed action, some style, and good performances. Back in the 80s, ""X-Men"" fans were campaigning for a movie to be made, with Clint Eastwood a fan favorite choice as Wolverine. Thus it is perhaps no surprise that style-wise and plot-wise, ""Logan"" behaves like if Clint Eastwood had made it, taking inspiration from multiple Eastwood flicks: ""Pale Rider"", ""Unforgiven"", ""A Perfect World"", and even small shades of ""Gran Torino"" and ""Million Dollar Baby"". It also references some classic anti-Westerns of the 1950s, going as far as including a ""Shane"" homage. All of this it pulls off well, but you do feel like you've seen this too many times before.""Logan"" also pretends to be a ""Mad Max""-like dystopian movie, but then it turns out that they're just in the US-Mexico border, and other than the lack of new mutants, the world looks exactly like the 2010s, despite it being 2029 or so. In fact, there's been no change to every day technology, including cars, cell phones and TVs. Only the villains seem to possess advanced technology, in the shape of cybernetic arms and advanced cloning abilities. The villains (The Reavers) are unimpressive, with the most powerful one being a metaphor of Wolverine's aging issues. And no, Nathaniel Essex is not in this movie, despite how it was promoted. Boyd Holbrook plays Pierce as a cunning dangerous redneck, somewhat of a cross between Gary Oldman and Woody Harrelson, but less strong.The story does not do us any service. Aside from the standard plot themes for this sub-genre of 'grumpy dying hero reluctantly takes on a child and goes on the lam', there's little added to the story. We learn of a grim fate of a half-dozen unnamed X-Men, but have no clue what happened to the dozens of other characters. We are left wondering how Wolverine suddenly started aging rapidly, with no good explanation given, or to how/when he retreated to a menial existence. We also wonder how Professor X turned into a babbling fool, other than dementia at age 90. Jackman and Stewart turn in great performances, even if Stewart's character bares only little resemblance to his prior incarnations. Perhaps you can justify it with how dementia changes some great people.What is different from the usual ""X-Men"" movies is the violent gore and the cursing. It shocks at first, then feels repetitive/gratuitous or over-the-top. I will say that the fight scenes are more effective, and overall in ""Logan"" the violence straddles a thin line between action and terror.Saving the film overall is the good chemistry between the leads, the acting, and the fact that you are watching Wolverine in action on the big screen.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

"Logan Is A Dramatic Action Masterpiece, Not Just Another Superhero Entry","Back in 2016 a special film called Deadpool came out and wowed audiences due to its overall success, considering it was Rated R. I just need to take a moment and thank Deadpool for existing because if Deadpool didn't exist then Logan most likely would've never been made the way it was. Logan to me is a very special film. The hugest praise I can give this film is that it doesn't feel like a comic book superhero movie. Don't get me wrong I love comic book superhero movies, but we're at a time where some of these comic book movies are getting tiring and too familiar. Logan to me is secretly an extremely emotional and serious drama with bits of exceptional action. It is so nice to finally get an extremely dark and serious comic book movie, that treats it's overall product masterfully. Now I don't think Logan by any means, is a perfect film. I have now seen the film twice, opening night and a week after, and I do have to conclude factually, that it has a couple of knit-picky flaws. For the most part though, I think all these insignificant flaws are outweighed by all the positives in this film for sure. In conclusion, the two viewings of Logan have officially confirmed to me that this movie might just be my favorite Marvel film. Hugh Jackman's performance in Logan, is by far his best portrayal as Wolverine. It's quite intriguing to learn about and get behind the character as an older and weaker person. Patrick Stewart's performance as Charles Xavier also, is by far his best portrayal to the character. The new young actress in the film who plays Laura, Dafne Keen, was incredibly good in this film. Normally I get nervous when kid actors or actresses play huge roles in films because, typically they're never really good, but Dafne Keen's commitment to Laura's character is outstanding. These three characters are so grounded and so well developed, through the entirety of the film, to the point where it feels real. A lot of people have been calling Logan, ""The Dark Knight"" of the Marvel entries, and it most definitely deserves the title, because its by far the most realistic and serious Marvel film yet, and has some near Oscar-worthy performances. The only flaw I due have with this film is one character in particular played by Boyd Holbrook, who is a great Actor; I loved his work in Narcos. He plays the main villain in this film, and for me he came off as a little too over the top and cliché. For one, since his character acts sometimes silly in a couple of scenes, it kind of takes you out of the all-so realistic world the film Logan has developed. His character also takes kind of that MCU villain route, where the villain is always trying to be funny like Loki, and I didn't buy it too much in a couple of scenes with him. With that being said, his character wasn't terrible or anything, I just think he could've been improved upon. I think that just might be my only solid flaw with Logan. Everything else in this film works so well, and is crafted with such care and commitment. Now, the action in the film is freakin' crazy. It is all-over-the-place gore splats, slicing people, bodies flying everywhere violent. From a X-Men standpoint its probably the best action that has ever been done in an X-Men film so far. The choreography for every actors and actresses fight scenes where done professionally. I was worried that the character Laura's action scenes in the film would look fake, since she is a little girl doing action scenes. To my surprise it all looked significantly real, which is to be praised for. This review is spoiler-free and I can't get too into details about the synopsis of the film but all you really need to know is that, going into this film, expect a satisfying, action, drama. Don't go into this film expecting another Days of Future Past, or a Civil War, or even a Dark Knight-like film. because Logan is able to stand on its own so well just like Deadpool was able to do. Like I said, Logan is my favorite Marvel movie ever made so far, and I'm going to give it a grade letter of an ""A"" and a IMDb score of a 10/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

"The Wolverine film we've been waiting for, just don't take the kids","Since his debut on screen in 2000's X-Men, grizzled mutant Logan aka Wolverine became a fan favourite, the poster boy for the then budding new series and a career defining role for Australia's very own favourite son Hugh Jackman.A lot has changed since that memorable debut in Bryan Singer's well-liked comic book hit, for Wolverine as a character, most of that revolves around a lot of crumby cameos and forgettable solo adventures but proving once and for all that good things come to those that wait, Jackman and his The Wolverine director James Mangold have decided enough was enough and finally given the many fans of the clawed mutant the film they've been calling out for.Logan, a downright glum and violent affair is very far from the ""perfect"" film but considering where this character has come from and where it seemed like he was likely to stay, Mangold's film is one worthy of the name and this Western inspired road trip provides a sense of closure when it comes to the Wolverine name, in that we can finally say Jackman did all he could with this creation that gave birth to his enjoyable international career.A film that ends up being slightly too long in the claw, Logan is 130 minutes of dust covered, blood strewn and anti-children's entertainment that leverages Marvel's new found ""older"" audience targeting that did them so well with Deadpool and their Netflix events, as a now withered and old Logan is trying to live a quiet life as a driver for hire whilst supporting an ailing Professor X only to be thrown headfirst into a violent battle to protect mutant child Laura who acts as a surrogate daughter to the bearded ex-hero.This set-up allows Mangold and Jackman to explore Logan on a deeper level, as the near suicidal man struggles to find meaning behind his sombre existence and Jackman delivers his best turn yet as the character while many fanboys will appreciate the time he gets to spend with Professor X (who I would argue gets too much screen time uttering Logan's name on repeat for the majority) and it's a chance to finally see the famed mutant act out some seriously impressive carnage.The action in Logan is where the film truly shines and from the film's opening minutes you're acutely aware that this is not a film you'll be watching with the younger members of your family.Limbs are lopped, chopped, sliced and diced and Mangold isn't afraid to linger on the killing that sometimes needs to be done and for all those years we've endured rather forgettable Wolverine fight scenes, Logan certainly does more than enough to make up for this.With action a high point of the film, Logan's not so amazing moments come from a story that starts to drag come the final stretches and with a finale that will be far from many people's memories come a few months' time, it feels as though Logan wasn't entirely sure of itself when it came to delivering the goods come the films conclusion.It's nice to see Marvel shy away from ""city destruction"" and an evil villain that just wants to take over the world but you can't help but feel the earlier beginnings of Logan signposted a far more ""epic"" final act, not one with a bunch of children running around a forest and a bottle of peptides.A fine final outing for Jackman and his Wolverine to be a part of, Logan is without doubt the best solo Wolverine adventure and easily one of the best X-Men orientated feature films that draws out Jackman's best performance in some time and introduces us to newcomer Dafne Keen, who does a great job in her portrayal of Laura.There's nothing truly ground-breaking here but it's certainly refreshing to see Marvel willing to keep expanding their horizons and deliver different takes on stories and characters that have flooded our cinema screens for nearly two decades and while this overlong trip is lacking a little in the emotional stakes and features a few to many corny circumstances, it's unlikely the images of Logan enacting out his sweet form of justice will be forgotten anytime soon.3 ½ bowls of cornflakes out of 5",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Great sendoff,A great way for Hugh Jackman to say goodbye to this character.

What the X-Men franchise should have always been,"I decided December would be X-Men month. Watching the films in chronological order so I understood the storyline. In comparison to the avengers storyline, X-Men barely seemed worth making, the concept is solid, but the end product lacked in almost all accounts, 2d characters, bad villains, poor pacing,And bad writing. I would have probably placed the X-Men franchise around 4.5/10.
Then I watched Logan. Had every other x-men film been created to the same standard as Logan (exceptions being the Deadpool series), avengers would have a serious contender.
From the outset the grittier violence level, darker tones and lack of silly outfits sets this apart immediately. Picking out a small cast of remaining mutants only helps as it finally gives the audience time to develop a relationship with the X-Men, understand their flaws, and garnish them with a sense of humour, something the franchise has been lacking dearly in its overwhelming pursuit of seriousness.
Stripping back the X-Men, and removing much of the technology, vast casts, and grandeur did Logan a world of good. The improved writing really allowed Hugh Jackman to shine, well beyond what I thought he was capable of, and despite sharing the screen with Patrick Stewart, he really held his own, as did Dafne Keen.
Keen really did shine bright here, despite. Being mute for most the film she still managed to feed us with enough character.
This is a brilliant film, I can understand where my fellow reviewers are coming from but I think many of them are wrong to be overly critical. This was an outstanding addition to the franchise. Void of all the previous X-Men failings. It should have always been gritty and well thought from the very beginning.8/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Logan - The Best of the Wolverine films?,"2016's Deadpool opened the door for a more gritty super hero film. With Logan, we get the Wolverine fans have always wanted to see. The violence and the language are turned up, rounding the character out very nicely... in a way. What this film lacks though is true heart. Newcomer Dafne Keen is lovable and highly watchable as Laura. Patrick Stewart brings a sad but tender Professor Charles Xavier. But with Logan himself, the detachment and the coldness are almost unbearable. He just seems... bothered by the whole affair. While retiring to the quiet life would be everyone's dream, you just don't get that when you're a mutant with metal claws and healing powers. We never see the true hero Logan has been and could be again. Overall, this reviewer enjoyed the film, but found it too depressing an end to Hugh Jackman's portrayal of the Wolverine.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Drastically overrated,"'Logan' is a drastically overrated. There is so much wrong with it, that I feel even giving it six stars might be too generous. I've seen it twice, a couple of years apart, just to ensure that it wasn't a mood thing that affected my judgment the first time round. And lo, all the misgivings I had were still there, plain to see. I could write a long winded review why I think this is, but after watching the film again, I found a page on 'Screen Rant' enumerating '15 reasons Logan is overrated', and it comprehensively lays out all of the problems I had with it better than I could explain here, from bad writing, poor use of characters familiar and new, and much, much more. I'm amazed at how both critics and audiences have swooned over this movie. I really wanted to enjoy it, but in a nutshell, it's all quite vapid and boring. Personally, I much preferred the previous film, 'The Wolverine', also directed by James Mangold.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

"A Gritty, Emotional Farewell to an Iconic Character","""Logan,"" released in 2017, is not just another installment in the X-Men franchise. It's a raw, gritty, and deeply emotional exploration of the iconic Wolverine character, brilliantly portrayed by Hugh Jackman in what has been billed as his final appearance in the role. Directed by James Mangold, ""Logan"" pushes the boundaries of the superhero genre, delivering a film that is as much a poignant drama as it is an action-packed adventure.Set in a dystopian near-future, ""Logan"" sees an aged, weary Wolverine caring for a debilitated Professor X, played by Patrick Stewart. When a young mutant named Laura (Dafne Keen) enters their lives, they're forced on a cross-country journey that feels more akin to a classic western than a traditional superhero film.Jackman delivers a career-best performance in his farewell to the character he's embodied for nearly two decades. His Wolverine is worn down, haunted, and deeply vulnerable, yet still capable of intense ferocity. Jackman brilliantly navigates this complex emotional terrain, creating a deeply human character whose struggle with his past and fear of his future resonate profoundly.Stewart, too, delivers an exceptional performance as Professor X. His portrayal of a man grappling with a formidable brain disorder while still trying to mentor Logan and protect Laura is moving and nuanced. The relationship between Logan and Professor X is richly drawn, revealing new dimensions to these familiar characters.Newcomer Dafne Keen is a revelation as Laura. Her performance is fierce and touching, offering a fitting counterpart to Jackman's Wolverine. Her interactions with Jackman are among the movie's highlights, providing a unique father-daughter dynamic that's rarely seen in superhero films.Visually, ""Logan"" is a departure from its glossy, CGI-laden counterparts. The film's grounded cinematography and real-world settings add to the gritty realism that sets it apart. The action sequences, while brutal and visceral, never feel gratuitous. Each blow, each battle, feels deeply personal and consequential, adding to the overall emotional impact.The script, co-written by Mangold, tackles themes of loss, redemption, and the harsh cost of violence. There's an undercurrent of melancholy that runs throughout the film, amplified by the stripped-down, soulful score by Marco Beltrami.""Logan"" is a testament to the depth and richness that can be achieved within the superhero genre. It's a deeply affecting, character-driven piece that offers a fitting farewell to Hugh Jackman's Wolverine. With its superb performances, thoughtful narrative, and visceral action, ""Logan"" is a standout entry in the X-Men franchise and a bold, unforgettable piece of cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Fantastic,"Probably the only Marvel movie Fox actually nailed.

Why is this not higher,"For a Wolverine film that serves as the ultimate conclusion for the character arc and one that is not only emotionally gripping but action-packed, it feels as though this doesn't get the same sort of respect as say The Dark Knight. It's a shame because I think this is one of the greatest superhero films of all time, and it deserves to be closer to the upper eights or a nine. Trying my best to avoid spoilers, it's as close to a gritty comic book movie as you can get, with the creative freedom of a r rating that allows it to feel as such. That's why to me, it exceeds in areas where superhero movies that are restricted to showing less graphic and less poignant scenes. It's raw, in the rawest sense of the word.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Not bad, but not as amazing as they say","This film tells the story of a world many years later, when Wolverine has already given up on himself and turns to alcohol. He has to take care of Professor Xavier and earn a living by driving a limousine, until the day when he meets a woman with a young girl pleading for his help.""Logan"" is certainly different from any other X Men related films, because it does not show much supernatural abilities. It is a bloody kill fest, showing a very downbeat and almost hopeless side of a former superhero. The story is quite slow in the first half, and actually the second half as well. I keep thinking that the film should be ending, but it just keeps going on and on. The change in the girl's behaviour at the end is quite annoying, as she should really have acted like that right in the first place, rather than saving it until so late. Is she doing that just for comic effect? I don't know, but it turns out to be annoying to me.If it was not for the spectacular performance of the girl, who looks calm, cool and ruthless all at once, the film would have been rather lackluster. I unfortunately have to conclude that it is not as amazing as they say.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"""So that's what is feels like . . .""","For better or worse ""Logan"" does not follow this all-too-overused cookie cutter template that most superhero movies use. ""Logan"" does not lack from comic relief—Patrick Stewart is comic gold—or from over the top action scenes. Director James Mangold permeates the story with action: car chases, loads of bullets, and a few choice decapitations. But, it feels significantly more reserved than his others work in this universe ""The Wolverine.""Fashioned much more like an old-fashioned western like ""True Grit,"" the baddies feel more like a throwaway sorry Boyd Holbrook, but the villain is the environment itself. Hugh Jackman's quote, ""Nature made me a freak, man made me a weapon, and God made it last too long,"" permeates the viewer with a deep sense of the pain. ""Logan"" is a story about regaining that humanity by fighting for what is right, albeit this fight is forced upon him when encountered with child female clone of himself. Dafne Keen's Laura character (X-23!!!) is arguably the most enjoyable performance in this film despite having very few lines or even screen time. Jackman's capability as an actor is apparent, often evoking an emotional response that continues to gnaw at you long after you leave the theater. If you are able to gloss over the few continuity issues (how does she reach the pedals?!) or the plot holes (you seriously want me to believe that all the x-men are gone because of GMO corn?), ""Logan"" is a very enjoyable movie. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Grim entry into the Wolverine saga: a big improvement over its two antecedents,"'Logan' continues the darkening trend in 'super-hero' movies, and being rated ""R"", was allowed to be gruesome in addition to being grim and dark. The plot is pretty thin: essentially 'Logan' is a 'bonding-during-a-road-trip' movie back-dropped by the X-Men mythos. The storyline allows Hugh Jackson and Patrick Stewart to showcase their acting abilities (a big step up for both from the 2D comic book characters they played in other entries in the franchise). There are a number of plot holes and inconsistencies, but that's nothing new for the genre and, all in all, the story is interesting and (spoilers hinted at) its position in the overall X-man/Wolverine story-arc allows outcomes not possible in earlier chapters. Probably as close to that oxymoron ""an adult-superhero movie"" as I've seen (other than the much superior ""The Dark Knight""). A bit slow at times but generally watchable: not as great as some reviewers gush but a lot better than many of the entries in the Marvel (or DC) film-verse",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Arguably the Best Superhero Movie Ever Made,"To say this movie is Extraordinary is an understatement. This is not only the best film in the X-Men franchise, but this is possibly the best Comic Book film ever made.This film tells the story of a now aging Wolverine, who in this is but a shell of who he used to be. He aides a very decrepit Charles Xavier who is also in the same boat. Event's happen prior to the film that made these two just done with life. Their tired, there bitter, and want it all to end. Until they meet a girl named Laura, who's not so different from Wolverine, and gives them a chance of hoping in something bigger than themselves.Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, Stephan Merchant, Dafne Keen, Boyd Holbrook, all of them give it there all, and together made this movie such a powerful watch. Shoutout to Dafne Keen who really held her own with people like Jackman and Stewart.And the Action, oh my word...ITS SO BRUTAL!!! It is R RATED to the max! There are limbs chopped off, people stabbed, Heads Sliced off, you guessed it. It fits the mold of this movie so freaking well. This is the most brutal Wolverine has been, and that's the way it should be.The Score fits as well. For being a more serious Comic Book film, the music did a great job with capturing the overall feeling of what Logan was going. Sometimes being very intimate, sometimes being Very Furious.I can tell you one thing about this film that I think everybody can agree on, Hugh Jackman gave it his all, and didn't apologize for it. I know We'll get him as Wolverine Once more in DP 3, but it will be Impossible for any other film to capture that kind of gravitas ever again. Well James Mangold, and well done Hugh.

An astonishingly excellent film.,"I saw this in theater, but after watching it again for the tenth time, I felt compelled to write a review for this phenomenal film. Logan is proof that the superhero genre is not stagnant and can work on so many levels. Prime's The Boys (2019) and the Deadpool films where further proof of that.Logan pulls no punches with it's hard R rating. The level of violence is staggering, yet not gratuitous. These characters live in a bleak and harsh world that barely gives you time to breath. James Mangold steps his (and the genres) game up after the mediocre The Wolverine (2013) with such a superbly crafted film, that I personally expect nothing less from him for the rest of his already very impressive career.Dafne Keen's breakthrough performance is comparible to Natalie Portman in The Professional (1994).

The Greatest X-Men film ever.,"The theme of the film is quickly revealed from the very first scene that it's not like any of the previous X-Men movie as the R rating appears from the very first second and it actually introduced the X-Men universe to the reality dimension.
Acting :⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Everyone in this film was giving another level of performance that we weren't used to from the very same characters. Hugh Jackman did the best performance as Logan in his 17 year long performance and his best performance since his Oscar-nominated performance. The amount of pain and suffer that Logan and Charles went through over the years was expressed by Hugh and Sir. Patrick were priceless and their expressions could deliver a flow of mixed emotions that would hit every X-Men fan right in the heart.
Making her debut as X-23, the wonderful child Dafne Keen gave one of the most strong child performances ever that blow our mind and we wouldn't ask for a better representation for this character.
Score : ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
By Marco Beltrami (who is also the composer of A Quiet place I and II) gave an intense, thrilling and powerful score that added to the greatness of each scene that will make you on the edge of the seat most of the time. The kind of soundtrack that gives you chills.
Cinematography : ⭐⭐⭐⭐½
By John Mathieson (who is also the cinematographer of Gladiator) was brilliant!! It makes you feel like you are right in the action especially the cars chasing scenes and the camera movements during it. Also the wide shots ( as in photo no. 4) was artistic as it could be. The lightning at some shots was just perfect making the shots at some points as a beautiful painting. The only flaw it had was the decision to shoot some fight scenes (especially the last one) in a single shot to emphasize the brutality and violence in them which the CGI didn't help in.
VFX : ⭐⭐⭐⭐
The visual effects were great but had obvious flops at critical points of the movie especially the last fight scene which was the grand finale of the whole movie which only the brutality, excitement and shock could save.
The plot : ⭐⭐⭐⭐½
The story is for sure strong and unique from the other X-Men films and the best among them. It's only enough that it introduced us to a new aspect of the whole X-Men universe and it's quite shocking and powerful events that just won't let you move your eyes of the screen, but it was quite predictable for how it's going to end and sometimes brought exaggerated violence which was at points unnecessary to keep us attracted.
Direction : ⭐⭐⭐⭐½
By the one and only James Mangold, who saved this franchise after the huge flop and disappointment the 1st film gave us. He made us worry whether this film is going to give Wolverine the ending he deserves or not especially that the 2nd film had mixed reactions but he did give us just the movie we were hoping for and even exceeded our expectations at certain points. Every shot of this film is well studied and artistic as it could possibly be creating the great atmosphere and the beauty that comes out of this brutal world making it an immortal film and one of the all time great. A great Job indeed.
A movie that will make you excited, entertained, cry and smile. One hell of a journey it has been.
Logan (2017) : ⭐⭐⭐⭐½

Nowhere near Dark Knight,"It is a good movie with lots of violence and a lot more emotions than usual, more emphasis is given to family love. I think the violence could have been curbed a bit rather than repeating similar chopping sequences over and over again.The acting is excellent, however, story is lacking and thus fails to keep a natural flow; The scenes seem to have been forcefully stitched together. The villain is unfortunately, a result of lazy writing.I liked the earlier X-Men movies a lot more such as Days of the Future past or First Class. A lot of drag in this movie, so much that I wanted to leave 15 mins before the end while watching this in IMAX.Overall it is not a bad movie and would have given it 7.5 if I could but definitely not 8.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Great decision to make it rated R,"""Logan"" is the final part of the Wolverine trilogy. It depicts the end of the main X-men characters. Logan is the first film I have watched within the ""X-men universe"" or whatever you call it, and it was great. ""Logan"" follows a now old and bitter Wolverine, who is waiting to die with no purpose in his life. That changes when he encounters a child, a mutant.A great part about ""Logan"" is its relationships. The dynamic between Logan and Charles is a great father-son relationship and it's great to follow. Likewise, it's great to follow the dynamic between Logan and Laura and their father-daughter relationship. She brings something different out of Logan and makes him rethink his view on life and his decisions.The story in this film is great. The story is sometimes slow but still enjoyable and not boring. It isn't that complicated of a story, but it manages to keep the viewer on their toes through the whole movie while creating an interesting story where the tension continues to gradually rise and rise until it culminates at the very end. Visually the film is impressive. It is aesthetically very pleasing to look at and it makes great use of different colors and different environments.The great visuals continue when it comes to the action which is also great. The action is fast-paced, hard-hitting, and brutal. It is also easy to follow and the combat looks absolutely brutal which is great. The decision to make this film rated R is a great one. The action wouldn't have been as great without the brutality and gore made possible by the R-rating. It is also refreshing to hear unfiltered language in films, especially a movie like ""Logan"" which could've been turned into a marvel-like superhero film, which wouldn't have fit at all.Hugh Jackman as Logan is absolutely amazing. He brings a great performance and he contributes a lot to Logan being the badass that he is in this movie.To summarize, ""Logan"" is a great film about redemption and is absolutely worth a watch. I'm not sure if having not watched the prior films made my experience of watching ""Logan"" better or worse, but I can say that you should watch it even if you haven't watched the other films.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
First Login and review..,"PG Handicap from prior Wolverine movies removed (check), deep husky comforting voices (check), carefully escalated tension and aggression in first fight scene (check). Environment blending in with the characters aging and deterrence; squeaky car/buildings/clothes etc.. (very nice touch).But..The overall impression was close to something like; your personal (DIY) home pet project, where you start off with the most accuracy in fixing that fence, or repainting that old mold infested corner in the ceiling, caring for the specifics and all the little details, until you find your self rushing off the job just for sake of getting it done!!And that's what in my personal opinion happened with this assignment, where it felt as the pace climaxed at around the first 20 minutes then duplicated it self thus gradually losing any fertility for potential.In what felt like a mash up between ""blood father"", ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"", and ""mad max:, there could have been more done to what is considered as the finale for the evolution of the character on screen, especially after all the years of trial and error, instead of exhausting all the art at the beginning and cruising on the protagonists name for the rest of the screen using it for commercial advertisement to mobile phones, breakfast cereals and automobiles.When maybe a cocktail of ""300"", ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Terminator salvation"" perhaps would have been more fulfilling in bringing out the protagonist's essence accumulated in the collective portrait of ""Wolverine/Logan"" fan boy generations over the years with his; instinctual beastly charisma, primitive confrontational manner, and repressed superego.In conclusion aside from the artistic concentration at the beginning, Patrick Stewart's master performance, and some of the catchy paradoxes in the story line, I think the overall rating should linger between (7,4) and (7) on the IMDb scale.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Hugh Jackman in his last go around as Wolverine,"I missed this film when it was in theaters. That is probably for the best, not that I had any desire to see it then due to the fact my fiancé had just recently passed away. If I had seen it, it probably would have triggered an attack. It still did, but at least I was in my own home so no one could see me break down. Just anything like this makes me remember the love of my life and the tears just pour out and I end up having an attack and have trouble breathing. That being said, this was a very good movie and a nice way to send off Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. Sure, there are things that make me question what has happened to reduce everyone to the state they are in, but when one reads comics, one understands that the story being presented may be sort of an alternate universe story arc, rather than the main one. I say this is the case with this movie, things may not necessarily turn out the way they did in this film, just in this universe things seemed to have gone very badly. It is a way to change up the actor playing Wolverine and get some closure for the X-men films starring him and Patrick Stewart as Professor Xavier.The story has Logan as a limo driver trying to earn enough cash to get a boat so that he and Professor Xavier can escape to the sea. Xavier is having trouble controlling his powers in his old age and Logan watches over him as there are hints that the professor has done something rather bad due to this lack of control. Logan is being assisted by a mutant named Caliban who has the ability to detect other mutants, a power nearly worthless now as mutants have become few and far between. Well, a woman tries to get Logan to help her as she has a young girl with her and some men are tracking both of them. This girl is apparently a mutant with some very familiar powers. Logan escapes with her and Professor Xavier and they must stay one step ahead of the agents determined to capture her. However, there is another familiar face that is unleashed in the agents efforts to recapture the young girl and several other mutant children trying to flee their grasp.I enjoyed the film for the most part, the only problem I had is that I was hoping for someone cooler when they revealed the soulless mutant who had no problem killing. They really did not have anyone new as far as mutants on display as Caliban was the only one I do not think was seen before. I would have liked the reveal to show the new weapon to be Omega Red. Granted, that would have meant a few more special effects I guess so we do not really get anyone new at all on display.So the film was good and the action was plentiful and quite gruesome. I knew there would be a bit more stuff shown because this film was rated R, but I was surprised at how many heads rolled and appendages flying everywhere. From what a few people had said about the film that I know, there really was not much action in the film. Not sure what film they were watching as there was a good deal. So ends Hugh Jackman's Wolverine and he did a good job in the role. I just find the makers starting with Marc Singer really did not do the character true justice as he was a much better fighter than the films portrayed, and his healing ability was not as effective in the comics as depicted in the films either. Basically, he was more apt to dodge in the comics than go head on and he would never have any problems fighting ordinary men and most superheroes could not match his fighting skills. Still, as I said, I just think of it as an alternative universe and it still saddens me to see Jackman depart the role.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Not the Wolverine movie I wanted to watch,"This is not strictly a superhero's movie. It's more a drama in the Sydney Lumet's Running on empty tradition mixed with a road movie (if you don't consider Running on empty a road movie itself). Obviously there are characters with superpowers or enhanced skills, cyborgs, adamantium claws and telepathic stuff but the action scenes just cover less than a third of the whole movie. Maybe is a more mature movie amid its genre than usual but I felt that it lacks a lot of entertainment. At least the kind of fun I expect from a superhero movie. I recognize the risk that the authors have assumed with this kind of story but I don't find it too original. I didn't like a lot the previous Mangold's Wolverine movie and I disliked Origins but to rank all three from best to worst; 1 The Wolverine, 2 Logan, 3 Origins. I think that they have missed a great opportunity with a really great character. I would have enjoyed much more a Bryan Synger's X Men movie style (but discarding Apocalypse) So Long Hugh Jackman's Wolverine",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Logan is a brutal and emotional film that encapsulates everything good about its genre.,"Coming off last year's rather disappointing X-Men: Apocalypse, I really didn't know what to expect from Logan. I was not too impressed by The Wolverine so I was wary of being overly excited. After the initial buzz from the first press screenings, however, my expectations skyrocketed. Fortunately, they were met and surpassed. Logan is a brutal and emotional film that encapsulates everything good about its genre.From the very opening, the the tone is set and you immediately notice just how bloody and brutal it is. Thanks to the film's age restriction, director James Mangold has the full freedom to go as far as the story calls for. There is excessive swearing but it never comes off as forced; it's natural because the situations that these characters are put in are dire. Another thing that fascinated me was that the gore was not gratuitous and was used effectively.As far as the story goes, it takes place in 2029, sometime after all X-men are dead but for Logan, Charles and Caliban. We don't know why and how but we are given pieces of the puzzle throughout the film that we need to put together in order to understand what has gone wrong. Logan is now old and tired of life, offering a service similar to Uber until one they his car is wrecked. I'll leave it at that as the less you know when you go in to see it, the better.Logan never treats the audience as if it is dumb and doesn't spoon-feed us every single thing that is going on. Moreover, the story is so told in such a masterful manner that upon leaving the auditorium, you will have seen a film with a beginning, a middle and an end—something rare these days, especially in the superhero genre. The end of the second act is by far one of the most suspenseful and shocking ones I have seen in a long while. The entire movie is intense and doesn't let you get distracted even for a second; you're glued to the screen.A big contributor to that, apart from the fantastic direction and cinematography, is the acting. Almost everyone gives an exceptional performance (save for Stephen Merchant, who is a hit or miss) but the standouts are, as you might have expected, Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart. The former is harrowing as the guilt and tiredness from Logan's long life is taking its toll on him, while Stewart gives an incredibly nuanced performance with exquisite subtlety. Dafne Keen is quite stellar as well, even if she doesn't play the most likable of characters. What she does in her action scenes is commendable.While the film's explored themes have definitely been dealt with before, it has its own spin on them to make them thought-provoking: are corporations too unregulated? Where should a line be drawn? Does good always win or does evil overpower it sometimes? Is immigration a solution to some problems? Do you choose yourself or should you go out of your way to help the others? These and many other questions are asked but you don't always get a straight answer. Rather, you need to make up your own mind about it.It is deeply emotional as well. Even though it is based on a comic-book, it isn't of the type 'let's save the world.' Instead, it's a much smaller, and therefore, a more personal film about dealing with loss and illnesses, moral dilemmas, and explores the line as to when your actions are justifiable and when you've turned into a monster.Not burdened by the task to set up a plethora of sequels and prequels, the director has crafted an impeccable film about what it means to be human and how far we are willing to go for those we care about. Logan doesn't cut away from the horror that one may afflict upon others and effortlessly scrutinises the motivations behind its characters' decisions. Combine that with the brutal but exceptionally executed action scenes and you end up with a film that elevates the superhero genre.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
great visual effects but nothing more than that,"I really like X-Men stories and movies and was really anxious to see this movie since it had great reviews. But after watching it I don't understand why the great rating. I found it extremely and unnecessarily violent, it lacks story content. Professor X is sick and has trouble controlling his power and he is a shadow of his former wisdom, Wolverine is a bitter man and Laura looks like a wild Tarzan. The title made me think it would be about how Logan went through life but it is not about that. It is not even about how mutants fit in with humans. It is just a men hunt.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
lame sell out,"Lets jump right in, shall we? X-Men style. Claws out, SNIKT!Speaking of which... in this poorly edited flick, we have two Mutants that saved the world, the very universe, and everything in between time and time again, yet everyone acts like they are in cheesy Jean- Claude Van Damme road-movie.Our main protagonist, everyone's favorite claw-wielding Mutant gets the clichéd-has-been-hero treatment. Awesome? Not really because the whole thing unfolds every bit as lame as you could imagine.This creatively bankrupt paint-by-numbers production stretches the 5'3"" Wolverine to 6'3"". Invisible stilts anyone? Hollywood's version of Wolverine in ""Logan"" doesn't have much in common with the Marvel comics character, besides sharing the same name.The pathetic ending, after the clichéd showdown with the doppelganger really had me scratching my head. This definitely isn't the Wolverine from the comics. Instead it's Hollywoods pale rip off for monetary gain.The only ray of light here was Patrick Stewart's solid performance, who always delivers in his roles.Ever since the seventies Stan Lee wanted to see his superheroes make a living in Hollywood, but ultimately by doing so Marvel sacrificed all integrity and identity.To all longtime X-Men Comic fans, do yourself a favor stay away from this awful bastardization.

"An ""X-Men"" movie for the adult audience...","Now, first and foremost I must stand forth and say that superhero movies is not my go-to pick of movies when presented with alternate choices. Why? Well, because I just don't really enjoy the superhero theme all that much. Usually, they provide nothing more than visual entertainment for me.However, I will say that ""Logan"" manages to stand out in the superhero genre; a genre that is well-diluted with mediocre attempts of bringing comic book heroes to life on the big screen. ""Logan"", however, steps away from the absurdly generic mould that superhero movies tend to follow, and it is not the superhuman powers of the characters that is the drive behind the movie.What makes ""Logan"" so good and entertaining, is that this is a movie intended for a mature audience, and it leaves the generic superhero archetype behind as it has been seen in most previous ""X-Men"" movies. With that being said, I will also continue on to state that ""Logan"" is actually the best of all the installments into the ""X-Men"" universe on the big screen so far.This is a movie that is driven by a good story, and spiced up with good characters and good acting all around. This is also the most violent and bloody of all the ""X-Men"" movies, take it as it is, like it or dislike it - that is a personal preference, of course. I did, however, enjoy the approach and the more dark atmosphere that permeated this entire movie. It was refreshing not to see a rose-tinted superhero movie where you know that the heroes will prevail against insurmountable odds.Sure, the effects in ""Logan"" are great, and they do help the movie along quite nicely.I was more than genuinely surprised with how good ""Logan"" turned out to be, and this movie does have enough entertainment contents to sustain multiple viewings. My rating for ""Logan"" is 8 out of 10 stars, without a doubt. And this is a well-worthy addition to the ""X-Men"" franchise.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
True Wolverine finally shows up.,"Everything I've ever wanted to see in a super hero movie. James is on the edge. He doesn't care whether he lives or dies anymore, he's just a drunk chauffeur running away from his past. There's no purpose in life for him, he's lost all hope, until he meets Laura. He sees in her his old himself and an opportunity to make up for his mistakes. He won't admit it, but he cares for her and so does Charles. Charles is the closest thing to a father he has, on the inside he is one of the reasons he hasn't given up yet. When they realize they need to protect what they destroyed in order to preserve the future that's when the movie begins. Logan is not all about violence, it's about inspiring the next ones, the next generation. Inspiring our children to be better than we are, so they can teach the same thing to theirs.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A fitting farewell,"Logan(Jackman, truly understanding the role that made him a star off Broadway too) is faced with helping a young female mutant who's having trouble with her powers. So it ends in much the same way it began. He's also taking care of Xavier(Stewart, grumpy and foul-mouthed, and we love it, but still some hope left). They're both dealing with aging, losing control of their abilities. The next generation need their protection. One last ride.Third time's the charm. As close as the second solo outing got, this is what we've wanted from Wolverine right from when we saw him cage-fighting. And with X-23, or Laura(played to perfection by the incredibly talented young Keen), the torch is passed. The way is paved for the X-Force, as well as the New X-Men. This is a slow burn, and a road movie. The action is amazing, using the R-rating for the ferocity and brutality that is called for, never gratuitously. There is not as much of it as in other entries in the series, and if you're not that interested in the characters this studies, you probably won't be that compelled to watch this. You can go into this blind.This has a lot of strong language, and brief nudity, in addition to what I've already described. I recommend this to anyone who even considers themselves a little bit of a fan. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Excellent,"Although I am not a Marvel type of person this film was amazing every aspect of it was just glorifying the young Dafne Keen was the breakout star, she stole the whole movie with her wonderful but violent performance.

One of those movies that I feel will age better with time.,"Logan was a good time and definitely worth the price of a ticket to see it. Keen's character is fantastic, and both Jackman and Stewart were great while their characters weren't as fleshed out. The western tone gave the movie a distinct feeling, unlike any other superhero film, but gets boring in the lack of set pieces. The finale takes chances that are unexpected from these types of production companies, and really brings out a lot of emotions that one might not expect to feel when walking into this movie. In the end I decided to give Logan a ""Good"" on theVade Review Bar or a 7 out of 10. Although it's a little higher than I wanted to give it, this is one of those movies that I feel will age better with time, ironically the opposite of Logan's character in Logan.Read more at theVade.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Perhaps The Last Time We See Hugh Jackman And Patrick Stewart In An X-Men Movie.,"Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart are my favorite actors. Hugh Jackman cemented his role as Logan(a.k.a. Wolverine of the X-Men) whereas Patrick Stewart immortalized himself as Captain Jean-Luc Picard in Star Trek: The Next Generation. As I am writing this review, Patrick Stewart is 76 years old. I don't think he will act in a film ever again. This film marks the departure for Hugh Jackman as Logan.Back to the film. First of all, I should say that this film is violent. Perhaps one of the most violent X-Men movies I have seen. Also those of you expecting over the top C.G.I. effects will be disappointed. The effects are kept to a minimum to keep the film going. More emphasis is played on the relationship between professor X. Xavier and Logan. The professor has become old and has to be medicated because he is suffering from Alzheimer's disease. Logan has stayed behind to look after him.Caliban an albino mutant who has the ability to track other mutants has also stayed behind to help both Xavier and Logan. He offers Logan a lot of good advice, however Logan snubs him in his usual gruff manner.The film starts in the year 2029. mutants are on the brink of extinction, with no new mutants having been born in 25 years. James ""Logan"" Howlett, formerly known as Wolverine, spends his days working as a chauffeur in Texas. His healing factor has faltered and, as a result, his body has aged greatly.One day, Logan is approached by Gabriela Lopez, a nurse for biotechnology corporation Alkali-Transigen, who wants him to escort her and an 11-year-old girl named Laura to a place in North Dakota called ""Eden"". After reluctantly accepting the job from Gabriela, Logan discovers that she has been murdered. Watch the film to find out what happens next...Verdict: Superb and mature acting by Hugh Jackman. He gives his best performance in what should be his last X-men film. During the screening of the film he and Stewart held hands and wept. This is no doubt due to the long relationship they had during the filming of the X-Men series of films. The cinematography and sound effects are adequate to the film. The film has a sort of gloomy/dismal setting which no doubt lets us know that the theme of the film is that all good things in life come to an abrupt end. People grow old - even mutants. But I do hope that the next generation has a bright future ahead of it.Thank you for reading this review.

Super Abilities Second to Super Story,"Bravo.Encore! Encore!This is what Wolverine is about, this is the Wolverine movie I'd been waiting for.""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" was alright. ""The Wolverine"" was about just as mediocre, but this... this was a masterpiece. This had depth, this had feeling, this had character.Logan is an older, disheveled, drunker, surlier character with diminishing abilities. He is rock bottom. Probably not the ideal Wolverine but it makes his character so much more layered. This is a Wolverine you will be familiar with but maybe slightly impatient with as well. But one thing is for sure, this movie (hence Wolverine) benefited from an R rating. It wasn't an R rating just for the sake of cheap sexual jokes or gratuitous nudity, rather it was an R rating in order for Wolverine to be Wolverine: a cutthroat killer that uses his claws for more than just neatly puncturing people.As for Charles Xavier, he is older and suffering from the effects of old age which has diminished his abilities as well as made him highly volatile. They are alone with hardly any mutants left and not much more to live for--that is until a girl named Laura (Dafne Keen) comes into their lives.Dafne Keen is wonderful as the little Laura. She has limited lines but she commands the screen nonetheless. She was both adorable and formidable and an indispensable part of the story line.If you're looking for non-stop action, this isn't the movie for you. If you're looking for a good story with structure and pace and some well placed potent action, then this is for you. The movie may have been slow for some, but I'm an adult and I can tolerate a slow movie that has a purpose.This was so much grittier and realler than just about any comic book/superhero movie. There was no saving the world, no saving the galaxy, not even saving a small town, but there was saving--and there was sacrifice. I love the movies that aren't afraid to make us angry or make us sad. Not the cheap anger that comes with every bad guy, or the cheap sadness that comes with the death of a good guy. I mean those movies, such as this one, that can cultivate and build to make an authentic anger and an authentic sadness. Not everyone can be saved, not everyone lives happily ever after and not everyone changes for the better. We try to reach those in need of saving--both literally and figuratively--but some people you can't reach. This movie had that.I could wax on much longer about this film I love it so much. For the sake of brevity I will conclude with this: Logan is that superhero movie done so well that the super abilities are second to the super story.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
One of the best films I've seen,"Once they were the strongest on earth. They could even change the course of history ... But something terrible happened and now they are no more.Logan - one of those units who are still alive, has already aged and drags on a miserable existence, working for pennies and watching how quickly his country and people around him are degrading. He no longer wants to participate in any conflicts, but simply wants to live in peace. But they do not give it to him. And even despite constant provocations, he does not want to harm anyone to anybody and attacks only when he is already being pressed. However, as you know, there is nothing more terrible than a beast driven into a corner. And then the offenders will regret that they dared to raise their hand against him and those close to him.This is a very deep and humane film about an outcast, no one needs a single person, for whom his whole very long life was a constant struggle. Life is full of wars, pain, suffering ... disappointment. He never knew what peace was.

Disappointing with one redemptive scene,"I was hooked into watching this movie because of a combination of seeing every other X-Men movie and because the preview for the movie was incredible. I thought this was going to be above and beyond better than any other X-Men movie. While it was not bad, it was not very good.I did enjoy large portions of the movie and several of the themes. However, it did not seem to finish any main theme. The themes of age, decay, and sorrow are very clear, but they were not well concluded. The movie just leaves you hanging. The movie seemed as lost as the characters, which if intended, then they succeeded.The language was completely unnecessary and distracting. The same movie could have been made and the same points could have been brought up without any of the language. It was as if the writers just wanted to make the movie dirty for the sake of being dirty.God was pointlessly brought up unless the point was to make subtle jabs at theism.There was one very good scene toward the end of the movie that for me was the main redemptive aspect of the movie. I will probably forever remember that scene.The movie leaves a lot to the imagination which is both a good and bad thing. Viewers could definitely leave the theater very confused about the development of the story.Finally, unfortunately like many action movies, it eventually gets rather silly in regards to its action.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

The proper farewell that Professor Xavier and Wolverine deserved.,"This is a perfect conclusion for the X-Men saga, and a proper farewell for two massive characters in the cinecomic genre. Despite having just a few dialogue lines, Laura is a well built and very complete character, the actress performed really well. The director created a special bond between her and Logan. Professor Xavier in this case is more of a side character, but he is absolutely necessary because he is the glue that will guide the two heroes, accomplishing their main goal. The movie is not scared to show the deepest and human side of these mutants: we get to see their most intimate emotions, vulnerabilities and weaknesses. We do not have in front of us the typical superhumans that cannot be killed. This is the main reason why I particularly enjoyed this film. The ending is bittersweet and for sure is not the usual ""lived happily ever after"" stuff. This is the perfect conclusion for an amazing saga that I followed since I was a teenager. This is how I want to remember the X-Men. I really wish they stopped here, instead of milking this cow over and over again.From a technical standpoint, the movie is extremely solid: action scenes and stunts are well executed, the CGI is overall good and it is never over the top. Photography is well done, there are many interesting and creative camera angles. I really liked the fact that they focus more on practical effects,giving a more realistic look to the entire film.

Patrick Stewart's character is used to slow down the story and add an alternative viewing to Jackman's character.The movie is generally fast-paced and exhibits a clear following throughout - the advancement is very much a journey, and a quest to peace and justice.

"'Take your friends and run... They'll keep coming, and coming... You don't have to fight anymore.'","For those who have been following the Marvel Comic Books cinematic transformation, the character of Wolverine – that hunk with the blades that shoot out from his hands when he is angry – is well known. LOGAN represents the end of Wolverine, and surprisingly this is a very touching film and not just excessive gore (though that is certainly present throughout the film!). One line that underscores the mood of this piece is Logan's line 'Nature made me a freak. Man made me a weapon. And God made it last too long.' James Mangold directs the story he wrote (transformed into a screen play with help form Scott Frank and Michael Green) with a great deal of empathy for the last of Logan and his return to a caring man.The year is 2029 - the mutant population has shrunken significantly and the X-Men have disbanded. Logan (Hugh Jackman), whose power to self-heal is dwindling, has surrendered himself to alcohol and now earns a living as a chauffeur. He takes care of the ailing old Professor X (Patrick Stewart) and his sidekick, the albino Caliban (Stephen Merchant) whom he keeps hidden away. One day, a female stranger (Elizabeth Rodriguez) asks Logan to drive a girl named Laura (Dafne Keen) to the Canadian border. At first he refuses, but the Professor has been waiting for a long time for her to appear. Laura possesses an extraordinary fighting prowess and is in many ways like Wolverine. She is pursued by sinister figures (led by Boyd Holbrook) working for a powerful corporation; this is because her DNA contains the secret that connects her to Logan. A relentless pursuit begins. This time around we see Wolverine as the superhero beset by everyday problems -aging, ailing and struggling to survive financially. A decrepit Logan is forced to ask himself if he can or even wants to put his remaining powers to good use. It would appear that in the near-future, the times in which they were able put the world to rights with razor sharp claws and telepathic powers are now over.Kindness prevails – as a family (Eriq La Salle, Elise Neal, and Quincy Fouse) provide caring and protection for Wolverine and his mutant daughter. The evil trackers are very well portrayed, the action is brisk, but underneath all the killing and mutilation is a story with a heart. Grady Harp, June 17",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

A masterpiece !,"Logan is by far one of the greatest superhero movies ever made. It's a drama focused , character driven and also action packed flick that captivated me since it's start. An authentic , gritty , bleak and hopeless drama takes place here , telling the story of 3 deeply developed main characters who won me over.Logan a tired , sickly , mean and hopeless man works as a limo driver to take care of the aging Charles Xavier who unlike him , besides his old age , is still hopeful , vibrant , sociable and full of life. These differing attitude and out look of theirs always puts them at odds and makes them argue a lot in a very emotional and sometimes humorous manner. I, for one really enjoyed seeing those two bicker.But besides their differences , they look out for each other. Logan respects him a lot and feels like he owes him for taking him in back when he was young and lost. He feels like doing the same and repaying him by protecting him from the Government and everybody out there who wants to capture him ( since he's a wanted man with a very powerful mind capable of being used as a weapon ) and tending to his needs. They planned on saving some cash , buying a boat and leaving for good to live peacefully somewhere out there. Then all of a sudden this little girl , Laura shows up and messes up this plan of theirs and becomes another burden for Logan to carry.Charles as vigourus as he is makes Logan take her in besides his refusal. But taking care of her proves to be a tougher job since an army is after her. The plot goes on like this.The writing was solid. I enjoyed every single dialogue between the characters as none of it was silly and padded out. None of the lines were wasted as each interchange served to develop the story and the characters. The acting by all was also superb. Hugh Jackman gave an amazing performance perfectly depicting Logan's angry , impatient and hopeless mien. Dafne Keen as the little mutant was sweet but also extremely fierce when she wants to be. And for the first time I didn't hate Boyd Holbrook at all. His smuggy and egotistic performance fitted his character well and made him a damn good villain. Sir Patrick Wilson as always was kind , polite and charming. The story was engaging and the gore throughout made the action scenes convincing. A genre defining movie that truly impressed me. A breath of fresh air after all the puerile junky comic movies Hollywood releases these days.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Despite the action Logan is an unimpressive superhero movie.,"'Logan' is the first movie (minus Deadpool) in the X-Men universe to receive an R rating. Unlike 'Deadpool' this film is not a comedy. Far from it actually. This film is a brutal action movie filled with excessive violence resulting in a surfeit of blood, gore, and cursing. Which, surprisingly enough, is what any fan of Wolverine as a character has been waiting for. Finally, we get to witness Hugh Jackman tear people limb from limb in glorious, graphic violence. For this film, the biggest selling point, aside from the R rating, was the fact that Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart are hanging it up after this film. This film will mark their last performances as their respective characters.So naturally, people want to see the only Wolverine they know be Wolverine one last time. And, thankfully, this film features an all around superb cast. Every actor in this movie is great with Jackman anchoring the film with his magnetic performance. Patrick Stewart also does a great job despite having fairly limited screen time. Even the young girl (X-23) did a fine job with what was given to her.But the crowning achievement of the film is the action. This director also directed 'The Wolverine' which was equally strong action wise. The difference between the two films is that 'The Wolverine' feels stifled by its PG-13 rating. 'Logan' does not have this problem. All the action is well handled and horrifically violent. Every time someone gets stabbed blood sprays all over the place in glorious detail.And it should be shown in glorious detail because the rating is the biggest selling point. Which is why you should see this with a crowd. It's the perfect movie to see with people and reveal in the excessive violence we have all craved. Every time Jackman and his little girl whip out their claws the film gets a burst of life and energy that really resonates with a crowd. So, while I would recommend seeing this with a crowd to experience the impressive action, I can't say that I liked this film.It's perfectly fine but the biggest problem comes in the form of the script. There are literally three screenwriters penning this movie. Writers who have such hit films as 'Marley & Me', 'Green Lantern', and 'The Wolverine' under their belt. Despite having three people looking at this script for who knows how long, it still feels like a first draft. Why? Because there is basically no story. Where the last Wolverine film was almost incoherent with its bloated story, hardly anything happens in 'Logan'.The first thirty minutes is set up followed by an action scene that all works very well but the next 45-60 minutes is nothing. They go to a place and then leave and then go to a place and leave over and over again. It gets so repetitive and dull to the point of me actually falling asleep. In an R-rated X-Men movie. It's in this hour of time where we are left with so little story that you start to realize that there wasn't really a story to begin with.It goes something like this: ""Take this girl to this place Wolverine."" ""No. OK, fine I'll do it."" And that's it. After he takes thirty minutes to accept this job he then takes two hours to complete this thin plot and that's the movie. It's nearly an hour of filler in a two and a half hour movie. If the film had this hour of filler cut out we would have had a great, straight up action movie. Instead, we have an uneven, poorly paced, thin story where not much happens.Like I said earlier, this is a perfectly acceptable action film. It has all the blood and gore you could ever want. It really pushes its R rating in the way we all wanted it too. Couple that with great performances and we should have had a great action movie. But, instead, the film is horribly bogged down with poor writing. Three screenwriters is never a good sign and it really shows here. There are endless action scenes followed by even more endless filler scenes. What results from this is overlong, thinly plotted, and an unevenly paced the film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
This is a Masterpiece!,This is the best Wolverine movie! Hugh Jackman makes the most of his final outing as Wolverine. It's emotional and brutal.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A little underwhelmed...,"Maybe it's a case of high expectations, but I was underwhelmed overall with this movie. It has ramp-ed up the violence to the max and the end is quite good but too many problems mar this movie to make it a hit: - the setting never quite clicks: 12 years in the future they have the same phones and the same TVs? Mutantkind was eradicated? Not a big deal but it never seems right - the movie is a road movie? An action movie? A mix of the both with a lot of dead times and fairly filler moments - What it is not is a super hero movie. It has some of its tropes but lacks the overall sense of wonderment a superhero flick needs - The bad guys and main threat are really **meh** So yeah Hugh Jackman is OK, Patrick Stewart is OK, seeing a Wolverine unleashed on the screen has its moments but overall somewhat disappointed.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
I changed my mind,"When i first saw this, i was expecting all the action, fighting, conflict, big bads, and cliff hangers that signified Once you relate to the characters as people just living their lives- people who once lived extraordinary lives, that are trying to leave all that behind and just be at peace. Once you do that. Once you ser that... then you understand. This is an action super hero movie about life- and what could come after if you lived in such a universe.

another triumph of comic material's R-rated transmutation on the big screen,"This gore-permeated, pathos-riddled final chapter of Hugh Jackman's Wolverine trilogy startles its audience with not one, but two curtain calls of iconic characters in the X-Men franchise, and director James Mangold (whose previous Wolverine vehicle is a styled but ultimately self-defeating oddity) ensures that his R-rated version will do something very different from other CGI-heavy products of Marvel cinema, where emotion vacuum has been repeatedly desensitized in favor of visual bombardment.The scale is relatively small (no metropolitan city is threatened by impending danger), set in 2029 where mutants have been almost extinct (the reasons beyond that are both a woe of Professor X and a progressive measure from dietary intake), a world-weary Logan (Jackman), now moonlights as a limo chauffeur, traveling to-and-fro between USA and Mexico, to take care of a delirious Professor X, aka. Charles Xavier (Stewart), a mumbling nonagenarian and episodically inflicted by seizure and is unable to keep a tight rein on his psionic superpower, can only be tamed by medication, meanwhile the albino mutant Caliban (Merchant, a bug-eyed phantom actually has a golden heart) is Logan's sole help.All Logan wants is to save enough money and buy a boat so that they can live in the sea while the rest of the world stays out of harm's way, because the blast induced from Charles' seizure has already caused disastrous collateral damage to those in the vicinity, but the advent of a Mexican nurse Gabriela (Rodriguez) and her so-called teenager daughter Laura (a commendable debutante Keen) will eventually sabotage his plan. It turns out, Laura is very much like Logan, she is a man- made mutant using Logan's own DNA by Doctor Rice (E. Grant), who takes a vocation to capitalize on mutation to manufacture killing machines, Laura is one of his experiments, but now, along with other mutant children, they are failed guinea pigs needs to be disposed of, since Rice has something much more advanced created. So, reluctantly, Logan embarks on his final adventure to escort Laura (along with Charles) to the meeting place, then with other escapees, to cross the border into Canada, where Eden, a mutant paradise purportedly exists (the metaphor of breaking away from USA today is right on the nose), at the meantime, they are hunted by the Reavers, led by Donald Pierce (Holbrook, manage to pull off a clichéd role with verve and bemusing ambiguity), a huge fan of Wolverine's legend but also ruthlessly committed to his mission, but he is not the biggest problem for the fleeing trio.Incredibly, Mangold thrusts a brilliant human touch into the story arc, not the least is the moving Western nostalgia eliciting from George Steven's SHANE (1953) and that soul-stirring denouement when Logan is again, regretfully, embroils an innocent family into his war; yet keeps the action sequences snappy, utilitarian but uncompromisingly lethal, that introduction set piece of Laura's destructive nature and combatting prowess is such a godsend. Hugh Jackman will be forever beloved for this role, which he has been playing for 17 years, and here he is even more manifestly touching in ramming home Logan's cursed kismet with unrelenting taedium vitae, which is countervailed by Keen's perfect embodiment of innocence and dispassionateness, slowly eroded when a father-daughter bond starts to burgeon, effectively reaches its crescendo in the coda where a sort of patricide passes on the baton to the offspring. Patrick Stewart, meantime, is equally poignant appearing for the last time as the aging Professor X, his valediction is every bit as potent as Logan's.Also worth mentioning that there is also a noir-version of the film, which is entirely in Black-and- White and makes great play of the story's tragic/heroic tone, when all is said and done, LOGAN is another triumph of comic material's R-rated transmutation (after DEADPOOL of course) on the big screen, but in its core, it is an ardently past-honoring action-er doesn't shirk from the grim fate but also sows its seeds of hope with great dexterity, to a point that we won't even begrudge to bid farewell to our favorite screen heroes, distinguished by their superpower but permanently scourged by its distasteful corollaries.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
a HUGE disappointment... unfortunately,"Usually I don't write Reviews as I think that everybody should get his own impression and not be influenced by somebody else's. But given the huge promotion for this movie as well as the misleading rating and comments here on IMDb, I feel kind of urged to leave this comment in order to warn all the people out there not having seen this mess of a movie yet...Not being a big fan of the whole new Superhero Genre / Franchises, this movie even manages - among with the first ""Wolverine"" movie, which was quite much terrible - to be the worst in the whole ""X-Men Universe"" for me.What makes it so bad?The Movie does NOT really have a STORY - or at least not something worth to be called alike. For sure a plot is there. But what exactly is the story? It's about a child that has been given birth to using mutant DNA in order to make them strong soldiers - as they do have emotions and don't obey, they shall be executed and replaced. One girl (DNA- infiltrated with Wolverine genes) flees (helped by a doctor) and goes on fleeing together with Wolverine and Professor Charles Xavier. So in fact this is simply a PURSUIT MOVIE. No side-plots, nothing more to think about - nothing else of interest involved...Out of this tiny story, something huge emerges: BOREDOM. Never has there been such a boring Super Hero movie. Basically nothing happens for more or less 2 hours: Family Talking (which it is not: they are not a family in fact...) seems to be the only driving force for a long time...why it doesn't work:For those calling it the first adult Super Hero movie that is not only about action: GIMME A BREAK. if you know a little about Independent Filmmaking and about stories with depth, ""Logan"" is a joke. It is totally SUPERFICIAL, the dialogues are not real to life, the emotions are fake Hollywood - it stays what it is: A COMIC MOVIE... So given the ambition to be a deep movie - something meaningful - it is a total FAILURE. It is simply NOT. Period. Go watch e.g. ""Perfect World (1993) instead... It's not that I'm a Blockbuster fan only looking for spectacle and action in a movie. But a movie should STAY TRUE TO ITSELF: If it wants to be meaningful and clever, a lot more would be needed than this.On the other hand, on a Super Hero and Action Scale, the movie is an absolute FAILURE as well, as for most of the movie duration there is not a lot happening on screen. There are 2 well-crafted action scenes, however:1. When Professor Xavier manages to stop time with his mind while Wolverine manages with his last force to kill all the bad guys who want to steal the young mutant (on the other hand, this scene is basically a rip-off of ""X-Men Apocalypse"" and the scene involving super-fast Quick- silver; thus: nothing new indeed. we have seen it all before...)2. The scene near the end when they hunt each other through the forest with Wolverine jumping on the enemies running in front of him is quite amazing.All the rest is rather cheap and / or unfunny; a cheap car-chase rip- off of ""Mad Max IV"" involved before they can escape behind the rolling train...+ SPOILER: ... this extremely unsatisfying event, when Professor Xavier (the supposed to be wise guy) accepts the invitation (or rather forces Wolverine to accept) by this nice family who had problems with their truck... How stupid is this??? Obviously they are all killed in the end - but don't worry - no bad conscience involved...^^ Heck, they are on the run...! Xavier should be the rational, old, wise man, shouldn't he?! How bad writing is that? Too bad to be true... This movie is utterly ridiculous... :DAre the 2 mentioned well-crafted action sequences worth your money for the entry fee? Certainly NOT! 7 minutes of enjoyment for 2h 10 of boredom? That's a bad exchange... Thus my advice: Safe your money, stay at home...^^ ...or watch something really worth your money! :)",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
The nihilism of Logan undoes the hope of Days of Future Past (spoilers),"Basically, this movie undoes all the goodwill from the film Days of Future Past. In DOFP, the X-Men successfully prevented the Sentinnels from coming into existence and saved mutant kind. The time line was altered and all the X-Men who died in The Last Stand were brought back to life and had a happy ending. The film Logan undoes all that with it's need to be relentlessly depressing and dystopic. We learn that Logan and Prof. X are on the decline and aging badly. The X-Men have been eradicated, as has mutant kind. So all the work the X-Men did in DOFP was for NOTHING. The film is full of bad language and very gory violence. There is no humor or fun in this movie at all. Patrick Stewart and Hugh Jackman are to be commended for their strong performances and building a wonderful father/son relationship in the film, but the villains are so bland and boring and forgettable. I can't even remember their names! I kind hope Cable from the Dead Pool movies comes along and time travels and restores the X-Men to greatness again.

The claws (really) come out,"Wolverine finally gets his R-rating, and it's a double edged sword. The bright side is that the berserker rage really means something (straight up hack-n-slash, baby). The unpleasant side to this is that there's no shortage of punishment in this movie and that's no more evident than in the lowly states of Logan and Charles Xavier (putting aside the ending, it's heartbreaking to see Patrick Stewart wasting away like this): this world has taken an unbelievable toll on both.It's a painful movie, hitting on everything from death to (fragile) hope to even child abuse; and pretty much everything you'd want in an old-man Logan tale.But my god, is it bleak.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

This film was as good as The Dark knight. By far my favorite superhero film of all time. Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart deserve Oscars and Dafnie Keene deserves the best young actress ever. I was blown away with much of everything in the film. This was totally worth the hype for the REAL LAST X-MEN films. The visuals, cinematography, the chill soundtrack, the set design.

No words can describe how good and how beautiful that send off was to both Hugh Jackman as Wolverine and Patrick Stewart as Professor Xavier. Thank you for making this beautiful film.

The best Wolverine (Xmen) movie to date,"Wow! what a show. The standard of this movie is threefold higher than the previous PRE-2011 X-men Movies. Its worth watching more than twice (if you have a free 2hrs slot). LOGAN is packed with action, drama and unexpected twists. It portrayed the life struggles of the Wolverine (Logan) and Professor X that I can connect with and able to understand their pain that they had to go through as the last remaining mutants in the world. The action scenes were violent, realistic, and graphically detailed unlike the previous PRE-2011 X- men movies which were more suitable for younger audiences. To me, this should be the standard of most X-men/ Wolverine movies one that portrays real-life struggle, pain, emotional hardship, mental suffering, and graphic death scenes. I also like how they use classic X-men comics to demonstrate the differences of real world X-men and fictional figures. A very good closure for both Professor X and Wolverine.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Concluding & Acerbic Contemplation For Marvel Comics' Fictional Superhero,"Weapon X, one of the most beloved characters that Marvel has brought to cinema screens, has departed, but he has made it in style, with scarlet blood dripping down his defective adamantium claws and leaving a feasible regeneration based on young mutants in the bequest. After insistent and suggestive promises of director James Mangold, which were disclosed while he filmed the notorious movie, ""Logan"" has finally landed in worldwide cinemas and we have had the opportunity to refute or asseverate whether or not the words of the scholar Marvel-fan were right. In general terms, the utopian western that Mangold has raised is the definitive entry point to out-of-the- ordinary facets in the genre, for the true meaning of adapting works with abidance. This installment will cause us to apply Plato's Allegory of the Cave to UCM in all its splendor, dusting off the glorious, intelligent, capable and above all human superhero movies.Jackman shows us his alter ego drastically unrecognizable: ill, faint and about to collapse. Australian actor gives everything in order to offer a proper last goodbye his professional epithet, he provides it tangible malady and visible fatigue along capacities, his sad gaze captures hopelessness; this man's actions will annoy to ethical heroes world and yes, what Mangold declared has a voracious source: ""It's not a superhero movie, it's a film about humans with powers"". Hugh offers a properly successor, she is Dafne Keen, newcomer actress who plays Laura, an overfilled with anger and vigor girl, with the potential required to carry upon her shoulder weapon X responsibilities. The dialogs for young actress are quasi-non-existent till the third act of the film, supplementing that phonetic absence by formidable physical skills within magnetic and violent action scenes; she's the precise.Wolverine's last adventure as an irrevocable spaghetti western is unthinkable, a feature-film with a dirty and stylized artistic expression and seemingly devoid of moral characters, rough and badass guys. Here, the action sequences are justified, calculated and incredibly ferocious. Officially, this is the movie adapting Wolvie's pages in form and essence, it doesn't display super bright battles or with light sparks instead of blood, violence has a reason and aftermaths; and although the application is concise, they stir more than Avengers' pompous fights. The signs of summer movie are almost microscopic; the pictures are dry, pessimistic, melancholic and without a doubt, selected components can be compared with ""Midnight Special"" by Jeff Nichols. All this lack of hope is embellished with a sudden parsimonious pace, aggressive when it has to be, but intelligent in emotions posed. Marco Beltrami's music squeezes every means at its disposal, however, paradoxically, calm and sad melodies excel, they capture the atmosphere of the film.And emotional field matters. Sentimentality is suitable in each character, sensations are plausible and touch even the most disheartened person. It differs from sporadic determinations, incomprehensible twists, every act is motivated by a thought supported by feelings. As it's becoming a road/buddy movie, interpersonal relationships are improving and wins a brilliantly tremendous connection. Each of these mutant beings has a well-crafted conclusion, both expected and completely unpredictable endings. In fact, there's something sad about the movie: this one feels like by far the best Wolvie's story, making us reflect how other adventures would have been without MPAA restrictions. Must ""Logan"" thank ""Deadpool""? It's all in how you look at it, since even though Wade Wilson's feature film has explicit contents, everything tends to the wit, while nuance is different here, and exactly that's what disquieted 20th Century Fox, the change has an abrupt alteration in pace with respect to the preceding film, however, they can breathe easier now, money continues coming in.Unfortunately, ""Logan"" must not be perfect thanks to the long- standing quandary which Marvel hasn't been able to keep down: antagonists. Year after year, movie after movie, despicable villains have to be as fundamental as setting or leading roles, they are a key piece in the puzzle, nonetheless, ""Logan"" re-inserted its reluctant hands in the painful ulcer. Perhaps, the screenwriters and director wanted the star trio was the absolute center of attention, embedding in the bad-guy role to Pierce (Boyd Holbrook), who doesn't appear the time requested on the screen, a few Mexican police officers and one or two human demons. Another point which many people have reviled is its ""extensive"" length, when a film with fascinating components is long?""Logan"" says goodbye categorically to Bryan Singer's and Mangold's adaptations and takes delighted Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy aura thanks to its realistic and pessimistic way, a desolate horizon where the hero isn't super, is a hero facing human issues. The second R-rated Marvel film cements ambitions in the tone, script and performances, portraying fully both the fictional world of the pages as the mortal world, our world which can transmute in the twinkling of an eye, there's a dry and overwhelming realism to our uncertain evolution. A violent, clever and eloquent motion picture; Jackman's final performance gives an unprecedented Wolverine impression so far and offers an open-minded look at the superhero universe, also serves as confirmation that Marvel can get to be as melodramatic and dark as DC films without losing the skills, without losing the touch. A round of applause for Hugh Jackman, who says ""never again"" to Wolvie's suit, however, economic Hollywood can get it. Thank you for everything and good way.

#51 of all time? ROFLMAO,"The IMDb has become the desert wasteland of the movie studios who flood voting and the haven of our youngest millennials who live to vote for tripe like this, rarely having experienced a good movie or watching anything more than 5-10 years old.This is a very mediocre and predictable X-Men movie dragged out for about 20 minutes too long. The script is weak and unfortunately dumbed down and needlessly mindlessly violent. Without ruining the film... you're going to ask yourself why the young girl doesn't talk. Cheap, exploitative tricks like this and a really rushed, dumb ending (because we need the same Kodak moment in every film) make this a pretty boring, droll drag of a film that is camouflaged in a deeper ""so this is what happens when X-Men get old!"" There was nothing deep about it.The lazy script leaves open gaping holes but I won't repeat them as a spoiler. Just be prepared to realize that this is a much lesser film than is being lauded here. People feel they must praise Jackman's departure as well as Stewart. If it wasn't for their excellent acting, this film would have gone quickly to cable.Notable are excellent special effects. I give them credit for seamless visuals. But the violence in this film was gratuitous and stupid, running into the face of danger like Superman. And at the end, after hearing all of this ""we perfected it"" rubbish, you'll have to wonder why the movie resembles Highlander. There can only be one. Really? Why is that?Don't kid yourself.

Beautiful and emotional swansong,"I'm emotionally devastated right now. I'm a fan of the ""X-Men"" saga and I heard this was Hugh Jackman's swansong to the character of Wolverine. Meaning he intends this to be his final time playing that part. And plus he is caring for a weak and humble Patrick Stewart. So I was already invested and a bit emotional going in because I got sad seeing these two characters in this state. These are people I care for and I feel like I know them at this point. There's been so many films with them and it all lead up to this moment. I wasn't sure if I was ready for it, but I went in and... It exceeded my expectations. I loved it. I'm not gonna spoil anything because I think you should see. I don't even know what to write really, I'm really speechless.This is a film that dares to go the extra mile and I applaud them for making an honest humble story and not this big extravaganza. Here the story and characters come first before all the action. Which I gotta say, The action was fantastic. It's extremely brutal and violent. Patrick Stewart gives a heartbreaking performance that's full of range. He is funny, crazy and wise. You feel really bad for him and seeing him be happy and remind Logan of the good values in life really got me. Hugh Jackman is phenomenal. This is ""THE"" performance from him.It's a tragic movie too. A lot of scenes actually made me teary eyed. There's so much in this that broke me that I'm still unable to shake the emotions off. This film is something special. I will say that this is the first time I've seen an entire audience stay until the credits ended. Why you ask? Well, because everyone was waiting for a Post-credit scene. There is no extra scene at the end, so you don't have to wait. Some guys started booing because there was nothing extra. I usually stay for the credits, but I don't think this movie needed an extra scene. It's perfect as it is. One negative I can find is that villain was stock. There's not much to him.That's it for now. I could talk about this film for hours, but I would have to go into Spoiler territory. My overall thoughts are that I think it's phenomenally exciting and heartbreaking. Go watch it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"A near perfect swan song for Hugh Jackman's grounded, ragged, and above all anamalistic portrayal of the Wolverine.","Over the course of my lifetime, I have heard countless stories of actors and actresses, before my time, becoming icons through breakout roles that would become synonymous with their very name. However, as previously stated, most of these roles were either before my time. Never did I expect to see the emergence of an unknown Australian stage actor that I would grow up with for the next 17 years over the course of 9 movies, 3 Spidermen, 2 Batmen, 2 Supermen, and 2 Hulks. Hugh Jackman has embodied the Wolverine character in a way that has changed the way people perceive the the comic book counterpart. Whether its his image, voice, personality, or any other trait, Jackman has become inseparable from the Wolverine character. A feat that I am really overjoyed to have experienced growing up, and was genuinely sad to let go heading into this movie.Anyway with that out the way, the movie itself is an absolute masterpiece. It not only provides the most accurate incarnation of Logan, but also takes the time to explore a broken side of Charles Xavier we've never seen. Then finishes with the introduction of X-23 who has the strong potential to be just as popular as her father.The introduction, interaction, and insight into these characters proves to be the strongest element of this film. The relationship between Logan and Xavier developed over the course of the past 16 movies finally has its payoff as every scene packs the emotional weight that hasn't been experienced in a superhero movie yet.These relationships then help in the introduction and explanation of Laura.In discussing breakout movie roles for actors and actresses, Dafne Keen may quickly find herself on that list. Portraying a mutant is already difficult enough, but not having any dialogue for the first half of the film while also playing the daughter of the Wolverine, its a tough task for even the most ""expert"" actors. This girl handles her role with such skill that allows her to stand out in a scene with Patrick Stewart and Hugh Jackman. That's without even mentioning her brutality once the claws come out!!I could go on and on about these characters, performances, and I haven't even gotten to the action yet, but no movie is without its flaws. Logan primarily struggles with its villains their motivations. Both villains while given an ample amount of attention, don't really shine essentially due to their vague and simple motivations.This is however combated by the presence of a lethal threat which provides a nice twist that was entirely unexpected.So this is it. James Mangold, 20th Century Fox, and Hugh Jackman save their best for last with an all-time great movie that once again transcends the ""superhero"" genre. This classification will unfortunately immediately cause many to compare it to the Dark Knight which has and will always reign king among this newly found category of superhero movies. While I would stray away from making these comparisons myself, I will state that Logan does a number of better than this seemingly untouchable movie. It truly is a near perfect film to end Hugh Jackman's on-screen portrayal of an all- time great comic book hero, James/Logan Howlett AKA Weapon X AKA The Wolverine.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

R ratings don't equal better movies.,"This is my first review even though I have been a member here since late 90's early 2000s. This is due to the fact that I don't understand the love for this movie.This movie stumbles about trying to figure out how to be a road trip movie with a western genre landscape and superhero theme. The result is a pretentious sloppy mess that takes itself too serious while giving very little regard to the films that led to this one.The fans that requested an ""R"" rating did so with the thinking that it would open up the film to be more free with the character. Instead it felt like it was pigeon holed into justifying the R rating from the senseless breast flashing to random F-bombs that don't fit the characters as presented previously in the last 17 years.The 2:21 run time seemed to drag past three hours as I felt a lack of empathy for any of the characters as they are not fully developed and flushed but rather used as props for beautiful shots against the desert and country roads of Mexico and rural America.Logan's disregard to the other characters in the film was forced and lacked any connection to the empathetic character we were introduced to in the original X-Men film in which we were introduced to a character that felt compelled to help Marie D'Ancanto after encountering her on the road. Logan, though he has tried to be a loner, never really was a loner without any empathy. That is until this movie and the motivation for this lack of empathy towards a little girl and her issues is troubling as a movie goer.I can not find a reason to recommend this movie or to see it again outside of the beautiful cinematography throughout the film.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
The Best Superhero Movie in Quite Some Time,"Logan follows the remaining X-Men in the distant future, where most mutants have long since gone extinct. A young girl comes to their door with a group of threatening people looking for her, thus beginning Logan's attempt to help her escape.As this is Hugh Jackman's last portrayal of Logan AKA Wolverine, it had high stakes. Personally I didn't expect this level of quality from it, considering how most of these big blockbusters tend to go in the direction of lackluster.Logan is a heavy movie. It is fantastically performed by both Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart, and the emotion they are able to infuse within the audience is more powerful than anything I've seen in the series thus far. The content itself is hard-hitting, thanks to a fantastic script, and as a whole this proves to be a huge step in an entirely different direction for the franchise. And that's a good thing.The R rating allows the movie to reach this level of heaviness, and with that weight comes some pretty awesome, but brutal, violence. Despite the warnings I received about how brutal the introduction alone was, I still managed to be surprised by it. The movie doesn't hold back, but it doesn't overdo it either. It's just right, and just right is exactly where I wanted it to be.The movie does a fantastic job of building atmosphere. It's dark, it's gritty, and it really feels like the end of the world. And in the context of the movie, I'm pretty sure that was the case.Overall Logan is a fantastic end to an already good series, and proves to be the best of that series, at least in my eyes. It's dark and gritty, but also well-acted, well-written, and never overdone. I can't wait to see this one again when it leaves theaters, and in the end I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Quasi-""superhero"" movie focusing on the grim reality behind the comic book","Released in 2017 and directed by James Mangold, ""Logan"" takes place in 2029 when loner Logan, aka Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), is a weary Uber driver near the border in West Texas. No new mutant has been birthed for 25 years and Wolvie lives with the Alzheimer's-suffering Professor X (Patrick Stewart) and the albino mutant-tracking Caliban (Stephen Merchant) in an abandoned smelting plant across the border. After a mysterious new mutant girl enters the picture (Dafne Keen), Logan, Xavier and the lass flee for possible sanctuary in North Dakota hounded by a malevolent security team from the dubious corporation in which the girl originated. Donald Pierce plays the arrogant cybernetics-enhanced chief of security.This is the third and arguably the best Wolverine movie, although I slightly prefer 2009's underrated ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" (2013's ""Wolverine"" was okay, but overall meh). ""Logan"" focuses on aging & death contrasted by new birth and the potential thereof. For a superhero flick, it's gritty realistic with compelling drama & characters and an entertaining road trip, not to mention loads of hard R-rated violence. The movie explores the possibilities of what would happen when high-powered mutants become aged and diseased.Some of classic Marvel Comics' best moments were when one of their superheroes, e.g. The Thing or The Black Panther, was thrust into an everyday scenario, like talking to regular folks on the street or shopping at the market. There's a lot of this in ""Logan."" It dares to slow things down and focus on the characters and is the better for it. One of the best extended sequences is the trio's meeting with a hospitable black family (Eriq La Salle, Elise Neal & Quincy Fouse) after a highway mishap somewhere north of Oklahoma City. This episode is Exhibit A in why ""superheroes"" can't mix with regular folk for too long, for their own welfare.""Logan"" ranks with the best superhero movies because, like 2009's ""Watchmen,"" it dares to be different. It's anything BUT a conventional superhero flick. Unfortunately, it's overlong at 141 minutes. The movie should've ended shortly after the trio's arrival to their destination, with some kind of potent dramatic close. But the filmmakers insisted on tacking on yet ANOTHER action-packed attack by the antagonists and it therefore ends on a tedious, redundant note. Disregarding this caveat, ""Logan"" is a great 'superhero' flick.My favorite mutant, by the way, is the chubby black boy.The film was shot in Rio Rancho, New Mexico; Newhall, California; and Pauls Valley & Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The screenplay was written by director Mangold, Scott Frank & Michael Green.GRADE: A-",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A great movie to end a legacy.....,"Well personally, If you are an action fan who wants more action than anything else than this movie may not be for you.

One Last Ride for 2 Amazing Actors in Iconic Roles,"After 17 Years debuting in the X-men Franchise, Hugh Jackman exits the role as Wolverine, a troubled loner with a heart of gold and claws of Adamantium.In the future of 2029, Mutants have almost become extinct. Logan, living with a dementia ridden Professor Xavier and a mutant recluse named Caliban, turns his back on mutant kind, instead attempting to make a living as a limousine driver to retire to the ocean. However, Logan's fate is changed when she meets a young girl with mutant powers very similar to his own.The Live Action X-Men franchise has often been accused of being disrespectful to the source material (or rather the more fantastical elements of said source material such as the Dinosaurs in present day of the Savage Land or the space opera adventures of the Starjammers), in an age where Marvel Studios explores space with Guardians of the Galaxy or the microscopic world with Ant-Man.In Logan, that grounded reality works to the benefit of movie. Instead of visual spectacle and technicolor explosions, the action grim, grounded and folded to reality. Unlike other attempts to 'mature' the genre through simple additions of profanity and violence, Logan uses its R rating to tell a more character driven story, showing broken old men at the end of their ropes. After years of a PG-13 rating, the R rating doesn't simply add blood and gore, but a sense of melancholy and bleakness other films of the same genre do not have.Logan has been described as the mainstream Superhero Western, a fair comparison since Superheroes have often been compared to the Western Boom of the 50's while scenes of 1953's Shane plays during a scene.The actors are fully giving it their all in this picture. Hugh Jackman has always had incredible range as an actor, but his turn as Wolverine is the thing that made him a star. It's only with an actor of his caliber and the age of playing the role for so long that you can get a performance of this magnitude with the emotional weight it deserves. Just the same, the usually reserved Patrick Stewart completely subverts his role as the kindly understanding Professor Xavier to a rambling, cynical cranky old man with a form of Alzheimer's. But, Dafne Keen will ultimately come out as the highlight of the film. It's hard to get children actors to put out a role of this magnitude but Keen's Laura manages to be both convincing as a child who's exploring the world for the first time and a violent killer in other scenes.The action set pieces are astounding. The fight choreography is stable, the edits manage to feel coherent and the amount of chopped limbs, be-headings and spilled blood makes for a gory good time.It's unclear where the X-men Franchise can go from here. After the critical disappointment of X-Men: Apocalypse but the financial success of Deadpool, fans have been counting the days when 20th Century Fox will sell the film rights back to Marvel Studios so the Mutants can become part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. But, for the payoff we received at the end, Logan is worth the 17 years worth of X-Men films (Some Good, Some Bad, Most Mediocre) to see two actors have one last ride in what was some of the iconic roles in Superhero film history.See it!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Tuning into the year 2050...,"IMDb of course will still be here. In fact, in previous reviews I have suggested that by then the IMDb database which by then will be many times the size it is now, will be available for implant in newborns.

A beautiful send off to the character,"Ever since the first trailer with Johnny Cash's 'Hurt' in the background was released, Logan looked special. From the locale, cinematography, and Hugh Jackman's performance, Logan is a radical departure from what we have seen in previous X-Men films.Part of what I enjoyed about Logan was its smaller scope and more personable nature in relation to its narrative and characters. This is not a film about the action or the 'end of the world' narrative that we are so used to seeing in the genre. When we are first introduced to Logan, he is an alcoholic and devoid of any hope. His healing factor isn't working as well as it once was and the scars from his battles do not fade away like they once used to. Whilst working as a chauffeur during the night, he looks after a now helpless, Professor X in his desolate home. Xavier battles with Alzheimer's disease but also his own powers, which have unwillingly turned him into the most powerful weapon to exist. There is a rather interesting backstory regarding Xavier in the film. The characters are a far cry from previous portrayals. For instance, they are more vulgar as the film is Rated R. It was slightly odd to hear Xavier swear, but the swearing is not for the sake of giving the film its rating, but moreover to relate to its darker, gloomy tone. The introduction of Laura, played by newcomer Dafne Keen, becomes a catalyst in the narrative going forward. From the trailers, it was made clear that she is in fact X-23, a mutant who shares the same genes as Wolverine. Their relationship is beautifully conceived and leads to some great character development. Laura is brutal and feral, yet at the same time rather cute. That's quite a lethal combination! As a character, Laura is hard not to like, through her childish innocence, but also her dark history, which is one aspect of the film that helps give reason to the Rated-R.Another aspect of the film I really enjoyed was its cinematography. Being set in New Mexico gave the film a warm, orange tint in the desert scenes that helped the film to look gorgeous. Aesthetically it helps to make Logan feel like an indie film. The camera work was thoughtful, particularly during the slower scenes, less so in the action. To elaborate, the camera work and slow paced nature of the film allowed me to connect with the characters. The action scenes worked in the sense that they really demonstrated the strength and brutality of the characters. Director James Mangold doesn't hold back and I loved it.Marco Beltrami's score is not overly emphatic but it helps connote the right emotion given the scenes. It too is a departure from the often dramatic scores of many superhero films and is instead more humble and soft.Part of why this film works is because we have seen Wolverine and Xavier's evolution as characters over the past 17 years and as such have an attachment to them. Their acts in this film will shock and surprise you. Hugh Jackman's self-professed final performance as the character is his best yet. He takes the character in directions we have yet to see him, as a father figure for example. Logan is truly a beautiful send off to a character who become a pivotal part of the franchise and its previous success.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Logan elevates the genre to new heights by stripping down the character to its essentials,"Barely even a superhero film, Logan elevates the genre to new heights by stripping down the character to its essentials and presents them in a powerful and emotionally moving tale about a worn-out man who has to find the hero who existed within him before.Logan has incredible direction. The standout is the R-rated action. All the gore and blood is utilized to visceral effect as the audience is carried from scene to scene following the characters. The western style and overtone of nihilism is perfectly captured by the barrenness and roughness of the production design. The score is a mix of melodies and orchestra capturing the essence of the moments and themes of the film.Character interactions are at the center of the film. The development of the characters are presented through subtle and emotionally resonant dialogue. The minimal dialogue draws the audience to the incredible and moving performances of the cast. Hugh Jackman fully embodies the worn-out hero who lives just to survive and has lost his sense of heroism or purpose of living. His performance draws us into his broken down world where little hope exists. Patrick Stewart, as Professor X, plays the opposite character with lively optimism and enduring hope. Laura, played by Dafne Keen, is the symbol of hope in the film and the vehicle through which Logan changes as a character. Boyd Holbrook, as Donald Pierce, plays the unrelenting villain who chases the protagonists and drives the plot of the film.Logan is not without its message. The film is a critique of unethical human experimentation and it hammers the point that it is more evil when done for the purposes of profit and power. X-Men related characters were created to highlight minority issues and the film is the best adaption of that purpose. It is also about the majority-minority power struggle and how each side acts and reacts against the other.Superhero films as an artform are rare, Logan is one of them.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Brutally Unforgiving,"Charles Xavier: You know, Logan. This was, without a doubt, the most perfect night I've had in a very long time... and I don't deserve it, do I?I don't know if it's just me but I love movies with a conclusion. I'm all for huge sprawling storylines but I like the ending. You always want more but at some point it all has to end. Logan does this perfectly. We see Logan who is old now, his body deteriorating and his mutant powers failing on him slowly. He's an alcoholic and he just wants to die. He has nothing to fight for anymore except Charles. Who is now borderline senile and has seizures that are capable of paralyzingly and killing all those around him.Logan is beaten down and although he still has fight left in him he knows his end is coming. He soon meets X-23 or Laura. A mutant who has powers like him. The film follows them as Logan tries to bring Laura to Eden, a place that she can be safe. You start off and you don't really care for Laura but by the end the relationship between Logan and Laura is heartfelt touching and sweet.This movie is brutal. I truly mean it. I like how now studios aren't scared to make a movie a hard R. This movie is brutal and violent and it feels like the wolverine movie we've needed for a long time. Hugh Jackman does a brilliant job as always. The conclusions to Logan's storyline feels fleshed out and real. Not like they just threw it all together. It feels real and like any amazing movie should make you feel.I saw this a year or so ago and coming back to it now was so much more powerful. I can't say a whole lot because I don't want to give spoilers but this movie is depressing. Really
Depressing. If you go into this expecting a fun Quicksilver time in a bottle type movie you're mistaken. This movie is brutal raw and real and keeps with the racism theme of the other X-Men films but puts it to the side a bit to focus on Logan and I'm honestly fine with that.The ""villain"" is basically in my opinion just in there to drive the plot forward. This is a character driven movie through and through about a man with nothing to live for just waiting to die who is suddenly thrust back into his old life and has to deal with the death and destruction that follows him.It takes a bit to pick up but once it does it's brilliant. This is the best X-Men film I've seen and a spectacular one all around. Please see this if you're ready to get your heart strings pulled on.

Best CBM ever?,"I've re-watched Logan endless times and I was pondering whether it is the greatest Comic Book Movie (CBM) of all time.

A new type of western,"My initial reaction to this movie was one of disappointment. What I heard was a triumph of a movie was in reality a cliche plot with failing heroes and a redneck villain. What?
Then I thought about this film in light of the other movies. People say it's the best standalone X-men film, but in reality it is the culmination of the others. The wanton killing, abuse of the manipulation of time, and repeated ignoring of a reasonable course of action has indeed freed the world from cataclysmic disaster, but has not given Logan more power. It's taken his toll, and now he dodders around, struggling to support a senile old man and save one little girl. It's not fanfare and parades that hail the return of wolverine but a failing liver and many unintentional naps. It makes so much sense, and it gives the film significance.
Logan has little new to offer in terms of traditional action films. But as a revolutionary take on the genre and an emotional exploration of Logan and Professor X, it truly is an incredible film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

A slog through depressing Western tropes...starring Wolverine,"This movie is a Western. Let me get this out of the way first and foremost- I love westerns. I do not like westerns that remove the tropes, allegory, and character arcs from the setting of the old west and transpose it somewhere else. Perhaps that is just my opinion, but the setting is intrinsic to a large part of the narratives that westerns often use.Director James Mangold clearly loves films like The Searchers, True Grit, A Fistful of Dollars, and Shane- Logan is rife with references. It telegraphs the plot, uses very obvious foreshadowing, and paints its obvious plot out for you. You know what's going to happen, in spite of how much you don't want it to. And I really didn't want it to.This film has zero fun factor whatsoever. It's a hideously depressing film, one that doesn't celebrate the history of the character of Wolverine or use him in the comic-book context with which we are so accustomed. Instead, this hyper-realistic version of the universe has just about everything that could turn off someone looking to have fun. Perhaps brutal nihilism in the face of your own growing mortality is one person's idea of a good superhero movie. Not for me. This is Wolverine, not Neil Gaiman or Jhonen Vasquez creations.Perhaps this is why the film got such a great reception: it is not a prototypical superhero film. But it isn't a very ambitious film, either, just a film that plays with genre expectations in one specific way in order to completely copy elements of older films. Even the cinematography is lengthy, uninspired, and wholly traditional. Even the plot follows a rinse-repeat formula reminiscent of the Man with No Name films. The saving grace of the film stems from its obvious influences, because if you copy enough good movies you'll eventually make some good narrative choices. The plot isn't bad, it's derivative. The movie isn't poorly made, it's poorly conceived.I simply ask one thing of superhero and comic book films: Even if it is dark or r-rated, it still has to be entertaining. Logan is not. It;'s anti-fun, sucking energy from every person who views it. Logan has some fantastic performances and calls back to a lot of great old Westerns, but it's not a good superhero movie because it made me uncomfortably depressed, bored, and begrudgingly disappointed at how traditional, derivative, and copycat the movie is, and how much it utterly failed at being fun.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Some early scenes with Logan and Charles have some great writingConsNone!Overall, I thought 'Logan' was sensational and for me it is easily the best Wolverine film and if we could compare it to the X-Men films, then I would also put 'Logan' at the top of that list. Yes, it's a film that oozes emotion out of the audience and your meant to feel that way, but I will certainly be watching this over and over again.

A fitting send off,"The thing I liked most about this movie was that it dealt with real issues. I am not obviously referring to cyborgs and mutants etc. Although at heart a superhero movie it was more of a toad trip where those on the ride, whilst being hunted down had to deal with the real issues of getting old, dementia, deteriorating health, not being the person you once were, realising (for some) you don't really fit in, loneliness and also loss and grieving. Many of these things our hero Wolvie has had to deal with throughout his long life but the aging and health issues are all new for him. In the past he never really had a family or loved ones but the X-Men became his family and he began to care and love. Now, mostly on his own, in pain, the loss and loneliness is kicking in and in many ways he can see the real curse of his once non ageing and healing powers. It's sad at times, often fun and joyous and also incredibly violent. The violence set the tone for what is now becoming a genre of its own, the adult superhero movie. Refreshing in so many ways.

An Epic Journey of an amazing character,"So even though I have watched The New Mutants, I still have a few X-Men films left to watch and the next one is the film Logan and here is my review for it. The premise of the film is set in the future and sees an older Wolverine looking after Charles Xavier when a young mutant comes into their lives and force them on the run.Main Character
Hugh Jackman has become famous for playing the role of Logan/Wolverine and in his final appearance in the role he gives his best performance to date. The fact he wasn't nominated for an Oscar for his performance here was an injustice as he truly deserved it for a mammoth truly emotional performance. We see a Logan worn down and fed up of life, he struggles throughout the movie and it really feels like the world has caught up with him and he is actually in danger, which has been something X-Men films have struggled with. Also this film having a more mature adult feeling means we finally get to see Jackman go full berserker Wolverine and it is fabulous and absolutely brutal.Supporting Characters
Sir Patrick Stewart is back one last time as Charles Xavier and similar to Jackman he is brilliant here. The father figure and strong character is gone, replaced with a weak and damaged man that has gone through a lot. The dynamic between Charles and Logan is fascinating here, as it really feels like the roles have reversed and that Logan has to look after Charles which is great to see. Dafne Keen makes her film debut as X-23 and she is fantastic, she has hardly any dialogue but you can't help but care about her and I really bought into her relationship with Logan and where it grows. The dynamic between these characters is really the thing that carries the movie and you really care about these characters and it really drives this movie. Stephen Merchant, Boyd Holbrook and Richard E Grant also all do good jobs in their smaller roles here.Story
Now even though this film has characters from the X-Men universe, this couldn't be further away from an X-Men film. It really focuses on the characters and the damage that has occurred to them over their lives and why they need to go on living for this young girl. As I mentioned above, the relationships between the characters and the friendship is what gives this movie weight and plenty of heart. It is a tragic story but a really well told one that fits the characters perfectly.Script
The script is really great, this world is so gritty and there is drama galore. The more mature writing fits the film perfectly and really shows where the characters are, especially Xavier when you consider what he has been like in the previous films. There are also little drops of humour too which is nice to see and ensures Wolverine still has those moments even if they aren't always meant to be funny.Style
The style is brilliant, this world they created for the film fits so well, it is dark, dirty and gritty and it really feels like the end of days for the mutants. The R rating for this film was the right choice, the action is brutal and violent and it adds to this films story and the way it is presented. It is such an emotional ride that is paced really well and keeps you interested throughout.Overall
Overall, this is a brilliant film, whether you are an X-Men, Wolverine or just film fan then you owe it to yourself to watch this movie. It is an emotional roller coaster and by focusing on it's character give a story and journey that you won't forget.Rating - 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Probably the best comic book movie,Logan is the definition of doing a character from a comic book accurate. Putting a good end to the character.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Uncompromising comic book neo-western packs a punch,"This down-and-dirty 'X-Men' spin-off takes its cues from classic westerns, specifically 'Unforgiven', and presents a compelling and surprisingly emotional take on cinematic comic book characters who had started to feel somewhat worn out. Ironically, this final chapter of the old guard rejuvenates what had become a stale and predictable franchise.Hugh Jackman reprises his animalistic icon and the role now fits him like a well-worn boxing glove, only this time he imbues Wolverine with such a sense of irreparable brokenness and emotional gravitas that it ranks as one of his finest performances to date. Patrick Stewart also shows us some of his best work as an ailing Charles Xavier, no longer the stable source of wisdom and serenity, but instead a fragile old man suffering through an illness of the mind that has robbed him of his dignity. If you strip away the fantasy then this is about two ageing men – one a fallen war hero turned washed-up alcoholic and the other a former community leader turned lonely, Alzheimer's-ridden geriatric. Together, Jackman and Stewart make for the most compelling and unexpectedly touching double act. They turn a comic book western into something of a fragile buddy movie cum pseudo father/son story and their chemistry makes the film work.There are issues with 'Logan' that stop it from realising its full potential though. The first hour is almost without fault: it's affecting and tense, full of pain and anger and grit and snarl, punctuated by salty dialogue, soulful performances, and bloody, brutal action set-pieces that pull no punches. However, as we switch gears into the third act, things begin to fall back on formula, especially once we meet the 'big bad' of the piece and lose an old friend in the process. The film loses something as a story after that and devolves into more standard comic book action adventure fare, particularly with its woodland-set climax that looks closer in spirit to the ramped-up silliness of 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine' than the dusty, dirty western-inspired imagery of the previous 100 minutes.But I won't get too bogged down in the negative because there is much to celebrate here. This is really brilliant stuff, commendable for the risks it takes, more so because it is produced by a candy floss factory of blockbuster entertainment that usually assembly lines its products to be sweet and light. And there ain't no candy to be found with this flick. It's bloody, it's brutal and it's emotional. It's everything you could want from a mature comic book film really. 'Logan' engages with its key theme of growing old both in tender and tough ways, so much so that you forget you're watching an 'X-Men' film half of the time, while director James Mangold finally fulfils the promise he once showed (20 odd years ago no less) with his own magnum opus and neo-western 'Cop Land'. Even with my reservations about the last 30 mins, 'Logan' is still a magnificently made, uncompromising superhero film that has absolutely no interest in being a superhero film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Brutal & Brilliant!,"The third and final Wolverine film following X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009) and The Wolverine (2013), 'Logan' is the darkest & also THE most brutal X-Men film to date. Director James Mangold & Lead-Star Hugh Jackman returning for one last time as Logan/Wolverine, deliver a superhero film, that's Super in its truest sense. The one's an emotional, gruesome, gritty & powerful film, that holds your attention, despite excessive violence. Faint-Hearts please stay away, but those who relish Hardcore stuff, Grab A Ticket Now!'Logan' Synopsis: In the near future, a weary Logan cares for an ailing Professor X in a hide out on the Mexican border. But Logan's attempts to hide from the world and his legacy are up-ended when a young mutant arrives, being pursued by dark forces.'Logan' explores very less of Wolverine's journey, its all about Logan this time. 'Logan' is a character study of a superhero finally off his prime & facing enemies who are stronger than him. Even his life may end, for someone to whom immorality was certain. And that's exactly why 'Logan' works so hugely. The narrative is about Logan's constant fight to survive as well protect his mentor & a young mutant, who's on the run. The villains are ruthless & Logan's fight against them, is clap-worthy.The Violence is too much though. I'm not complaining here, I mean a superhero with claws so sharp can't be projected with fake juicy blood, but the bloodshed here is rather disturbing. Whenever there is action up on screen, its brutal & unforgiving. The finale, particularly, is no-holds-barred. Don't tell me later I didn't warn you, dear faint-hearts!The biggest triumph of 'Logan' is its emotional connect. Logan & the young mutant girl, share a wonderful relationship here, as does Profresser Xavier. The connect among them, despite all the brutality around, forms 'Logan' in its entirety. I was engrossed & even concerned about Logan & Co. here, I was connected with them & was rooting for them when they fought the evil-heads.Scott Frank, James Mangold & Michael Green's Screenplay is intense & engaging. Its all-out brutality, with strong emotional undercurrents. The Writing, though predictable at times, is thoroughly arresting. Mangold's Direction is excellent. He's handled the film with authority. Cinematography & Editing are very good. Action-Sequences/Stunts are spectacular & pushes the 'R Rating' with force. Art & Costume Design are perfect. Graphics are top-class. Background Score & Make-Up, merit a special mention.Performance-Wise: Hugh Jackman returns as Logan/ Wolverine for one last time & he's in terrific form. Right form his broken body-language, to the aggression he expresses when the claws are out & to the softness he emotes when building a connection with the little girl, Jackman brings fabulous layers to his portrayal. This is the best performance Jackman has delivered being Logan/Wolverine. Sir Patrick Stewart as Charles Xavier/Professor X, is remarkable. The Screen Legend adds tremendous depth to the part & shines in every scene he appears in. Dafne Keen as Laura, is a surprise packet. She's electrifying! Boyd Holbrook as Donald Pierce, is menacing to the core. And is it ironic that the chief villain here is named Donald?? Elizabeth Rodriguez as Gabriella, does well in a brief role. Others lend good support.On the whole, 'Logan' is Brutal & Brilliant! Two Thumbs Up!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

"A Gritty, Heartfelt Send-Off for a Legendary Character","In purely literal terms, Logan is a comic book movie. However, it's a significant departure from the standard comic book movie formula. It does not have a super-powerful threat intent on destroying the city/world/universe. It does not have a gigantic CGI battle sequence. It does not have a contrived romance subplot. It doesn't even depend on the audience having seen some number of previous films to understand the plot or character motivations. And it certainly wasn't made for the standard PG-13 audience. Instead, Logan plays out in way that could perhaps best be described as an extremely intense, violent, and emotional family road trip. And as strange as that may sound, it works almost perfectly.The tone of the film is one of weariness and struggle; from very early on it is made clear that Logan and Professor Xavier are in hiding. The look of the characters and world itself both reflect this tone perfectly; Logan and Xavier both look like they've seen better days. Not long after the film begins, Logan becomes the begrudging guardian to a seemingly mute young girl, Laura, who is being hunted by dangerous people. What follows is a road trip across the country, punctuated by a mix of quiet, heartfelt moments and brutal, unforgiving clashes. The tension of being pursued is a constant driving force giving our characters' actions a sense of purpose, and keeping the audience engaged at all times.If I were to note a flaw with this otherwise very strong story, it would be the abrupt introduction of a large number of characters towards the end of the film. They are mentioned previously, but they aren't really developed beyond the bare minimum. They weren't particularly necessary to the ending, and it is hard to care about them seeing as we barely know them. I couldn't help but find myself thinking that if they were written out of the story it would have been more focused overall.That being said, the three main characters work perfectly together as a strange little family, and they are developed in such a way so as to not alienate viewers who have never seen any of the other X-Men movies. The villains are also threatening and scary throughout while still being completely believable, albeit fairly one-dimensional. The near-future world in which the events take place is also a very grounded and believable one instead of a monolithic comic book fantasy world. References to events in past films are also minimal, though they reward people for following this character through his various past adventures. The ending is incredibly satisfying.Overall, Logan is a highly compelling standalone film that can even entertain crowds that have no interest in comic books or the movies based on them. It is one of the rare comic book movies that transcends being great within the comic book genre to being simply great, period.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Stunning Tribute To The ICONIC Wolverine,"Half-man, half-beast. A brooding, violent mass of rage who shreds to pieces anyone foolish enough to stand in his way. Isn't that what all of us Marvel fans envision when we hear the name Wolverine?I was a bit disappointed when I saw the trailer for Logan. The fierce anti hero we're familiar with is a shell of his former self. Suffering from pain and drudging through day-to-day life. Far from the short-tempered badass that characterizes Wolverine.I went to view Logan with low expectations and sense of loyalty. After all, Hugh Jackman is nearing 50 years of age. His hard work and determination to give us a final Wolverine performance is admirable (hopefully I can deadlift half the weight he does at his age).The plot is set in 2029, with Logan making a living as an alcoholic limousine chauffeur - while doing his best to look after an ailing Professor X. The tone is dark, gritty and somber. Unsurprisingly, Logan's attempts to hide away from the world is botched when a young girl shows up in his life.The movie starts off depressing and slow, but the pace ramps up quickly. Rage-fueled slashing and hacking? Delivered in spades. The action scenes are extremely violent and gory. The R-rating is well deserved.Hugh Jackman gives his best performance to date. He portrays Wolverine's nuances and inner struggles flawlessly. Dafne Keen, who portrays the young mutant Laura, gives an amazing performance as well (looking forward to her future roles). And Patrick Stewart delivers an exceptional performance as Professor X.Overall, Logan blew away my expectations. As the credits rolled, I felt highly satisfied - and sad that Jackman's role of the character had come to an end. He reveals a vulnerable, humanistic side of Wolverine I'd never imagined - without omitting the ferocious, savage aspects we all know and love.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Believable Brutality Makes Logan Outstanding,"Not since the first Iron Man have I left a superhero movie as satisfied as I was after seeing Logan. There are a few factors that pull this hero flick into an exclusive group of its own - and for good reason.It may sound typical, but basic brutality and gore are what hero films have lacked in recent years. How many times can we watch an Avengers fight scene and feel a tad underwhelmed? Logan's intense and at sometimes dark violence makes you actually witness the pure epic slasher that the Wolverine is supposed to be. Time after time I found myself actually putting my hand over my mouth in pure awe during the fight sequences of this absolutely shocking take on the Wolverine.But it isn't pure blood-soaking fight scenes that put this film over the hill. Logan in all actuality has a story, a good story - and in relation to most other superhero movies, a great story. Not once did I find myself waiting for the dialogue to end in order for the action to begin. This movie is the perfect action thriller that has a story that keeps you engaged until the very end.I only have a few minor complaints that keep this movie from earning a perfect score. I do not mind ""inappropriate"" language in movies; in fact I think that different examples of crude language can greatly add to the effect of a film. However, I think with Wolverine earning the ""R"" rating - they went a little over the top and in some moments were just lazy with dialogue. The other very minor thing, is I thought Dafne Keen was slightly annoying. In terms of child actors she was fine, but her repetitive screams and yells were irking.Logan is the closest thing I've seen to a perfect superhero movie in a long time. The characters are dynamic, the story inviting, and the action brutal. I couldn't have asked for more out of this film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Major violence, foul language and sadness abounds","I read a few other reviews and cannot imagine how this movie could be called a beautiful swan song for Logan or Xavier. Logan is a grumpy old alcoholic with lethal tendencies who is soured by the horrors of his life. The story in this movie confirms that he has good reason to be this way. It was not my kind of comic book material. I only give it a 7 because it wasn't horrible as a movie. Just really over the top with swearing and horrific reality-based violence compared with other X- Men movies. I rate it less than other X-Men movies because the mutant powers are not shown as much as I think they could have been, other than the heavy use of claws. For example - Caliban was a pretty important character and I don't feel we really ever knew what his mutant power was. Certainly it wasn't just being sensitive to sunlight.On a side note about Xavier. We saw him die in X-Men: The Last Stand. Then we saw him alive at the end of The Wolverine, at a time Logan was grieving dead Jean Grey. Logan looked surprised at Xavier's appearance but there was no explanation other than ""I have a few tricks up my sleeve"". I am wondering if this was explained in Days of Future Past and I just don't remember it. His death back in The Last Stand really hit hard and he was dead a good 7 years between movies, only to be alive up until the year 2029 and well, you will know when you see the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

One of the best in the franchise,"This is the ninth movie in the X-Men franchise (I've seen them all) and the third of the stand-alone ""Wolverine"" films, but this really is an X-Men movie like no other. In characterisation, narrative, location and style, it stands apart but is entirely consistent with the others and brings the story to a most satisfying conclusion.Set in 2029 when mutants are all but extinct and located in a bleached terrain on the Tex-Mex border, we find adamantium-clawed Logan aka Wolverine (Hugh Jackson) and wheelchair-bound Charlers Xavier aka Professor X (Patrick Stewart) as we've never seen them before: fragile, failing, vulnerable and ultimately in terminal decline. In thespian terms, this raises the bar for both Jackman and Stewart who are able to deliver more nuanced performances than one usually finds in super-hero movies. They are being chased by the bad guys from Transigen in a fleet of heavy, black vehicles commanded by a metal-armed cyborg, so this is part a road movie (with elements of ""Mad Max: Fury Road"") and part an elegiac western (with echoes of ""Unforgiven"" and clips from ""Shane"").But this is the most viscerally violent and outright bloody X-Men work of them all with perforated chests and rolling heads, not just from Wolverine and X-24 but also from 11 year old girl mutant Laura/X-23 (played amazingly by English-Spanish child actress Dafne Keen).It's 17 years since we first met the X-Men on the big screen and Jackman as Wolverine has appeared in them all. The three stand-alone Wolverine films have been ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" (2009), ""The Wolverine"" (2013) and now (2017) ""Logan"" (note the human name). James Mangold directed the last two and this time originated the story and co-wrote the screenplay and he can be proud of a truly exciting and entertaining piece of work that is one of the very best in the franchise. Although possibly a little too long, ""Logan"" opens strongly, it is well paced, and the ending is poignant yet uplifting. But. unlike most Marvel movies, there is no end credit scene - I told you it was different.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

A good sendoff,"Finally a X-Men/Wolverine movie with heart. More of a stand-alone really, disconnected from the previous ones - which is a good thing.

No other superhero movie can compare,"It's violent, it's very dark, and in the end it's notably depressing. But 'Logan' is also exciting, deeply engrossing, and ultimately unexpectedly fulfilling. And it's quite possibly the single best live-action superhero or comic book movie that has been made to date.The genre was all but reinvented when the Marvel Cinematic Universe launched with the first Iron Man film in 2008, and the MCU has since largely defined the standard for comic book movies. That's a double-edged sword: Every new superhero blockbuster now has to have heroes that are as snarky and sarcastic as they are superhumanly powerful. There's room for humor that is more clever, and for deeply affecting drama, but above all superhero movies must have Action, Action, and more Action to draw in the box office numbers, and a tangled web of world-building to lead into the next projected number of films.It can be enticing, but it also becomes tiresome after a certain point - we can only watch so many protagonists formed from the same mold before the pattern begins to wear thin. In 2017, 'Logan' struck a very different tone that's just one part of what makes it so great and, even now, more lastingly impressive.The opening scene alone gives a peek at how violent and bloody the movie is going to be, and also imparts a bit about our protagonist before we even get the full picture. The man called Logan is no longer the powerhouse known as Wolverine. He's noticeably older, he's tired, and he doesn't bounce back from injuries so easily; the abilities he has relied on for many years are failing him. That's only the introduction for a narrative that becomes ever more dour alongside the setting: This is not your typical comic book movie.What follows is partly an examination of mortality, and the consequences of a hard-charging heroic lifestyle, as Logan tries to get by with odd jobs and care for a very ill Charles Xavier. No one else among their recognizable mutant allies, the X-Men, are around any more - it's just them. When Logan is tasked with protecting a young girl, life becomes significantly more difficult.Hugh Jackman is an excellent actor, and for all the times he's portrayed Wolverine on film, none of them can begin to compare to this performance. Patrick Stewart, legend that he is, again turns heads in the role of the man once known as Professor X, but this time it's a much more frail, saddening depiction.The rest of the cast is fine, but extra special commendations must go to young Dafne Keen, appearing in 'Logan' as the mysterious girl Laura. Keen was only 12 years old when this film premiered, but she lights up the screen and handily steals the spotlight away from the bigger names on the bill. The first time that Laura shows who she is, and bursts into action, Keen lets loose with a bombastic, feral rage that makes the scene absolutely electrifying, and almost a little startling for how very visceral it is. She shows more range as the picture goes on, especially at the finale, and impresses upon us right away that she is a talent to be reckoned with. One can only hope we get to see many more features with Keen in the future, because she is outstanding.'Logan' is exciting and suspenseful, but it's also a bit of a punishing watch. In following our aging protagonist, the film forces viewers to recognize their own mortality. For all his abilities, and all the things he has done, Logan is no longer the person he once was, and to continue to push himself to the same limits may actually break him. At the same time, the minor focus on Xavier complements that mirror by showing us a man who is losing himself, and losing control of his faculties - yet who is no less powerful, and therefore a danger to both himself and those around him. As much as 'Logan' is filled with action to satisfy fans of superhero movies, it is also highly suffused with sorrow, frustration, regret, and a hurt that runs deeper than the most grievous wound.As heavy as the narrative is in its themes, we're still not done. The X-Men, as an intellectual property, has always been a thinly-veiled metaphor for the queer community, with substantial emphasis on the persecution, ostracism, and prejudice levied against people just because of who they are. The focus on these themes have perhaps lessened over time as attitudes in society have shifted. Yet as the means used to target lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, or otherwise queer folks have changed, story beats in the comics and movies have changed, too. 'Logan' doesn't shy away from the subtext as the narrative also includes mention of genetic engineering that echoes real world concerns: mapping the human genome means better understanding of the diversity of our species, but the knowledge also presents a danger of being used to alter people before they're even born.Many other superhero movies dabble in sociopolitical topics; 'Logan' bathes in them. Many other superhero movies give a passing glance at the human condition; 'Logan' is laser-focused on it. I repeat: This is not your typical comic book movie.It's simply a bonus that 'Logan' stands on its own, independent of other films. One doesn't need to have seen other pictures featuring Wolverine to appreciate this one. One doesn't even need to have background on who the X-Men are to appreciate this, though it does help and adds significant context. As long as violence is no object, this is a movie that anyone could enjoy.My interest in comic book films has waned considerably over time, and only periodically will one come around that truly piques my interest. 'Logan' falls into the genre thanks to its source material, but it refuses to follow the established formula; you will not find any shots here that accentuate the imposing heroic stature of the protagonist. The thrilling action is intense, but so is the arresting drama. 'Logan' is a superhero movie like no other, and I don't expect we'll see another like it any time soon.Essential viewing, for comic book fans and for general audiences alike. I don't want a glut of films copying what 'Logan' has done, but action blockbusters could definitely stand to learn a lot from this.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

The beginning of the end times,"Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart return to their roles as Wolverine and Professor X, respectively, in this film that is almost certainly Jackman's last run as Wolverine and might just be Stewart's last as Professor X as well. And as far as swan songs go, they could not have asked for a better film.It's 2029 and mutants have become an endangered species. No new mutants have been born in years and only a few of the old guard are left. One of the few ""lucky"" survivors is Logan, who is radically removed from his glory days, being reduced to a suffering husk of his former self. And he has gotten off lightly compared to Charles Xavier, trust me. But then a new mutant enters their lives. A young girl with a power set almost identical to that of Wolverine's.James Mangold is once again directing and he continues to show that he really gets the character. The Wolverine focused on Logan's past and the human behind the adamantium skeleton and the nigh immortality. Logan focuses on the mortality of the character. On the fact that all beings, even one such as Wolverine, must grow old. Must one day, no matter how far into the future, die.In that light I'm almost hesitant to call this movie a superhero film. Because it's such a reconstruction of the genre that it's almost a new thing in and on itself. It borrows heavily from westerns and the rougher side of Americana, while also being a bittersweet love letter to all the previous X-Men films and to all superhero films in general. While also being a brilliant film in its own right.Here's to you Hugh Jackman. Here's to you Patrick Stewart. And here's to you James Mangold. This will not be the last superhero film.

"""As I live and breathe, the Wolverine.""","""Logan"" is the final farewell to Hugh Jackman as the iconic X-Men superhero, Wolverine, who wouldn't be so iconic without his performance. Jackman hangs up the gloves in ""Logan"" and in a grisly fashion. ""Logan"" is everything we ever wanted in a Wolverine film, a hard R-rating with bloody violence and over excessive language. The film follows Logan as a limo driver trying to support himself and Charles Xavier as they live in an abandoned factory a couple of miles from the border to the U.S. in Mexico. One day a mutant girl (X- 23/Laura) finds her way into the lives of the two men as she is being chased down by the Reavers, led by Donald Pierce, and the man Pierce is working for Dr. Rice. Soon Logan and Charles are sucked into the situation and take it upon themselves to protect Laura by any means necessary and getting her to safety.""Logan"" might be the most realistic and mature superhero film that has ever been made. It's really hard to categorize this film under the superhero genre because the film is so grounded. There are no big budget explosions or people wearing spandex suits, this is an in your face film about what happens to superheroes when they are no longer superheroes. Logan is a heavy drinker and is slowly losing his healing ability and his powers are slowly draining. Charles Xavier has violent seizures which cause tremors and has lost all hope in what he is and was. This is a very depressing film where there is no glimmer of hope in these characters, all hope is basically lost.The opening scene of the film where Logan fights off these gangbangers trying to jack his limo is not only awesome and violent but very depressing. You see Logan struggling with his powers and getting his butt kicked around a lot, even though he comes out victorious there's no feeling of relief or success. The Wolverine we know and love is gone, he's not making sarcastic jokes, or buffing up his ego. All of that is gone and all that is left is a broken man.The acting is spot on. Jackman and Stewart do their finest works in this film and Dafne Keen as Laura/X-23 was great, she is a very talented little girl. Boyd Holbrook as Pierce did a very good job, he was very cool and calm, and brought so much life to the character. Stephen Merchant as Caliban was so great in the film. You felt so much empathy for his character and it wouldn't have been the same without Merchant's performance and the fantastic writing and character development.The film has a lot of action, blood, and gore. This is a very unconventional superhero film in that the action is very grounded there aren't any explosions and most of the action heavily relies on the hand to hand combat the characters face. The opening scene of the film just shows the grisly violence it has in store for us. It was just awesome to watch, I still have goosebumps thinking about it.James Mangold returning to direct this film did such a fantastic job at it. He really created a Western drama disguised as a superhero film and it very much does feel like a Western. Mangold's vision for the film was spot on, it just shows how far gone the world is and the state the characters are in. Mangold directed the previous solo Wolverine film ""The Wolverine"" (2013) which I found to be quite underrated, Mangold did a good job with that film took what worked best about it and brought it to ""Logan"".""Logan"" in my opinion is the best superhero film that has ever been made. It tackles so many themes in the superhero genre that haven't been touched upon or even noted and does it masterfully. Mangold's direction and Jackman's performance is what really brings this film together and in the end the best portrayal of the Wolverine.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
i can't find any word to describe how good the movie was....... its just perfect,"the movie will get you from the beginning and you'l know that's nothing compare to any superhero movie you've ever watched, the story line it's perfect, the fights scenes was so real ,the actors did a wonderful acts and they didn't use so muck visual effect to made the movie more real plus the scars & vines on Logan body. i can't pass without talking about the end of movie the end it was something remarkable it was so emotional and unbelievable the movie will end and you can't just realize what happen. it's gonna be so hard for marvel to do another wolverine movie in the future after the success of this peace of art. i'am disappointed to hear that's the last movie for Hugh Jack men as Logan and i think it is really the end of the wolverine movies.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Logan is quite frankly brilliant,"Logan is probably the most hyped X-Men film of all time and I promise you this film will not only meet your hype but downright break your expectations.This is a searing epilogue to the character of Wolverine and a swan song for Hugh Jackman after 17 years of playing this legendary role.Logan is not only in my opinion the best marvel superhero film ever,arguably this is the best superhero film ever as well.I know in terms of technical ability Dark Knight might just edge Logan out but in terms of enjoyment this is an experience that is yet to be matched by a superhero film.It's brutal and merciless and when I say say brutal and merciless I MEAN IT.I mean we all knew that it was a R-Rated film but nothing can prepare you for the hell that will unleash upon.I don't care what people will say but Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewert are Oscar worthy in this film.This is most probably the first film where Hugh Jackman was challenged as an actor to play Wolverine and sadly it's his last.After 17 years of playing this role he knew everything about the character like the back of his hand but in this movie he had to portrait a person not a hero.It was gritty,brutal and downright gut wrenching.And can we talk about X-23 now?BEST SIDE KICK EVER!!!!!In fact she is much more bad ass than Wolverine.Wolverine is very worn out in this film.We see that the world has taken it's toll on him so,he doesn't fight too often but when he does you'll feel sorry for the guy who's gonna fight him.But when Wolverine isn't using his claws to slice up wholesale meat it's X-23 who does it and HOLY Crap!It's brutal and Awesome.Dafne Keen plays the role of X-23 and before going into this film I was kind of skeptical cause she's a kid and we all know kids in Hollywood movies are always the weak link.Can someone just slap me now for thinking that?She knocks it out of the park.I don't know if she'll feature in any future X-men films or not but I'd give anything to see her in this role.Let's talk about the action,Probably the one of the best action film of the decade and not just because it utilizes it's R-Rating brilliantly,The fight sequences are genuinely well choreographed.It's absolutely insane. Is it a perfect film?No,it's not.Do I give one ounce of crap?No,I don't.It's the most fun I've had watching a superhero film and that's the only thing that matters.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Best Wolverine by far!,"I don't write many reviews as it means i have to log on to my laptop to do it. But some films that are just brilliant or so terrible that i have to share my thoughts. I keep them short and sweet.This film, from the start was excellent. I am glad they didn't cater it to a younger audience and went for a 15 rating. Meaning it was how it should be when you get a couple people coming at you with sharp metal claws.....MESSY! The action was brilliant. It had its comedy moments but not so much that it makes the film look less serious as this comes across as a serious film.It just seemed like it was in a much higher league from all the other xmen/wolverine films. I highly recommend this film in the cinema or on a really big screen with surround sound.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Flawed but still a good Super hero film,"It isn't heavy weight thoughtful award winning material and it is full of massive plot holes and terrible cliches but it is entertaining.

The Wolverine movie we deserved,"This is the Wolverine movie we all deserved and they made us wait for really long. This is not like normal X-men or even normal superhero movies. This is much more personal, emotional and brutally violent, strictly not for kids. After the 2 shitty solo Wolverine movies, this is not only one of the best X-men movies, but also one of the best superhero movies, almost at par with Batman: The Dark Knight and Spider-Man 2.Its the future, and Logan is now an old mutant, still surviving through claws and regenerative healing powers but he's growing weaker. He's taking care of Prof. X, who is now 90 years old, who still has the mind-power but its now uncontrollable. Somehow both meet a kid (X-23/Laura) who they have to save, but as it turns out she's also a mutant with Logan's DNA, hence obviously, CLAWS. The organization who created her and several other mutants, are on the hunt and the whole movie is about survival.The kid who played Laura is so BAD-ASS, its amazing. Its a big deal to be the highlight of a movie where Hugh Jackman is the protagonist. The relationship between Prof. X, Logan and Laura are like Grandpa, Dad and daughter which makes these characters highly relatable. Patrick was amazing as a very different and never seen before Prof X. Hugh Jackman did what he has been doing last 17 years, only this was his best. Other Villainy characters did a fair job.The movie is dark, like ""Game Of Thrones"" dark, people die, there's blood everywhere, heads and other body parts are coming off. But overall, its the best send-off they could give to Hugh as his last Wolverine film. Best part is you really don't have to watch any previous films to watch this, if you don't know what are mutants, it doesn't matter. Its a great watch for anyone (Anyone who's comfortable with blood and violence).Hugh Jackman will be missed as Wolverine.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

A Fitting But Painful End,"Unlike many Marvel fans, I knew Wolverine before Hugh Jackman and didn't get to see the first X-Men in the cinema. I have always had a huge love of the X-Men comic franchise and in all the ups and very deep downs of the films, Hugh Jackman has been a consistent pleasure. Despite knowing the Wolverine character before Jackman, he was my Wolverine and can never be replaced.
This film works as a fond farewell and an entirely standalone, non-cannon story; it is rich in humour, subtlty, meaning and emotion. Few films have left me as affected. We will always want more, we will always want things to be different, but we need to learn to be okay with enough.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Jaw-dropping!,"I'm gonna be completely truthful and tell you that this wasn't a movie I was interested in watching at all at first. I just put it on for background noise while I went around cleaning and cooking. But guess whose jaw slowly dropped when they looked up and guess who ended up giving up on cleaning about a few minutes in. *raises hand*I applaud the performance given by all the actors in this film and I'm extremely excited for any of Keene's future performances. That little girl is special and she's gonna blow the roof off of any role she ends up playing.Every one of the actors took a piece of my heart and kept me invested in them, the character development and character dynamics were complex and real. Laura was pint-sized child that held all the fury and fists of a grown man, fiercely loyal and bloodthirsty. Professor X's ailing disease turned him bitter but at the root of him you still saw the compassion and caring professor that had always been around. And Wolverine, man, I applaud the performance of this character. Jackman really blew me away; Wolverine was so complex and riveting and I'm sad to say I don't have enough words to explain how amazing it was. I have to applaud the writers for this as well.This was truly a masterpiece. It seems as if Hollywood is really getting it's act together. This film was unflinching raw; it grabs you by the throat and doesn't shy away from showing you it's dark world.I was in for one heck of a ride and I didn't even know it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Bad Movie In Almost Every Regard,"Four pluses: 1) I always enjoy Patrick Stewart in just about anything; 2) Ditto Richard E. Grant; 3) The young actress who plays the new mutant (Dafne Keen) does very well in a role in which she is entirely (until almost the end) mute; 4) Johnny Cash's ""When The Man Comes Around"" plays over the end credits. Other than that, this is a Bad Movie in almost every regard. There is nothing in it that we haven't seen a hundred times before. In the title role, Hugh Jackman channels Humphrey Bogart as the cynical loner who doesn't want to get involved, who ""sticks his neck out for nobody,"" until he goes all-in for the good side (Casablanca, To Have and Have Not, Key Largo, The Harder They Fall). The action/fights are very repetitious: heads roll, arms roll, blades penetrate bodies. Worst of all: it is a Road Trip movie where mis-matched characters have to bond during a long automobile journey.A few years ago, I decided I needed to see more multiplex fare so squirmed my way through ""Captain America"" and ""Thor"" before I said ""No more comic book super heroes."" But I watched ""Logan"" because a production team spent six weeks in the New Mexico desert about 4 miles from my house filming the scenes that feature the old factory with the downed water tower that appear in the film's first half hour. On a morning run, I even saw the battered limousine (if you have seen the movie you know what I am talking about) being transported on a flat bed truck on its way to the filming location. When the set was first constructed, it was covered in the paper and TV news flew over in a helicopter, but that ended coverage so, apparently, there were no Hugh Jackman or Patrick Stewart sightings in Albuquerque. So it is possible – nay, even probable - that everything they did for that month and a half was all for green screen projection and no movie stars ever saw the place in person.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"It's violent in blood and language, it's good but it's not great","This is one of those movies who left me with some mixed feelings, and first I thought it was due to the way they decided to end the movie and Hugh Jackman's role as Wolverine, but then I sat and though about what really disappointed me in a way I could not see this as a ""masterpiece""...The story is well built overall and being an action / drama / comic movie, you can always expect some exaggeration and some plot problems, but in fact it's not the case, and apart from one or two details (like the ""vacation"" with that nice family on a middle of an escape), I didn't saw very big flaws...The acting is overall very competent (apart from the annoying girl), but also it's not memorable (and this is the first star removed from the 10/10 some people gave as rating).Then there are two things that take one star each:the girl with Wolverine's dna (the ""Wolverine's daughter"") it's a very cheesy idea (with an annoying act)and that Wolverine clone - who ruins, in my opinion, an otherwise reasonable plot, by creating a reasonably ""cheap"" solution to end Hugh Jackman's role as the character.Overall it's a likeable movie, with some drama and lots of violence, but along with that, I feel that Jackman deserved a better farewell....",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
By Far the Most Meaningful Comic Book Movie,"I think I was the last generation that grew up reading comic books rather than just watching them. As such, it gives me a different perspective than most. That being said, I believe this to be one of the best and most meaningful of the comic book movies made. It's dark, it's gritty, it's real and most importantly, it is NOT just another action movie. The story line brings to a head the struggles portrayed in so many other X-Men movies over the past 17 years and shows the development of characters that we've come to associate with certain actors. That being said, I would definitely not recommend this movie to younger audiences who have no familiarity with the characters or even foul language as this movie is dark but also real to life: People in Tough Situations Curse and Wolverine is Always in a Tough Situation.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Logan buried.,"Logan (Hugh Jackman) is old and sick, living out his golden years as a limo driver. When he's not chauffeuring drunken hen parties, he's in Mexico, tending to Charles Xavier, who now suffers from dementia. After a woman called Gabriela (Elizabeth Rodriguez) comes to him looking for help, Logan unwittingly becomes the protector of a young mutant called Laura (Dafne Keen), who is being hunted by a ruthless scientist (Richard E. Grant) and his armed cronies.Director James Mangold takes a decidedly different approach to this follow up to his 2013 superhero flick The Wolverine: whereas his first outing for the Adamantium-clawed X-man was pure comic book silliness, Logan goes for gritty realism. While the sombre tone is a gutsy move, Mangold's film does have a tendency to slip into over-ponderous mode as the director attempts to add depth and poignancy to his character.Mangold's story also leaves much to be desired, being yet another case of young mutants persecuted by the authorities, with our ageing hero caught in the middle. Logan's character arc is easy to predict, as is the inevitable outcome, while certain elements aren't adequately explained (the drug used to keep Xavier from having seizures, the origins of the comic containing the co-ordinates of Eden). Trite as it may be, the plot at least offers up plenty of opportunity for action, which the director handles with aplomb, his R-rating allowing for lots of blood and severed body parts.Ultimately, Logan is a mixture of exhilarating (brilliantly executed fight scenes) and exasperating (the uninspired plot), bringing fans some of the best the series has to offer, but also some of the worst.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Rating: A,"Well, if you're thinking this is just another typical X-Men or cliché superhero movie ... You're seriously wrong. Of all the comic- book movies I've seen, I dare to say this is the one that I can finally call a goddamn DRAMA. Plus, this time it's rated R! Thank you Deadpool, I honestly hope that we'll have more films like this in the future.The very first scene instantly transports us to a different tone that we're not used to seeing in this type of films. It's darker, gritty, bloody, gruesome, grisly, did I mention bloody? There are so many scenes that just stuck to my memory, I constantly jaw-dropped at almost every single action scene. AWESOME! Excellent direction by James Mangold, the quick cuts worried me at the beginning, but it's almost flawless. As for the action, this movie nails it and surpassed the already huge hype that it had. Best action from the whole  X-Men franchise.Hugh Jackman ... It's an epic goodbye. As always, he's magnificent which I already expected before entering the theater. I mean, it's a character that he's been playing for almost 20 years, it's a routine that he knows from scratch, but this one is really the best from him.  A very different Logan and he nailed it perfectly. Patrick Stewart is great as always and this time he's even funnier than Hugh Jackman! However, the real surprise is Dafne Keen (Laura), who plays the extraordinary kid. She's able to connect with the audience without saying a SINGLE WORD until the beginning of the third act. Honestly, she reminded me of Millie Bobby Brown's powerful performance of Eleven on Stranger Things. She's that good. Marvel just keeps getting the casting right, again and again, every single time.I can't and I won't tell you much about the story. What I can say is that this is definitely the most emotional and captivated that I've ever been in an X-Men movie. The ending is as perfect as it can be and the movie is honestly more than I expected it to be. It surpassed the hype surrounding it and I can only congratulate James Mangold for the brilliant work.Unfortunately, the movie isn't perfect as a whole (none is) even if it has a lot of perfect action scenes and performances. The pacing drops to a slow-burn in the second act (the least great of the three ... still great, though) and, don't get me wrong, it is needed and it's well compensated later in the movie, but it still dragged on for a little too much. The villain worked for the plot, I don't have that many problems with him even if I did expect more from him. A few exposition scenes, in the beginning, explaining the origins and purpose of some important backstory nagged me a bit, I think they had the possibilities and means to achieve a better way to explain everything (as they did in some other situations throughout the film) without recurring to an iPhone video.All of these are minor issues because Logan is f*cking AWESOME! The bloodiest X-Men movie ever, the best X-Men action scenes ever and the best Hugh Jackman in all of the franchise: this is the best film from the X-Men universe. An emotional DRAMA, with powerful performances from both main and supporting actors, a beautiful ending and an epic journey that now (supposedly) ends. Thank you, Hugh Jackman. You will not be forgotten!MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"""so this is what it feels like""","If there was any film likely to leave me in tears this year in the cinema, it was going to be Logan. Hugh Jackman's swansong to the X- Men franchise and to the character of Wolverine he'd been playing for 17 years. Logan is a character I've been watching since I was 4 years old back in 2004, so in many ways it felt like the end of my childhood.Thankfully, Logan is a film that has matured with it's audience that had been watching X-Men since their early years. It's a dark, miserable and depressing film and barely resembles a single superhero film of recent years. I'll also say seriously that this is the best superhero film since The Dark Knight, possibly even better.This was a beautiful, powerful and violent send-off that worked far better than I ever possibly could have imagined. Hugh Jackman plays a far older, broken and worn down Wolverine whose healing powers don't work very well anymore and has to look after a dementia stricken Professor Xavier who is prone to dangerous psychological outbursts. Logan ends up reluctantly having to look after and take a clone of himself in the form of a young girl to sanctuary while being hunted by a military group.Where Logan differs itself from other superhero films is its tone and content. While Deadpool was a violent and crude film, Logan is far more mature, resonate and powerful. This is not a kids film, not just due to the adult content, but the bleak and miserable tone throughout.It's really sad to see these characters you grew up with in such a broken state. Logan is a borderline alcoholic reduced to being a limo driver, while Xavier is a shadow of his former self. It's heartbreaking stuff that works so well thanks to the incredible performances from Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart. They manage to mix superhero nonsense with genuine heart, warmth, tragedy and even comedy at times. It's all so bittersweet, but it works.They're joined by a star making turn from Dafne Keen as 'Laura' a near mute clone of Logan who is on the run from a military group. While barely saying anything, Keen brings so much to the role, delivering a really touching father-daughter relationship Logan had been unable to have throughout his whole tragic life. What's even more impressive is the fact this is only Keen's second role in her entire career and she nearly stole the show from Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart. This is probably the best child performance I've seen since Chloe Grace Moretz in Kick-Ass.The Office/Extras writer Stephen Merchant also gave a memorable turn as Caliban, a pale albino mutant who brings a lighter tone to some of Logan's more bleak outlook. He's essentially doing what he usually does, but with some makeup on. Anyway, it was nice to see him a huge blockbuster film for once. He earns it more than his co- writer Ricky Gervais. And now I just imagined an alternate universe where Gervais was in this too...James Mangold takes on directorial duties as he did with the previous Wolverine outing 'The Wolverine' in 2013, which was great until it's third act, but still 1000x better than 2009's 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine'. Logan thankfully does not suffer from the same pitfalls as Mangold's last effort with the Wolverine character. Probably due to the fact he was allowed creative control to make a violent, R- rated send-off that lacks a bombastic CGI heavy finale.All the action in Logan feels small and contained, but is brutal and hard-hitting at the same time. It was so satisfying to see Wolverine actually cut people up into gory messes. While extremely violent, it all works within the tone of the film. I wasn't a massive fan of the frequent swearing at the beginning of the film, but that soon wore off and they toned it down.Mangold directs the action scenes with kinetic beauty, making use of both Wolverine and Laura in some visually beautiful action scenes. The cinematography of Logan feels closer to No Country for Old Men than it does a superhero film. Logan has the vibe of a neo-western and looks gorgeous, full of nice looking deserts and even a trip to Las Vegas.Without spoiling anything, I'd honestly be okay if this was the ending to the X-Men series as a whole. It leaves things in such a powerful and perfect way that I was tearing up. While is the end of Hugh Jackman's run as Wolverine, it also feels like the end point of the X-Men we all grew up with, and it managed to do it all perfectly.Logan is a powerful, violent and beautiful send-off for Hugh Jackman's 17 year run as Logan. It's also one of the best superhero films of all-time and likely to be one of the best films of 2017. I really hope there's Oscar considerations for Logan for next years awards.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
I wanted to like this - I really did! But...,"I had heard the reviews of this one: excellent, poignant, best Wolverine movie, etc. What I watched did not live up to the hype.The magic of the X Men wasn't there. Neither was the humour. Instead, I watched a sad and plodding movie with 1 dimensional characters. It all seemed so flat.Patrick Stewart was just annoying. He rambled on too much. There was very little background info on the mutant caretaker character. Jackman was pretty good. The guy can deliver every single time, no matter what the movie. But I must admit, what really didn't sit well with me was I was all the cussing and the graphic violence. I was surprised by it. The X Men movies never resorted to that.

"The sad and unspectacular slaughtering of the cash-cow called ""X-men""","I think that ""Alkali research"" might have put a ""pathogen"" in the water that has prevented the birth of sane, critically thinking movie goers for the last 25 years. Or it might just be the fact that Hollywood produces turd after turd and that has lowered our expectations. Either way, the sad reality remains, a simple and unspectacular movie like Logan gets a 8.5.The movie begins at a somewhat slow pace. The more it progresses, the more it starts to get evident that we're not going to be seeing decent special effects. This was produced on the ""cheap"" and has a TV series feel to it. The execution and the sheer scale are not up to par with the other X-men movies, the script is lacking too. The worse part however is that this movie is supposed to give the whole X-men series closure and it does that in a very unspectacular and boring way. They rushed it, probably seeing a good opportunity to slaughter the dying cash-cow, seeing that Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart wanted to retire from playing their iconic X-man characters.A big disappointment and a sad ending to an otherwise decent franchise.

He just wants to be left alone, while taking care of Professor Charles Xavier, who is now suffering from his old age.Charles' mind, which was once so in control, is now slowly slipping, and losing its grip on reality, making it equally as dangerous as it is powerful.Suddenly, when a mysterious child shows up, Logan is forced back into the field of an X-Man, the line between what's right, and what Logan wants to do, suddenly blurred.This is a comic book movie done right. This is a perfect portrayal of who Logan is. A broken man, outliving everyone and everything he has ever loved, wanting to be done with it all, until he finds that there are still things to love in this world.It is gut-wrenching, brutal, and dark, but shows that even the hardest of hearts, the most broken of men, will still be heroes, and come to help those that are in need.The cinematography is exquisite, and the acting so on par. This may very well be Hugh Jackman's best performance of Wolverine that he has ever played.If you are any fan of X-Men, any fan of Wolverine, who truly understands the character, you will like this film. Go watch it. This is Logan at his roots. This is the Wolverine.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Best X-Men movie ever!,"I never thought a superhero movie, especially an X-Men movie would be so moving as to make me tear up a little. The performances by Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart and Dafne Keen are absolutely brilliant! I can honestly say there was nothing to complain about in this movie and that's rare.

"I'm sorry, but the most critical element of the film has failed to deliver.","It is definitely a movie whose high scores and positive comments are unreasonable. At the center of the film is the blossoming father-daughter relationship between Logan and Laura, but the film fails to convey this. It falls very short in making one feel a deep relationship between them. The problem has nothing to do with Keen and Jackson's acting. Dafne Keen did justice to the role, even though it was an adult film with a high dose of violence. Even though the script is a road story and such stories are very suitable to tell about the developing friendship and care, they could not put it on a proper basis and flow in the movie. I think one of the reasons for this is that they crowd the screen and the plot with other subjects, distracting the focus of the character of Laura. Maybe if this didn't happen, we could focus on developing our main characters' relationship better by making it feel natural.Also, the end of this children's story arc is an ending that would suit a shounen anime or cartoon rather than an adult movie. It's like the producers weren't sure what kind of movie they were making. If it weren't for the other subjects, the film might have had a more complete style.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"A superhero movie, a road movie, a western, a family drama, a farewell letter, a new start. Anyway, a movie. A great movie. No label. Full of symbolism.","There are those films that follow formulas and that are very successful and there are those that also become recognized and gain notoriety for not following formulas or for following other types of formulas not inherent to a certain genre. This second case is where 'Logan', by director James Mangold - fits, who had already directed the also excellent 'Wolverine Immortal "". FOX and the director decided to put a definitive end to the most acclaimed hero of comics and cinema, who followed for almost two decades and the final result is one of the great superhero stories ever written for the cinema. We are facing an innovative, courageous, incredibly creative film with performances and direction that enshrine this work and will make it remember for a long time In these more than 15 years on screen, adding both great adaptations and not so happy moments, Hugh Jackman's Wolverine was in almost everyone.Based on a story by fellow director James Mangold, the screenplay written by Scott Frank, Michael Green and Mangold himself was inspired by a more recent Mark Millar and Steve McNiven comic, 'The Old Logan'. From this story of the road - in which the aging and debilitated mutant crosses the United States in a post-apocalyptic scenario in which eccentric villains dominated the country to help an old ally deliver an illegal package - however, Logan's script takes advantage only the state of Wolverine and the idea of a dystopian future. The trio manages to deliver a first-rate drama, with a character development arc, with twists and turns and emotional and action scenes hardly portrayed in films of the genre. Being a superhero film is just one detail in the complex and striking plot. In it, we can follow a whole journey of self-knowledge and redemption of our beloved hero.In 2029, Logan (Hugh Jackman) makes his living as a limo driver to look after nonagenarian Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart). At his side in this endeavor, we have Caliban (Stephen Merchant), one of the few mutants left. Physically debilitated and emotionally drained, he is wanted by Gabriela (Elizabeth Rodriguez), a Mexican woman who needs the help of the ex-X-Men to defend little Laura Kinney / X-23 (Dafne Keen). At the same time that he refuses to return to active duty, Logan is chased by cyborg mercenary Donald Pierce (Boyd Holbrook), interested in the girl.Developing this idea of a dystopian future well, the director deftly creates this darker, darker world and the tone of pessimism is what prevails throughout the entire projection. However, it is in the list of characters that the great asset of 'Logan' is found. Anxious by the fans, we can see the family relationship between the weakened, calloused and scarred pupil Logan and the master, Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart), the most powerful mind in the world, who now suffers mentally with advancing age. And when the girl Laura (the excellent Dafne Keen, who dominates the non-verbal expression, showing a variety of emotions with just her eyes) comes on the scene, we have the idea of family again present in Logan's life. The interaction between the trio is what sustains Logan's actions throughout the film. In one of the scenes when they pass for a family, it is one of the best in the film, with several references to Professor Xavier's Mutants School and the relationship between them. Make-up on the edge of the unrecognizable, old and tired, Jackman and Stewart do the best job as these characters have since they started this journey. The film balances these moments exceptionally well with explosions of action and fury, setting the stage for a promising and liberating continuity from the shackles of the confused canon established in the X-Men universe in theaters.
At no time does he worry about being didactic, does not use cards or voice-overs to prepare us for this future, he passes on to us every information we need to know through his dialogues and does not waste time offering us the causes of all that . At no time did we discover Xavier's disease, Alzheimer's is only left in the air through Zander Rice (Richard E. Grant), who is also the apparent culprit for the disappearance of the mutants, a fact that we also do not understand how it happened and, fact, we don't need to know.The film already establishes the state of the mutant in the first few seconds of the projection, making it clear that his glory days are gone. Hugh Jackman arrives with a wistful air, red eyes and a wobbly walk. The excessive use of alcohol acts as a way of escape for Wolverine not having to deal with his biggest enemy: the guilt he carries for everything he did in other times. To work this out visually, director James Mangold bets on open plans to show the ruin of the scenarios and on closed plans to create an intimate connection with the people shown there.James Mangold makes 'Logan' a road movie with several turns. Forget if you expect a classic superhero movie, with cover heroes and scenes full of special effects. Realism sets the tone, not only in the setting, but also in the action scenes. Logan also knew how to take advantage of his higher rating to give fans the brutal violence they always wanted from Wolverine. However, management did not use this freedom to deliver rampant gore and profanity out of context - everything was used for the sake of history.It is not an action movie with dramatic sequences, but a drama movie with action sequences. The scenes of violence in the place where Wolverine and Caliban took care of Professor Xavier are visceral. It was also the first time that we saw sweet Laura showing a side that even shocked the viewer. Talent and pure competence of the young Dafne Keen, who manages to pass the innocence and sweetness of a child at the same time that she is able to cut cold and violently with anger and fury several of her persecutors. The graphic violence of blades piercing heads, necks, arms, viscera is present to exhaustion here and is repeated in the scenes of the Harrah hotel and casino in Oklahoma, on the Munson family farm, and the last act near the border for Eden. In all the scenes, brutality, strength and realism impress and shock the audience, on purpose. Filmed millimeter, each blow or injury is felt. In the X-Men movies we never saw Wolverine really release all of his anger and show off the killer animal he is. In 'Logan', the film is not afraid to show all the blood and violence it entails.It is certain, however, that Logan - even though he idolizes his origin in the comics all the time - could have been more ""heroic"". Were it not for the claws and powers, the film would go very well as an action drama disconnected from this legacy of the hero. By anchoring him in a supposed realism, looking for the adult Wolverine that fans had been waiting for years and without really exploring the potential of villains like Pierce and the Butchers, Mangold and Jackman disregard another aspect of the character that was desired ... the super -classic hero, who is once again left in the imagination - in conversations about the past and what was left behind.
A superhero movie, a road movie, a western, a family drama, a farewell letter, a new start, which teaches you ""not to be what they did to you"". Anyway, a movie. A great movie. No label. Full of symbolism, James Mangold's feature opposes past and present, youth and old age, nostalgia and novelty to make the baton pass to a new generation. 'Logan' is a visceral experience that leaves the bittersweet taste of questioning about life and death, about the past and the wrong choices left in it and also about the possibility of redemption.
Perhaps the film will not appeal to those who seek something similar to other superhero films, but it will certainly delight everyone who seeks a melancholy, harsh, tense drama in many moments, but above all human. This does not mean that 'Logan' is better than traditional superhero films, but it is simply different, in discarding everything we could expect from him. And the most impressive thing is that the film can do this without being pretentious. It is a film full of emotional and unique in which Hugh Jackman delivers the best performance of his career, honoring almost two decades playing the character in a farewell worthy of reverences marking his name in the history of cinema.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A farewell and a welcome!,"A perfect farewell to the only mutant who had solo films in 'X-Men' franchise. I never understood 'X-Men', I thought it was the worst superhero film series I've ever seen. But 'Wolverine' was the only reason I watched them all and particular, Hugh Jackman. There won't be Logan now onwards, though a set of new generation welcomed in this film, while saying goodbye to the old guys. So now what happens in the future of this franchise is a very suspense. Yet Logan had been the precious gem in the crown of 'X-Men', that mean it won't be the same anymore.After many years passed in the future, the last survivours of mutants hiding their identity and living among the humans. Logan and two others were attacked by the armed men when he decided to help a child mutant. Running away from them and looking for a place where they can be safe prioritised in the narration. More dramatised film in the franchise, but there are enough actions those who desire for that.It's an emotional time for the hardcore fans of Logan/Hugh Jachman. One final great performance by him and the little kid was also good. A well shot film, with minimum graphics and more realistic stunt sequences. Well, not all were real, too strong fights, too bloody, despite having a child actor in it. Yeah, it is a good film, I liked it, but not a masterpiece as you might have heard of. But anyway, it is a must see for the 'Wolverine' fans.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

The best movie about WOLVERINE,"""Logan"" is a cinematic triumph that slashes through the superhero genre, leaving an indelible mark of raw emotion and gritty realism. Hugh Jackman's portrayal of Wolverine is a tour de force, a poignant swan song for the iconic character. The film editing is a masterclass in pacing, seamlessly blending brutal action sequences with moments of poignant reflection. The haunting musical score, composed by Marco Beltrami, amplifies the film's emotional weight, underscoring the struggle for redemption and the inevitability of mortality. The film's strength lies in its unflinching exploration of legacy, sacrifice, and the toll of a life filled with violence. The cinematography captures the desolate landscapes with a visual poetry that complements the grim narrative.

A hard-hitting wonder from Logan the Wolverine.,"Logan is the best movie in the X-Men franchise, but is solely about Logan wanting to live without being confronted with the mutant agenda and works a steady job while he is hiding with Charles Xavier and Caliban both of whom in a sad condition. Not that it is bad, not at all, but I will stress that I mostly consider it a spin-off, and therefore my favorite ""X-Men"" movie is still Day of Future Past.But in this movie Logan is approached by a nurse who recognices him as the Wolverine and wants his help, but he doesn't want to. But that woman ends up turning his life upside-down because she knows something unsettling involving an 11-year-old girl and a gang of other mutant kids.This story adaption is just all out violent, sad, gory and packs up all the heartbreaking events we got in the comic, so if you don't mind all the severed limbs and children being harmed, then you're in for a hellride of emotions. It does give itself room for some quiter moments to let us get into the wants and hardships of the characters, so it works as a satisfying journey with enough growth and bonding to make you care for them.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

No comprende,"Wolverine has had quite a bumpy and uneven ride since Jackman took on the role back in 2000. He's been in the main trilogy, he's made appearances in the prequel-trilogy and has had also three spin-offs of his own. As charismatic as the character and the actor playing him are, all of his stand alone outings ended up lacking just that: charisma.While Origins is often pinned down as a disaster, The Wolverine follow up ended up being a truly catastrophic mess; and despite Mangold's efforts to make amends in this final outing, ""Logan"" is not as strong as it should have been and also isn't the proper conclusion the character needed. The whole selling point was to adapt the Old Man Logan comic as the send-off to the iconic mutant with an R-Rating, an approach the character was craving for since 2000. The gripping action is there, the acting is unexpectedly superior for comic-book films' standards and there's enough character development to elevate the film. Nevertheless, Mangold somehow manages to have the film feel uncomfortably familiar, predictable and deficient denoting a weak directing pulse and sense of conclusion urgency.As an avid X-Men fan and Jackman's interpretation of Wolverine, I ended up finding all three of the solo outings lacking in a way the ensemble ones (even the weaker ones) never did; he has inhabited Wolverine from day one and it is quite astonishing how he's made 9 appearances in the franchise and none of those felt flat, phoned-in or tired. It was a fully physical and emotional commitment to the mythos that honestly doesn't leave much space left for anyone else to take on or reinterpret(although sadly, we know it's bound to happen).",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Wow !,"Here's my super late review of Logan .So Logan was directed by the guy who directed the not so good wolverine movie where he fights asian dudes. And this time he sure made a comeback with Logan. So needless to say , Hugh Jackman was great as wolverine and the little girl who played x23 was great too , the bad guy was good but would've sucked if it weren't for the R rating. Patrick Stewart was 'okay' as for most of the movie , he's just an old dude in a wheelchair annoying Logan. There are many references to the previous x men movies but without giving reason on what happened to the rest of the x men .The story is not your typical superhero movie , its a road trip drama with lots of gorey action and that's the best part , because you see wolverine for the animal he is. So ,in the end , Logan is not just a good superhero movie but a great movie with loads of action , good one liners , great characters and one big farewell for Hugh Jackman.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
.... And I'm not even a huge fan of Wolverine!,"IMHO - Logan is the worst major character of all the X-men. He acts like a total tool, he's made of metal (the material that can be manipulated by the #1 guy they fight, Magneto). He can't fly, manipulate minds, or fight from any distance beyond the length of his arms hell, he can't even make my tea cold!With that said, this movie was actually pretty good! Tons of ACTION - rarely a dull moment! We get a new enemy (rather than the same story of mutant vs. Mutant clans). Even better was the heroes were mostly children - so, a very different type X-Men movieThe ending felt kind of flat, and disappointing - that's probably my biggest complaint!RECOMMENDATION: Even if you're not a huge fan of the Logan/Wolverine character - this movie is EXCELLENT!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Mad X,"This, on the one hand, is a sequel to the ""X-MEN"" film series that has huge events happen off screen in between the previous films and itself. On the other hand, it doesn't have too many things to deal with, and has a simple story that's easy to follow. But that simple story only works for two thirds of the runtime and the third act is a failure.The harsh reality and the violence ""Logan"" is bold enough to have on screen go hand in hand both in the beginning and in the middle of the plot, but in the big finale, the plot twists and becomes complicated, and the elements it has to deal with get out of hand, stop making sense, raise questions, ruin what realism there was, and all that's left is the violence.Director James Mangold had a strong third act in ""The Wolverine"" from 2013, and the rest of the runtime was boring because the movie couldn't handle the big material it had to deal with until things were clear and simple enough for the big final showdown. There was also a little prologue in that movie that did work, but again, that was just a handful of minutes and they were someone's memory. Here, the big picture is the opposite. It is the big final showdown that can't handle the material it deals with, here, the parts of the film that do work are the ones that didn't in ""The Wolverine"", the beginning and the middle. Fortunately, one failed piece out of three does not necessarily ruin the whole picture, but it does not make it good, either. Not when it's the finale.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

The Last Dance,"Why is it that so many of the best superhero films are the ones where the superhero elements feel secondary? Where the characters feel human first and super second? Where the story is down to earth and barely a comic-book film at all? Winter Soldier, Dark Knight, and now Logan... In truth, Logan may be better than both of those. It may be the best superhero film ever made. Then again, it's hard to say. Is it it even fair to call it a superhero film? It's more like a gritty western. This film is the perfect conclusion to the X-men films, and to Wolverine's tale. If X-men 3 ruined X-Men in the worst way, than Logan killed off the franchise (for me) in the best way possible. It broke my heart again and again. The characters I loved are at their absolute lowest and worst. The action has never been more spectacular and violent. Wolverine is at his absolute finest in brutality and in Hugh Jackman's performance. The inclusion of a new young girl mutant also brings in a great new character.

"A masterpiece, and one of the best comic-book/superhero films of all time.","What is there to even say about Logan? There is a short list of superhero films that go beyond the tier of ""pretty fun"" and ""entertaining"" into genuine masterpiece territory, and on pretty much everyone's list, Logan is there. It's well deserved, and especially true for me in context of the rest of the series.If you, like me, felt that the X-Men franchise had strayed a bit too far from its character focused, soap opera roots, then Logan is really the movie for you. I find it funny when people say that this is ""less of a superhero movie, and more of a Western,"" when distinctions like that don't exist in the comics. (When you're writing literally hundreds of stories for characters, different genres inevitably pop up). Logan honestly feels like a graphic novel brought to life, as it's more self-contained and character-focused that typical films like this.I have to admire James Mangold's courage to go truly BLEAK and depressing here; the world of Logan is a miserable place, where we see beloved characters become shells of themselves. The X-Men are a distant memory. Professor X suffers from seizures and dementia. Logan, sick by the adamantium bones that once made him indestructible, is slowly accepting death.When I complain about the lack of world building in later trilogy, I feel even more vindicated by how AMAZING the world building in this movie is. Everything from the technology to the culture to the politics feels very well thought out but never in your face. (It's crazy how OBVIOUS a commentary this movie is on the Trump administration when you rewatch, with migration, xenophobia, and an honest-to-God blonde villain named DONALD)This is also one of those rare times where the R-rating absolutely elevates the film in every way. We've seen a version of this movie before without it, also directed by James Mangold: The Wolverine. The blood and gore are purposeful, reflective of a brutal, unkind world where even children can inflict horrible violence. Without, the movie wouldn't work nearly as well (and let's be real, the R rating was an undeniable box office draw).The performances in this movie are next level. Hugh Jackman delivers what is honestly an Oscar worthy turn as Logan; he's a different character, but constantly reminds us why audiences fell in love with him in the first place. A 17 year culmination of his cinematic depiction of Wolverine, this performance is a masterpiece. He shows so much range, vulnerability, and ferocity here and it's truly amazing.Patrick Stewart's heartbreaking performance as Professor X is what, I know for a fact, probably drove many people to tears. The sadness and desperation in his eyes, the hope he feels, the deterioration that's so evident; even little moments when he sneers at Logan when taking his pills are so true-to-life for us that have seen loved ones decline mentally, it's also honestly, Oscar worth.We also need to talk about Dafne Keen. While I would've preferred her stay non verbal or at least solely speaking Spanish, I can't deny how unbelievable she is as X-23. He inhuman shrieks are exactly what I imagined the character to sound like. She has a vulnerability and childishness that feels realistic, yet is an absolute killing machine and neither feel awkward. You can fully buy that she's the type of kid to play with the locks on a car door to annoy her Dad, but also decapitate a man with ease. Also, shout out to Stephen Merchant as Caliban, a character I cannot believe we've seen TWICE in this series.I also initially didn't like the idea of Wolverine vs. Younger Wolverine when I first saw this movie, but I was wrong. It was a stroke of genius to have an older, weaker Logan face off against his prime self: another example of the movie using a sensible plot element as subtext to drive the theme - aging and acceptance - home. Like all great movies, it's not only great on its own terms, but is ABOUT something and a movie that honestly resonates more with me the older I get.I also love how this movie - despite its darkness - is still inherently hopeful. I don't think you could've crafted a better ending, honestly. The final shot still gives me goosebumps every time.I've always found it funny that Wolverine - a dude who has claws that come of out his hands and super healing - became the face of the X-Men. We have people who can control weather, teleport, shoot lasers out of their eyes, but this guy is the one everyone adores? What this movie so beautifully demonstrates is there's a complexity and deep humanity to this character that can't be matched.Yeah, this one is special.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

The last film with Hugh Jackman's Wolverine just happens to be a borefest,"Look I'm not trying to be non-conformist here. It seem's like I've been crapping on every X-Men film since the 3rd one. However there are actual good things to say about this film. The acting and the script are really good, and the tone is actually pretty consistent here. Its also very nice to finally see a Wolverine film where there there is a good amount of blood.But for every scene where Wolverine hacks away at the bad guys does it have to be filled in with 40 mins of snail paced scenes? There are so many scenes of just... talking and... driving and...drinking and... pill popping and... sleeping and driving and talking DEAR LORD! I know this is supposed to be a gritty, almost western like film based off the Old Man Logan comic where its more about the character arc than saving the world but... no that's still no excuse. The studio threw a budget into this and this is Hugh Jackman's last outing as the character, it could've done better.The plot could've been better. It could've been about Wolverine renouncing the use of his claws (just like Old Man Logan) but something from his past comes back to haunt him and he must fix this before his time runs out and in the process hacks away at some armour-clad gunmen. Instead we get a weird Last of Us ripoff mixed in with a road trip movie where Wolverine, the badass mind you, is a baby-sitter and nurse.And the villains suck by the way. The first one is played by the guy from Narcos, and I don't remember the character's name at all that's how forgettable he was. He didn't really do anything menacing. The second is the first one's boss. A scientist who just happens to make stuff happen with little to no explanation. There is a huge bit of exposition regarding the second villain and in essence the film's premise but it was all condensed into one throw-away line.Let me compare this to another R-rated superhero film with a brooding protagonist which also kick-started the Marvel boom: Blade. I remember there were actually a lot of quiet slow paced scenes. But why do I like that film way more? Well actually even the slow paced scenes served a purpose, they weren't filler. The protagonist was consistently badass and stoic and had a mission from the beginning and wasn't thrust into a situation. The villain was a lot of fun. The movie had a lot of atmosphere and world building. And most of all, every character tried to be pro-active.I'm sorry you had to read this but this is film. It's subjective. I understand there are some emotions attached to this as Hugh Jackman will say goodbye to this character and I think X-Men will start fresh. But take off those goggles and watch it as just a film and you will see just how boring it is. Hey at least that opener with Deadpool was fun.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"As X-Men movies go, it's one of the best,","Take a little X-Men, add in some Paper Moon and stir in some Taken, and you get Logan. Which is actually two movies. The first one is an impressive and fairly serious movie about family, aging and human nature. The other is your typical X-Men movie about mutants and the men who hate them. And, it earns its R-rating through copious amounts of violence and language.Hugh Jackman (clearly wearing a hairpiece), Patrick Stewart (clearly not wearing a hairpiece) and 12-year old newcomer Dafne Keen are wonderful in the scenes they share. Unfortunately, the story bogs down and become formulaic the instant the bad guys show up. With a running time of 137 minutes, I found myself yawning more and more frequently as the movie continued.While many movies use low-cost locations (Vancouver, Eastern Europe, etc.) to stand in for major urban areas, Logan is a bit unique in that it uses the New Orleans Harrah's as a stand-in for a casino somewhere in Oklahoma. (""Look, I know the film is set in LA, but for budgetary reasons, we insist you shoot in Paris and Rome."")As X-Men movies go, it's one of the best, so see it now if you LOVE X-Men movies.

"An Ugly Violence, Emotionaless Superhero Movie","7 March 2017. Unlike Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lector, Hugh Jackman as Logan isn't very likable in this movie. He's stubborn to the point of being almost dumb about his decisions, allowing bad things to happen to him Even a wolf would probably be even more intelligent, resilient, and resourceful than this version of Wolverine. The relationships between characters are stilted and not very meaningful. The plot lurches from one engagement to the next more like a video game than a thoughtful and emotive storyline. Even the predictable ending seems strained by the inability of the team of characters to really offer up a sensible and more likely scenario for a climatic ending. Too many people are slaughtered in this movie that needlessly went to their deaths because of superhero ignorance or drunkenness. By the end of the movie the redeeming value that somehow was patched together at the end, isn't that convincing or memorable.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Was I watching the same film as the Marvel fanboys,"OK, so it was big budget with lots of CGI and one good scene, but the rest was just boring. Slooow to kick off, lots of repetitive violence of the same kind, little emotional attachment to any character (especially the girl, who spends most of her time either doing bugger all or making holes in people's heads, shoulders, knees and toes), a plot so compromised Logan himself couldn't make any more holes in it with his pointy bits. One very annoying technical aspect was the cheap lens they used that created really noticeable parallax distortion every time the operator pulled focus. Made me feel ill.

Good last journey,"This movie has created a lot of hype due to the fact that it is last movie of Hugh Jackmen as wolverine and he will no longer portray that role in the future, so being a concluding chapter to his 17 year long service at this role everyone is eager to watch this movie.Me being a beloved fan of the x-men franchise was excited to see this movie and how Jackmen's last go as wolverine would look like.The initial reviews when the movie released were very positive and some even compared it to great films such as Dark knight, but i have to say that this movie can't be compared to any other movie,it is directed and presented in an innovative and unique way.Logan has elements of western,family drama,action...put together in it to make it refreshing to the viewers.Performances of all the actors were very good,Jackman and Stewart were impressive.When it comes to special effects this movie didn't had much so those who expecting it would be disappointed, most of the actions were very violent but eye catching and thrilling.The most entertaining one for me was when Charles was forced to use his power in one scene to save himself and a character, it was a heart pounding scene.In conclusion do not expect to see another Dark knight instead hope to watch a variety movie with some good action and sentiments, you will be gratified.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

For a non superhero movie fan this was quality fare.,"In which I see my first X-Men movie in a franchise that is now 10 episodes old. So I know nothing of the back story.I also have no real fondness for Hugh Jackman after the disaster that is Les Miserables.And I don't much like superhero movies full stop, unless they have a twist.So, that's what made this an excellent evening's entertainment.The twist.It's no spoiler to reveal that the twist is Wolverine (Jackman) is losing his powers. He's an OAS (Old Age Superhero) and, as such, it doesn't take much for his superpowers to run out long before the Duracell Bunny would like.And that opens up a depth of story line that is seldom seen in these franchise affairs.It requires, and is given, a quality script and a complexity of performance that makes it both engaging and sustaining throughout.It won't be my movie of the year by a long shot (and it fails to breathe the sort of life into an old vein that Mad Max Fury Road did two years ago) but it's an excellent evening's entertainment and I'd recommend it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Decent and enjoyable but lets not go overboard,"Logan is very entertaining to watch. We look at an aged and more vulnerable wolverine and later introduced to an even more vulnerable Charles Xavier. The maturity in terms of language, violence and darkness definitely works well and adds to the realism. The child actress, Laura, who plays Logan's unknown daughter also does a great job. The setting and story line also deserves to be commended as it was a unique look at the world of the X Men. We have gone from the limitless possibilities of the heroes in X Men First Class and Days of Future Past to a more fragile existence for the last remaining mutants. We are informed there are no mutants and Logan and Xavier are possibly the last of their kind. Unlike previous films that have seen Wolverine as a dominant force he is portrayed as a dying and often weak hero who is often on the receiving end.However as entertaining as this film was it is not deserving of the over the top praise from critics. Some have cited this as the best X Men movie and some said it was in the same league as the Dark Knight. This was a good film but not one that was better than its predecessors such as X Men First Class or even Apocalypse. The X Men films have improved significantly in recent years but Logan would not be its best. The film often felt slow at times and the plot seemed disjointed. There was nothing overly unique about this film to set it apart. The story about creating future soldiers with abilities has been done before and there were no twists to be seen. Essentially it was a film about survival and when that fails we wait to see Logan die.Critics and users can sometimes act like sheep and rather than see a movie purely for its worth their minds are made up in advance. This is a good film but not an iconic film, a strong 7/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

The Final and most painful chapter,"""time catches up with all. Those who don't age , age slowly , age normally"". Although living endlessly can seem like a dream come true - it really is not as easy as one may think.Of all the super heroes in the X - Men series , Logan is one of the characters which has 'depth'. A lot about his history , loss of memory , watching his friends and foes wither and die. Logan in fact is the toughest of them all , has withstood horrific amounts of pain - both mental and physical.This movie is a fitting adieu to the character envisioned by James mangold , and as usual brought to life by Hugh jackman.This movie is more real than any other X Men in the past. Ageing , failing powers , illness , poverty all ail the remaining X Men - and they all awaiting their end by counting days and getting by.As a fan , it touched me , enthralled me and got me sad.It is gladdening to see Logan finally getting a motive to live - and finally dying in the arms of somebody who loves him. ( it really is significant - because everyone close to him have died in his arms - a tremendous burden to carry , considering how good natured and emotional person he really is - although he portrays himself to be toughest of them all).Logan and his battle against challenges thrown at him when his powers fail him , and a hope in the form of his biological descendant dominates the movie.Compared to the likes Logan has fought and survived in the past , the antagonists in the movie are not really that powerful. Coming to think of it , this movie really isn't about fights between 'them and logan'. Its deeper than that.Every fan , am sure will definitely love the human tones of the movie. Physical locations where it has been shot , the bg score and performance.This indeed is a fitting adieu.*sniff*",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

"Great Movie, lots of plot holes, cannot compare to The Dark Knight.","Lets start with the obvious. I think a lot of these reviews are overblown. Was this a great movie? Absolutely! Can this be compared to the Dark Knight? Absolutely not. That movie was a solid 10 out of 10. This movie had so many plot holes that were unanswered, I was shocked. I get that they wanted Jackman and Stewart to go out on a high note and their acting was Oscar worthy, but they really half assed the plot. The X Men timeline makes no sense. There weren't any explanations as to what happened to mutants. It was hastily thrown together like ID4 part 2 and that's what made this movie a 7 instead of a 10.

Logan 2017 Review,"The decision to make this rated R was such a perfect choice for both the tone and the story of this film. It's dark, gruesome, somber, and definitely gory. Hugh Jackman has his best act yet as he departs away from Wolverine (at least for now) carrying a huge, dark and heartbreaking performance.
Storytelling is also huge in this, definitely the darkest X-Men film thus far with huge stakes as our beaten down Wolverine and elderly Prof. X try to help Laura - a young mutant. The only thing that can be said negatively about this film is the pacing, the second act of this film is mostly traveling and learning about Laura and her past. But the first and final act all ride really fast and are thrilling to watch. Even with how dark this film is, theres some pretty solid humor in both the first and second act before taking an even darker tone in the final act.
And the action, oh man what do I even say. It's so brutal and gruesome its honestly just what we all wanted from a Wolverine film. Dafne Keen even has some crazy awesome action scenes. I hope we get to see more of her in this role.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
The Last crusade of a human hero,"After all this years an all of the X-men and wolverine movies we finally close the final chapter with the most human film of the entire franchise. Logan is not a movie about mutants, but more of a movie about people. The year is 2029 and almost all of the mutants are gone or in hiding, Logan has a regular job and takes care of the poor and old Charles Xavier( with help from a friend), they have almost of a father-son relationship in the movie, a ""son"" that's seeing his ""father"" sweep away from himself and reality due to his debilitated mental status. Some people might say that that this movie could have used some more of the characters that we were used to see but Jackman and Stewart steal the show together, and don't get me started with the little girl that gives a really good performance without saying almost anything. A final journey in which family, friendship and heroism are the main aspects of the last crusade of The Wolverine with a perfect yet sad ending which die-hard fans that have followed the franchise throughout the years will probably weep tears alongside the ending credits. A final word about Stephen Merchant an actor who is more used to comedy but still delivered a good performance. Over the years a lot of actors played superman, batman, spiderman, etc but only one defined the super hero role as Hugh Jackman has defined Wolverine or Logan if you wish, i do not envy the actor that eventually will try to follow the footsteps of the Australian actor.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
spare yourself the pain and don't watch this,"This movie is depressing and riddled with plot holes and contradictions with generally accepted lore. I didn't realize that this movie is based off of a different range of comics that depict this darker, older bunch of characters and apparently it relates to that range quite well. However most viewers aren't comic connoisseurs and will have their knowledge from the previous movies, the comics and cartoons they were watching as a child and anything that the movie itself would present during its showing. Logan, however, does very little to explain the background of the setting or the characters. The actors do a great job of acting but it's lost on the viewer when you have no idea why things are happening in the movie. If the writers of this movie were focusing on a non standard lore path they should have made damn sure the viewer was more comfortable with the new, and contradicting, environment they're presented with and not assume we've read or even appreciated the alternative story line. There are so many wtf moments when things don't gel in this movie that I can't recommend this to anyone.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

My Review!,"Over the past few days, I've been seeing and commenting on Blogs about who could replace Hugh Jackman as ""The Wolverine"". With a pinch of Salt, I've been saying, ""Tom Hardy"". He has the physique, the acting abilities etc and then, I saw ""Logan"". Deep, emotional flick this. It is in no way a classic Wolverine movie. It's surpassed that. Hugh Jackman, the man, ""The Wolverine"". IRREPLACEABLE!!! Next is, the character ""Laura"". That kid, the depth in her eyes, spoke a lot. In many ways, she was over shadowing Hugh Jackman. Seriously, FOR REAL. At that moment, I was like, Tom hardy, respectfully can take a backseat and let ""Laura"" take over as ""The Wolverine"".There are no end credit scenes in this movie. Many say, after the trailers and the movie begins, there is a pre-credit scene. I was right there sitting even before the trailers began and came across no credit scenes. I saw it online while typing this. Maybe it differs from Country to Country.Peace Out!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
a very unique take on an iconic character,"One of the X-Men's most venerable members returns for this compelling tale set in a bleak future where the mutant population has been ravaged to the brink of extinction. Acting as a caretaker to the ailing Charles Xavier, the weary Logan is suddenly drawn into a dangerous quest when he encounters a remarkable young mutant with a unique gift, and runs afoul of the sinister forces in dogged pursuit. This isn't the usual flashy, lightweight, or humorous mutant concoction; it's a gritty and raw saga with thought-provoking themes, in-your-face action, and dark subject matter. In what is reported to be his final time taking the reins, Jackman—playing an aged and much more vulnerable character—is sensational, creating one of his most memorable and distinctive interpretations to date. An impressive showing, one that isn't really made for fans of its predecessors. ***",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Good film (as far as X-Men films go),"The X-Men films are always difficult to review because the universe, the characters and usually the special effects in the films are all incredible and for the most part it is the storyline that fails to pack a punch. The Wolverine films have been part of this same flaw and while Origins was somewhat interesting, it was also incredibly underwhelming. Don't even get me started on how boring the second Wolverine film was...so here we are after a whole series of average films with what people view as the best so far.I have to say I probably agree with them. Within the whole series, Days of Future Past is probably my favourite film but this would be a close second. For those of you who have stuck with the films over the years, you know going into this film that they're not at their best: the trailer alone shows both Charles and Logan having aged and it's always quite an emotional time when characters such as these begin to show their mortality.I do however, have to disagree with many of the reviews on this site: first of all, as far as films go this is not ""the best film ever"" nor is it the best Marvel-based film either (obviously I mean from Marvel comments as we all know that the Marvel universe is somewhat divided due to legal issues). For me, almost all the MCU films trump the X-Men films by a long shot and this film is no exception.I've still rated this film pretty highly (7) because it is definitely a good film. I just think all those aboard the hype train perhaps need to slow down a little, catch a breath, and come back to the reality where X-Men films are average or slightly above and will probably never succeed beyond that (with the exception of Deadpool).",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

If you have engaging life, you accumulate tremendous amount of experience.

"Here's to you, Wolverine","It's 2029. The mutant population is pretty much gone, with only Wolverine (played by Academy Award Nominee Hugh Jackman), Professor Charles Xavier (played by Golden Globe Nominee Patrick Stewart) and Caliban (played by Emmy winner Stephen Merchant) left. Logan, aka the Wolverine, has aged quite a bit, is an alcoholic and even his healing powers are dwindling. The three live out the rest of their days in an old steel mill in El Paso, Texas. However, once a little girl (played by Dafne Keen) comes into play, the Wolverine is brought back into action. It turns out that this little girl has powers just like the Wolverine and she is being chased throughout the desert by dark forces - the dark forces that made her from Wolverine's DNA. With all this going on, the Wolverine must decide: should he live out the rest of his days in peace or is it finally time for one last fight?I can't stress enough what a near-perfect movie this is. As a matter of fact, the only X-Men movie that surpasses this one is Deadpool 2. Make no mistake, though; this is a Wolverine film, through and through. While it is a superhero film, it is not a superhero film for the faint-hearted. That R rating is well deserved here and it is the only way to tell the final chapter in the Wolverine story. We finally see Wolverine's berserker rage in all its rated R glory and it truly is glorious! The writing in this film is also spectacular, even getting an Oscar nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay (which it should have won for sure). James Mangold ups the ante from the previous Wolverine film ""The Wolverine,"" proving that he truly was the best director to bring the hardened Canadian hero to life.But let's talk about our three starring performances. First of all, this is not just Hugh Jackman's final outing in an X-Men film. Patrick Stewart is also back as an ailing Professor X whose tragic past continuously haunts him. He is originally seen as a mumbling fool by Wolverine when he continuously says that he is waiting for someone (turns out he is right). It is kind of sad to see the Professor like this, but Patrick Stewart also gives his best performance in the series. He is more compelling than he ever was in the X-Men franchise; while he was a crowd favorite, this is his best performance by far. Also along for the ride is Dafne Keen, a newcomer who plays Laura, the little girl who Wolverine protects. Has she really only started acting last year? While she may be just a kid, she acted like she had been in the game for more than 20 years. I hope she gets more roles as she gets older; she is a sight to behold as Wolverine's daughter. She even shares a similar story to Wolverine: someone who has had it rough, who has been unfortunately turned into a monster, and who now needs the guidance that Professor X gave Logan. Only this time, it's Logan who has to guide her. She is just absolutely astonishing in this role; she nailed it.But of course, who are we all here for? We are all here for the man himself, the Wolverine. Not only does Patrick Stewart give his best performance as Professor X, but Hugh Jackman gives his best performance as Wolverine. This is his last X-Men film, so he lays it all out there. He puts all of his cards on the table. He goes out with an unimaginable bang. Each X-Men film that stars Wolverine starts out with him having lost his hope, but this is different. Here we truly see a broken man who, until Laura comes in, seriously has nothing left to fight for. Hugh Jackman's Wolverine will go down as one of the greatest film heroes the world has ever seen and one of the greatest super hero portrayals ever. He is Wolverine. No one will ever even come close.Here's to you, Wolverine. Don't be what they made you.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Proper send off,"When you think of wolverine it's all about the rough attitude and one liner puncher response that has become our favorite from the character. Nice build up of the story where all started with Logan and Prof X were barely making it just to make ends meet. This is a great conclusion to the X-Men saga and of course the Wolverine, Logan.

Going out on top,"If this is indeed Hugh Jackman's last foray into the X-Men world as the title character Wolverine (which I'm strongly hoping it isn't. There are still many questions/stories after seeing this film), what a way to go out!As expected, Jackman and Stewart own the characters they've been given guardianship in a gritty, raw, tour de force. The chemistry between the two has always been superb, but the interplay here is next level. Relative new comer to acting Dafne Keen as Laura is a marvel (no pun intended) to behold and more than holds her own on screen with these two veteran actors. Stephen Merchant as Caliban brings his A- game. And Boyd Holbrook's Pierce wastes no time establishing himself as the bad guy you love to hate. An added treat is Eriq La Salle as the very humanizing Will Munson.The film starts rather unexpectedly with an inappropriately lighthearted and deliciously twisted vignette from a ""guest"" character. Once the laughs are over, however, $#@! Gets dark and real, real fast. To say that Wolverine has seen better days is an understatement and it looks like his days of reluctant hero are behind him for good. Patrick Stewart's Professor X isn't faring much better either. Due to the actions of one former nurse, both men are tasked with one more stab at heroism. What follows is a two hour dark, violent, graphically violent, action packed, touching, humorous, raw, introspective, emotionally charged, dramatic ride of a life time. An entertaining and compelling family road trip from hell from start to finish.Don't just take my word for it.

Doesn't fully work for me,"Wolverine can finally be wolverine. So happy with the R rating. We can finally see what he's really capable of. This did not feel like a super hero or comic book movie. It felt like a regular good movie with superheroes in it. It was pretty slow for a lot of it but overall I think this is a very well made movie. The action was all awesome.On third viewing I was wondering why I didn't like this more. It seems to be based on 2 things. First, I was pretty bored for a lot of the movie. I no longer go into these expecting constant action of a popcorn blockbuster, but I couldn't help but feel restless at a few points during the movie.Secondly, I am not a fan of the musical score at all. It just felt off in so many of the action scenes. Even the end credits first song was this lame country music. Dropping it to 6 stars. (4 viewings, 7/21/2024)",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Director takes us to the emotional side of logan and i personally liked it. Story also succeeded in doing the same.2.)Hugh jackman , Dafnee Keen (laura/X-23)- Hugh Jackman's acting was phenomenal and he succeeded in bringing out emotions of logan character. Dafnee as laura was outstanding and she acted like a matured girl. I liked her crying scenes because that was totally realistic and also her angry scenes as well with her special scary looks. In short she was apt for the character.3.)Cinematography 4.)Bgscore Negatives- 1.)Too much of violence - Violence is too much and they could have reduced it. This is the reason why this movie got R rated.2.)Lagging at some areas 3.)Duration- Duration could have been reduced 4.) Some Action scenes- Some Action scenes could have been nicely choreographed. It was fast paced and it makers could have improved it.Overall- If you are Xmen series fan then you will love it and ending can also make you cry because its really emotional and you will understand when you watch it.

Best Marvel movie of all time!!,"First of all the portrayal of the characters in this movie is AMAZING! Hugh as old man Logan is the perfect match, the best grumpy wolverine of all movies. It kinda made me think of the scène in The Wolverine (2013) when he goes to the bar after the bear was killed. The way he only cares for himself, but in the end always sticks up for the other person. Patrick Stewart, always plays the role of Professor X perfect, but this time it was extraordinary. The extra elements this time around, define the character in a perfect way. The actors really feel like they are the character.With that said, the cinematography is out of this world, it feels like an Interstellar Marvel movie. I've never seen a Marvel movie like this. The shots, the lighting, the setting and the grading, perfectly matches the vibe of the movie. I love all the x-men movies, I personally think that if you don't like superhero movies, you will like X-Men.

Masterpiece on complex trauma,"This isn't a PG movie about superhero's and villains. This is a movie about trauma, about pain and suffering and despair. It's an R rated picture of intergenerational dysfunction, insecure attachment, dementia, addiction and broken families still being families together. It's a peak behind the scenes of what some of our real world war veterans live through and how society treats them. Its our sporting hero's after their 15 minutes of fame. It's uncomfortable and deflating to watch, and it should be.The storyline plays out while a constant internal battle occurs for Logan. This is evident in Logan's self loathing, the fact that Logan's body is killing itself and the fact that there is an actual second Logan trying to kill everyone. He really is his own worst enemy. These metaphors and more are riddled throughout the movie.The strength of well developed characters, with real emotions and strong bonds that we can all identify with helps offset some of the pain but also brings it closer to what we can empathise with. The characters are set out with the grandfather figure, the uncle or brother who has a strained relationship with Logan, a new generation in Logan's daughter and Logan himself. The inference of this family unit resonates with the viewer and it's these relationships that we are hoping and cheering for, not the battles with giant robots or aliens like in most super hero movies.It has huge success of really showing the despair, desperation and helplessness that stem from complex trauma. The impossibility of the struggle and complexities of stigma, financial hardship and broken health care systems reflect today's society really well even though the movie is set in a backdrop of the future.I don't know who they worked with to get this clinical insight but they really have succeeded in making a masterpiece that 90% of viewers will never appreciate for what it really is.It's not much of a popcorn popper but get a box of tissues, dim the lights and embrace the pain of one of the best education sessions about trauma and attachment on the market.

A Raw and Emotional Story,"""Logan"" is a gritty, emotionally charged entry in the superhero genre that transcends the conventions typically associated with it.

Set in a bleak, near-future world, it sheds the usual spectacle of superhero films in favor of an intimate, character-driven narrative. Jackman gives a phenomenal performance, portraying Logan as a broken man struggling with his own mortality, while Patrick Stewart is equally heartbreaking as the ailing Charles Xavier. Newcomer Dafne Keen also shines as Laura, bringing fierce energy and emotional depth to the role.The R-rating is fully utilized, allowing for brutal, visceral action sequences that highlight the toll of violence on Logan's body and soul.

Your heroes are NOT invincible,"Warning: This review may contain opinions that qualify as spoilers.Rewind to the year 2000 when X-Men finally arrives on the big screen. Logan is a wild animal fighting in a cage for money with no memory of his past. Angry and disgusted with who and what he is he just wants revenge on the world. Enter Professor Xavier and the X-Men. Wolverine finds people who accept him, even like him oddly enough, and someone in the form of Jean Grey in whom he could maybe even find love. Armed with a new found purpose and backed by a family that believes in him Logan changes from a dangerous animal to an invincible super hero worthy of legend.Fast forward to 2017. Logan is a shadow of his former self as is Professor X. There are no more heroes in America. Corporations can do whatever they want. Good people who still believe in heroes or are heroes themselves just by raising a good family with American values will become casualties. There is no stopping an automated future. Your heroes are NOT invincible. Do not look to the next generation for hope. This was not a superhero movie but a dystopian pipe dream.I would have been happier seeing gun toting thugs lined up on either side of Wolverine and 2 hours of him perforating their skulls one at a time.

The Last Stand,"Logan, directed by James Mangold, is a gritty, emotional farewell to one of the most iconic characters in modern cinema. Set in a dystopian future, the film follows an ageing Logan (Hugh Jackman) as he grapples with his deteriorating powers, struggling to protect a frail Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and a young mutant, Laura (Dafne Keen), who holds a mysterious connection to his past. With its intense character focus and mature themes, Logan redefines the superhero genre, blending elements of Westerns and dramas to create a story that is raw, reflective, and deeply moving.Hugh Jackman gives a career-defining performance as Logan, portraying the character's vulnerability, anger, and heartbreak with an authenticity that is both painful and powerful. Jackman's portrayal of Logan's final journey captures the essence of a hero who has endured more than he can bear, seeking redemption even as his body and spirit wear thin. Patrick Stewart is equally remarkable as Xavier, delivering a hauntingly vulnerable performance that reveals the frailties of a once-powerful mind. Together, Jackman and Stewart create an unforgettable dynamic, conveying years of friendship, regret, and love.Dafne Keen as Laura, or X-23, is a standout, bringing fierce intensity and emotional complexity to her role as a young mutant trying to find her place in a hostile world. Keen's portrayal balances vulnerability with raw strength, making her scenes with Jackman's Logan both touching and impactful. The chemistry between them adds a layer of emotional depth that elevates the film beyond the typical superhero narrative.Mangold's direction is masterful, emphasising realism and character over spectacle. The desolate landscapes and muted colour palette mirror the bleakness of Logan's world, while the stripped-down action sequences are brutal, intense, and grounded. This restrained approach amplifies the emotional weight of each scene, allowing the film's quieter moments to resonate just as powerfully as its intense battles. The film's R-rating allows for unflinching action and honest storytelling, giving Logan the gritty, uncompromising farewell he deserves.Logan is more than a superhero film; it's a poignant exploration of mortality, legacy, and family. Its themes of loss, sacrifice, and redemption are universal, making Logan's final journey one that resonates deeply with audiences. By focusing on character and emotion, Logan transcends genre boundaries, standing as a powerful, introspective story about a man who has suffered and sacrificed-and whose final acts are a testament to his enduring humanity.In conclusion, Logan is a cinematic achievement that leaves a lasting impact, offering a fitting, powerful goodbye to an iconic character while setting a new standard for the genre.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"""Logan: A Bleak and Profound Exploration of Sacrifice, Redemption, and Heroism","""Logan"" ventures into uncharted territory for superhero films, delivering a somber and introspective narrative that showcases Hugh Jackman's Wolverine at his most vulnerable.

Dafne Keen's breakout performance as Laura injects the film with a fierce energy, as Logan confronts his own legacy while protecting her from relentless adversaries. Set against a bleak backdrop, the film's emotional depth and brutal action sequences redefine the genre, offering a profound exploration of sacrifice, redemption, and the enduring spirit of heroism.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
An Epic !,"Logan is an epic from the very beginning to climax. Totally cut off from unrealistic realm trying to be more realistic. It did well and is praiseworthy. A classic in the X-Men franchise. To be precise the best !Hugh Jackman is perfect as the old hero who once saved the world. An old guy who became fragile in strength and the director is cautious enough to show that he could fight only with humans not with mutants anymore. Logan is now peaceful becoming peace oriented with friends but the Laura's entry was shocking for him that keeps the film going. Logan was happy with Charles with few dreams of his own trying to stay away from the people and be at peace. The performance regarding this is satisfying at every level. But the ultimate challenge appears before him and he has to deal with both humane and inhumane spirit within himself. Laura is the point of turning table upside. That makes the film gripping. Logan fragileness makes himself humanely protective but falls short of his previously violent characteristics. This makes clear the ending that he is defeated in the end. Logan still saves the world this time but he leaves the world for better and finds someone to replace himself. Perhaps the only thing needed in the end was right motivation. And Logan did it by hook or crook.Logan is less about Superhuman but more about human life, relationships, sacrifice. The action and thrilling sequences are a kind of cherry on the pudding. It will entertain you but amidst it connects you with the reality of lives and society. It is a recommended film for some exquisite taste even for matured viewers, whose storyline will make you remember the film as an unique event. Though it ends with an pessimistic note where the lead character is lost forever, but carries an optimistic theme where it teaches us the value of life, family, sacrifice. An epic in its genre, it's a 98/100.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
The greatest adventure of all.,"""Nature made me a freak. Man made me a weapon. And God made it last too long."" Logan (Hugh Jackman)God is allowing us to enjoy the last in the X-Men /Wolverine cycle with Hugh Jackman having endured 17 years of pumping up to give adolescent males a reason to get up for the demands of an unforgiving world. However, this film, Logan, is not all blood and guts—it presents an aging hero coming to terms with the natural degeneration of his greatness and his legacy.It's really all about how these mutants, who clearly represent the fringes of society with odd residents marginalized by the homogeneity of the world. Inevitability hangs over this substantial hero saga, especially an iteration that suggests what even super heroes long for— immortality through lineage or enduring philosophy.As the founder of the mutant school, Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), tells it to Wolverine: ""This is what life looks like: people love each other. You should take a moment . . . ."" The film is suffused with a sense of the importance of family, not just Logan and his daughter, Laura (Dafne Keen), but also the new generation of mutants who must band together to survive.The heroism turns on love rather than technology. The love is familial, in this case Logan discovering his daughter then sacrificing his safety to escort her to Eden, a place with other child mutants, who must hide from the dark forces bent on using them as soldiers. Although such bonding is the stuff of cliché, this film makes the growing love and sacrifice believable.In the end, the search has been to discover what it's like to live and love normally. Albeit briefly. Amidst the sturm and drang of violent, bloody super hero films, and this one has as much violence as any other, the discovery of homely love is the greatest adventure of all.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Logan - 10/10,"1. Overall Plot - 9/10
The story of this movie is so good. Logan being old, and his body finally failing him is super unique and cool to watch. The world being in almost a no mutant state is also super intriguing. Everything about the story of X-23 has always been one of my favorites. Logan having to learn about her and than trying to help her is so fun to watch.The only thing I wish was a little different was that I wish they went into more detail about what happened with Xavier and all the mutants. Instead of just eluding to it. Other than that, basically everything else about this movie is perfect.2. Entertainment / Engagement - 10/10
Wow, this movie is amazing. I've always heard it was good, but now I can completely agree. I was very entertained throughout the whole movie. They do a great job of making you feel the pressure and suspense of the story. It is definitely a very intense film.You get pretty engaged in Laura's character. Learning from where she came from, and who she is, is super cool.3. Emotion / Investment in Story - 10/10
This is one of the most emotional movies I have seen in a long time. I barely ever cry in movies. And by the end of this film, there was definitely tears. It hits so hard. And this is a fantastic good bye to Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. It is a great love letter to his character and acting.You get very invested in the story. You want Laura to be safe. And watching Logan grow to feel that same way throughout the movie is amazing.4. Theme and Depth of Story - 10/10
There is lots of little themes in this. I wouldn't say there is one overall big theme. Some little ones are; loss and regret, love, taking care of others, and never giving up.This movie is super, super deep. It goes into everything that was set up in all of the previous X-Men films. Watching Logan learn to love Laura is also very cool.5. Characters - 10/10
All of the characters are great. Logan is fantastic, and feels like Old Man Logan. His potrayal of his powers slowing down is very cool. Xavier having Alzheimer's is also very cool to watch. Laura is a fantastic character. She is done perfectly. The connection she has with Logan is special and unique. I like the villain, and how he is just hunting down mutants.6. Acting / Writing - 10/10
The acting is literally perfect. Not a single bad actor at all. Hugh Jackman did phenomenal yet again. The emotion he shows is amazing. Dafne Keen is so freaking good in this. It is crazy how good she did for how young she was. She is the reason this film is as good as it is. She doesn't talk almost the whole movie, and doesn't speak much english. But the emotion she shows on her face is everything. You always know exactly what she is thinking. I can't express enough how good her performance was. And her chemistry with Hugh Jackman was great.7. Cinematography / Sets - 10/10
The cinematography didn't do anything super special, but that is just fine. I think it did absolutely perfect for this movie. It is filmed just the way it should be, to make the movie be as good as it can be.The settings are also very cool. I especially love the last act being in more of a forest. It made for some very cool stuff.8. Score / Sound - 10/10
The score was phenomenal. The music did a perfect job at making you feel every and any emotion. It made the movie feel so much more intense.The sound design was also great. I like how they made the claws sound. It is definitely more brutal than anything else we've seen.9. Editing / Pace - 10/10
The editing and pacing was perfect. I can't imagine it any other way.10. VFX/Practical Effects - 10/10
The effects were so good. Everything looked and felt real. I enjoy having more blood in some things to make it feel more accurate. But I also hate when movies use an excessive amount of blood. This movie didn't do that whice was great to see.Average Score:
9.9/10My Overall Rating and Final Thoughts:

Finally a decent comics book movie!,"While not quite as incredible as it was hyped up to be (seriously, people in some corners were raving about it as if it's as good as The Dark Knight) it's definitely a *good* movie and these days, that's a big accomplishment. Since Nolan we haven't seen a single film based on comic books that could really be said to have any sort of serious substance and/or artistic endeavor and actually was well executed (amazingly, some TV shows like Preacher, Jessica Jones and recently Legion have gotten closer to that). Rather they've been almost entirely conforming to formulaic block-buster 'rules', which essentially stipulate you are to have X amount of battle scenes, Y special effects and CGI, Z amount of space dedicated to establishing a franchise, a PG rating, and maybe 5% room for originality if you really feel adventurous.Logan is a breath of fresh air in that, even though there are still a fair amount of gratuitous fight scenes and visual effects, it still for the most part actually seems like a real, non-franchise movie that tries to be something unique and build characters and relationships and a visual identity and emotional depth. Is it great? Not quite, but given how movies get made these days and the financial risks involved for studios and their intellectual property, we have to applaud them even being brave enough to take such a big step in the right direction. James Mangold did a very solid (if not overly ambitious) job helming this movie and giving it a unique character, and hopefully this will mark the point at which major studios realized they may have even more success if they hand these franchises over to even more serious visionary directors and let them do their thing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

It's a wake up call to our ""progressive"" society that wrongly (research is proving) minimizes the role that dads play in the lives of our children. At the same time they highlighted and honored the men in our society who put their lives on the line each day to protect us. That message is wrapped up in an entertaining movie where you will laugh & cry. I was in tears during scene one and in several others I nearly fell out of my seat laughing.

Brutal & Respectful,"In a world (doubly-so now,) where Marvel movies are forgettable, riddled with forgettable punchlines and so silly you can hardly take them seriously, Logan is a movie that is so grounded and gritty, and it makes for such an enjoyable experience, especially when taking into account that's it's the sendoff for Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. The movie is incredibly violent and mature considering the universe it takes place in, though it falls behind in its presentation. Every single scene in this movie where music is playing is drug down significantly solely from how generic and forced it sounds - like the background music of a hallmark movie. The movie is shot blandly, there's no unique or interesting set-piece that stand out in my mind, and a certain scene at the end of the movie starring an ensemble of 'super kids' is laughable.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Bid Adieu my favorite character,"Logan is superhero movie and tenth part of the X-Men Franchise. The movie is directed by James Mangold and stars Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, Dafne Keen, Boyd Holbrook, Stephen Merchant and Richard E. Grant.The movie is set in 2029 where the mutants are almost finished and Wolverine/Logan is hiding with Charles Xavier/ Professor X and Caliban.This was the third and final installment of Wolverine and there were lot's of expectations from the movie and you will not be disappointed. Although wolverine is now aged with declining health still you will see lot's of action, violence and bloodshed.Acting is superb and Dafne Keen is surprisingly superb and with her skills and the way she acted she can give tough competition to the actress senior from her with most compelling performance from Jackman knowing that this is his last movie for the franchise he had done s stupendous job.This movie ends the remarkable and unforgettable journey of Hugh Jackman/Wolverine/Logan in the most appropriate and profound way who till date was one of the most strongest character who had carried the franchise for long on his shoulders.A Must watch for all X-Men/Wolverine/Jackman fans.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

"Raw, Brutal, Uncompromising and Outstanding","Logan has been on my radar for a while because it looked different. Super hero movies these days (this is not an insult it is common knowledge) have become somewhat formulaic. Marvel is particularly guilty of this and you cannot blame them because they have churned out good movie after good movie.Logan is something else entirely.From the first five minutes you know you are in for something very different not just because of the ""R"" rating, but because of the dirty, gritty nature of the first scene.When the violence erupts it is presented in a no holds barred brutal manner you would expect from a guy who has lived a life as long, brutal and as violent as Logan has. He has had enough of having to fight his whole life and when he does fight he is absolutely doing it with no holds barred.The action scenes are designed amazingly well and it is nice to see them grounded in reality especially after ""Apocalypse"" and its super cartoon like flippy twirling action scenes.I have not returned to see an XMEN movie in the theater a second time, and I loved ""Days of Future Past"". I will be returning to see Logan again. I may be naive but I think Jackman should receive award consideration for his role as Logan.I cannot recommend Logan higher. The only reason it does not get a perfect 10/10 score is because of some continuity issues with previous installments of the franchise.Leave the little ones at home.

The type of superhero movie that could finally get an Oscar nomination for Best Picture!,"'LOGAN': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The third and final standalone Wolverine movie (and the 10th installment in the 'X-MEN' cinematic film universe); once again based on the popular Marvel Comics character, with Hugh Jackman reprising his most iconic role (for supposedly the last time). The film has an aging Wolverine traveling across a dystopian future America, in order to help a special young mutant girl. The movie also costars Patrick Stewart (reprising one of his two most iconic roles, once again, as Professor Xavier), Dafne Keen, Boyd Holbrook, Richard E. Grant and Stephen Merchant. It was directed by James Mangold (who also helmed 2013's 'THE WOLVERINE'), and it was written by Mangold, Scott Frank and Michael Green. The film has been a huge hit at the Box Office, so far, and it's received nearly unanimous positive reviews, from critics and fans alike. I enjoyed it as well.The story is set in the year 2029, when mutants are almost entirely extinct. Logan (Jackman) is now aging like a human does, due to the fact that his adamantium skeleton is now poisoning his body (and it's stopped healing him as well). He's now working as a chauffeur driver, in Texas, and helping to take care of Professor Charles Xavier (Stewart); who's suffering from a disease which causes him to lose control of his telepathic abilities. Logan is approached by a nurse (Elizabeth Rodriguez), who wants him to help transport an 11- year- old girl (Keen), with very special powers, to a place in North Dakota. Logan reluctantly agrees.The movie is surprisingly dark, and extremely dramatic. It's definitely a very serious character study, and not a fun action flick like it's predecessors. The movie is also shockingly violent; and it's the second 'X-MEN' film to be rated R, in as many years (following last year's blockbuster 'DEADPOOL'). Hugh Jackman is also fantastic in the lead, giving arguably his best performance in the role. For all of these reasons, I really respect this movie. Like I said, it's not a fun comic book flick (like some might be expecting), but it is a really well made drama film. It's actually the type of superhero movie that could finally get an Oscar nomination for Best Picture, but we'll have to wait and see about that.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://vimeo.com/203409666",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Selling the name Logan – that was good!,"As the name suggests the movie is mostly about mutants like Logan. There's logan, his clone and his daughter.

Even though little, that was great.Cinematography: The movie is A(R in US) rated. A lot of blood was involved. Wounds penetrating deep in body were seen.Tone: Taking child mutant to a place where said fellow mutants are already present is the tone in which movie is set.

"""When the man comes around""","At last – a superhero movie with real heart (and not just the chunks over the knuckle blades!). Logan is a bit of a revelation. I was reluctant to go and see it, since a) I'm a lukewarm X-Men fan at best and b) I hadn't seen either of the previous two Wolverine spin-off films. (Seeing the other Wolverine films, by the way, is not a pre- requisite for enjoying this one). After a long day at work, my choice was ""Logan"" or ""Kong: Skull Island"". I voted for this one, and I'm so glad I did.It's now 2029. Hugh Jackman plays Wolverine, but this is not a Wolverine we have seen before. This is an aged and deteriorating superhero: his self-healing powers are waning; a limp is developing; and his fighting prowess (although still legendary) doesn't show the stamina it once did. This is a Wolverine that is also an unlikely carer, looking after a mentally degenerating Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart), now 90 years old and finding it increasingly difficult to keep his devastating mental superpowers under control. This is a Wolverine trying desperately to avoid the limelight, working diligently as a limo-driver in an effort to save money for the dream of buying a 'Sunseeker' and sailing off with Xavier into the sunset, gaining true anonymity among the boating fraternity.Life doesn't play ball though. A brutal encounter with a gang on the highway outside El Paso advertises Wolverine's presence and brings him into contact with a strange eleven-year-old girl (Dafne Keen) with impressive powers of her own. The girl is being pursued by a ""reiver"" (Boyd Holbrook, ""Run all Night"") supported by a small private army. Against his will, Wolverine is forced into a memorable road trip with the old man and the young girl that leaves a trail of bloodied bodies behind them.For, be warned, this is an *extremely* violent film, with much dismemberment and 'blade work' that must have kept the prosthetics department busy for months. It's also quite emotionally brutal, particularly within a central segment set in a ""Field of Dreams"" style idyll (featuring Eriq La Salle from E.R.) that you know in your gut is not going to end with ""Goodnight John Boy"" pleasantries.The well-choreographed and frenetic action within the road-trip segment reminded me at times of the harsh cinematography and dynamics of ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" – a great compliment.But the film also takes time to pause, in uncharacteristic Marvel- ways, for character development and genuinely intelligent dialogue. These interludes allow the acting to shine, and it is first-rate. We all know (from ""Les Miserables"" for instance) that Hugh Jackman can act, but this is arguably his best-ever performance: a meaty role (he actually has two in the film) that affords him tremendous range and emotion. At one point towards the end of the film I thought ""this has genuine Oscar show-reel potential"". He will surely never get nominated – a Marvel film? Get Away! But wouldn't it make a refreshing change if he was? Recognizing good acting, regardless of the context.Patrick Stewart is a great Shakespearean actor, and here he also gets given full rein to impress as he hasn't had chance to in most of his movie roles to date.Claiming the prize so far this year for the most unusual casting decision is Stephen Merchant as the albino helper Caliban, unrecognizable to me at first until he had some lengthy dialogue to flex his Bristol accent on! A non-comic and dramatic role, Merchant does really well with it.Finally, I can't leave the acting without doffing my cap to young Dafne Keen whose mesmerising feral stare would probably put the fear of God into every parent of a pre-teen girl! Even though she has only a handful of lines, this is an impressive feature film debut. I predict we will see much more of this young lady.Less convincing to me was Richard E Grant as the evil mastermind behind the scheme, who never quite seemed nasty enough to me to be believable: in one scene he could be calling back a dog that's run off down the beach rather than desperately trying to gain control of an out of control situation!Directed by James Mangold (""Walk the Line"", ""Knight and Day""), who co-wrote the piece with Scott Frank (""Minority Report"") and Michael Green (""Green Lantern"" yes, really!), this was a gritty and well constructed movie. If you can stomach the gore and the body count (I would see it as very lucky to have got away with its UK '15' certificate) this is a roller-coaster of a movie that is recommended.By the way, to save you from sitting through the end titles (although you do get a Johnny Cash classic to enjoy) there is no ""monkey"" at the end of this Marvel film. (I'm no stranger to still be sitting there as the lights come up but many of the crowd that were left looked vaguely embarrassed!)In terms of my rating, I'm not a fanboy for Marvel or DC properties, but here I award a rating I have only previously bestowed on two superhero films before: the quirky ""Ant Man"" and the anarchic ""Deadpool"".

What a Surprise,"Plot: In the near future, a weary Logan cares for an ailing Professor X somewhere on the Mexican border. However, Logan's attempts to hide from the world and his legacy are upended when a young mutant arrives, pursued by dark forces.I'll be honest when I watched the trailers for this film, I thought it would be a boring and uninteresting film and another failure for a Wolverine film. However, I'm happy to say that this is not the case with this film. I was generally surprised by how the story was told along with the cast doing a very good job playing their characters especially Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, Boyd Holbrook, Stephen Merchant and especially Dafne Keen.Dafne Keen was a big surprise considering some child actors would just be portrayed as annoying and cliché, this was not the case with her, she excelled as this character portraying the right amount of emotion at the right time. The action in the film is well shot, not using any shaky cam or fast cut editing which I was happy with just like I was with John Wick Chapter 2.Another thing I should praise is the cinematography which is gorgeous which is shocking to me since I didn't think it looked that great in the trailers which made it look very low budget.My only problems were the length, this film needed to be cut down about 20-30 minutes and that would've helped the pacing at times, and that most of the villains(save for Boyd Holbrook) were very one dimensional and weak. Besides that this is a surprisingly good film in the inconsistent x-men film franchise, I don't think this is The Dark Knight of comic book films, that is pushing it, but it's a film that you should go see if you're a comic book film or even a movie fan in general.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

There has to be some bad guys, or else how else you get the fighting Messiahs? And the audience will see a slow scene with the bad guys coming in. Than there is a distraction. And a minor fight.

"Sweet adieu, Logan","You will know from get-go that this is the Wolverine movie you have been clamouring for when the first word out of Logan's mouth is an F-bomb and he proceeds to slice and dice scumbags who are trying to jack his car.I like what director James Mangold has done here. It's great that I see risky turns being undertaken in a genre that is rife with just adhering to an over-used template of upping the amount of Defcon One city-levelling destruction. Here, everything is stripped down to an almost unplugged lo-fi setup. Titular characters are distilled to their bare essence and everything that they held firm are tested, their resolve magnified as they stand up for one last hurrah before the curtain call.All through 17 years of Wolverine, the character never had a chance to unleash the level of violence that is synonymous with the claw-for-hands brutish hero. The first one is an embarrassing made for kids action flick, while the second one is a marked improvement albeit with just a sprinkling of blood. I think we have last year's Deadpool to thank for when the studios finally realised an R-rated action superhero movie can haul in big bucks. Of all the Marvel characters, Wolverine practically cries out for the same treatment; he has been crying out for 17 years. It is just gratifying to finally see the character unchained and the balls-up action up to the bloody wall. Hugh Jackman finally gets a chance to flex his acting muscles with an incredible swan song to a fascinating character.Though distinctively lo-fi in its setup, it is ultimately hi-fi in the way the story respects the characters. The theme here is family with Professor X as the grandfather and Logan as the father figure to a precarious child not in touch with the workings of the outside world. The story also takes a hard look at superheroes beset by everyday problems of putting food on the table and running away from their past. Physically, they are ageing and ailing, their abilities becoming liabilities in a world that find them irrelevant and only fit for the comic books. It is a brave way to tell a superhero story and I only hope this opens the door to more experiments.Is Logan perfect? Not by a long shot. Some of the expositions have no guile and the actual story takes a while to get going. The middle act has some really inert moments and the pace also slacks quite a bit. So in a sense the risk taking turns are curtailed by some storytelling elements. Still, this is finally the Wolverine movie I have been waiting for.Sweet adieu, Logan.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Logan is really the most haunting superhero film since The Dark Knight.,"Logan (2017): Superpowers are one thing, but no-one said they were immortal. What happens when superheroes get old? Actually, what happens when, like many non-superheroes, they arrive at late middle-age without a partner, in ill health, and with an ageing parent to look after? I have hear rave reviews about Logan and many of them claimed that it is the most emotional superhero movie of all time.Except for Hugh Jackman's terrific portrayal,I never cared about Wolverine but Logan proved me wrong.Even not being a fan,Logan made me teary-eyed at the end ans Yes.. Logan is one of the most emotional superhero movie of all time.Plot: In 2029 the mutant population has shrunken significantly and the X-Men have disbanded. Logan (Hugh Jackman), whose power to self-heal is dwindling, has surrendered himself to alcohol and now earns a living as a chauffeur. He takes care of the ailing old Professor X (Patrick Stewart) whom he keeps hidden away. One day, a female stranger asks Logan to drive a girl named Laura (Dafne Keen) to the Canadian border. At first he refuses, but the Professor has been waiting for a long time for her to appear. Laura possesses an extraordinary fighting prowess and is in many ways like Wolverine. She is pursued by sinister figures working for a powerful corporation; this is because her DNA contains the secret that connects her to Logan.My Review: Logan is more like a survivalist thriller than a superhero film.Who would even dare tho think to make superheroes to fight for their survival?Logan did.Logan is an emphatically cheerless film about the cost of life, and the burden of being a superhero in a world that doesn't deserve them.Part of the reason why Logan manages to be so emotionally effective is because it arrives late in the process for Jackman. The actor has been wearing the claws and percing the flseh out of everyone for 17 years, and he lets those miles show in every haggard look on display in Logan. Jackman full comprehends exactly what Wolverine needs to convey in each Logan scene -- whether its concern or compassion, remorse or berserker rage -- because he has occupied this character's skin for so long. It's second nature, and the decisions he makes along every painstaking step of Logan help ensure the movie's masterful success.The second reason is the chemistry between Logan,Professor X and new entry, Laura.Our tired Logan taking care of ill-Xavier and the relation between them is heartwarming and funny at times too. Laura,who is almost mute for almost 3/4th of the film except for the screaming whenever she fights.All 3 of them has good chemistry between them which made us cry at the sad parts.Logan doesn't follow the superhero blueprint, though that's a check in its favor. There are villains, yes, but the real antagonist staring down Wolverine is time, and fate. Cities aren't blown up and no visual destruction is shown in this movie.It has everything common which is uncommon for superhero film.I was deeply moved by Jackman's soulful, intense and, yes, Oscar-worthy performance, which draws from every appearance as the Wolverine.Jackman wears pain, persecution and baggage in his eyes, and in his sighs. We see him wanting to stamp out hope but unable to go through with it, the actor carving up his character with both weariness and restlessness at once. It is a strong, resonant performance, an appropriately powerful.By his side is the great Patrick Stewart, who gives the most emotionally affecting performance of the entire X-Men franchise as a decrepit, mentally weakened Professor Charles Xavier.Dafne Keen is an absolute showstopper of a child who has all of Logan's powers and more, and none of the restraint its taken him lifetimes to accumulate. and the way this young child relishes the violence -- slicing villains to shreds with wildcat rage and ice-cream-truck glee -- may be this film's most disturbing image.So,Logan is really the most haunting superhero film since The Dark Knight.My rating 8.25/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Logan Review,"Logan is the final chapter in Hugh Jackman's Wolverine story. With it's R rating and darker tone, this had the potential to be Marvel's (well Fox's) Dark Night, or burn where it stands like the other Wolverine film. Thank god it was the first one.In Logan we get an old Logan, an Old Man Logan. While it is extremely loosely based off the comic, it was still great to get this older Logan that just doesn't care. His aged, his body isn't like it use to be, and his starting to become a grumpy old man. What was so great about this aged version of Wolverine, is you can see the younger Wolverine from previous film turning into this guy over time. Everything he did didn't seem out of character and he still had the Wolverine personality he has had for 17 years. I think much of this is down to the performance of Jackman. No matter what quality of X-Men movie he has been in, he has nailed Wolverine and this film is no different.As well as being Jackman's last appearance as Wolverine, unless there's a Deadpool cameo, it was also Patrick Stewart's last appearance as Professor X. I've always really like Patrick Stewart as Charles, despite not jumping into the X-Men franchise til the new incarnation of McAvoy had come about. In Logan, Professor X is aged and unstable and I liked them playing with the idea of what would happen when the most powerful mind in the world becomes old. Through seizers that is able to freeze everyone in their place, we got to see how dangerous Charles has unintentionally become in his old age. While I've always really liked Professor X as a character through the other films, I think this is my favourite version of him because he comes with so much depth and history that he feels like this powerful and wise mutant. Again like Jackman, Stewart's performance is outstanding during this film and what is done with the character is because of what Stewart was about to do.Moving on to our new mutant, Laura, aka X-23, was an absolute hit with me. Not meaning to get repetitive but the performance by Dafne Keen brought this innocence yet uncontrollable aggression to the character. While I'm not too familiar with the character itself in the comics, I felt like they were able to give her a great origin and make it clear who she is and how she has come to be. While this film is an end to an era in many ways, it still leaves a slight gap open to a new series, which I would personally be all for because we would have X-23 leading the pack. She was such a strong character and it is disappointing that we probably aren't going to get more of her story because she's a character you want to follow. Now onto the R rating. This film needed it. While Deadpool needed the R rating for the humour, Logan needs the humour the the realisticness. This is the most grounded and realistic X-Men film we have ever gotten. We are in this lived in and matured world that not giving it the realistic treatment. The main reason for the R rating is the language and violence, very similar to Deadpool, however it was used in such a different way. We got to see what Wolverine is, a killing machine, and not only that, his an aged killing machine that just doesn't care no more. With that comes the violence and gore that we got in this movie. As far as language goes, it's one of those things that when it's not there you don't notice it, but when it is, you appreciate it. While the language wasn't too vague in anyway, being able to have the characters say what they do is more realistic than anything else in this movie. These are mutants who have gone through hell, and being able to see them do simple stuff like drop an F bomb when their frustrated or express their surprise with language gives them more of a realistic feel than I would have gotten from anything else.Touching on the villains, while they weren't the strongest villains you could think of, I didn't mind because they didn't have an extremely strong presence. They act as a way to further the plot and push our main characters further in the story and that's all they need to do. When they are great when they are on the screen they are great and their villain presence is felt and that's all I wanted them to do, especially a certain one that pops up mid way through the movie. For the most part this is a story about Logan's final chapter and him having something he has never completely had his whole life.For me, there is only one slight negative through this whole film and it's something that I didn't think of til much later. During the film they touch on what happened to the other mutants and while it give you a pretty decent idea as to what happened to them, there is part of me that wanted that bit more and to actually see what happened. It was just one of those situations where I thought they could of done a ""show not tell"", however I can see from a length point of view as to why they went about it the way they did.Overall I loved this movie. After Deadpool last year I never thought I would see a Fox Marvel property that I liked more but this is it. This is the Dark Knight for a Marvel character and it's going to go down as one of my favourite superhero movies of all time.9.5/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Logan (@cmp_moviereviews),"17 years ago, a character known and appreciated by many, was brought to life by none other than Hugh Jackman. Yes, we've all seen the goods and bads of the films surrounding Wolverine, but witnessing ""Logan"" somehow sheds new light on the character. It is a powerful, violent, rough, tough, rugged character send-off that just so happens to be included into the X-Men universe. Director, James Mangold, and his team weren't just focused on telling one final compelling story, but ending an era with grit and heart. Multiple actors can and have portrayed a single superhero, but there can and always will be one Wolverine. Thanks, Hugh. #Logan",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
The first dramatic movie the SuperHero Kids have seen.,"I'm not reviewing the movie but the fans and their reviews.What is it with all these reviews ""This is the best superhero movie"" ever? Are these written from kids and teenagers who only have seen Xmen and Captain America films? This is most definitely NOT a Superhero movie. You could easily cut out the ""Comics"" part, which by the way Logan himself states that are B.S., and have a thriller in the Mexico and U.S. countryside, with some elements of a road movie.The fans must have not seen other movies. Honestly. The director changes the mood and feel to something that belongs to another genre, without being original for that particular genre, preserving basically the names of the now elderly X-men and produces an otherwise unremarkable movie.I write these comments spoiler-free, but the ending has a serious impact to the whole mythology.In my opinion Superhero movies must stick to their original virtues so can fans to see what they are expecting to see, and leave the unnecessary darkly humane elements for other genres..",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A very rough movie full of script holes,"One of the most violent films in the history of cinema, so I was surprised by this amount of violence. Aside from the violence of the film, there is a script full of holes in the script that I do not want to reveal. But the games, especially Hugh Jackman and Professor, are very good and praiseworthy. Also, the soundtrack, although short, was good, but the film was still emotionless. Overall, this was not the best movie to say goodbye to Hugh Jackman .",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
'Logan's fowl mouth and new look ..',"Let's all just take a minute to appreciate how incredible this movie is!I mean seriously, Wolverine was dying! The last couple of films were pretty poor and you know it, but somehow when the trailer for Logan was released, audiences finally found some light at the end of the tunnel.It looked fresh, new, dark – an altogether different x-men movie and by George it didn't disappoint.I was emerged in the story within the first few minutes. We were immediately introduced to Logan's fowl mouth and new look. Had he aged? Yes. Did he still look smoking? Double yes.I don't want this review to involve spoilers of ANY kind, but it's so hard to express how fantastically deep and disturbing this movie actually is without revealing a few plot secrets (don't worry I'm not going to).The basic outline is we're a little ways into the future, mutants are a dying breed and my beloved Charles has aged a little more than I'd like to see.Their X-men days are way behind them and they're basically in hiding.Enter a mute little girl who needs their help and you've pretty much got yourself a road trip movie.This movie is riddled with tears, nostalgia and heart! Whilst being 'serious' it also manages to not take itself too seriously and honestly guys it was an almighty thumbs up from me!I can't recommend this movie enough and it seems that it's the same for every other person who's had the viewing pleasure.This was demonstrated by the fact that my usually quiet cinema was filled to the brim 8:30pm on a Tuesday. IT'S A SCHOOL NIGHT.Logan gets a resounding 9/10 from me and if you haven't already seen it, what the hell are you waiting for?",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A Terrific Finale,"Being a movie pessimist has its perks. Logan is the most pleasant surprise I've had with a movie in a very long time. Everybody and their mother has been grinding their teeth in anticipation for this movie. The expectations were absurd. Me? I saw absolutely no reason to be excited for this movie. Not even the ""R"" rating could get me excited, no matter how many times I heard someone claim that the ""R"" rating was what they needed to tell a Wolverine story that is ""true to the character"". All I knew were two things. Thing 1: We all know how the previous two solo Wolverine movies went. Thing 2: This was from the director of The Wolverine which was, in my opinion, painfully boring and dull. So I walked into the theater ready to tell all my friends how bad it was and not to get their hopes up.Logan is absolutely beautiful. As bleak and emotionally draining as it is, it's beautiful. It's the first superhero movie in a very long time that treats itself as a movie as well as a superhero movie. It's a drama and a character study of Logan. A man who's spent his entire life pushing people away and watching as all the people he ever loved or cared about die one by one. From the beginning, Logan is a very sober experience. Along with the knowledge that almost all the other mutants are dead (including all of the X-Men apart from Logan and Charles Xavier), it's also weirdly sad to see how Logan and Charles have aged. Logan's hair is all gray, Charles is senile. Maybe it's only because of the fact that there are eight other X-Men movies behind it, but another thing this movie seems to have down very well is a world that feels very alive and lived in. Like things have happened. And on top of all of this grim but wonderful detail, Logan even goes to the effort to have a good plot. It would have been so easy to have some throwaway mustache-twiddling villain who's out to end all mutants and blah blah blah and Logan has to stop him (yes, I know it's based on a comic and the story existed beforehand), but this movie really outdid itself with a plot that's engaging and extremely compelling. And to top it all off, Logan is in no hurry to set up another X-Men movie and thus it tells a much more complete story. I only wish the other two solo Wolverine movies could've been this good. Logan is an absolutely wonderful finale.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

"""What a disappointment you are."" -Charles Xavier","Charles Xavier literally calls Logan's character a disappointment in the movie, and it is so true... Logan has in the 5years since the events of 'X-Men: Days of Future Past' become such a freeking panzy. He is like a neutered little kitten... instead of killing the executives and heads of the corporation (Transigen) that is responsible for spreading an anti-mutant virus and perhaps undoing the massive damage that Transigen has caused, Logan instead chooses to be a freeking limo driver living on scraps and dealing drugs to get money on the side... WHAT kind of Wolverine is this? An old, sick, immoral, passive, compassion-less, uncaring, drug dealing, limo driver... WTF!This Logan lets people die and refuses to help humanity. He is single-handedly capable of bringing down Transigen and saving millions of lives, and yet he doesn't. Apart from this huge plot-hole, the movie has other plot-holes, such as them not killing 'Donald Pierce' when they had an opportunity to and literally hundreds of bullets being shot at a car with Xavier in it, yet him not getting hit a single time... that's simply impossible and just another plot-hole.Overall, it's an OK superhero movie, but it's a poor attempt at 'shuttering' certain characters in the X-Men universe, such a Wolverine. It's just poor writing honestly. 6.5/10 and not worth watching over anything like Deadpool or Thor Ragnarok, that's for certain.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

""The Last Stand"" was awful, true, but the franchise was brilliantly rebooted with ""First Class."" They took the time to address continuity issues, they took the time to respect the concerns that the fans of the franchise had about the reboots and even tied up some of it in ""Days of Future Past.""With ""Apocalypse"" they threw away everything they worked so hard to preserve in both the original franchise and the reboot.""Logan"" does much the same thing, it takes a once respected timeline and throws it all away, leaving just a movie, a stand alone song that doesn't fit in with the rest of the Franchise album.They aren't trying to protect the franchise any longer, they are just turning out movies with complete disregard over how they fit in with the established story.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Mutants, Reluctant Heroism, and Genetic Patents","Logan is a 2017 film based on the Wolverine character from Marvel's X-Men comic book series. Hugh Jackman portrays Logan, an aging and ill version of the character that we all know and love. Professor X is also in the film, once again played by Patrick Stewart, and is displayed as an old, senile shell of his former self, suffering from Alzheimer's disease and/or ALS.The story follows Logan as he tries to gather enough money to essentially retire on a sailboat. Wolverine and Charles Xavier cross paths with a young girl who has been artificially created using Logan's genes. The girl is being pursued as a runaway patent by a corporation, and Xavier insists that they help her. Pushed into helping the child on her adventure, the reluctant Wolverine finds himself once again attempting to fill the role of hero.Moving, exciting, and heart-wrenching at times, Logan is an excellent film. Each actor gives an amazing performance and the story is very well crafted.If there are absolutely any complaints to be made about the film, it would have to be the dialogue in the first several minutes of the film. Sounding as if written by Tarantino, the word f--- appears in every other sentence. Adult language is absolutely fine in a movie, but sometimes it sounds as if it was added later. As if any f---ing person f---ing talks like this. You f--- ing know what the f--- I mean? Also, while an excellent device used to move and elaborate the story, the professionally edited and narrated cell phone video from the nurse is so unrealistic that it pulled me out of the movie for a moment. These are very minor criticisms and do not take away from the movie as a whole.Overall, this film is a must-watch for anyone and will leave all viewers moved, whether they are comic book fans or not.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Logan (2017) - A 'Wolverine' Finale,"Logan (2017) is the final portrayal of Hugh Jackman's Wolverine.Hugh was the first wolverine in cinema and he kicked ass.He created his own trilogy and this is the final installment of his trilogy.Logan is the very definition of a Wolverine film. It is highly dark and violent with a more noir and western fusion.Director James Mangold has said that Logan's influences included ""Visual reference points"" of cinema, citing Shane (1953), The Cowboys (1972), Paper moon (1973), The Gauntlet (1977), Little miss sunshine (2006) and The wrestler (2008). They are very clearly seen when you watch closely.The conceptual niche's like ""Old Man Logan"" and ""Post X-Men universe"" is discussed in Logan.Overall one of the best films of the X-men universe with reference to Wolverine.Good bye...

He shot Logan because Logan knew these people were after him and yet still put the farmer's family in danger. I would have shot him as well. Another asks why the children did what they did during numerous events? They are kids moron. Why didn't Xavier sense X-24 was there (the reviewer said he was a robot which automatically make him stupid). Xavier is drugged up most of the movie that is why.

A straightforward superhero film,"Logan, made in the wake of Nolan's universally acclaimed batman trilogy is the superhero genre, after dark. In light of this as well as its reputation as one of the great superhero films, I was expecting a dark and subversive character thriller. And I got that. Kinda.A very much plot driven film, the arcs and beats are extremely telegraphed to the audience. So much so that multiple times, I was predicting beats in the film 10 minutes before they happened. Yes, the more realistic take on a washed up hero is somewhat interesting, but as we get into the meat of the film, the story gets more and more predictable. It really is just your average 3 act superhero film. I did really enjoy the subversions written in with the level of gore and occasional unexpected interaction. However, it doesn't change the fact that the high level and medium level storytelling is the exact same as any other marvel film.Okay, now some good things to say about the film. Jackman's performance is really great. It's visceral and ferocious, like the hero he plays. Stewart was good as well, funny beats and believable performance. The film visually looks good, not great, but good. Action sequences with a lot of wide shots was great.Final sour point: I know this has been beaten to death, but on average kids are terrible actors. This film isn't an exception. Dafne Keen, especially when speaking is a lower point in the film. Of course, this is more a flaw with the real world as opposed to a flaw with the writing/directing, but still.All in all, I'm not really seeing the hype for this film. Whereas Nolan's batman ascends beyond the superhero genre, Logan stays firmly within it. Perhaps near the top.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Logan ShowMeTheMovies Review,"The final X-men picture goes out with a depressing whimper instead of the emotional roller-coaster that was intended.Over time, X-men movies have grown more and more inconsistent in terms of tone and pacing between films; maintaining consistency is a difficult task with such a vast franchise (particularly one with multiple timelines), but Logan manages to be one of the 'odd films out' in that it is far more grounded than its' predecessors. In making the movie more grounded, the film is far more dark and brooding than any other X-men movie, portraying Logan/Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) as a jaded and depressed mutant and even the presence of a child throughout doesn't lighten the tone.There is no doubt that having Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart in their usual roles is the best the movie has to offer, it is clear that they are completely comfortable in their roles to such an extent that one cannot imagine anyone else performing. Their presence on-screen is fierce and captivating; and I could not praise Logan enough for this.The movie however is riddled with faults throughout, starting with the primary plot point of the film, the most important character involved: Laura (Dafne Keen). The introduction of this character is key to the entire fabric of how the film runs and functions as a storyline, yet she is unlikable and irritating. I have pictured a version of the film's events without her presence, and she does not add to the story as a single entity at all, despite the fact she is among the centre of events. To put it simply: the film revolves around her as a character, but if not present, the film would not lose an entertaining or vaguely interesting on-screen performance. This is not down to acting talent, but script writing which paints Laura as a damsel in distress despite the fact she can clearly handle herself during action scenes.The action is undeniably entertaining, yet comes few and far between. Some dramatic moments include Logan having to deal with Xavier having a seizure, which causes the surroundings to be affected perilously and Logan must stop the seizure by calming Xavier down with an injection, which just involves Wolverine walking toward Xavier in slow motion, disposing of a couple of enemies who are frozen and cannot move. This doesn't particularly constitute its' own 'action' segment, and detracts from the real moments in the film in which the protagonists really can entertain the viewer with some incredible bloodthirsty scenes.Logan is a bloodthirsty film overall, at no point is there a pause in the violence that the movie shows, which again, changes the tone from most of the other films within the franchise. This film is not for the light-hearted, and those that find themselves huge fans of the series are definitely going to enjoy the movie; this is not the first X-men film which I can say has flaws, and while I know that the film isn't perfect and I personally did not find the plot captivating (in fact the plot is not anything we haven't seen before), I know that a lover of the X-men series is going to find that this movie will tug on their heartstrings time and time again.The need to thrust the important parts of the story upon Laura is completely unnecessary, when this film tries and fails to get the audience to enjoy her as a character, it then attempts to make her relatable by placing her opinions and feelings towards Logan in line with that of the audience: of admiration. This didn't work on me at all, and I still found her an annoyance as the film began to close, and due to the fact the main focus was shifted slightly from Logan and greatly from Xavier to this new character, it meant these beloved characters did not get the chance to really relate like they have done in other films before their exit.Is Logan a good film? At least partially. Is it a good X-men film? Absolutely. The vast inconsistency with other X-men movies puts it above many others, naming The Wolverine and X-men Origins: Wolverine as the main movies that Logan has managed to top (which wasn't particularly difficult). I can recommend the movie to anyone who loves X-men and Marvel, but definitely not to anyone else.https://showme-themovies.blogspot.co.uk/2017/03/review-logan.html",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Berserker Rage on Screen,"This is an excerpt from Nerdent ""dot"" Net.Logan is Hugh Jackman's last movie playing the character many cannot break apart and making the movie based off of Mark Miller's renowned Old Man Logan. I had my doubts about this film only due to the fact key characters in the series are splintered owned by separate companies. However, the way James Mangold has crafted the story he was able to jump over many of the major hurdles holding this movie back.The tone of this movie is gritty and real though scene can tug at the heartstrings with that family undertone. This might be the most realistic X-Men movie in existence with all the glitter stripped away from the characters no mansion, on the run, and bodies breaking down. I forgot about the movie being R rated until being carded at the theaters but it was well deserved as the action in this movie was bloody gruesome and just plain animistic. Even though this is based on Old Man Logan I was surprised to see so little attempt of Logan not using his claws, except hinting at it in one scene and instead often sent into Berserker Rage.Though there is plenty of rage, crudeness, and substance use there is still some wholesome qualities such as family qualities. We've seen Xavier and Logan go at it in previous movies as they know much about each other. Charles might have the best grasp on Logan due to knowing where he came from and what he has done which is why he wants Logan to have a normal life with Laura. Similarly, Logan despite being hesitant of having a daughter, in the beginning, is soon a father figure in her life. Logan slowly becomes what Xavier wants from him a father as he places his life on the line as X-23 and her siblings as they make their way to Canada.Logan was the perfect standoff to Hugh Jackman's run of the character he has been playing for the last 17 years. Though the film is Rated R and full of adult content ranging from substance use to bloody gore Mangold ties it together with a family vibe with all the characters. I believe it could've been more faithful to the source material though splintered fractions of Marvel characters hindered it. Stylistically the movie was a work of art from the cinematography to choreography. Where Wolverine will go from here is still to be seen but he will pop up sooner than later due to the character's popularity.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
The Claws are Drawn for One More Time. Logan is an Amazing End for Wolverine,"With a set of metal claws, an ability to heal from wounds, and a Clint Eastwood-like attitude, you get the superhero animal known as Wolverine. Within the X-Men comics, Wolverine has become one of the most iconic and popular characters of not just that team, but for Marvel in general. While some of that comes down to a neat design, the character of feels the roughest of personalities. This has allowed him to confront his enemies with more of a street-smart mindset that the other X-Men lack. It also helps that his regeneration practically makes him the perfect shield for the other heroes.His cinematic outings have worked thanks to the casting of Hugh Jackman. He manages to carry the necessary roughness with the combination of the actor's charisma. What this makes is a Wolverine that remains popular even though he has never worn the famous costume from the comics. This is simply excellent direction. It makes sense that the actor wouldn't be able to play the character forever and had to exit at some point. Had it not been for the critically acclaimed Old Man Logan comic, writers might still be searching for a good idea. What comes for Wolverines final cinematic story is Logan.Set in 2029 sometime after X-Men: Apocalypse, the mutants are close to being extinct due to no new ones being born in a while. Logan (played by Hugh Jackman) has aged considerably now that his healing is much slower and the metal that's attached to his skeleton and claws is poisoning him. He works as a chauffeur and caring for Charles Xavier (played by Patrick Stewart) who is retired and suffering a disease that causes him to lose control of his telepathic abilities and memory loss. A nurse approaches Logan asking for safe transport to North Dakota for her and her child Laura.Logan agrees for a payment, but finds that nurse murdered the morning they were supposed to leave. When he returns home, he finds Laura in the trunk. Not too long later is when Donald Pierce (played by Boyd Holbrook) comes with a security team to kill Laura. During the battle, it's discovered that Laura has a similar set of claws and a similar regeneration power like Wolverines. Logan, Xavier, and Laura escape and hit the road to drive north. What they're hoping for is the last chance for mutants to continue.Not only does the movie contain a lot of story elements that I don't want to spoil, but it contains a lot of acting moments that are also worth keeping secret. It's rare to find a ""three"" movie that's the best of a series, but Logan seems to be that specialty. Not only is it the darkest and most violent (it takes full advantage of the R rating), but it's also the most mature. What I mean by that is that this feels like a very adult story regarding aging, politics about minorities, and even genuine drama between Wolverine and Laura.Out of all the X-Men movies, Logan is the least superhero of all, and that's a good thing. Hugh Jackman's Logan plays off more like a cowboy as his character practically refuses to be the hero that most audiences have identified him as. He's more weary and damaged then before, and his performance reminds you of a scar that contains a good story. By the end, you'll not only be fighting off tears, but feel that the song use of Johnny Cash's ""The Man Comes Around"" is worth it. Logan is without a doubt, the best of the X-Men series (yes, even over Deadpool).I'll give this nine Wolverines out of ten. In the ages of capes and super villains, it's refreshing to see something that's more grounded. It takes inspiration from the right places (Shane, Children of Men, etc) and uses it's action to it's full advantage to make the perfect last ride for good old Wolverine",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Logan,"From the first moment Johnny Cash's mournful voice graced that terrific trailer, there was a sense that Hugh Jackman and director James Mangold were not going to play by the rules anymore. For Jackman, it was his ninth time playing Wolverine, and for Mangold, it is another shot to perfect what he almost achieved in 2013, when he sent Logan to Japan.For both of them however, it was now or never. Jackman's missed no opportunity to tell everyone that this would be his last time playing the Wolverine, the character that defined his career, and would probably continue to define him for the rest of his life. Perhaps it was this pressure to do well, to erase bad memories (hopefully, after this, X-Men Origins will be forgotten), or perhaps it was the freedom afforded to it by the success of Deadpool, but Logan is unlike any superhero film you have seen. Like that Cash song, it is minimalistic, meditative, melancholy, and has nothing to lose anymore. We've seen him go through hell, we've seen him watch on as everyone he loves dies, and all he can do is keep living. All Wolverine can do is keep fighting. But what for?The reason comes in the form of a girl, no older than 10.When we catch up with Logan, grizzled, visibly older, the scars on his body like haunting memories of the past, it is 2029. No mutants have been born in the last 20 years. They've become folktales, legends passed on in comic books, and perhaps even movies. Logan scrapes a living driving a limo near the US-Mexico border. The little money he makes goes into buying medicine for his friend Charles, Professor X. They live in the desert, away from everyone else, together, like they have been for so many years. They're all they have in this world.And then, Laura arrives. She's a lot like him, Charles tells Logan. She's a mutant. The first one to come along in decades. And she's the only hope they have. It is rumoured that thousands of miles away, in North Dakota, there is a safe haven for others like her, like them. That is where they must take her, away from the bad men.They do the only thing they can. In a subtle homage to the first X-Men movie, Logan takes the girl under his wing. They steal a car, grab some snacks, and take to the road.It is said that the superhero movie will soon go the way of the movie Western (not by me, but by better minds, like Spielberg and Lucas), how it has arrived at a saturation point, how the six-shooters and cowboy hats made way for spandex and force fields as they journeyed towards their final destination. For an uncommonly grim film which would much rather contemplate mortality than gleefully demolish a city, the idea of Logan reviving a dying genre – two dying genres – is almost poetic.There is only one way to push this genre forward, to prevent it from becoming obsolete. And that is to deconstruct it, to rip off all the excess CGI, all the capes and cowls, and exhume the essence of what makes these movies so great. Logan does that. And then it does it again.It takes cues from classics like Children of Men, The Wrestler, and even the great video game The Last of Us. It is uncompromising in its brutality and fearless in its reverence of these iconic characters. It's a testament to the power of storytelling, and what creative freedom can produce.Logan's cinematic journey began 17 years ago in a forest. He was making money fighting in cages. A young girl saved him then, she showed him what it was like to have a family, what it felt like to be good. In Logan, it takes another girl to show him who he really is, to remind him that his life was worth something.It is the perfect swansong he could've got.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Farewell,"Logan is the most unique superhero movie since The Dark Knight. There are glaring similarities between the TDK and Logan. The casting in both movies are excellent. The acting performances in both movies are excellent. Both movies build to the climax, i.e., both movies elevate the tension until the end in memorable fashion. Furthermore, Logan varies from Deadpool because Logan takes a more gritty and real world undertone whereas Deadpool is more comedic and still feels in the realm of a superhero movie. Logan is unique.Thank you Mr. Jackman for your brilliant performance in Logan and all of your previous work for the X-Men franchise.

"In summary, this rendition is a masterpiece of its own kind. It has one of the story lines I consider terrific.","Logan is one of the most interesting movies I've come across this year. I love the story line and the plot. It tells much about an imaginary world with super-natural kids. I also believe that the movie has been organized in a very critical manner sending out the best message to the audience. Nevertheless, I believe the picture quality could have been adjusted to the best level. I don't underscore the quality, but of course I have come across movies with exceptionally intelligent pictures. For instance, Revenant's gory concept could have been adopted here.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
There is maybe one too many robot arms in this movie.,"I feel obligated to mention that I have seen all the other movies featuring Hugh Jackman. I don't really like any of them especially. Some are decent and others are sort of bad and forgettable. The context and history surrounding it are apparent to me, though they don't do too much to influence my feelings on this particular film.All that being said, this film is probably the best I've seen featuring this portrayal of this character. It's legitimately pretty good. Some of what some people would say makes it exceptional though I think is sort of relative. The fact that it has a stronger emotional core and more adult story than its predecessors doesn't mean that on its own its a great film. It's certainly refreshing considering the franchise as a whole, but only really from a story perspective. In its execution I can't say that beyond the especially violent action, which is pretty neat, it really goes above and beyond in any major way. Despite one memorable shot, the visual nature of the film doesn't really feel like it represents a unique voice. I have never seen a film from James Mangold before, besides The Wolverine, and I honestly don't think I could make much of an educated guess on what any of his other films are like based on this one. In all honesty it seems like he did a lot more for this film as a writer than as a director. That isn't to say that the direction is bad or that the story is amazing, but relative to the rest of the franchise one did a lot more to elevate this film than the other.Like I say, the story isn't amazing. It's good, and it helps this film to stand on its own, but there are definitely some logical lapses (How did he not see those cars earlier, how does she know how to use that gun, etc). I will say though, to Mangold's credit as both a writer and director, there were parts of this film that, while cheesy, could have been way cheesier and potentially ruined the film. It is solid on its own, but I would concede that, despite not really liking the franchise all that much, this story inevitably holds a greater emotional value for you if your a long time fan of this character and of these movies.It's got something for everyone. Check it out or don't. You'll probably get out of it what you expect, and what more could you ask for?",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Jackman's Last Stand As Wolverine,"Logan is the third in the trilogy of the Wolverine films and is significantly better than its predecessor The Wolverine. An underlying theme throughout this third film is mortality, and the cycle of life. Jackman is once again solid in his portrayal of Wolverine but it is Patrick Stewart who provides the stand out performance adding gravitas to the film. Richard E Grant is underused as is Stephen Merchant. The tone of the film is a much more adult one rather than a comic book tone and that does lend to the script. The film looks good and the action sequences although not standout are serviceable. Logan wraps Hugh Jackman tenure as Wolverine up nicely and is a good film, however i think it slightly misses the fun element of Wolverine Origins and at 2 hrs 17 mins is a bit too long. This aside Jackman goes out on a high.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Terminaverine,"Notice the positive reviews of this and every other XMen/Wolverine  movie. They all claim ""masterpiece"", ""the best superhero movie  eveeeeeeeeeeeer"", and ""this is how you make a superhero movie"".  The positive reviews are canned, scripted, generated by publicists.  This movie wants to be Terminator. It even uses similar music as the  perfect killing machine stalks a little girl protected by the imperfect  killing machine.  Like other Boreverine movies, this one takes away Wolverine's healing  because the writers don't know how to handle it. The Wolverine from the  comic books is weakened and supposedly humanized. But what's left is a  Wolverine bereft of what makes him super and bereft of all emotion.  Can we get a superhero movie that's about a hero?",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Superb swansong for Hugh Jackman,"Sorry this is quite late, I couldn't get to see Logan at my local cinema but anyway, Logan is a terrific film, it follows a weathered Logan, caring for a sick Charles Xavier and his reluctant journey helping a young girl, who may be more than she seems. The reason this film works is how vastly different it is from the others in the X-men series its a lot more bitter and darker and this is reflected in the R-rated violence, the violence is so brutal and would maybe be jarring in a different X-men film but for this darker take on the character of Logan it works. The performances in this film are also on point with Hugh Jackman as always making an awesome Wolverine and also Patrick Stewart who has to play a lot less hopeful and positive Charles Xavier amongst these are also a menacing villain and competent child acting. Overall-A superb entry to the X-men universe and probably my second favorite after Days OF Future Past.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Favourite Superhero Movie,"I wasn't really excited seeing Logan. I went in expecting just another generic X-men movie. What I got was far beyond my expectations. In my opinion this is Hugh Jackman's best performance and also his last as Wolverine. The directing was great especially during the tense and action-packed fight scenes. The movie had a number of epic and thrilling scenes with a few touching and sad moments. It was good to see Patrick Stewart come back as Professor X. It was a great send off for the character Wolverine. Overall, Logan is a thrilling action-packed ride with sad moments and a ton of gore.

An Emotional And Hard Hitting Send-Off For The Immortal Superhero,"The X-Men franchise has seen its ups and downs. Many characters have come and gone. But there was one character that most fans loved the most; The Wolverine.Wolverine is known for his sheer power, brutality, and rebellious attitude. Australian actor Hugh Jackman carried the role brilliantly for seventeen years in such a way that it is very difficult to imagine any other actor filling his shoes. Yet all good things must end and his character finally signs off in the just released film Logan.With recent X-Men movies being completely revamped with different timelines and new characters, it was time to let old characters go. Hugh Jackman's age and recent health issues also made him feel that he wouldn't be able to give his best in the coming years. Here he teams up with James Mangold, director of the 2013 film 'The Wolverine', to give the best possible send-off with the intense and emotional Logan.The previous Wolverine movies 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine', and 'The Wolverine', were not critics' favourites, nor did they create much havoc at the box office. After being slammed by the critics and some fans for his previous Wolverine venture, Director James Mangold gives us the best Wolverine this time. Being the first R-rated movie of the X-Men franchise, Logan justifies its rating in every possible way. The frustrated Logan and Professor X do not shy away from cursing. The action sequences are raw and not heavily dependent on CGI. The film neatly captures the emotional and physical hardship of Logan as he battles through his inner self and external evils while feeling the responsibility of doing what's right. The movie is not about the mutant Wolverine, but rather the human Logan, which makes it both different from and superior to the rest of Wolverine's films.Logan is set in the year 2029. The timeline follows events after X-Men: Days of Future Past. Mutants are having a tough time surviving, and the Logan's powers are wearing off. He is living an isolated and disastrous life as a limousine driver, while also looking after Professor X whose health has worsened. The tone is gloomy and dark.Logan is approached by a lady who seeks help to protect Laura, a 'special' kid who is being pursued by the evil organization Transigen. Laura is part of their experiment. Circumstances bring Logan and her together as they escape along with Professor X, and Logan slowly learns a dark and bitter truth. What follows are some raw, hard-core action sequences, brilliant performances, and a scintillating climax.The film revolves around Logan, Laura, and Professor X, and their unexpected journey together. An ageing Hugh Jackman fits the role. The character of Wolverine gave him his fame in Hollywood, and he makes sure to do it justice one last time. Fans are bound to experience mixed emotions watching Logan putting on his reading glasses, but there are also many action sequences which remind us of the Wolverine of old. Patrick Stewart as a tired and unstable Professor X also gives his best.The movie has its funny moments thanks to the brilliant chemistry between Logan and Professor X. It almost feels nostalgic watching them arguing over little things and nagging each other, but it is the young Dafne Keen who is the show stealer with her portrayal of Laura, whose actions speak more than words. The sequences with her and Logan fighting together are jaw-dropping.Logan is the perfect ending to one of the great legendary characters of recent times. The only catch is that this film is very violent and not at all recommended for younger kids. Logan is an action-packed emotional ride, whether you are an X-Men fan or not. I walked away with a heavy heart, as I expect most of you will.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Hugh Jackman delivers brutal, touching swansong to Wolverine","""Guys, you don't want to do this."" We've been in this situation before. Logan is surrounded by half a dozen goons. They're usually armed. Depending on where he is at that moment, he could be attacked by katanas, revolvers, or like this time, with monkey wrenches. But he warns them. It's only fair. They don't know who he is, what he's capable of.This is how Logan begins. But this time, events don't pan out like they used to. Wolverine doesn't have a wry smile on his face as he hacks and slashes his way out. This time, he gets beaten to a pulp, the blows break his bones, rip out his flesh. The wounds that once used to heal immediately are left gaping. There's blood everywhere. And lot of swearing. This time, unlike the countless times before, Logan almost dies.From the first moment Johnny Cash's mournful voice graced that terrific trailer, there was a sense that Hugh Jackman and director James Mangold were not going to play by the rules anymore. For Jackman, it was his ninth time playing Wolverine, and for Mangold, it is another shot to perfect what he almost achieved in 2013, when he sent Logan to Japan.For both of them however, it was now or never. Jackman's missed no opportunity to tell everyone that this would be his last time playing the Wolverine, the character that defined his career, and would probably continue to define him for the rest of his life. Perhaps it was this pressure to do well, to erase bad memories (hopefully, after this, X-Men Origins will be forgotten), or perhaps it was the freedom afforded to it by the success of Deadpool, but Logan is unlike any superhero film you have seen. Like that Cash song, it is minimalistic, meditative, melancholy, and has nothing to lose anymore. We've seen him go through hell, we've seen him watch on as everyone he loves dies, and all he can do is keep living. All Wolverine can do is keep fighting. But what for? The reason comes in the form of a girl, no older than 10.When we catch up with Logan, grizzled, visibly older, the scars on his body like haunting memories of the past, it is 2029. No mutants have been born in the last 20 years. They've become folktales, legends passed on in comic books, and perhaps even movies. Logan scrapes a living driving a limo near the US-Mexico border. The little money he makes goes into buying medicine for his friend Charles, Professor X. They live in the desert, away from everyone else, together, like they have been for so many years. They're all they have in this world.And then, Laura arrives. She's a lot like him, Charles tells Logan. She's a mutant. The first one to come along in decades. And she's the only hope they have. It is rumoured that thousands of miles away, in North Dakota, there is a safe haven for others like her, like them. That is where they must take her, away from the bad men.They do the only thing they can. In a subtle homage to the first X-Men movie, Logan takes the girl under his wing. They steal a car, grab some snacks, and take to the road.It is said that the superhero movie will soon go the way of the movie Western (not by me, but by better minds, like Spielberg and Lucas), how it has arrived at a saturation point, how the six-shooters and cowboy hats made way for spandex and force fields as they journeyed towards their final destination. For an uncommonly grim film which would much rather contemplate mortality than gleefully demolish a city, the idea of Logan reviving a dying genre – two dying genres – is almost poetic.There is only one way to push this genre forward, to prevent it from becoming obsolete. And that is to deconstruct it, to rip off all the excess CGI, all the capes and cowls, and exhume the essence of what makes these movies so great. Logan does that. And then it does it again.It takes cues from classics like Children of Men, The Wrestler, and even the great video game The Last of Us. It is uncompromising in its brutality and fearless in its reverence of these iconic characters. It's a testament to the power of storytelling, and what creative freedom can produce.Logan's cinematic journey began 17 years ago in a forest. He was making money fighting in cages. A young girl saved him then, she showed him what it was like to have a family, what it felt like to be good. In Logan, it takes another girl to show him who he really is, to remind him that his life was worth something.It is the perfect swansong he could've got.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Brutal and personal.,"Seventeen years and eight films after he first donned the iconic mutton chops and sharpened those adamantium claws, Hugh Jackman is back one last time in his most iconic role of Wolverine in Logan. With the ominous tagline 'His time has come' looming over the film, my hopes were that they'd be able to do both the character and Jackman justice after the two solo outings we've had so far have left a lot to be desired.The year is 2029 and there hasn't been a mutant born for twenty-five years. Attempting to hide from his life and legacy, Logan (Hugh Jackman) lives on the Mexican border providing care for an ailing Professor X (Patrick Stewart).With his powers dwindling, Logan is approached to help with Laura (Dafne Keen), a young mutant being pursued by dark forces. bringing everything he tried to put in the past right back to the fore.First thing that struck me about Logan was just how different a take on the character this was going to be. Sure, he's always had anger issues but we have never seen him in this state before, constant pain and deteriorating powers making him a shadow of his former self. Right from the off we are thrown into a scenario that perfectly sets the tone for the film about to unfold, it's subtly comical yet brutally violent, making me so glad we finally have an R rated Wolverine film.The violence isn't unnecessary either, supporting a more realistic portrayal of Logan taking down his enemies. It also helps the action sequences flow better, rather than having to cut away every time someone gets stabbed in the head the camera can linger a little longer on the mess Logan and X-23 leave in their wake, one long take in particular towards the end gloriously showing Wolverine at his devastating best. It's at this moment that I have to thank the success of Deadpool, which led to the studio giving James Mangold the chance to do an untamed version of this character, Mangold in full control of the reins mirroring Logan fulfilling his brutal potential.The difference in quality between The Wolverine, which Mangold also directed, and Logan is quite staggering really and you can certainly tell Mangold was in full control of the story this time round. The former descended into a typically over-the-top CGI-fest of a finale whereas Logan takes its time to build a study of this beaten down hero before climaxing with a heartfelt and personal finale that makes it much more of an involving film for the audience. The theme of parenthood has been explored a little with this character before, his relationship with Rogue in the first two X-Men films however, none of them have been quite like this, Mangold's homage to the old school Westerns playing out fascinatingly well as Logan plays out. The real dirt and grit of a Western etched with Logan's past is felt through John Mathieson's quite wonderful cinematography while the adventure of it all is encapsulated in Marco Beltrami's score.Coming to the performances, Logan features the best turn from Hugh Jackman in the role to date, and you can tell with his performance and promotion of the film that this is something he's always wanted to do with the character. Jackman's dedication to the role is admirable and I don't think he's ever done a bad job in any of the films, it's just that when a performance like this comes along in a film of this quality, it's hard not to put it above the rest. Patrick Stewart returns as Professor X, himself not in the best of places, and it's a very good and touching performance from a man who's also done a lot in making the X-Men films what they are. I found I had to get used to the pair of them swearing so much but when I did, the two are really quite funny, particularly together.The breakout performance from Dafne Keen as Laura/X-23 is one of the most impressive ones we will see all year, offering an innocent yet vicious portrayal of such a powerful little girl. She speaks very few words, using her facial expressions more to convey her emotions and she rather impressively gives Jackman a run for his money when it comes to the action sequences. The rest of the supporting cast, most notably Boyd Holbrook as Donald Pierce and Stephen Merchant as Caliban, make the most of their screen time, even if Holbrook does fall foul to the comic-book movie villain curse. This is Jackman's film though so focusing more on his last outing was always going to happen.Logan certainly does justice to both the character and Hugh Jackman himself with a film that steps away from the superhero norm and offers a personal and emotionally fuelled outing that certainly brings the violence and delivers one of the best comic-book films I've seen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Don't leave the kids behind,"As much as I enjoyed the film, there's no denying that the mutant kids were a letdown. They were nothing special and were portrayed too simplistically and blandly, especially considering they were in the final scenes of the film. If the kids had been developed more, the ending would have been better. The boring kids also expose the second weakness of the film, which is the villains. Mercenaries, an evil doctor? People who just chase and end up in simple deaths. The action scenes between Logan and Laura have a lot of potential to be better. Making Laura gentle as quickly as possible at the end is also not convincing, even though the director's purpose was to try to make Laura win the sympathy of the audience of fathers and mothers. This makes her mysteriousness disappear unfortunately. But aside from that, the film succeeds in bringing to the screen an aging but painful Logan, Professor X and Caliban are also attractive. The music is also good. And the production design and cinematography are great and I really enjoyed it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Hugh Jackman's Wolverine:The Final Chapter,"As you most of you know,this is the last film in which we expect to see Hugh Jackman as the Wolverine,who has become an icon for many people.Joined by Patrick Stewart they are reunited once again in a film with a tremendous impact on all people have followed the course of Wolverine all those years and to those who see it for the first time.So lets take a look where the events occur.It is 2029.All the mutants are gone.The last survivors of the mutant kind are Wolverine,Professor X and Calliban.However,none of them is the same person who once was(well except for Caliban maybe i am not sure).Logan's powers have been greatly diminished.He is old,grumpy,scarred and his temper is bigger than ever.His healing ability isn't as strong as it used to be and the proof is the scars all over his body.Charles Xavier(prof X) has Alzheimer and he is having mind crises.Logan tries his best to take care of Charles,but he is caught up in a chain of events that include a young mutant named Laura(Daphne Keen) and some bad guys chasing after her.Most of or all the fans of wolverine wanted an R-rated movie.This movie certainly lives up to their expectations,as the violence here is way beyond anyone would think for the x-men series or any other superhero movie.The fights here are brutal,savage,bloody with gruesome images that will shake you from your seat.Wolverine here literally goes berserk.He is finally releasing the beast that has long buried as he slashes,maims,decapitates his enemies.But the credits for that cannot only go to Logan,because he has lots of help from Laura.However,this film adds most of its strength from the character development and the acting.Wolverine is not only physically,but emotionally devastated.A mere reflection of his past self.An old relic.He has almost lost the will to live and you will see in the movie how far he went on this matter.But,as the movie progresses he discovers a new purpose that gives him enough will to carry on.Charles has become miserable and sad because of something terrible he did in the past.In spite of that,with the founding of Laura we see a resemblance of our old,caring professor as he tries to take care of her like he did with his former students and teach Logan the meaning of life.As for Laura,in the beginning she is insecure and quite bitter.Later though, she begins to trust and like more both Charles and Logan.Hugh Jackman gives the best performance as the Wolverine and he doesn't have to anchor this movie by himself this time.Credits must be given to Patrick Stewart who delivers an enjoyable yet emotional performance.The standout of this movie though, is Daphne Keen who despite her young age is able to stand here ground to the A-list actors mentioned.Thanks to their performances,they ""force"" you to root and care for their characters.When they are wounded,you hurt.When they are happy,you feel relieved and happy as well.You develop an emotional tether with them during movie that doesn't break even after the end.Although,what kind of superhero would Logan be if it didn't have a villain?This movie's main villain is Donald Pierce(Boyd Holbrook).This isn't the kind of villain that tries to scare you.He just messes around with you but he will become lethal when needed.He is a suitable villain for this movie.But,he isn't the only threat that our characters have to face,as more challenges stand in their way:inner struggles and more foes to fight.I highly recommend this movie for all those reasons mentioned because it distinguishes itself from the usual superhero movies.Notably,i was so touched by this movie,that it brought tears to my eyes.I have watched all the x-men films and i liked most of them but none of them managed to reach this movie's level of emotion or action.This was meant to be Hugh Jackman's final chapter as the Wolverine.If it is,please let it be the final and don't replace him because there won't be another actor that can replace Hugh Jackman's Wolverine in people's hearts.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
There's a good movie in here somewhere...,"Outside of Joker, I don't think I've ever seen a comic book film so obviously desperate to be taken seriously as cinema as Logan. It ends up caught between genres, though, instead of weaving them together. The serious character study is largely there, though it feels a bit shortchanged, and the exciting superhero adventure ends up playing catchup unconvincingly for long stretches. The clash undermines the whole experience taking what should have been a rather easy layup of a film into something a bit less.It's 2029 and something's happened to the mutant world. No mutant has been born in twenty-five years, Wolverine/Logan is a combination of indestructible and sickly, and Charles Xavier is acting erratic in an isolated location south of the American border with Wolverine and another mutant named Caliban guarding him. Logan is working as a driver, trying to save up enough money for a yacht that he can take Charles on and safely live away from the world, protecting the rest from the deteriorating state of Charles' mind that turns his ability to freeze people around him into a painful, deadly experience. Into his world comes a Mexican woman, desperate for his help which he brushes off as not his problem. Immediately afterwards, he's visited by an obvious bad guy, Donald Pierce, with a metal arm, a Texas accent, and a series of questions about the woman.The woman, Gabriella, worked at a genetics lab in Mexico City where scientists, led by Dr. Zander Rice, were experimenting with children mutants grown in the lab. She, along with some others, broke the children out when Rice decided to liquidate the children, and she has Laura, a mute girl, along for the ride. When Gabriella shows up dead at her hotel after calling Logan there, Pierce shows up to Logan's remote getaway where Laura has snuck to in Logan's trunk, and we see the first of the curious decisions by characters that undermine the action of the film. Laura knocks Pierce out with a pipe, and Logan gives the sickly, sun averse Caliban the task of taking the mechanical armed paramilitary soldier out into the middle of nowhere to dispose of, almost like they think he's dead. Because they don't ensure that he's dead or give the disposal to Logan or even just tie him up at the hideout, he gets a chance to connect with his team who are driving towards the hideout and lead the attack while capturing Caliban, who was the ability to track mutants (convenient). All of that is predicated on Logan actively giving bad instruction that goes against what he would probably do, especially after we've seen him kill several people in the opening sequence out of self-preservation. I don't see anything there that would tell me that Logan would be genial in that sequence as opposed to the opening. It's weird.Xavier, Logan, and Laura get away in a solid scene that shows Logan completely trashing his limousine to get away, barely escaping by outrunning a train (which is whatever, but enough to sell the idea of them getting away), and head straight to Oklahoma City to rest for a short while before heading out again. They have to wait until Logan can get a new car considering the state of the limousine, and when they wait for just the few hours, Pierce and his Reevers show up, triggering a Xavier event that nearly kills everyone in the hotel before Logan can get to Xavier and give him his medicine. The Oklahoma City sequence feels like this movie where everything gels best. There are moments where characters are allowed to breath, like Xavier and Laura watching Shane in their hotel room. Logan figures out that the location Gabriella wanted Logan to take Laura to was taken from an X-Men comic book (which were taken and expanded from ""real"" adventures Logan took part in), and he begins to question everything about his mission. The Reevers show up unexpectedly (because they have Caliban) and know exactly where Xavier is, getting to his hotel room while Logan is out, and Logan has to fight the psychic damage in order to exact terrible vengeance on the Reevers in the room. This is the combination of narrative styles that works best in the film.The rest of the movie is built on bad decisions and coincidences that undermine everything else. The three get away, and on the interstate they almost get run over by an automated eighteen wheeler along with a small farming family pulling some horses. Xavier, after having just barely escaped with his life because the Reevers found them without explanation (which should have been easy enough to figure out considering Caliban), decides that what they need is to spend the night with this innocent family so that Logan can get a feeling of home. And Logan goes along with it. I mean...what? The violence that inevitably gets visited upon this nice family is because of a pair of incredibly stupid decisions, but it's all at the behest of the movie trying to pursue its thematic goal.At the heart of it all is that Laura is actually Logan's daughter through surrogacy and gene manipulation on the part of the scientists. Logan needs family and meaning in a world where he's lost everything, and Xavier, knowing that he himself is dying and will leave Logan alone soon, understands that Logan needs someone to live for, and here comes this girl who is his biological daughter. The evening, with a nice conversation around the dinner table, is supposed to be that view into the world he could have. It's a nice idea, I just wish it was better placed in the film. There's no way these characters should be relaxing at this point. They should be running like they're being pursued by a paramilitary organization with a mutant sniffing mutant hot on their tails.Everything goes wrong, including Logan getting himself involved in a water dispute with the farmer's neighbor (where, honestly, the farmer is in the wrong), when, surprise, the Reevers find them. They send in Weapon 24, a clone of Logan that's much younger and much more ferocious. The fight is brutal, though it ends with Logan and Laura being the only two left standing at all, and Logan doesn't finish off Weapon 24, assuming that he won't survive a wound that looks grievous but considering Logan's own history of survival would indicate that Weapon 24 will probably be okay with some time. Which, of course, he is.See, here's the core of my issue: James Mangold obviously was far more interested in making the character-based story. That's where all the love went. Almost none of the action is really all that necessary to tell the story of Logan facing his mortality while learning the value of connecting with his daughter at the same time. It's necessary for some mechanical elements around it (including the death of a prominent character that I feel falls a bit flat because it relies too much on the previous films for the emotional involvement from the audience instead of building the movie up itself). Instead, it feels like the central idea of Logan's emotional journey was built and then the plot of the impending paramilitary organization was stitched on late without a good amount of time to smooth out the wrinkles.I can imagine a version of this movie where the paramilitary threat is gone after Oklahoma City, and we just get a focused tale of three people on the run, looking over their shoulders, and finding those small moments on the run to bond, ending at Eden and Logan quietly dying. That wouldn't be the sort of action spectacle audiences would expect from the first R-Rated Wolverine movie, but it might have been more appropriate to the actual story being told. The only reason that the final action scene happens at all is because an intricate series of coordinates was written out on two separate pieces of paper (an envelope filled with cash for Logan's services, and the back of a photograph of the children in the lab that we don't discover until its in the hands of the bad guy) and the bad guy got it in time. The only reason the bad guys keep up is because the good guys let them, essentially.I'm very much of two minds on this. The action is largely good. The character stuff is largely good. However, they are horribly sewn together to the point that character actions to keep the plot mechanics moving forward veer between making no sense whatsoever and being just outright stupid. That it wants to be taken seriously makes this all the more frustrating because there is a very good movie hidden in here. It's just not this.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Near Perfect,"So many movies out there are trying to appease the adolescent masses that spend 99% of their income/allowance on entertainment. This is finally a mature comic book movie with sophistication and originality. I'm 48 years old so the wolverine comics came out just after I graduated high school, I stopped reading them sometime after issue 50, got a job and a girlfriend I guess, but I never finished reading them, don't know if they continued after all these years but if they had a final issue to wrap things up This would be that story. It is near perfect, I would give it nine and a half out of ten, there are some slow spots, at times a bit too long of a slow spot but I've been fed a steady diet of quick flashes of explosions for the last thirty years.

"Not as good as the Dark Knight, but like that movie this one can appeal to more than just the core comic book audience.","""The world is not the same as it was."" In the future mutants are scarce and Logan (Jackman) is trying to hide from the world while caring for an ailing Professor X (Stewart). When someone finds him and asks for help he does his best to ignore them, but then he sees something that changes everything. Now Logan, Charles, and a girl are trying to find their way to Eden and finally find a peaceful life. This is one of the best comic book movies I have seen. The fact that this is R rated really helped the movie. The brutality and in-tenseness of the violence really helps you get fully invested in the film. My big hit against the Marvel/Avenger movies is that there is never any real drama and they are all cookie cutter and repetitive. The new X-Men series has continued the standard started by the Nolan Batman saga in that it is possible to make a comic book movie when the characters have real depth and emotion and a gripping adult story line. This movie contains all of that and more. You almost forget this is a superhero movie, and that is a good thing. The movie is brutal and very bloody, but again it really adds to the feel and the movie needs to show that Logan has changed. The previous stand alone Wolverine movies have not been good at all, but this one more than makes up for them. This is a movie I highly recommend whether you are a comic book movie fan or not. Overall, not as good as the Dark Knight, but like that movie this one can appeal to more than just the core comic book audience. I give this an A-.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

"Logan, best Wolverine movie as thus far.","I had to watch this movie three times over as for the first two attempts each time I fell asleep. Not out of boredom or so but just because I was just too tired. And I'm glad I took my time to watch it a third time as Logan is by far the best Wolverine movie made as thus far. Wolverine is one of the most appealing X-Men to watch as he's one of the more ""human"" ones and one we can relate most with. In Logan you get a more emotional story, with of course alot of action scenes. Those action scenes are worth the detour, especially the ones where Logan fights side by side with the young Dafne Keen. Good job from her as well as she has a major part in this movie, mostly silent but with the right facial expressions.

A Non-Fan Had A Good Time,"First off, let me say I am 76 and have never been a fan of ""comic-book"" super-hero movies, including Superman, Star-Trek, and the Marvel comics. (though I was and am a collector of the EC Horror comics from my youth). A younger friend of mine told me about ""Logan"" being quite good, and that it pays homage to ""Shane"", which newspaper reviews also noted. Well, it so happens I went to see Shane when I was 12, sixty-four years ago, and it was the first film that moved me to tears and showed me what a movie can be as a total experience. So after seeing how well received this film was, I was willing to see it, and I have to admit, despite the intermittent bone-crunching violence, which seemed over-the-top, the film held my interest, had some genuine heart, and was quite entertaining, and even enjoyable at times. Admittedly, for me, showing scenes of Shane was the highlight, along with the surprise dialog near the close. Thus, a 7, overall, which probably would be a 9 or 10 if I were a Wolverine Fan and in my 20s-40's. The only caveat for me is that the violence is so frequent and overdone that it actually seems counterproductive, as it is so extreme, it would only take one hit to knock out or kill an opponent, even a ""mutant"". Oh well. Enjoy!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
This will be a movie that you'll want to watch way more than just once,"Honestly speaking, at first I didn't even want to watch this movie when it came out as I need a very lengthy and expensive process in order to watch a movie in cinemas in the country I live in, so I was saving all I had for movies like fate of the furious and so on. But when I saw just how everyone was so positive about this movie, that was when I decided to know what the fuss was about. And that was the best decision that I ever did in my life. This movies really hits you hard. And at the end of it all, you'll feel very sad not just because of the ending but because it was over. Because I personally wanted this movie to never end. Hugh Jackman gives the best performance of his career. And so does Patrick Stewart. But to me, I think the star of this all was Dafne Keen. They really have found the perfect girl to do that role, anyone else in her place wouldn't have even gotten close. There's just something about her look and the way she does things that truly makes me admire the movie more and more. I hope they stick with her in the future and we see more of Lauren. Because I think a lot of people will truly want to see more of her. She is the right character to get behind in the coming X Men movies if there is any. But overall, you will have missed on a lot of you don't check this movie. So just drop whatever is infront of you right now and watch it. It will be worth it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

A Farewell to Hugh Jackman,"Before we talk about Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, let's revisit the X-Men series
While movies like Spider Man, Captain America, and Iron Man were very popular among fans, the X-Men were quite underrated
I remember when X-Men first came out in 2000 and it was something out of this world especially being the first comic-based movie then a sequel came called X2 and that was even better than the first
After that was X-Men: Last Stand which was good but could have been better
X-Men Origins: Wolverine was very mediocre but watchable
Then came X-Men: First Class which was the prequel of the events of the first three movies and it was pretty good a different style
The Wolverine is a movie focused on the character, Logan, which follows the events of the first three movies and that was the Wolverine movie we all wanted but it didn't stop there
X-Men Days of the Future Past again centered on Wolverine as he must travel back in time to save the X-Men that was an amazing concept that was perfectly executed
Then Deadpool came as the first R-rated movie for Marvel and the highest grossing R-rated film Ryan Reynolds is the highlight of this movie and he is pretty funny
And there was X-Men: Apocalypse which was an okay movieNow we have Logan which is not only the best movie of the X-Men series but one of the best superhero movies ever made
Sadly this is where we say good bye to Hugh Jackman. There were many amazing characters in X-Men like Storm (Halle Berry), Cyclops (James Marsden), Magneto (Ian McKellen), Mystique (Rebecca Romijn), and Professor X (Patrick Stewart) which I enjoyed a lot but Wolverine is my favorite. Some of you guys may not realize this but he has been the main character for this series till now
Yes Logan is R-rated but that's thanks to Ryan Reynold's Deadpool which gives the Wolverine we always wanted
It is a lot of gory violence but this is very realistic depicting a world of mutants
Patrick Stewart reprises his role as Professor X and so does Stephen Merchant as Caliban unfortunately they are leaving as well
Boyd Hallbrook did justice to his character, Donald Pierce, as a ruthless mutant hunter along with Richard E. Grant as Dr. Rice
The supporting cast did an awesome job especially the mutant kids
Marco Beltrami's music really puts you to the edge of your seat as the suspense builds up
James Mangold really did a superb job in making an amazing superhero film like WolverineNow let's talk about Hugh Jackman's Wolverine. He is the best man for the job and now he has aged as Wolverine is now more than a couple centuries old
He is getting weaker but he has to save his kind from a powerful enemy
Hugh Jackman is going to be retiring from X-Men as now he is having health issues due to his age which is very sad
Hugh Jackman will always be my favorite Wolverine and one of my favorite superheros
He is indeed the man for the job and the best Wolverine
Now we have to say good bye to Logan as now after this movie there is going to be a major change in the X-Men Universe
Yes Deadpool 2 is coming soon but think about the X-Men without Logan
No one could have done Logan like how Hugh Jackman did and now it is sad to see him go
I will warn you that you might become emotional throughout this movieI am going to miss Hugh Jackman and of course Logan is going to be a future classic
A future cult classic
Now we have to say good bye to Logan and I wish the best to Hugh Jackman",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A fitting end to an OK spinoff series.,"I'm not sure I know what to think about this movie. I mean, I wanted to like it inasmuch as I like a lot of the action-filled superhero movies that preceded it. However, the plot felt like it had less to do with these fantastic mutant abilities and more about just living life as normal people. Don't get me wrong: there are plenty of mutant abilities on display in this film, it's just that they weren't necessarily the focus of it. In fact, if you took away the fact that this was based on comic book characters, you'd still have a film about a father trying to care for a daughter he never knew he had. Almost sounds cliche to me.Regarding the Wolverine spinoff series, Logan (2017), is a strong finish after the abysmal Wolverine: Origins (2009) and slightly improved The Wolverine (2013). I did appreciate the finality of it, especially considering the whole X-Men film series started seventeen years ago. Unfortunately, unlike Deadpool (2016), which thrives on the entertainment value of its title character, Logan left me confused with just how much abuse this character could take, especially since his regenerative powers weren't what they used to be.I know many people were thrilled that this film was able to have an ""R"" rating, but I honestly don't see what's so special about it. I mean, we have had V for Vendetta (2005) and Watchmen (2009) before it, and even the aforementioned Deadpool fully used its ""R"" rating. Sure, it was fun to finally see the eponymous Logan essentially use his knives-for-hands to eviscerate the enemy in its bloody and gory glory, but I think my imagination could do that in the earlier, PG-13 versions without much of a jump. And it's not like Logan wasn't allowed to use strong language in previous films, it's just that he was able to use a lot more of it in this one.A fitting end to an OK spinoff series, I give Logan 3.5 stars out of 5.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

The Vidiot Reviews...,"LoganYou can tell a superhero is getting old when villains start using credit-card scams on them.Luckily, the aged protagonist in this action movie knows to keep his PIN protected.A weathered Wolverine/Logan (Hugh Jackman) struggles to survive in a mutant-less future where his healing factor is failing and his once powerful mentor (Patrick Stewart) suffers from Alzheimer's.Matters worsen when a young mutant (Dafne Keen) escapes from a laboratory and asks for his help in reaching a mutant safe haven up north. Accepting, however, puts the irritable immortal's life in danger for the first – and possibly last - time.Focusing more on the character than his infamous claws, this end chapter of the Jackman era may suffer from some lulls but is ultimately a fitting tribute to the troubled Canuck with strong performances, furious action and a moving script.Incidentally, elderly superheroes always keep some candy in their spandex.Green Light",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Logan goes Bogan,"This is without doubt, the saddest Marvel release EVER!!! Who ever wrote this should be taken out and shot at dawn and all the money they were paid should be put into a charity fund for the homeless(more to the point to fund poor writers who could have run rings around the untalented butt clowns that wrote this travesty of biblical proportions).The previous X-men films have all been top notch, high quality efforts that have not only been faithful to the comics that made them possible but have been well written with super acting and masterful story telling.This mess of a film has ruined so much of what I liked about the original X-Men films that this fan is not going to spend money going to see any more X-men films at the movies. I'm that upset about this rubbish.The most important thing about Super Hero style movies is that people like this fan, go to see HEROES WIN AND SAVE THE DAY. I'm sorry if a few unmentionables can't handle that or find the concept trite or boring etc, but the world needs Super heroes, not super loosers.The only saving grace of this film was the young troupe of new mutants(genetically engineered mutants). Sadly as I hope your getting the idea, the whole concept ruins the ideas that came before and more to the point Wolverine(I'm not going to call this character by the name that belongs to this terrible movie ever again), totally destroys the place of his origin. Zip, NADA, nothing left folks, so this whole story is a complete pile of badly written 'what if' at best.Don't let this be the first (and last) X-Men film you ever see. Skip this one and enjoy the glorious other movies that Marvel has put out. This movie was so bad, they didn't even have a snippet clip at the end of the movie(even Marvel must have realised it would be wasting it's time doing so with this one, because most of the people in the cinema I saw it in, walked out as soon as the credits started rolling and all I heard where numerous comments about how bad they found the movie).So no spoilers to give on this one fellow movie fans because the entire movie is a spoiler.

The Very Best,"Probably the best film of 2017!! Very violent but also touching! Hugh jackman at his best in playing an HUMAN weapon!! Stunning quotes and oscar-likely acting, also from Dafne Keen. The brutality her character has is out of space! Watch it!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
8.5/10,"Sad, brutal, powerful and most importantly freshly original, ""Logan"" is a great piece of cinema with performers committed to this material in a way we haven't quite seen before in the genre which pays off by touching emotional heights for which the audience might be as unprepared as much as they are touched by it.The balancing act that Mangold pulls off is a tricky one, but his mastery in molding the tones and hitting the emotional moments when they need to is remarkable, he takes full advantage on his medium and leaves us with frames and feelings stuck in our head for long after the film's departure. He has so much on his table to bring to life, there are multiple story lines and many moving pieces, but he makes all of it into a beautifully flowing piece where you never feel lost, everything here belongs to this film.The success of this emotional piece is strictly connected to how good the performances in it are. First off is Boyd Holdbrook who is a revelation, he has a natural talent for holding the screen and being magnetic and make the most out of it giving us a villainous role that is the perfect match for this feature. On top of that comes Dafne Keen who does stuff which I have never seen in a movie theater before, she is crazy good and possibly one of the best child performances I have ever seen. What she conveys with her eyes only is incredible and when she starts getting into the action they do stuff that I have honestly never seen before with a child.Of course this is the Jackman/Stewart show in the end and what a show, what a finale to give to these characters. There isn't merit to be awarded singularly here, as in all great movies, the quality of the emotions you are being carried through starts with a truly great script that offers the actors A+ level material to work with. They rise to the challenge, making the most out of every word, every stare and in comes Mangold and his delicate touch in capturing all of these moments. This film is really sad, it brings to life emotions and characters in a way that hits the audience deeply, the themes of bitterness, rejection, heartbreak, love, life, purpose, discrimination, hope, it brings tears to my eyes just recalling the outlook the films takes and it is a icon of how cinema can convey theme through story no matter its nature.The struggles the characters go through in this film feel so raw and close to us. Professor Xavier is given what is possibly his best portrayal and arch yet, he his in a sad, sad place, his life feels so tragic to us, his dreams have vanished, the way Stewart portrays him takes us to a place of such humanity, looking at an old man, a great man who is at the end of line, disillusioned and lost, mad, but still hoping. It is a beautiful piece of character drama that is developed throughout the film with pitch perfect dramatization and, curiously enough, the perfect amount out comic relief. As much as this film is emotional and sad it has moments of comedy gold that fit in seamlessly as they have always been part of these characters. Stewart has moments of ""Cukoo's Nest"" madness that bring out really funny monologues, plus his timing on one liners is perfect and even the way he moves makes for great comedy. And of course we don't loose Wolverine's dry humor which has always been a great part of his character.And we haven't touch upon the action yet. This movie is violent and brutal and awesome because of that. Every drop of blood, every hit, every scar is justified by story. there isn't a moment of wasted time in the action, it feels urgent and necessary, the set-pieces flow in naturally and frenetically, they enter the story at the right times, they build and end when they need to and when it is time to start a new one is always feels built up and climaxes to new heights which are topped with the final confrontation which is a blood bath of violence and savageness that has me white knuckled, you almost feel there, with the characters, in the middle of this insane struggle. You feel every it, the pain in every cut has a weight and Logan's incredible effort and stress to go on it conveyed brutally in a way that you almost feel it upon yourself.I think that there are only a few criticism that I could move towards the film which are plot points that are repeated throughout which don't really belong in the film. They insist on an X-Men comic point which has nothing to do with the film and raises questions all around which don't really need to be there and could have easily been solved with another macguffin. These sort of nitpicks and continuity issues are the only ones that really have any place in being pointed out.Everything else in ""Logan"" works, this is a devastating film, with many tears involved, it will stick with you and leave you with images and feelings stuck in you mind, that is the mark of great, great film, one that molds tones and stories into one beautiful piece of genre cinema that will certainly have a lasting effect through its legacy, every single risk taken in here paid off to perfection.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

One of the better X-men movies out there but...,"I stopped watching this movie about half way through. I had seen most of the Marvel movies out there and thought I knew what I was getting into with Logan.My first half run through I was shocked by the level of gore and it just kept coming. I am not a big fan of gore but am ok watching it if it has it's place and doesn't make me gag. I just wasn't ready for the new version of Wolverine, face slicing death machine. Then there was the story line - I won't spoil anything but I found about half way through I was just overcome with kind of a sadness (because of some serious violence towards kids) and it was depressing so I turned the movie off, I wanted more of a fun good guys vs bad guys, explosions, sprinkle in a car chase, good guy wins - you know... every other Marvel movie out there.After having some time to digest what I saw I went back to it more prepared than I was before. The fight scenes are amazing, the story line is fantastic. This is a stand alone superhero movie.I would have rated it higher but ever since I became a dad I can't stand seeing violence against kids, even if it is pretend.

I could feel and relate to their frustration and anger of a world they don't belong to. At the end of the movie the war, the pain and the anger drained away in one bright flash!

No Pun Intended,"There seems to be permeating trends for comic books coming from ink and word-bubbles to being thrown up on the big screen. One of which, is to add a darker theme to an adapted, comic film. The Batman appeared more cynical than usual in his last flick, and the comic book company, Marvel, recently release Deadpool, the film about a foul-mouthed ninja slicing through hordes of bad guys to meet the end. The film itself was the first R-rated comic book film -- the 2nd R-rated comic book film being Logan.Before viewing the film in theaters the other night, my only understanding about the movie is what I saw from 2 different trailers. I felt the same impression from the both of them: the main character is older, worn, and beaten, there is a young girl with physical abilities similar to him, and his mentor is even older, more worn, and more beaten. Furthermore, it appears the 3 of them are traveling somewhere for some reason. The whole thing was ambiguous for me.So, there I was -- sitting there not knowing what to expect. The intro scene immediately caught me off guard in a way that said, ""Tighten the harness"". The first act took configuration to see the inherent story for why these characters are in the position that they are in. Not long into the film, the main theme of the movie was established and continued to pull me through the story-line. The acting was remarkable, and facilitated my journey with these characters. It was as if I was with them traveling to our destination in hopes of finding what was needed. I coveted more angles for fear of not seeing what was around the characters: danger or a shred of help.As this movie is a 3rd installment, I expected to see familiar ground from its predecessors. Certain actions the characters make and the outcomes could have been originated from scratch rather than refreshing an old scene. At the same time, they were parts that seem natural in the real world – so it's hard to see them happen any other way. Next to that, the theme about a few people traveling great distances with pending death chasing them day and night, and no outside help has been an occurring one throughout media. Logan is a great example of a collaboration of artists using ideas from other artists, incorporating in their style, and coming up with something fresh and innovating. Again, you might see unoriginal moments, but sometimes the old is required to provide the new. The action scenes make no surprise for why is has an R-rating, and the profound story-line will grab your attention, intrigue you, and then pull you to the end-credits of Logan.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Good acting and potential that is wasted,"I wanted to like this movie but the longer it went, the more I disliked it. I can only think how much better this movie would have been if Marvel had made it and done the story right. The good is that the acting is very good and Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart deliver great performances as you would expect from them. Stephen Merchant was great as Caliban. Dafne Keen was the true find as she did an outstanding job as Laura (X-23). Not speaking for most of the film means she had to rely on facial expression and looks and she did them with a lot of skill. Whether it was her or just great direction, the point is that she executes her role wonderfully. She has very expressive eyes and at times reminded me of a very young Sandra Bullock. I hope she has a long career.The bad is the typical problem when Marvel isn't making the movie. Apparently the desire is to make superhero movies where the superheros detest their powers and stay far away from lame things like costumes (ie what fan like). So of course there are no costumes in this and there is a lot of complaining about having fantastic powers and everyone seems to determined use kung fu rather than actually use those powers.At several points, it seemed that someone in Hollywood got an idea and insisted that it be included (hey let's involve border crossings, hey we need to say something about big corporations, hey let's complain about self-driving cars, etc. etc.) which all just muddle the story and add nothing in my opinion.Although his acting was as good as always, I found Prof. X a distraction in the movie and was disappointed with his storyline. Others may disagree.This movie is rated R. There are some bloody scenes but there are a lot of F-Bombs. Despite the rating, we had a 9 year old Wolverine fan sitting behind us constantly asking his parent what this or that means. With Wolverine being such a child-friendly character in comics and cartoons, making an R rated version was a pretty bad idea since a lot of kids are going to want to see it and give their parents plenty to have to explain. Deadpool could do it since Deadpool is not that common with kids. In fact, the best part of the movie was the preview (kind of preview) for the upcoming Deadpool sequel.This was the 3rd movie I have seen recently in the theaters where the audience was disruptive. Talking, cell phones, etc. (one guy even taking a phone call during the film!) made it a bad experience. I love seeing movies in a theater but if people cannot learn that when in a theater they are NOT in their own den watching Netflix, I will have to seriously rethink it. Ticket prices keep going up and up and highly disruptive customers (forget poor films) make a good explanation for why people are staying away from theaters.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Graeat screenplay excellent performances,"As a comic book reader, I've seen a lot of misleading plot points when screenplays try to merge a lot of material into one original motion picture. Sometimes it's because they down own the full characters rights to make the full adaptation of the original but sometimes its lazy screenwriting in my opinion.In Logan I was very pleased to see a great comic to film merge of a lot of source material without compromising the full marvel (x men) franchise in the meantime. It's done in such a superb matter that you almost don't get the full attention caught with the R rated scenes as they serve a purpose for the story. True to be told, Wolverine is one of the most lethal characters in comic book media that's ussually reprised as a good guy as he should be depicted more as an antihero.Great work for an already intense actor before he was really too old for a character that's supposed to not age at all.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A tour de force of acting with a great story to boot,"This one is a 9.5 or a 9.8 rather than 9, but let's not split any hairs on trivial details. It's one of the best sci-fi/action/comics, I've seen in a very long while. I've said more than once that the X Men have the best characters written down in comics history. They also have some of the best story lines, even though this one is not part of their long illustrious mythology, it's still rings true to their comic based characters, and since the comics itself had already presented us with so many alternate realities, none can complain if it doesn't follow a precise story from the comic books.Hugh Jackman, presents what I consider to be his best movie performance, Patrick Stewart is coming close to his very best, (I simply didn't see enough of his movies to pass a definite judgment). Dafne Keen shows great promise, as the young wild, and sensitive X23. The rest of the cast are faultless to the very last minute role. And the story flows naturally from the very start, it's as if it simply writes itself, and as far as I'm concerned it's one of the best complements one can give a story or a script. A real masterpiece and a great signoff for a wonderful character. All fans of the X Men, and of Wolverin especially, this one is a real must see.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

a punch to the gut,"I already knew what most people would consider a big spoiler and had fair expectations, some kind of grumpy kind-hearted old Wolverine with a Last-of-Us-ish plot and setting, ok. Instead what I got was a ruthless punch to the gut.I don´t really care much for the plot, which might deserve a lower rating, what I find compelling is how it beams emotion with an unprecedented power for a superhero movie. The setting is an extremely cold, cruel and hopeless future (seriously, way too much for my taste) but I guess this extreme setting is needed since the man isn´t ordinary. The man has a regenerative power and has lived countless years, what would it take to make him tired, seriously tired and old? That is why this film is a triumph: the entire run time conveys how the world just passes us by, our body simply gives up the fight and even the toughest one perishes at some point, craving for eternal rest. The world goes on, for better or worse, but who cares? It might be exhausting but it certainly got my attention.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Wolverine Unleashed,"Wolverine is finally done right, showing the true berserker slashing through the enemy. The film has a western vibe throughout which is very impressive. X-23 was great for a young actress with not many acting credits, the bloody sequences in the movie really bring us (the fans) what we've wanted to see for years a true take on what Wolverine is thanks to Mangold.

I can't believe how bad was the movie,"I'm so sorry that I went to see this movie, I liked the other x-men movies , but this one was absolutely awful. Who wrote this script was absolutely crazy. The script makes no sense. How the hell all the mutants were extincted? And how so, just 3 mutants were left (professor , wolverine and the fuk white face) There's no explanation about how it's possible that wolverine to be poisoned by the Adamantium.

A flat out Masterpiece,"So i really had no intention to see this movie cause i didn't really think the X-men movies were all that great, but my roommate rented this and he asked if i wanted to watch it. So i thought i would give it a watch and oh my god, this movie is incredible.Logan is the story of an old and tired wolverine that is done with everything. He is sick and on the verge of dying because the thing that makes him wolverine is now poisoning him. He wants to go away and live a peaceful life with Professor X, but once he meets this girl that has a few people hunting her down, Logan and the Professor are thrown back into the midst and have to protect this girl as well as themselves.First the obvious, Hugh Jackman plays Logan and i honestly think he deserves an Oscar for his performance. He does a spectacular job at playing a man that is just wants to give up on everything. The action sequences are well done and greatly engaging. There is also a tragic and sad moral to this movie, about how we all get old and die. This is probably my favorite movie ever made.If i was going to point out one flaw in this movie its that the movie at times slows down, but fortunately that happens to give some character development and it makes the upcoming action much more satisfying.So in the end, Logan was a masterpiece and it truly floored me. Every character is engaging especially Logan and the little girl. The soundtrack, the action, and the story is just amazing and very well done. I could not be happier with this movie and i really mean it when i say it is my favorite movie of all time. A+ or 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Wolverine's story comes to a close in this dark, gritty masterpiece.","Welp, this is it, ladies and gentlemen. Wolverine's story has come to an end. Last time Hugh Jackman plays Wolverine ever in a movie. This is the masterpiece he decided to go out on.James Mangold's direction was fantastic in this, really like his style and that he decided to do this less light and more gritty than 2013's okay-ish The Wolverine. This is a great move because this is what Wolverine deserves. A gritty, dirty, R-rated movie. And Jackman took a pay cut to ensure this was R-rated.And hoo boy, does Mangold and Jackman use this to good effect. This film is extremely brutally violent. BUT THIS IS WHAT WE NEEDED FROM A WOLVERINE MOVIE!!! Bloodless carnage in the X-Men films was simply just not acceptable now that Logan is out.The acting is phenomenal. From Hugh Jackman's grumpy, old, weak, down-on-his-luck Logan, to Patrick Stewart's old, crusty, senile Professor X, to the insane, crazy debut performance by Dafne Keen. All played masterfully.The action is awesome, still has that Wolverine edge to it. Just with more blood. The action is spread out throughout the film, so obviously as to not miss out on any plot details.The ending is something to remember for a long time. (I won't spoil it)THE VERDICT: If you are a fan of X-Men or the Old Man Logan comic books, or just a fan of R-rated comic book movies in general, see it. You'll be glad you did.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A must watch for Hugh Jackman and the plot.,"Set in the future and no proper time explained (Might be 2029) Logan is one of the bests of the franchise. Who knows this movie might change the future of the superhero movies as well. Logan unlike other super hero movies is emotional, moving and plot centric.From scene one the movie takes the audience in and one might want to watch it without interruption. The aging of the Logan and the emotional bond between the lead characters are surprising and moving as well. Laura's character was a great add and one would fall in love with her. The film gave us a different, but great super hero movie experience.The aging of Logan was evident from scene one. When he struggles to get rid of the thieves who are after his car, Logan indicates that we are to watch a different Wolverine. His life moves on with tired days and Charles by his company (Off course Alcohol). Though he is old, his action scenes are brutal as ever (Age <18 better stay away), Laura adds more cruelty to it.As mentioned Laura is a great add to the finale. Her character is the core of the plot and sheds surprises at times. Charles being in the back seat sends emotional shivers throughout and advises Logan as usual.Cast performance: Hugh Jackman is aware that this is his last outing as Logan and has ruled the screen. He excels in action scenes and equally in the emotional scenes. His expressions are standalone. This movie will go as one of his bests in his career.Dafne Keen as Laura Kinney is my favorite in the movie. She is a great find for the Hollywood industry. With her fast movements in the action scenes and exceptional acting she is going to give a tough competition for the actors/actresses of her age.Patrick Stewart as Charles has done what is needed for his character and he does it with perfection. Richard as the antagonist is terrifying. His acting might go behind Logan still he manages to threaten as the villain.Direction: This is James Mangold's second directorial in the Wolverine franchise. He didn't bother to put his protagonist as a week and emotional superhero; he has succeeded in doing so. His love for westerns has given a different shade to Logan which is great to watch as well. His direction gets life with John Mathieson's camera and Marco Beltrami's music.On the whole Logan is a different superhero movie and a must watch for Hollywood lovers (No need to be a superhero lover).",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Depressing,"This was a grind to get through, just a sad story about the end of some great characters lives. Logan is living in a hideout near the U.S Mexico border caring for the ailing professor X and working as a chauffeur. He is angry, mean, exhausted, addicted to pills and alcohol, his body is failing and he's just fed up with the world. Patrick Stewart as X is now a bumbling useless old man, on drugs to control his ""spells."" Their sheltered existence comes to an end when a young mutant girl arrives and needs their help to stay safe -she is very good as a sort of young, feral version of wolverine.Anyways trudging through, this ends in a road trip into Mexico, lots of violence, Logan F bombs and is super grumpy. More mutant kids show up, kinda like Mad Max, there is no humour or even a glimpse of hope. I can't understand why this particular story ever came to film or why the high ratings?

Disney take notes.,"This is one of the best (if not the best) comic-book movies I have ever seen. It was so nice to go see a movie with one of the comic-book characters you grew up with, and not being treated as part of a demographic plan to sell tickets, toys and merchandise.This felt like an actual movie - with heart, soul and and a story to tell. And not like a machine-made formulaic and predictable 2-hour toy commercial, full of political correct cast characters, pointless forced jokes and waves of product placement. Like all of your other Iron Man and friends movies.The movie had action scenes when it needed to, to further the plot. And not to make you feel like your being treated as an ADHD-case by throwing something loud and shiny at you every 20 minutes.And the action in Logan is great. It's like you're there, and feeling every punch, slash, stab and shot, along with the characters. It is very grounded, gritty, intense and easy to follow. And never scaled too big or over the top. This isn't collapsing skyscrapers with tons of flying robots, monsters, laser cannons, explosions, and people surviving the most ridiculous situations. While some blue beam shoots up in the sky, so our so called heroes can save the planet the 100th time.This is just characters you care for (even the villains), fighting for themselves, each other and their humanity. Often in a very brutal way, but the brutality just makes the action more involving. The action isn't explicit in a gory way - like it's just trying to shock you or to be edgy, but it just pulls you more in. Actually I think a lot of PG-13 movies, could make their action scenes work this great too, without toning up the blood and violence, if they just toned down all the CGI and made the action more accessible and believable. It really isn't about the R-rating, as much as it is about involving you as a moviegoer. Instead of distancing you with CGI and unbelievable over the top shiny scenarios.Personally I'm under the impression that people have had enough of the Disney Marvel movies, and all their imitators. Enough of expanded movie universes (that actually feels more like a commercials for another movie within the movie, more than it feels like it's expanding anything). And enough of movies about super heroes that all feel and look the same with their political correctness, CGI, demographic planning, predictable jokes and formulaic plots.Most people just want a good movie with atmosphere, drama, and scenes where you actually can tell what's going on.Hopefully this movie will help start up a new trend, and become a genre- defining piece, so Fox once again can be the innovators of something new, like when they first started the genre with the first X-men movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Logan is what Marvel isn't and what DC wants to be,"Drama. Western. Road movie. Logan is far more than just another superhero film, grounding the genre to satisfy a wider audience but not losing the charm and fun that's made it such a success. Learning from the mistakes of DC, Logan creates a dark and cruel world without sacrificing colour or a sense of humour.Closing the door on his definitive role, Hugh Jackman is finally allowed to unleash the ferocity and bloody carnage of the character trapped for so long by the blockbuster intention of the franchise. With Deadpool proving the box office potential of R rated superhero flicks, Logan goes full throttle with some of the most brutal violence you will see in a mainstream picture; blood soaked and torn limb from limb, the body count rises steadily throughout and finally allow us to see the obvious results of a manimal with 3 unbreakable claws. Director James Mangold brought a sophistication to The Wolverine that was shackled by the expectations of a family audience but here he creates a perfect portrayal of the X-Men character in a barren, hopeless future. Logan rises above a lot of its competition as it's a character piece first and an action film second, using the brilliant fight sequences to compliment the splintered psyche of an older, broken Logan.Wolverine has worked in the past as a father figure to the likes of Rogue but here it is most apparent in the form of Laura, a young mutant who drives the plot and proves to be just as savage and thrilling as Logan when it comes to taking out the enemy, as lacklustre as they may be. Jackman continues to be perfect as the titular mutant but the standout performance belongs undoubtedly to Sir Patrick Stewart as a very different Charles Xavier from the wise mentor we know; elderly and cranky, Xavier is both an object of pity and admiration as a source of both tragedy and comedic relief from the consistently angst ridden Logan. In terms of world building, Logan depicts a dark conclusion for the X-Men universe that is tragic but realistic; adding a layer of grittiness that sets it apart from the idealism of Marvel and the grime of DC.Logan is a fanboy dream come true, sending off Hugh Jackman in a blaze of blood and guts while further creating hope for the future of the stagnating superhero genre. It's gory, a tearjerker and, well, any film that gives Stephen Merchant an action movie one liner deserves at least some credit.SWEETVisit https://sweetorsaltedmoviereviews.com/ for more.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Logan - everything you want and more (and thank God it's rated R),"Few anticipated the mammoth success of Deadpool last year. With a fraction of the typical budget for superhero fare, an audience-prohibiting R-rating (presumably box-office poison), and the lack of a Summer release date, it had none of the hallmarks of reliably profitable cinema. And yet, Deadpool hit a nerve. Positive reviews, gargantuan box office takings, and the collective adoration of most who saw it. It seemed that people didn't want their violence sanitised, and their action films humourless - who'da thunk it?As with all unexpected hits, Hollywood learns from its mistakes and dutifully attempts to emulate the success of these breakout box office anomalies. After Star Wars destroyed the box office, countless ripoffs emerged, and similar things occurred after The Matrix, Jaws, Indiana Jones, American Pie, Paranormal Activity (blegh) and the list goes on. In the case of Deadpool this is a very good thing - Hollywood seems to be putting far more faith in producing big budget films with big R ratings.Logan is the first to follow Deadpool's wake, and like its predecessor, it wears its R rating like a badge of honour. The curiously bloodless stabbings of Wolverine in his previous PG 13 outings are out - now we are treated to spectacularly gory Adamantium-fuelled fight scenes that are utterly thrilling and cathartic. Importantly, the violence isn't just cheap thrills - it actually serves to contribute a real sense of stakes to the plot, making you really feel and understand the mortality of these mutants, that violence is ugly, brutal and most importantly painful. We are also treated to profanity, which once again is not exploited, merely a reflection of Logan's age and weariness, as he approaches the latter stages of life. Aside from some uncharacteristic swearing from Professor Xavier (which felt gratuitous) and a scene with totally arbitrary bare breasts, Logan's R rating is effectively utilised for the service of its story, which is far darker, meaner and more mature than other X Men related films.An aspect that really worked well was the inclusion of Laura, a girl with formidable powers that prompts Logan to seek heroic redemption and rediscover his sense of purpose (albeit rockily.) Steely, tough and mostly mute, Laura is the antithesis of a cute movie kid - she takes no prisoners, and leaves no throat unstabbed, a terrifically entertaining character. As such, her uneasy union with Logan is believable and unexpectedly emotional, grounding the film in pathos usually absent from superhero movies. Also adding emotional resonance is Patrick Stewart, in fine, gracious and ever so fragile form as Charles Xavier, who is reduced to a consuming neurological disease stemming from his telekinesis - he has easy chemistry with Jackman, complemented by the years of baggage contributed by almost 2 decades of X Men films. Finally to Hugh Jackman himself - he is a stellar vessel, playing Logan as he has never done before, with vulnerability, brusqueness and a surly resolve, he carries the movie amply with a layered, sophisticated performance that is worthy of end of year awards consideration (unlikely as that may be.)In the first act villainous characters are effective, because they appear only as hired guns led by a menacing Boyd Holbrook. This simplicity feels appropriate for James Mangold's pared back, realistic vision of the X Men-populated world, a factor achieved through the grounded nature of characters, and very cleverly through the existence of X Men comics, almost implying that the films that preceded are an airbrushed, more idyllic, fictionalised version of the truth of the X Men. Critics have called the film like a Western, considering its setting, its brutality, and a particular scene that directly references Shane (1953). On these bases, the film proceeds with gusto, yet falters when far more melodramatic, far-reaching elements to the films antagonists are introduced. As followed through by a wasted Richard E Grant, the villains, and their back story, while interesting, feels incongruous with the gritty, realistic main narrative and its effectively more concentrated scope. It also adds more fat to the already bulging story, which feels bloated and not entirely coherent, at a slightly overlong 2 hrs 17 minutes.Furthermore, a sequence involving a family who invites Logan, Laura and Xavier to dinner after they assisted them on the highway, and its culmination was profoundly irritating - as a result of the morally iffy actions of Xavier in particular it is very difficult to sympathise with him immediately after, despite the fact that the film seems to want you to do so. Nonetheless, the film builds towards a satisfying climax that feels like a fitting end to Logan's journey, that is unless Jackman decides to return once more.In all James Mangold's film is bold, brash, gloriously mean and feverishly exciting ride that is certainly the most audacious and enjoyable superhero film I've seen in quite some time, perhaps since The Dark Knight or Watchmen, and few who see it will be disappointed. Logan delivers what you'd expect from a rollicking action flick starring Wolverine, but what you might not expect is an equally satisfying drama of characters and relationships, which explores age, regret, duty and redemption in powerful fashion.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

A True Masterpiece,"LOGAN is one of those films that, when it ends, you immediately want to watch it again.As far as X-Men films go, LOGAN is the most brutal, violent, and bloody (I do not count DEADPOOL as an X-Men film simply because it isn't at all essential to the X- Men/Wolverine films & it really is it's own thing), in a lot of ways it's the Wolverine film that people have always wanted. X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE was a let down to many (it's a good action flick but that's about it), while THE WOLVERINE was received much better (with the exception of the film's final act). LOGAN is truly the Wolverine film that everyone has been looking for and, in many respects, the Wolverine that Logan himself looks for throughout the film.Directed by James Mangold (3:10 TO YUMA, WALK THE LINE, THE WOLVERINE), LOGAN itself is a Western; technically a Modern Western, but a Western nevertheless. It's not just the western settings (Mexico, North Dakota, Nevada, etc.) that set LOGAN apart as a Western, but also the content of its characters. Logan was a hero, much like the Civil War heroes who come back home to find that they don't belong (I'm looking at you Uncle Ethan...), Logan was formerly one of the X-Men, superheroes that the world counted on and looked up to (depending on the X-Men film that is), as Wolverine. He's a classic example of ""don't meet your heroes"" as he's merely a shell of the man he once was. Sure, this isn't only a characteristic of the Western, but it is one of the common traits of Classic Westerns. The hero who has no place in society, yet fights, and even gives his life, to defend it. This is Logan.And let's not forget that the basic plot of the film is the group traveling from Mexico to, eventually, Canada to run from a group of Reavers after a young girl and her friends. Sounds very Western to me...Along with all that, the use of the film SHANE, a Classic Western from 1953, not only serves as a bridge for us to take a closer look into Charles Xavier, and the title character himself, but it also gives a clear picture as to what LOGAN is supposed to be. LOGAN shows Logan, Laura, and Xavier what it's like to have a family, much like SHANE does with it's title character. LOGAN creates a bond between the Western hero and the child he's sworn to protect, another clear characteristic of SHANE. And of course that ending scene, which I won't spoil one way or another.All this being said, LOGAN is not only very clearly a Modern Western, but also just a phenomenal display of the character of Wolverine in a way that none of the other X-films have been able to fully grasp (although some have come awfully close). When watching LOGAN, I immediately compared it to two of my all-time favorite films that often fight for their place as my fourth favorite on in my Top 10: THE DARK KNIGHT and TERMINATOR 2: JUDGEMENT DAY. It's not really the content of these films compared to LOGAN that stuck out to me, but instead the implications that come along with them. LOGAN is Marvel's THE DARK KNIGHT, it's the one big and important film that separates it from anything else the company has done before or will ever do again. LOGAN will become a standard for all X-Men, Wolverine, Marvel, superhero, and comic book movies out there, much like THE DARK KNIGHT is for DC, Batman, and the superhero/comic book genre now. Similarly, TERMINATOR 2 changed action and sci-fi films forever. In fact, outside of MAD MAX: FURY ROAD, I can't name a single action film that has had the impact on the genre and film industry as a whole in the same way TERMINATOR 2 has, until now.If LOGAN is Marvel's THE DARK KNIGHT, then it is also certainly the comic book genres TERMINATOR 2. Like the title of this review says, LOGAN is a masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Logan (2017),"The final Wolverine has come and gone and the review for this seemed to indicate that was one of the best superhero movies of all time. While I don't necessarily agree with this I think the film was an interesting approach to a fan favorite film hero and a balls out action heavy conclusion to the Hugh Jackman fronted Wolverine era in the X-Men franchise. It will please many people but I hope we have reached finality with the Wolverine character before Hollywood goes crazy for a reboot.This film follows Logan who is now older and weaker. The adamantium skeleton is slowly killing him and he lives in a dystopian future where no mutant has been born for 25 years. He meets a young girl who has the same powers as Logan and has been bred from DNA garnered from mutants. The first thing that must be said is that this is a very different and more somber approach to a popular superhero. He is beaten and near broken but fighting with whatever kick is left in him. While I appreciate this more unique take in the Marvel universe I don't think its as stellar as people make it out to be. That's not to take away from a solid film in the hands of a director who knows what he is doing.Its a pretty violent film, its expected from an R rated action film regardless of it being in the Marvel world. The fight scenes are intense and don't really let you down. The film is pretty simplistic and doesn't attempt to accomplish more than it should. Its pretty emotional as well. I would have liked more connection with some of the other characters of the X-Men franchise but this was all about Logan and that's probably the best way to go about it.The film is long which i think kind of works against the film as the film could have been perfectly fine 30 minutes shorter. Logan isn't really my favorite Marvel character nor is he my favorite X-Men, but its hard to deny the giant impact and perfect casting that Hugh Jackman brought to this character. He seriously brought it to life, which is why I hope they let Wolverine in film rest because we don't need another Spiderman situation going on here. The film isn't amazing but its a different approach and a fitting farewell to a beloved character.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A legacy,"Logan is the final film Hugh Jackman will be portraying this iconic character of wolverine that he has ingrained his portrayal into fans of the Xmen and the wolverine for 17 years,this film marks the end of an era and is quite gut wrenching to think about growing up along side the movies,in my opinion this movie is the best way send off the character in a satisfying and emotional film that every fan has truly been waiting for in a faithful adaptation of the character and loosely based on the old man Logan story line.As a fan of these x men films(although not all great)i have grown to become invested in these characters and that one character is wolverine,wolverine is poster boy for the Xmen movies and has got a spin off series of movies due to his popularity and in my opinion if it wasn't for Hugh Jackmans portrayal of the character he probably wouldn't be as successful as he is nowadays.Logan is that movie that appeals to the fans of the character and hits fanboys in such unexpected ways that its actually a painful experience in that satisfying,emotional almost empty feeling by the end of the film,this film hit me harder then expected and for that experience alone just left me with very high praise for this film.This film deals with a lot of different aspects and has a very fitting tone of gritty and serious but also has moments of levity with slight humour and really invests the audience in the characters,the aspect of character in this film was very prominent and is really the main focus as in this film is a very character driven and doesn't rely on big action scenes but very small and quiet scenes that explores the characters way of thinking and their motivations,this comic book film separates itself from what people expect from those types of movies for something fans can really respect.Although this film is character driven and its main focus is to explore them as human beings and not as the ""mutants"" that people in this film has a hatred,it follows aging Logan and senile Xavier in a world where they are alone with no hope left and nowhere to go which gives the tone of helplessness and the need to escape from the cruel world a very powerful and emotional feel.Overall this movies as an absolutely amazing experience that allows the audience to experience every emotion and sympathize with an aging and brutal Logan in his final outing,it offers amazing and investing character development and absolutely beautiful brutal fight scenes that perfectly depicts the true character,but the one true problem i have with this film is the pacing but even a fan like me cant dwell to much on it with the fact that it was such a great conclusion and send off.9 out of 10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Wolverine Does Leon (The Professional) Surprisingly Well,"With strong support from Patrick Stewart and Dafne Keen, Hugh Jackman successfully pulls off a sensitive portrayal of a declining hero and his somewhat self-imposed alienation, decorated with the usual Marvel studios CGI action sequences. While the CGI sequences were as protracted as they usually are in contemporary pop culture movies, they did not detract from the film's strong emotional content and were more integrated into every level of the story than they are in most comic book adaptations.The Wolverine, Logan, (Jackman) may reach an heretofore unrealized peace with himself and his world through his newfound relationship with a young girl who may be his daughter Laura (Keen). However, Laura is being hunted by the same evil that has hunted Logan throughout most of his life, and his Logan's other real connection to humanity, Charles Xavier (Stewart), needs more help than he can give. The most dangerous mind in the world (Xavier) teamed up with one of the most dangerous men in the world (Logan) might seem like an undefeatable juggernaut, but for many reasons, neither of these superhero legends are what they used to be. As the story unfolds, Logan's powerful defense mechanisms are challenged in ways that have, in previous adventures, been his undoing; aspects of Laura's personality and history leave the value of the central adventure wide-open to question; and Xavier's loss of the ability to control his incredible mental powers threaten to expose everything.It really is not clear what will happen in this film until it actually does.Thoroughly entertaining, well-acted, well-paced and surprisingly touching, Logan is one of the best films I have seen from this genre.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Dumb and dumber,raises a dysfunctional half mute kid","Who wrote this stuff? it's god awful. The blood and gore don't bother me,but the stupid predictable,idiotic decisions do. No person would ever take those decisions. I have not read these comic that this ""new"" old wussifed Logan/wolverine is based on,but based on this movie,I haven't really missed out on anything.If you take out the mutant element of this movie,it's your average generic slow burner drama ,with a hint of action.Long dragged out dialogue,with no real purpose. Half spoken sentences.And of course the anti hero, who makes all the wrong decisions that makes a B movie. 4-5 times Logan could have easily killed the main antagonist, and just ended the whole pursuit and killing of innocent.But every time he runs away instead,just so you can have the final show down.And even than he fights like a girl I was actually hoping someone would just put him out of his misery",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"A Sombre, Touching Finale for Jackman & Stewart,","Logan is a brilliant movie with a very well developed plot and an outstanding cast that are all given time to shine. It is completely unlike any other superhero film, it has a gritty, western vibe throughout, scenery and cinematography that you will not see in any other X- Men film, and dialogue heavy moments with no action, this really is groundbreaking work. What really surprised me about this film is that you can go in to it completely blind, you do not have to have seen any other X-Men film, it stands on its own.I did feel the movie could have been a bit more sentimental. Considering the fact that it's the finale for Wolverine and Charles, there is little reflection. There is one beautiful moment where they speak about first meeting each other, I would love to have had more moments like that, to showcase the history they have with each other.It is certainly sad watching this movie knowing that this is the last time we will ever see Hugh Jackman and Patrick Steawart in their very famous roles, but they certainly went out with a bang. The connection between them here is stronger than ever, they are both clearly at ease with one another and it makes for pure, natural acting. Dafne Keen also shines as Laura, for such a young girl she seemed well capable of holding a strong character throughout, and her chemistry with Jackman and Stewart is very sweet. Stephen Merchant also surprised me, I was expecting him to be comic relief and thought that he would have felt very out place in this universe, but he is actually stellar in this role, delivering little humorous dialogue, he completely transforms.You will walk away with great sadness, but also feeling like they could not have closed off these characters arch's any better way. Dark, action packed, well acted and grounded, Logan is a must see for all X-Mem fans, as well if you are looking for a good action or drama.When Logan and Charles discover a young mutant, they must hide her from dark forces and search for more of her kind.Best Performance: Hugh Jackman",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Oh Poor Logan,"This movie was great, but left me in tears more than once. It was dark, gritty, tragic, but hopeful. I cried throughout the movie.

But again this movie is so damn good.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A good example of why X-Men is consistently the best comic-to-movie series,"I can't say Logan is my favorite movie in the X-Men series - it's too darn depressing - but this gritty meditation on heroism and mortality represents why the X-Men movies are so consistently good; the focus on character and psychology.In the age of modern comic-book adaptations, I'm not sure anything else is quiet as pared-down is this. The leads are sick and dying, and the fights throw out flying and weather control in favor of what is basically a series of violent martial arts blade fights.This is a very dark movie with a high death toll and a consistent bleak sense of place. It is emotionally powerful and surprisingly uncompromising within the movie superhero world, although it's still full of exciting action sequences.At the same time, I think it's easy to be overly impressed with this movie because it's so different from a typical superhero movie. Some viewers are responding to Logan as though director Mangold has created a movie for the ages. I think that's pushing it a bit. But it is an absolutely terrific movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"A must see, 2 downsides unfortunately.","LOGAN REVIEWWhen Hugh Jackman was approached to make this apparently at first he refused, he wanted it to be more real and out of the Spandex universe and I'm so glad he stuck to his guns because the film is an epic.Even if you have never seem any of the previous X Men films you will enjoy this.Previously the X Men films, whilst good didn't make you emotionally involved with them, it was just action and special effects but front the start, middle and especially the end of Logan you care.A well deserved 15 rating as the violence is in your face and not as comic book safe as all of the previous X Men films so be warned.A must see, 2 downsides unfortunately.Firstly, Richard E Grant (why?) There are far better actors out there and personally I think his role should have been played by a female.Secondly, there is one item referred too throughout the film (almost too many times for my liking) making it obvious how it will be used, especially when Hugh Jackman is recovering, but that said by the time it does happen your that engrossed and care so much for the characters it still works.Don't go expecting Spandex and happy heroes but I guarantee you won't be disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Probably the best comic book movie made so far,"This is not your typical Marvel movie. It's not even your typical X- Men movie. It's so much more and brings so much to the genre!I enjoyed the fact that the movie takes it's time and is very character driven. For the first time since the first X-Men movie came out you find yourself actually pitying Logan. He's tired. He's just done. All that rage and it seems like the Wolverine is finally running out.Then a new challenge is presented to him and he begrudgingly finds himself helping a misfit child who has some very bad people looking for her.I think that Johnny Cash's music was used perfectly to set the mood of this film in the trailer. Be prepared to have a Wolverine movie hit you right in the feels! All that said, I feel like it's obvious that this movie benefited from Deadpool's success and the fact that it was bumped up to an R rating. Without spoiling anything I will say that this movie simply wouldn't have been the same (or as good) had they been force to really hold back. Those edgier moments are used to play up the despair and hopelessness. Some brief nudity is used to reveal Logan's detachment.I cannot recommend this movie enough.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
The Best Film of 2017 So Far. Jackman and Stewart deserve Oscar nominations.,"Logan is the best film of 2017, so far. The darkest and most violent X-Men film ever. It's dark, violent and emotional. Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart both deserve to be nominated Oscars for their performances which was outstanding and newcomer Dafne Keen made an impressive acting debut as Laura Kinney/X-23 and she was fantastic in the part. The film was pretty hard to watch and the world of Logan was really dark and depressing and it shows you how cruel life and the world is, especially how bad the world in real life has gotten and how much rubbish people like Donald Trump, the drug lords, corrupt politicians and terrorists are giving to the world. However, I was real confused about if the film took place in the original or the reset time-line. I am glad Deadpool didn't appear in the film or made a cameo, he would had ruined it. If you plan on going to see Logan, I strongly advise that you bring tissues with you to the cinema, the real gets really emotional.

"If this is a Western, Logan is very reminiscent of broken-down antiheroes!","Like Clint Eastwood's William Munny in Unforgiven-a trained killer nursing decades of regret and sorrow, with enough juice for one last mission.The dirty little secret few critics dare mention is that James Mangold's last film, The Wolverine, was just as good as Logan, if not better.Mangold proudly wears his influences on his sleeve; a pivotal scene sees Xavier and Laura watching a clip from George Stevens's seminal 1953 film Shane, about another grim gunfighter with a mysterious past. Logan prefers hand-to-hand combat, of course, but aside from that he's quite similar to Alan Ladd's character in that film, a trained killer who fought for the good guys but didn't consider himself one of them.Mangold is an excellent director with a solid, unheralded resume (including the Johnny Cash biopic Walk the Line and the Sylvester Stallone neo-noir Cop Land). But Jackman and Stewart are, quite simply, why Logan works-they're why the film doesn't just feel like a cheap exercise in bloody violence, and why its subversion of typical superhero-movie tropes feels organic (unlike with the X-Men spinoff Deadpool). The actors bring warmth and grouchy humor to the story, barking at each other like the married couple they've become, as they go on a road trip north with their young ward in tow.The story itself is a little all over the place-Logan and company ping-pong from location to location across the country, as the villainous Donald Pierce (Boyd Holbrook), a metal-armed bounty hunter, chases them in search of Laura. A long digression at the house of a friendly family of civilians feels a little forced; the film's bloody climax, involving a sniveling scientist (played to the hilt by Richard E. Grant) and another mysterious enemy, slightly overstays its welcome. No matter-anytime things get too out of hand, Jackman and Stewart are there to tether them back to earth, and at no point does a cosmic portal appear in the sky, or a giant purple supervillain start a monologue about magical gems.""Logan"" is Jackman's latest, and possibly last, portrayal of Wolverine, the Marvel superhero he has played since 2000. If this is his final run at the role (comic-book characters do have a way of making surprise comebacks, so I'm wary), it's a peculiar milestone worth noting-he's our first superhero actor to officially age out of a role, a testament to the extreme longevity of some of these franchises. Will we get another Logan one day? Quite likely, no matter how foolish a proposition that might be; this is a world with a new Han Solo and a new John McClane, after all. All the more reason to salute Jackman as he rides out into the sunset; that's Logan's chief task, and it succeeds splendidly.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Amazing last performance,"One of the best movies I've ever seen. Deserves all the praise it gets. I honestly want to go see it for a third time. Soundtrack is amazing, just like everything else.

Heroes with a Heart,"You don't expect your eyes to start watering in a superhero movie, especially one as swift and violent as ""Logan,"" but that's what happens when you have a director and writers who care as much about craft and drama as they do about fight scenes and chases.This film concerns people. There's minimal CGI; emotions are raw and real. Explosions are few and far between. The characters have to interact with each other. Some have mayhem on their minds. Some are learning what it is to care about others and to develop a heart under all their adamantium. Forbes magazine rightly compares this film to ""The Dark Knight,"" and their critic sees possible Oscar nominations, including Best Picture. I'm inclined to agree. Now that DC has given quality up for crap, it's good to see Marvel finally smartening up.Action fans certainly won't be disappointed, but director James Mangold is going for more here. Set in 2029, Wolverine is getting old, and his powers are waning. It's harder to push the bullets out of his chest than it used to be, and healing takes longer. He spends his days taking care of Charles Xavier, now in his 90s, and he's not what he used to be, either. In fact, without medication, he's downright dangerous. They, and an albino mutant named Caliban (Stephen Merchant) are hiding in an abandoned complex in the Mexican desert, just south of El Paso. On most days, Logan makes money by chauffeuring a limousine for wedding parties and prom nights. Wolverine is a superhero brought low.In this world, mutants have been pretty much eliminated from the human race, but a young mutant (and mute) girl named Laura is one of the exceptions, and she has become a commodity which a large genetics company wants back. They're willing to to dangerous lengths to get her. But she believes she has a destination where she will be safe, and Logan agrees to take her there. The chase is on!I have to single out young Dafne Keen here. (Did they have to spell her name that way? God, I hate that.) She's the daughter of actor Will Keen, and acting is clearly in her blood. She has to balance her innocence and her unusual childhood with power than can be terrible to behold. Even without speaking, Keen holds her own against Jackman, who gives his best portrayal of Wolverine yet. She's touching and frightening, often at the same time. Keep an eye on her.""Logan"" is more of a road Western than anything else. A clip from ""Shane"" turns up along the way, and Mangold uses some of John Ford's well known desert locations. In its sense of the ending of an era, ""Logan"" also has echoes of Clint Eastwood's ""Unforgiven."" Both those films concern the cost of violence, which may be a first for a superhero movie. For once, we actually see the destruction one of those fights leaves behind, and we see what the first responders have to deal with. That alone gives ""Logan"" a deeper dimension.You'll never see Patrick Stewart better. His scenes with Jackman are pure gold, and their banter is wonderful. The film's ""R"" rating means that the characters can talk and act like adults, and they do. Seeing Logan, of all people, trying to get the old man to take his medicine and to see Xavier acting like a little kid about it, is human and funny. These are two professionals having a good time, and they've let the audience in on it.Yet, once the action is done, what we have left is humanity and sadness; Laura gives us a touching tribute to Logan with a single gesture that had the audience I was in at the edge of tears. This film does not have the marketing department's fingerprints all over it, and nobody's trying to sell any toys. Both Stewart and Jackman have said this is the last time they'll play their X-Men characters, and we will miss them.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Logan is another milestone in the Comic Book movie genre,"The comic book movie has seen a number of milestones throughout the past 17 years. In the year 2000 X-Men was released and stunned audiences with creating well- rounded, dynamic characters. It showed that a comic book movie could be more than just campy. 2004's Spider-Man 2 took that even further by creating what I still say is in the top 10 comic book movies ever. It delved deep into the character of Peter Parker/Spider-Man and it served as a great character movie. The Dark Knight elevated the comic book movie to an entirely new level that may never be surpassed. It took the camp and silliness that usually fills those movies and instead told a serious and gritty crime movie. It essentially was a crime drama that so happened to have Batman. Logan has once again elevated the comic book movie and is another incredible milestone.It's the year 2029 and nearly all mutants have disappeared. A mutant has not been born in 25 years. Wolverine is older now, he's been beaten, he's a bit rougher. He lives in hiding with an even older Charles Xavier who is suffering from seizures, and whose powers are dangerous now that he doesn't have as much control over them anymore. One day they come across a mysterious young girl that needs help. Together they must take her across the country to help her.This is the third movie of a somewhat underwhelming Wolverine trilogy. It's rare after two underwhelming movies a good movie yet alone great movie comes along, but Logan is that rarity. It not only exceeds expectations and is the best of this trilogy, it is the best X-Men movie in the entire franchise.The X-Men movies have always relied heavily on the characters. Part of what separates the X-Men movies from other comic book movies is the incredible characters the franchise contains. The good ones, and they're almost all good, have well rounded, great characters. We already have 9 movies with the character Logan/Wolverine, but Logan develops the character even more. It's evident that he's seen a lot of terrible things in his life. He's at the end. Enter Lauren and things start to change for him. This is the best character piece for any comic book character.The performances are all around great. This is the best Hugh Jackman has ever been. He's really giving it his all. You see it in his face and in his body language. This is a character he loves and he wants to do it right one last time. Patrick Stewart gives, what I think, is a nomination worthy performance. I know it's early, but I hope his name is getting thrown around come Oscar season. He is that good. The movie requires a lot from him and he gives it all. Dafne Keen who plays the little girl is also very good in the movie. She has to perform between two giant screen presences in Jackman and Stewart and she still manages to nearly match their screen presence. The movie requires a lot from her both emotionally and physically. She might be my favourite part of the movie. She is so good and so convincing in the movie. It's not a cringy child performance. You believe every second of her performance. She even steals a few scenes from Hugh Jackman, and that's saying something. The performances are all top notch.There is a very good pace to the movie. It never drags and it always seems to be progressing to something. Each scene builds to the emotional and incredible finale. The last 20 minutes of this movie are absolutely thrilling. There is one incredible long take of Wolverine tearing through the forest on the attack. It's amazing.What elevates this movie though is the choices it makes throughout. There are a lot of bold choices the movie makes that 5 years ago would have probably not worked. I don't think audiences were ready at the time. Now that we are well into the slew of the comic book movie genre, I think audiences are ready for some of the choices it makes. Other comic book movies lately have attempted at doing some of these choices, but have used under developed, poor characters, or have back tracked right at the end almost as if to say, ""just kidding!"" Here they make great decisions that I think will push the genre to a whole new level that will cause people to say, ""hey they did it in Logan, why not in this movie now?"" To me, that shows an evolution.Just like The Dark Knight was a gritty crime thriller that happened to also be a Batman movie, Logan is a character drama that happens to be a X-Men/Wolverine movie. This is, in my opinion, the best comic book movie since The Dark Knight. It's emotional, thrilling, contains great acting, and it makes very bold decisions. It's one of the best movies of the year. Do yourself a favour and watch this movie.Just remember, it is very brutal.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"""Logan, you still have time...""","I had a hard time just coming up with a title for this review. Because, honestly, how important is that when talking about a film like Logan? It's probably one of the few superhero movies I've seen that deserves to be called perfect. I just went to see this with a friend, and we agree that this film excited us, shocked the hell out of us, and presented us with characters that we love and are now all broken down, and a genuinely great story that follows how they spend their final days.The plot here is that Wolverine, or James Howlett, or Logan (Hugh Jackman) is spending his days driving people around the city for cash to buy medicine for the now emotionally-broken and physically declining Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) with the help of fellow surviving mutant Caliban (Stephen Merchant) who can't go out into the sun without burning severely. Logan himself is declining too, with scars forming on his body and his healing factor working much slower than before. Everything changes when Laura (Dafne Keen) walks into their lives and asks to be taken to a place called Eden in North Dakota. All the while, they are pursued by Donald Pierce (Boyd Holbrook) and Dr. Zandar Rice (Richard E. Grant), who want Laura back.What I will say right now is that this movie will break the hearts of anyone who loves X-Men and the character of Wolverine. I can't give anything away, but I will tell you that there are moments that show you how much people like Logan and Xavier can screw up and how they have to live with their mistakes. Logan himself is at his lowest point and he convincingly acts in a way where you wonder who the man was underneath that Adamantium skeleton and those berserker rages. Xavier himself plays off Jackman very well. He talks like a bitter old grandfather at times who is unhappy with his ""son"" and yet acts like a grandfather who has the opposite personality: loving, understanding, and sharing his wisdom of the world with Laura. A scene where they watch Shane (1953) is especially touching.Despite what other critics have said, the villains are great here. Holbrook is properly cruel and twisted and Grant plays the kind of villain you want to hate. The fact is, neither of them play super-powered bad guys who want to take over the world. This is one superhero film where I wouldn't have cared if the villains didn't get much backstory or dimension, because it is not their story; they are just forces that Logan and co. keep running into and are part of a less tolerant and more unfriendly government.The violence is done well and Logan slicing his enemies up in a gory fashion is something we finally get to see. Here, Wolvie stabs people in places we haven't seen him stab before and whenever those claws do strike somebody, there's always blood. Logan shows that even though he's old, he's still a pro, and even then, we see that every new wound he receives in his state just slows him down even more and makes him worse.Dafne Keen is definitely something of a complete surprise in terms of child acting. Even though she doesn't say much for most of the film, she nails the aggressive stares and animalistic and child-like tendencies very well. When she cries and is frightened, it feels very real, and not annoying like with many child actors. In fact, some may consider this a stretch, but she might be the best child actor I have ever seen in a movie.The film seems to take a lot of cues from something like Mad Max, with similar desert landscapes, and the story of an aging iconic character who needs to get past his emotional pain and redeem himself is still exciting here. It worked with Rocky Balboa and James Bond in Skyfall, and it works here. It's clear that Logan feels pain and through his conversations with Xavier, it's obvious that he needs redemption. Its great script (filled with numerous earned curse words) drives one in to see if Logan actually achieves it.To end, Logan is a fantastic movie. Period. Not ""superhero"" movie. This film will most likely make you question how good other superhero movies that you've seen really are, as it's doing to me now. I'm not kidding; this film will provide you with emotional satisfaction and leave you feeling like you had seen not a superhero movie, but something else entirely. Just be sure to bring plenty of tissues, because it will screw you up inside.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Emotional. The best X-Men movie of the series (that I've seen). 85+%,"I became interested in seeing this film after I saw Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart interviewed on ABC TV's (Australia) ""Lateline"" programme. Here's the link to that interview (01/03/2017), with a transcript and video of the segment:http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2016/s4628874.htmI'm surprised to see that it looks like I've only reviewed ""The Wolverine"" at this site, which I scored 72.5+%, however, I have seen the first X-Men film in the series, at least. Which is to say that I'm a casual viewer of this franchise and I'm not particularly invested in the characters, so for me to like a film in this series so much speaks volumes for what they've accomplished here. It's a movie which effectively manipulates your emotions, in a way that other, lesser films, attempt to do, but fail, for example ""Star Wars: The force awakens"".Seeing as ""The Wolverine"" was the last X-Men related film in this franchise that I've seen, I can't say that I've kept abreast of what's happened in this universe. By the looks of it, the mutants of this world are no longer a force. The reasons why are, presumably, covered in previous instalments of this franchise. In any case, there seems to be a little expository dialogue by the characters to help you understand what's going on better.Logan (The Wolverine) and Charles Xavier (Professor X) are living in less than ideal circumstances. Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart are both very good in the physicality of these now older, more feeble mutants (maybe that's not so much ""acting"" from Stewart!). Jackman's Logan looks a bit like Saddam Hussein, just after he's emerged from his ""spider hole"" (foxhole)!The major narrative arc of this film concerns Logan having to – unwillingly – escort a young girl to safety from what looks like a paramilitary operation which desperately wants to capture her. Visually, the film has touches of movies like Mad Max 2 for its vehicle action and it probably has similarities to an American Western which is regarded as a classic, but which I don't think that I've seen. In case naming that film might provide some spoilers, I'll refrain from doing that, but this film does show clips from that old movie and even reiterates dialogue from it. There's a scene with Logan and his ute which reminded me of a similar scene involving Basil Fawlty from the TV series ""Fawlty Towers"", but stripped of the hilarity of that earlier Britcom. There are actually some amusing scenes in this film...an unintentional example of that was Logan at a funeral near the start of the film...seeing what he does with litter, the phrase ""Keep America tidy"" popped into my head! It should also be pointed out that the film does get ""meta"" at times...there's an interesting series of comic books which appear in this film!There was an enjoyable interlude in this film with a family which invites Logan, Charles and the girl to dinner. Seeing as what the family looked like, I did wonder how things would develop and my hypothesis was borne out, as far as the family was concerned.Back to the topic of emotion in this film (as a viewer response)...it's delivered. Near the end of the film, there's a scene where Logan enters the fray. Whilst it didn't fill me with joy, it was pleasurable, which is unusual in these kinds of Hollywood superhero or action movies where they aim to produce this feeling in you...but fail. The last scene featuring Logan also produced an emotional response in me, of a different kind. Again, the contrast with ""Star Wars: The force awakens"" is marked, where the scene designed to produce that feeling in you failed to deliver it, again.Miscellaneous observations:* A Johnny Cash song opens the closing credits. For a moment I thought that the song was ""A boy named Sue""...which would have totally spoiled the moment! Firstly, I'm not that familiar with Cash's music, but I did realise that I knew the song that he was actually singing (vaguely). Interestingly, the credits list the song's writer as ""John R. Cash"" and the performer as ""Johnny Cash""! Also interesting was hearing the line, perhaps for the first time, concerning what the singer was kicking against...I had heard it before with regard to Australian alternative artist Nick Cave...but looking up that phrase now on Wikipedia, it seems that perhaps both Cash and Cave were referencing a bible quotation, surprisingly, rather than it being a case of Cave referencing Cash. Just looked up the name of the song that Cash sings in the end credits, ""The man comes around""...it mentions that Cave actually sang on that Cash album of cover songs!* I have no idea how or if this film differs to any comic book treatment of the life of Logan. Whatever the case, I do like how this film deals with his story.* It's possible that the Lateline interview has Jackman mentioning that he wanted this film to be rated ""R"", for artistic reasons. Here in Australia, it has an MA15+ rating, which means that children under 15 years of age can't see the film except with an adult accompanying them. Interestingly, the ""R"" rating which this film gets in the US means that children under the age of 17 can't see the film, except with an adult accompanying them. As for this violence, the film does get quite bloody but doesn't reach the point of requiring the next restriction in Australian ratings, ""R"", for people 18 years of age or older. Not even being accompanied by an adult would allow somebody of under the age of 18 to be able to view such a film.In closing, I appreciated the sombre, gritty nature of this film and the lack of the previous instalments' risible elements, such as bizarre mutant abilities (like controlling the weather, ffs!).",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Amazingly gritty, full of gore and shamelessly crude, but at its core 'Logan' is all about the characters","After 17 years in his iconic role as Wolverine, Hugh Jackman's time in the X-Men universe is at an end. The fan favourite receives the perfect send-off in 'Logan', standing as one of the best, if not THE best film of the franchise. It demonstrates further the point made initially by 'Deadpool' that the superhero genre can benefit immensely if they take the risk of a more mature approach to comic book films. Moreover, 'Logan' succeeds in being distanced from the archetypal ""city/planet/love interest in danger"" monotony of other modern superhero flicks, showcasing a much more personally captivating foundation for the scenario of the film.Beginning at the Mexican border, Wolverine (going by his original name of James Hewlett) is forced out of retirement to safeguard a young girl, Laura (Dafne Keen) who is the first mutant to emerge in years. Incentivised by his lifelong friend, Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), whom he now also cares for in his old age, the three venture north to Canada to save Laura from some dark forces.Wolverine is finally illustrated in his true colours (yet ironically still excluding his classic yellow and blue suit seen in the original writings); 'Logan' is gritty, full of gore and shamelessly crude, everything that this character should have been from the start. Watching him tear through his enemies with a 15 rating is a wholly fulfilling display, reaching new heights in the franchise with the blend of grounded realism and awesome action sets. Alongside this however, 'Logan' also conveys the Canadian's inner turmoil and self-loathing better than any previous instalment. It never holds back: from a terrifying rampage by the titular character, to poignant moments exploring his alcoholism and unwillingness to be the hero, 'Logan' is unhinged in all aspects. It can only be questioned why he hasn't been seen in this way before.The setting is mesmerising - the environments mirroring how stripped down the concept of the film is. Plus, certain desert car chases feel like sequences from the 'Mad Max' series, filmed expertly and going full-throttle with the higher age rating. But at its core, 'Logan' is all about the characters. Jackman provides us with a career highlight, absolutely entrancing as the 'Old Man' Logan (reference intended). Stewart is enticing as the deteriorating Professor X, but it is Dafne Keen who is most alluring. Being her first film, it is amazing the amount of conviction she expresses in her mostly speechless (but by no means silent) performance. She herself more than compensates for the expendable villains and the predictable nature of their scheme, which is 'Logan's principal weakness, despite the outcome of it enhancing the emotional impact in the final sequence.The previous mishaps of the Wolverine series are ratified in this truly emotional and overall electrifying final chapter, and as 'Logan' is also Stewart's final outing, both him and Jackman end on a series high, a fitting end to their long and commendable run in their respective roles.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
truly sad,"first off, i wanna ask is how the hell can you compare this depressing nihilistic, destructive horror film to the dark knight.....or ANY superhero film? superheros were meant to inspire good and hope...this film only destroyed those elements it completely baffles me how this destructive gore fest is being called ''the best superhero film of all time''. as for the dark knight trilogy-batman inspired people....even the criminals....logan starts off depressing and ends depressing. logan provided the perfect chance to restore the xmen and complete charels's dream by saving this dark, depressing world-yet, they chose to kill logan-and leave children trained to be weapons with no guidance, no hope to be anything more than weapons....this film spits on every xmen film before it, it spits on the xmen and the superhero gen as a whole and frankly, from what i've read-if it wasn't as graphic as it was- not very many people would've bothered....hell, one person here pretty much said this film would be nothing without the r rating! i saw the potential it had....but completely disregarded all that just to make a depressing, destructive, gore fest-frankly, i feel the r rating is what ruined this film. logan never liked killing in the past films- he would always try to avoid killing-here, he'll go out of his way to do so in the most graphic ways, logan is supposedly remorseful for the lives he's taken....yet, he kills more in this film-so i can't believe this, he also have a little girl who looks up to him.....and he continues killing! i can recall i quote from days of the future: I was your most helpless student, and you unlocked my mind. You showed me what I was, you showed me what I can be-so, in conclusion-he should've killed even less and he should've lived. so, i gives this film 2 stars-1 for the acting, another for the potential it had to be a masterpiece. i also wanna say that even though most say they can't relate to laura-i can, however. it's also worth mentioning logan has been a very influential character-taught me to never give up. another lesson completely overlooked is: just because someone stumbles and loses their path, doesn't mean they're lost forever. but, a quote that that should've been the theme here is: why do we fall? So we can learn to pick ourselves up! i also wanna say that the fact Laura is mute mostly is understandable-think about the crap she went through-would YOU be very social? one other thing i wanna address is statements regarding the children......of course they're gonna gonna be afraid.....they're abused children!",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Thank you, Hugh Jackman...","Logan is a well made and tearful swan song for Hugh Jackman as the title protagonist, and is quite possibly the best film adapted from a Marvel property since Spider-Man 2.The film defies superhero conventions by being a gritty Western-like picture that delivers on the gory violence we expected from Wolverine while earning its R rating for reasons beyond the spectacle.This time around, Hugh Jackman portrays Logan as an older man who is broken (physically and emotionally) by the loss of his teammates of the X-Men, and his special abilities slowly deteriorating and poisoning him to the point where he could die. Jackman goes out with a bang (or a huge claw slash, in this case) by delivering a strong performance that reminds us of why we became so attached to this character. As far as I'm aware, he IS Logan/Wolverine.The rest of the cast is amazing too, including Patrick Stewart as a frail and unintentionally dangerous Charles Xavier, and newcomer Dafne Keen as Laura, a young runaway Mutant with some of the same DNA that Logan carries. The two especially share a huge on and off screen bond with Jackman to the point where you truly believe they are a family.After two PG-13 attempts at a Wolverine movie and the success of Deadpool, 20th Century Fox gave into fans' expectations by going all out with the high R-rated gore levels and adult themes and language one would expect from a character as ferocious and ill-tempered as Wolverine. Though the film is light on action, the set pieces that are in the film are well executed, and gleefully brutal with a sense of grittiness and realism to them (for a comic book movie, that is).As mentioned earlier, the film plays less like a superhero movie, and more like a Western in the same light as Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven, which Jackman has admitted to being the main influence for this movie. The darker tone is perfectly consistent as it knows exactly what it is, and what it wants to be.The plot moves along nicely, and is surprisingly thoughtful and metaphorical, coming from a comic book movie.While it saddens me that this is Hugh Jackman's final performance as Wolverine, it's still a great movie that stands out as one of the best of the genre, and his legacy as the character will never die.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Hugh Jackman's swan song at long last testifies to Wolverine's potential,"Hugh Jackman's 17-year ride as beloved ""X-Men"" hero Wolverine has been full of ups (""X2"") and downs (""X-Men Origins""), but his commitment to the character has never wavered, and that's undoubtedly a factor in what makes ""Logan"" a special superhero film.Inspired by Mark Millar's ""Old Man Logan"" storyline, the film takes place in 2029 in a world almost completely devoid of mutants. A physically ailing Wolverine has concealed his identity and works as a private driver in El Paso. He commutes over the border to Mexico, where he's hiding a senile Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), who has seizures that result in physical tremors. Their quiet life is upended when a woman pursues Logan with a request to take care of a young girl in her care named Laura (Dafne Keen). But some bad folks from a bad technology company are after Laura, who shows some mutant-like tendencies that resemble Wolverine's. The three are forced on the run with the hope of getting Laura to a safe haven in North Dakota.The film both subtly and overtly resembles a Western. Director James Mangold, who also made 2013's underrated ""The Wolverine,"" also directed the strong ""3:10 to Yuma"" remake and the acclaimed Johnny Cash biopic ""Walk the Line."" Story and aesthetic elements of both make it into this film, as does the character-focused storytelling that made ""The Wolverine"" a strong entry in the character's lengthy canon.It may seem crude, but what elevates ""Logan"" to the top of the Wolverine spin-off pile has a lot to do with its R rating. Although the violence adds a grit that better captures the essence of the character, it's equally about the maturity of the storytelling. The R rating also affects the style of the film, which is far more dramatic and introspective, and consequently much slower in pace. Freeing Wolverine from the restraints of PG-13 also means freeing him from the restraints of the cookie-cutter comic book blockbuster framework. Mangold and fellow scripters Scott Frank and Michael Green are able to populate the story with character-building scenes and dialogue that serves more than plot momentum.The success of Fox's ""Deadpool"" would seem the obvious source of our gratitude for Logan's liberation, but Mangold's vision and Jackman's tenure in the role, which has raked in billions for the studio in the last two decades, had to inspire more confidence that if any character could carve its way out of the superhero mold, it would be this one. Mangold and Jackman reward the studio's trust – and our trust – with a one-of-a-kind riff on the genre, something becoming increasingly vital after two decades of Juggernaut-like forward momentum in Hollywood comic book adaptations.Yet for the ways it tests the limits of the genre, ""Logan"" doesn't transcend it. It still ultimately feels like a comic book movie, namely in the way it gives in to action set pieces and gratuitous violence (albeit in a whole other stratosphere, stylistically speaking). Adding Western tropes to superhero tropes technically doubles the amount of tropes, and both genres have an overwhelming tendency to descend into violence. So ""Logan"" may not be formulaic, but it's still predictable. The script finds some nice moments that exist in service to themes and emotions, but the storytelling is simply good, not exceptional. Watching a superhero film play out in such a unique manner is more satisfying than following the actual story itself.Nevertheless, Jackman seizes his opportunity to go out on a much more profound note than fans of the character ever dreamed possible, especially in 2009 after ""X-Men Origins."" The story, the style – these components give an actor who was already such an effortless fit more opportunities to own the character, which is bittersweet given he's hanging up the claws. All the same things can be said of Stewart, who did it without ever having a solo film. He actually has the more demanding role given how different it is than his previous appearances as Professor X.""Logan"" is refreshing and interesting, which means it might not hold up over time as superhero films continue testing the limits that once contained them, but it will undoubtedly stand out as one of the high points of Jackman's unprecedented legacy as Wolverine.~Steven CThanks for reading!

An incredible achievement,"This is one of the best superhero movies that I have ever seen, and the reason for this is because it is a great film that just happens to have superheroes in it. The Dark Knight was a crime drama with Batman in it, The Winter Soldier was a spy thriller with Captain America in it and now Logan is a modern western with Wolverine in it.Logan is also a great example of what you can get when you let artists be artists, and the studio can sit in the corner doing nothing except promoting the film. Clearly James Mangold was given leeway to execute his dark, slow-paced and gritty vision of a final chapter to Logan's story, and man does it work well. The impact of the R rating during the action scenes is felt and lends way more intensity and realism than any of the other Wolverine action scenes could ever hope to accomplish without showing any blood or guts.The real reason Logan is so fantastic though is the story. I can't remember the last time a superhero movie left me this emotionally devastated, in fact I don't think it's ever happened. I was so invested in the events and the characters, thanks in no small part to the amazing performances. If this truly are the last performances of Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart as these characters then I would be very happy with that cause I can't imagine how they could ever top the amazing performances they both handed in here. I would actually want for them both to be nominated for Oscars at the end of this year although there is unfortunately no chance of that happening.Logan is not a movie for the faint-of-heart. It is violent, dark, depressing, bleak and really slow-paced for a superhero movie. But unlike the recent DC movies where those things were implemented just for the hell of it, here it serves the story in a meaningful way which is the reason it pays of so beautifully. I can recommend this movie to anyone who think they can handle the tone and the emotional gutpunch it packs. As it stands it is easily one of the best superhero movies ever, and it is precisely because it's not like any other superhero movie, it's just a great overall film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
There will be no man who can play wolverine besides Hugh Jackman,I will say that I went to see this movie aside from terrible reviews about the content of the movie and yes it was a little bit over the edge of content but I truly loved the movie and was sad that I had to leave early to get my car from the shop I got to hand it to Jackman he went out with a bang like no one else can I loved the supporting characters in the movie too I really liked the young girl she was very pretty and well acted she was as much of a powerhouse as Logan was I don't recommend you taking the family though it is rated R for a few good reasons . The violence and constant swearing and drinking from our own hero and the very brief nude scene in it however for 16 and over I say go see it you will enjoy it trust me,9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
