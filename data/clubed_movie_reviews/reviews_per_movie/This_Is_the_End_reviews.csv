"How to make a stoner comedy with a bunch of friends and turn it into a smart, shrewd and hilarious statement on humanity","A vanity project for a bunch of Hollywood's highest paid comedic actors, playing themselves in a ""stoner comedy"". So how do you make that good? By making it an hilarious, smart, insightful, satirical and scathing commentary on religion, celebrity and Los Angeles. And how do you make that successful? By making it a stoner comedy about a hapless group of actors saying and doing the stupidest things.It actually starts out pretty slowly with a lame story being introduced. Jay Baruchel comes to LA to hang out with his friend Seth Rogen who wants to hang out with his friends James Franco, Jonah Hill and Craig Robinson, but Jay doesn't like his friends and he doesn't think that they like him. Sounds kind of lame doesn't it? The party at James Franco's house delivers the ridiculous, raunchy comedy which the target audience craves but it doesn't yet include the intelligence which the rest of the audience is applauding.It seems like everybody in Hollywood is at James Franco's house. Michael Cera is doing coke, Jonah Hill is being friendly and everybody else is finding another drug to imbibe. While Jay and Seth are off to buy cigarettes, the Heavens open up and the Earth caves in. And then the real fun begins. Knowing the title of the film, or having read the bible, or really having seen any loose interpretation of the apocalypse, it's pretty obvious what is happening. And we get our first glimpse of the film's take on the celebrity culture and what it does (and what will eventually happen) to those at the center of it.Our heroes aren't quite sure what's going on. Remember, they are actors in Hollywood. It's probably an earthquake, or it could be a zombie invasion, or it could be the end of the world as described in the New Testament's Revelation. But who believes that stuff?The majority of the film takes place with our five actors holed up in James Franco's house â€“ which is like a cement cave designed by himself since he's an artist. The jokes are vulgar, crass, silly but also incredibly insightful into who they are and the result is a perfectly written self-parody. You have to get past a lot of penis jokes, but once you do, you'll find an under-current tackling the issues of celebrity status but also of celebrities' biggest detractors, the religious congregation. I don't think ""This Is the End"" will be successfully duplicated any time soon, but I also don't foresee the apocalypse hitting any time soon.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Hilarious and original, which is all it was meant to be.","Although 'This is the end' does not have the greatest storyline in the history of film, it is a very inventive movie in its own way. The fact that every actor and actress plays him or herself makes the movie quite original and refreshing. Besides that, there is also the fact that the makers took an overused theme, the end of the world, and made it completely their own.'This is the end' hasn't failed a second to make me laugh. It is a very clever and entertaining comedy, with hilarious and dirty dialogues. I do have to admit, however, that the storyline can feel a little bit too ridiculous from time to time, even for this kind of movie. The acting in the movie was not that spectacular, but the actors involved were all born for this kind of movie.For anyone who can truly appreciate a hilarious movie which is made specifically to humor and entertain people, and has no other hidden agenda whatsoever, this is definitely a must watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
You have to know going in how plot less and ridiculous it will be.,"I was actually surprised that it was better than I thought it was going to be. I think too many movie-goers hyped it up in their heads that this movie was going to be the most epic comedy of all time. I went in knowing how dumb it was going to be and found it really funny at parts and I liked the dark comedy eased with more immature slapstick comedy. A lot of these negative reviews I've read either have some kind of religious agenda against this movie or were people trying to measure how big their cinema knowledge penis is by citing great foreign films and comparing how much it falls short. It's a stoner comedy made by stoner nerd's that happened to find success and are probably just as baffled as these harsh critics are as to how they achieved it. In a movie filled with celebrity cameos and over the top CGI and humor, it felt to me like it was still a down to Earth movie they probably spent 30 minutes writing and had a blast filming and getting friends together and showed Hollywood excess from the point of view of the outsiders. If you were offended or wrote this movie off because it wasn't up to your standards, you're not the audience this movie had any intention of appeasing. It's obviously a cult comedy that some will love and most will hate which sometimes are the best comedies. It wasn't quite up there with the writer's and actor's other modern day classics but it was totally enjoyable and worth watching again.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"If you love these actors, you'll love the movie!","If you've seen Superbad, Pineapple Express, etc., then you know the type of humor this movie will have. I, for one, could watch James Franco, Seth Rogan, and Danny McBride leisurely eat a sandwich and manage to laugh my butt off. Thankfully this movie is much more exciting than that. It's brilliant that they all just play themselves and manage to poke fun at their own lifestyles. Expect weed and drug humor of course. The plot sets itself up for hilarity, as they all take refuge in James Franco's fortress of a mansion while the world outside them goes up in flames. Cabin fever mixed with dwindling supplies results in hilarious situations and good one liners.The movie made me laugh extremely hard and had all my favorite people in one film. I only wouldn't recommend this film if you're uptight and religious.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Hysterically Stupid,"This comedy where the main stars play versions of themselves is not believable; however, it is very funny. Seth Rogen, James Franco, Jonah Hill, Jay Baruchel, and Craig Robinson are very funny. Danny McBride is viciously brilliant. The film involves a gathering of these stars and friends amidst an apocalyptic event that is the end of the world-thus the title of the film. That event is just the catalyst to expose the shortcomings and quirky behavior of the stars-and it works. There are a ton of cameos from Rhianna to Jason Schwartzman. Michael Cera is very, very funny in the short time he is in it. So is Emma Watson. The story and special effects are not what this movie is about.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Funny, but starts to drag","Alas, it is the fate of so many comedies - the first half of the movie is great and funny, the second half is 'meh' as the director tries to figure out how to resolve the story lines. I laughed a lot in the first half of this movie - it's so over-the-top and ridiculous that you can't help but laugh. If I were rating the 1st half, I'd give it about a 9/10.The second half was a different story. Though it had a handful of funny moments, it seemed to drag and was a predictable mess IMO - maybe a 5/10. The first-half comedy was enough to make up for some of that, so I give it a 7/10 overall.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Great humour!,"I don't know what all the bad reviews are about. I loved the idea of using the actors' real names but creating alternate personalities. The humour is great, and special effects are rather realistic! Also, I particularly loved Michael Cera and Paul Rudd's appearances! Great job to the writers, directors and actors. For me, this was the perfect combination of comedy, horror and sci-fi. There was a sense of doom throughout, especially with the wide shots of LA, which made me feel quite uncomfortable, but then there was plenty of comic relief.I don't often laugh at movies, but if you're looking for a relaxed, light comedy, I would recommend this film.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A devil put aside for me,"I thoroughly enjoyed the film, though in retrospect, I am not sure if it is really a great film--there's not much to compare it to. One thing's for certain: this film is not ""just like"" any other film you could name. It is one of the funniest films I have seen in quite a while. And I am probably going to miss the Rapture as a result of my enjoyment.The film has graphic sex talk and graphic violence. The dialog could hardly be any nastier. And of course, hardly more sacrilegious. However, despite all of that, the film is surprisingly good-natured.This is not a film for children or for family viewing. Anyone who is squeamish or easily offended should stay away.And don't automatically assume that anyone over 40 would not like this film. I'm over 60; I had a great time. So I saw it a second time, and loved it even more.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
This is the End review,"I'm pretty sure everyone has their own vision of how the world is going to end. Biblical Apocalypse? Nuclear war? Hit of a meteor? No matter how, the way of surviving it in 'This is the End' is by far the best I've seen on-screen.The concept of the movie is rather simple - have a bunch of celebrities fighting for their life during the Apocalypse. It starts off rather inconspicuously - Jay Baruchel and Seth Rogen after spending a day on smoking weed and playing video games head to party at James Franco's new mansion. There are way too many cameos to include all of them in this review, but the most memorable ones are definitely Emma Watson (you need to see Hermione with an axe), Danny McBride and Michael Cera. However, they are mere additions to the main course of 'Pineapple Express'-like buddy comedy featuring Seth Rogen, Jay Baruchel, James Franco, Jonah Hill and Craig Robinson.I wouldn't say the plot is non-existent, but it certainly isn't developed enough to pay much attention to it. The movie is rather a collection of gags with typical American humor, which is exactly what you would expect from anything created by the duo Seth Rogen-Evan Goldberg. But what's more, it is fairly obvious that the whole crew had so much fun making this movie. Be it playing soccer with a severed head, fighting over a Milky Way or filming the sequel to 'Pineapple Express' (hands down my favorite part of the movie) - it all seems to be pure fun to these guys. And it's amazing, because this atmosphere of good fun is passed to the audience. Plus it's nice to see big Hollywood names not taking themselves too seriously.'This is the End' contains a fair amount of satire on the posh world of show-business. It also has a very simple, yet not so dumb message. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying it's anything overly ambitious or a piece of art that would leave you thinking about your life or state of the world. However, it makes the movie a bit better. That's always a good thing, right?Overall, it's a very fun watch, especially if you have some friends and beer with you. It's simple - if you liked previous movies by Rogen- Goldberg, you're going to fall in love with this one. If you didn't - well, it's still worth a try.For more reviews check: www.altentertainment.blogspot.co.uk",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Sinkhole de Mayo,"Why isn't Jay Baruchel in more things?! Well, more relevant things. I mean ""Goon"" was a really good movie, but how many people saw that? The writing team that brought you ""Superbad"", Seth Rogen and the very hit and miss Evan Goldberg, come together once again to write and direct this film. Adapted from a 2007 short by Goldberg, Rogen and Baruchel entitled Jay and Seth Versus the Apocalypse, ""This Is the End"" has one of the most simplistically brilliant plot lines in film history. Basically, Rogen, Baruchel and every other comedic actor you can think of (all playing themselves) attend a party at James Franco's houseÂ…and then the world ends. This plays out like an elongated Funny or Die skit. The only difference being that ""This Is the End"" is consistently funny.There is actually a subplot dealing with Rogan and Baruchel growing apart as friends which works really well (in ""Superbad""-esque fashion) only because of the construction of the script and some rather genuine chemistry from its two leads. And can I take a minute to talk about how well this film looks for being both Rogen and Goldberg's directorial debuts? I mean, aside from the onslaught of funny one-liners, this end-of-days film looks like a million bucks (in a good way). Even when some of the CGI does slip into a cartoonish realm, like seasoned vets, Rogen and Goldberg maintain the tonal atmosphere befitting each scene; be it a high octane chase sequence or a few well placed dance sequences.Side Note: When I say everybody is in this movie, I do mean EVERYBODY. But the cameo that clearly steals the show is from Michael Cera in his most outlandishly crass and hilarious role ever; a performance that is almost worth the price of admission alone. Trust me. If you weren't a Cera fan before, which is supremely understandable with him being the most annoying kind of Canadian and all, then you will be after this.""This Is the End"" is what every person paying $11 for their movie ticket should expect, but rarely gets from a modern comedy. It's not only an adult comedy that actually contains non-stop laughs for a change, but ""This Is the End"" is the funniest movie since ""40 Year Old Virgin"". This also is a much needed return to comedic form for Rogan and to a lesser extent Jonah Hill (only because ""21 Jump Street"" was pretty funny) and clearly is the funniest movie the rest of this cast has been a part of by far. Hell, even Danny McBride is hilarious here. And we all know how much I hate Danny McBride.Final Thought: There are so many memorable one-liners in this movie, it is sure to become an instant comedy classic. And why most of these jokes work is because they are so self-deprecating. Yes, THIS IS about 20 minutes too long and it is essentially a movie full of phallic and weed tangents, but when it comes right down to it ""This Is the End"" is a comedy which contains very few bits that don't work (mostly coming near the end) and is drowned in laugh out loud moments from minute one, to a finale that blows the one in ""Bridesmaids"" right out of the water. I hate to constantly pick on ""Bridesmaids"" (well, hate is such a strong word) but Kristen Wiig and crew should really take note on how a real comedy like ""This Is the End"" constructs a final sequence. I'm just saying.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

best comedy of the year so far,I saw this movie opening weekend but did not review it right away because I was not sure of what I thought of it. It was not really what I was expecting. I was expecting a raunchy but light hearted comedy that took light of a bad situation but instead the apocalypse in this movie is taken very seriously. I was not so sure I liked that. But I've had over a week to think on it and I have decided that Overall I really enjoyed watching This is the End.I love the cast I think everyone in this movie is talented and really funny. They all have such great chemistry together but also all have something of their own to offer. The funniest part of the movie for me and my friends I think was a several minute long back and forth between Danny Mcbride and James Franco but I would watch the movie again for that scene alone So overall This is the End is a really fun over the top movie.I give This is the End an 8/10,8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Hilarious,"Overall this movie was pretty good, and super funny. I don't recall another time when I actually laughed out loud numerous times throughout a movie. The only reason this movie was so funny is the cast, if you put a whole different cast in the exact same story line with the exact same lines it would be a horrible movie. There was a couple things I didn't like though. Like Jonah Hills personality in the movie was so annoying, this was probably my least favorite roll he has played.SPOILER The Funniest part by far was when James Franco was arguing with Danny Mcbride about cumming in his magazine. I was Rofling in the theatre. I really hope they do some kind of sequel but I don't know how they would considering what happened to everybody.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
So Funny and Entertaining,"I was fortunate enough to watch a screening today in Miami and let me just point out, this movie is exactly what you would expect from Seth Rogen in terms of comedy. Its non stop laughing from the opening scene to closing. Everything about this movie is great, the story, the actors, and the comedy. Having such funny actors like James Franco, Seth Rogen, Jonah Hill, Jay Baruchel, Danny McBride, and Craig Robinson playing themselves all in one movie just makes it that more entertaining. If you liked the comedy in Superbad and Pineapple Express, you will love This Is the End. I recommend this movie to everyone who has a sense of humor. Like everyone that stood in line with me to watch it almost two months early, you wont regret it. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Comedy of the year... so far,"There's one scene in This Is the End, where James Franco and Danny McBride arguing, when I snorted from laughing so hard.Even though it's embarrassing, it's been a long time since I've literally laughed out loud at the movies. Actually, it's been a long time since there's been a laugh-out-loud comedy at all â€“ the last one was probably The Hangover.This Is the End is so utterly ridiculous and completely insane that it's borderline genius. Similar to the best bits of Anchorman, there are moments here when you're thinking ""What the heck is going on?"", but due to the likability of the actors involved and the fact that they're just having fun with it, makes it you laugh even more.This film is like an inside joke with some of Hollywood's biggest actors, and while watching it you feel like you're in on it. It feels more like you're laughing with them instead of at them. It's the same kind of thing you would make with your own friends at home, and I guess that's the film's biggest appeal.And just like Anchorman, it's also really hard to pick your favorite actor or favorite line, because there's just too many to choose from. Each brings their own spin onÂ… themselves, with Franco, McBride, Jonah Hill, Craig Robinson, Seth Rogen and Jay Baruchel adopting fictional and overly-exaggerated persona.Even cameo stars take the mickey out of themselves, and there is a boat-load of cameos. Nearly all members of the Apatow family are accounted for, with Jason Segel, Mindy Kaling, Paul Rudd, Christopher Mintz- Plasse, Aziz Ansari and Michael Cera (who is hilarious), but then there's some big names like Emma Watson, pop star Rihanna and Channing Tatum showing a knack for comedy.The concept originally started as a short film, also written by Rogen and Evan Goldberg, called Jay and Seth versus the Apocalypse. Jay and Seth remain the main characters here, which is why they're basically ""the straight guys"" in amidst all the weird stuff that's going on.James Franco is making me dislike him less and less these days, to the point he's actually one of the best things about this film. I think it's just all the other self-absorbed, artsy stuff that makes me want to punch him in his smug face. If he stuck to stoner comedies like this and Pineapple Express I would probably love him.As for the rest of them, this just made me like 'em even more. Jonah Hill is almost cringe-worthy as an over-the-top phony, who at one point starts a prayer with ""Dear God, it's me Jonah HillÂ… from Moneyball"", Craig Robinson has some of the best one-liners, like ""I'd be pretty bummed if I don't at least get a bight of the Milky Way"", and even though Danny McBride is playing his usual selfish-jerk role, he has never been better.And even though it sounds stupid, the only thing that will turn some people off is the whole ""apocalypse"" thing â€“ with all the demons and what-not. You could tell from the start that it was going to get a bit crazy toward the end, but I think they rescued it with a bizarre ending that seems perfectly fitting.It's early in the race, especially with Anchorman 2 and The World's End still to come, but so far this is front-runner for comedy of the year. Definitely worth watching.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Unbearable,"I wish I could give it a rating lower than 1! If you are looking for something intelligent or a good storyline, don't watch this. This is supposed to be a comedy, I may have blown some air out my nose in amusement near the beginning, that was the extent of what I found funny in the movie.I like the actors in this film and when I started watching it, I thought it would be good fun. Not even half way into the movie I was just wishing it would end! If you are a Christian, it is not a good idea to watch this, it's so full of blasphemy, I found it unbearable. I always finish a movie, no matter how boring or stupid, this is the closest I've come to stopping the movie.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Not your typical comedy film,"This is The End is an out of an ordinary celebrity apocalypse comedy film. The story is quite simple: A bunch of Hollywood actors and actresses are having a party but suddenly the world comes to an end and the survivors fight to stay alive. We get to see a lot of cameos from actors playing themselves throughout the film: Cera, Segel, Tatum, Watson, Mintz-Plasse, Rudd, Rihanna,etc.While the whole concept of the film is new and interesting, but the execution is weak. None of the 'characters' are likable or memorable...Most of them are douchebags or pricks. While the film is not terrible and still watchable (I suppose), but it doesn't feel funny from beginning to end. The jokes presented in the film were crude and raunchy (a lot of dick, masturbation jokes) which may not be everyone's cup of tea. There's some gory death scenes (you get to see various Hollywood stars getting killed), a lengthy conversation about who is going to rape Watson, Rogen urinating into his own mouth, to name a few...There's a lot of sudden, unexpected events that may come as a surprise to the audience. Many who assumed that this is a silly comedy that shouldn't be treated seriously could easily change their mind after watching it. The demons shown in the film are genuinely scary looking and a demon-possessed Jonah Hill look quite disturbing in the film as well.Overall, this film is mixed bag...For those who enjoyed the stars' previous works might find it acceptable or entertaining to watch, but for the rest, I don't really think so. Personally, I expected more, considering the film is filled with talented comedy actors, but what to do?",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Funniest film of the year so far.,"Was lucky enough to see a preview of this tonight, and can recommend it to anyone looking for a funny, modern and silly yet at times shocking comedy. Not sure how it can have a score of only 6.4 at the moment, the film is easily the best comedy of the year so far and deserving of an 8 or my case a nine as i was so pleasantly surprised by the quality of the jokes and the story.The cast is perfect and the cameos aren't there to fill out the movie and take up time, they are excellent especially Emma Watson and Michael Cera.

Note, all male - although I never spied Rihanna and Emma Watson in ""heaven' either.Funnily enough I found the devil monster at the end to be quite effective. I wasn't sure how they would ""end "" it, but I think it pulled it off. Silly James Franco, with his dick jokes. Ha.However, their version of ""heaven"" would be my personal hell.

"Good For a Few Huge Laughs, It's Not as Consistent as You May Have Heard","Seth Rogen and his usual entourage of stoner near-celebrities return to the screen, this time propped against the backdrop of a biblical end-of-world scenario. There's a certain taste of playful irony in the fact that so many of these actors, Rogen, Jonah Hill and Danny McBride especially, who share the common criticism of merely playing themselves throughout their careers, are doing so literally this time around. They're able to play that up to ridiculous extremes and big laughs in the long-form party scene that eats up most of the first act, riffing and rolling with the punches in their never-ending quest to make the cast and crew smile. Predictably, that's the film's sweet spot - a blank slate for ad-lib spoils - and when it's finally cast aside to make way for a more coherent narrative (admittedly, a very loose one) their ship springs a big leak. Where a more thoroughly-incubated concept like Shaun of the Dead is able to easily blend quick, witty banter with big set pieces and wild, frenzied action, This is the End struggles to unify an equally diverse toolbox. I can get the fish-out-of-water aspect that was being fronted here, of a catered group of celebrities who were lost when their smartphones dropped off the grid, but that runs out of gas near the three-quarter mark and when the big special effects swing and miss, there's nothing left to carry us the rest of the way. Really uproariously funny at a few points, but pointlessly thin and overblown at others.Additional thoughts after a recent re-watch:Like a lot of Rogen and company's films, I think this works far better if you fit one or two descriptions: happy-intoxicated or just in the mood for something completely mindless. Last night I was both, and man did it hit a sweet spot. Of course, the opening party scene has the greatest bits - actors and celebrities poking fun at themselves and the vapid public image that typifies their slice of pop culture - but it also functions well when the crowd is significantly reduced and the plot shifts from a snappy ensemble comedy to a much smaller crew in the midst of a disaster. The transition from dialog-driven laughs to a frantic survival parody is so sudden, the only thing I can compare it to is the infamous directorial shift of From Dusk Till Dawn. This is the End, though, pulls off that wheel jerk more than once. Of course, such swerves cause the storyline to spiral completely out of control, but that unpredictability is partially what makes it so stupidly entertaining. Not something I'd want to watch most nights, but it's also more consistently knee-slap funny than I remembered. Upon review, I'd upgrade my original score from an 6 to an 8.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Seemed like a full blown ad-libbed script,"It certainly appeared the main characters just ad-libbed their way though this film, a film loaded with homo-erotic jokes.

It's about the end of the world occurring as a big celebrity house party filled with drugs, booze and sex is going on. Bizarre comedy-horror flick.

"""I don't wanna die at James Franco's house.""","Some comedy premises seem to go over people's heads. Which the case with This Is The End. The film is based on an idea that the actors play exaggerated versions of themselves, based on the characters they play in their films, which seem to be the same character over and over again. Or they play completely against type - Michael Cera's case.The idea of actors playing themselves always seems intriguing to me and here it serves as a basis for letting Rogen and his friends goof off. The film perfectly serves the celebrity lifestyle and the culture surrounding them. It even briefly touches upon how people are obsessed with these celebrities. The plot revolves around a James Franco's housewarming party when an apocalypse hits the Hollywood Hills. Those who survive the earthquake, fortify themselves in Franco's house and wait for the rescue which may never come.This results in hilarious series of fights, arguments and gags. The mystery element about the apocalypse keeps interested in the film. The ending is just simply madness but that is exactly what I expect from a comedy like this: to be surprised.Rogen, Franco and the rest of the pack are amazing as always. Danny McBride plays the biggest scumbag that has ever walked the earth. If you are fan of these comedians, then you are in for a treat. Even though you are not, I believe you will have a splendid time and perhaps you will become a fan as well.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Well judging by some of the reviews, people did. Seriously, some people said it was like the funniest movie ever? Yeah right, Doesn't hold a candle to Caddyshack, Animal House, My cousin Vinny, Something about Mary or Fast Times a Ridgemont High.

"Wacky, Witty, All-Star Comedy","From the get-go the film is not meant to be a cinematic masterpiece. The film is about an all-star cast (literally, even the background actors are all famous stars) playing their-selves surviving an apocalypse.Because of the film's nature, I won't be reviewing it as I do normally, however I do want to note: cinematography (6/10), sound design, with a top level soundtrack full of legendary pop songs (8/10), stuntwork (9/10), and story/dialogue (4/10).Most of the dialogue and story simply compliments the comedy of the film, so if you were looking for a compelling story, or good dialogue, you're looking in all the wrong places, as it's severely lacking. The film's stuntwork, comedy, and scenery make up for a lot of the areas it's lacking, which make the film still entertaining. It's an interesting combo to see all-star actors in an apocalyptic B-movie, but it ultimately works.Overall, the film gets a 6/10, as it accomplishes its mission of being a wacky all-star film with lots of stupid comedy and funny references, however, as a film it's not very appealing. It is worth the watch, but not worth paying for to see in theaters.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Super Funny,"Let me start by saying this movie isn't for everyone. If you enjoyed Rogen/Goldberg's previous efforts, namely Superbad and Pineapple Express, then you will thoroughly enjoy this one. I will admit I laughed so hard, there were tears. It didn't seem like it was trying too hard, it flowed well and was as ridiculous as I expected it to be.Cinematically, this movie did something that I've never really seen done before. I've seen plenty of actors ""play themselves"" so to speak, but usually the role is small and insignificant. This movies shines for that choice â€“ to have all the actors play (funny, fictionalized versions of) themselves. I thought the story/writing very funny and well paced. As I said, not for everyone, but it had me laughing for sure. I liked the choices of music used (for the most part), one part in the end really had me (and the entire theater) in stitches.Overall I thought it was very funny, but like I said not for everyone. It contains a lot of crude/rude humor - but it's done well. Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg are indeed a winning team, and I'm looking forward to their future films.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Surprisingly...... Funny,"The only reason i contemplated on watching this movie was solely based on its above average reviews as well as the fact that i was frankly bored on a Wednesday night.

However, this movie seemed to unlock the perfect concoction in order for the experience to be enjoyable;irony, demons,and Emma Watson. And even though they were predictable and immature, the movie instead brought empathy and understanding-a feeling of rooting for the main characters ; overall if you feel like being pretentious, i would not recommend it, however, if you feel the need to relax and just laugh at offensive and taboo jokes, then this is the one.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Brave, Original and Downright Hilarious","This Is the End (2013)*** 1/2 (out of 4)Seth Rogan, Jonah Hill, Jay Baruchel, Danny McBride and Craig Robinson are at James Franco's house partying when something disastrous happens and the men soon find themselves facing all sorts of danger as they tucker into the house and try to survive. To mention exactly what happened would be a mistake for anyone going into this film blind. Yes, the trailers hint at a few things but there's just so many off-the-wall twists in this film that it would be a shame for anyone to have them spoiled. I will say that this here is without question one of the most original, daring and funny comedies to come out of Hollywood in years. Co-writer and co-directors Rogan and Evan Goldberg actually do an incredibly good job on both fronts for a number of reasons. For starters, they're really not worried about crossing the line of good taste but their dirty humor isn't like so many other gross-out films where it happens just for the sake doing something dirty. The humor here comes for a reason and the reason is whatever situation the cast finds themselves in. Again, I'm not going to ruin these situations but once you see the film you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. There's a lot of great humor aimed at weed and various other drugs, which also come off as fresh and original even if that REEFER MADNESS thing has been done to death since Cheech and Chong came along. The film also has something to say about certain issues, which are smartly placed in the screenplay where they don't come off as being preachy. Finally, a big amount of credit has to go to the cast members for allowing themselves to be the jokes of so many cruel moments. This is especially true of the five survivors who must deal with each other through this ordeal and the screenplay is just so creative that it perfectly nails this stars even if they are just playing certain versions of themselves. Not only do we get the big five doing their thing but a lot of other celebrities show up with quick cameos and it's good that they can all laugh at themselves. THIS IS THE END is a brave little gem that manages to be incredibly funny at times but best of all is that the viewer never knows where it's going to go next.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Pretty funny,"First I will say a lot of people are comparing this to Hangover part 1, even saying it is better, that is not the case in my opinion. However, that does not mean it is not worth seeing. This movie was extremely funny and Craig Robinson and James Fraco definitely stole the show.The start of the movie is slow but that changes very quickly. They get to the point and there is nothing that is hard to understand which is good. The only real negative I can say about this film is that I have never seen Jay Baruchel as even remotely funny and he unfortunitely has a big part but again I say This Is The End was hilarious and, thus far, the best comedy movie I have seen all year.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Big Laughs,"Of course this review is coming from a guy who loves Your Highness, Pineapple Express, Hot Tub Time Machine, and all that stupid, silly stuff. That said...Loved it. I went to the theater to get some big laughs and that's what I got. I wasn't expecting a good plot, but it was original and interesting.Danny McBride stole the show. I was expecting big laughs from Jonah Hill and he had a couple hilarious parts; however, I felt like he was holding back. Maybe it was because there were just so many funny people on the set that it was tough for him to shine. Seth Rogen had some hilarious lines.Also, I think this is the first movie where you laugh out loud while people are dying horrible deaths. It's hard to describe how humor can come from all the over-the-top death scenes. You have to see it to know what I'm talking about.This movie is not recommended for highly religious or conservative people. But... Recommended for fans of McBride, Rogen, Hill, and the usual suspects.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The fun of the rapture,"Many of Hollywood's biggest comedy stars united for This is the End for one of two comedies about the end of the week. Whilst Edgar Wright's The World's End is the superior film that is consistently funny and action packed flick, This is the End does offer many laugh out loud moments, using more crass and crude humour, having jokes ranging from masturbation, stoner jokes and violent slapstick. Some of the best moments include a trailer for 'Pineapple Express 2', Emma Watson's cameo and discussion between James Franco and Danny McBride over a porn mag. Other jokes are more miss or crude for the such as the demon's man parts. The main stars have excellent chemistry together and had a strong dramatic with Seth Rogan balancing his old friendship with Jay Baruchel who hates LA and his newer friends in the city.If all else fails at least Kevin Hart dies a nasty death.If you enjoy this film then Zombieland and Dogma are worth checking out.7.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Lewd and Crude, Butt Funny","This film is recommended.Take a group of today's younger comedians and actors, mix in an apocalyptic nightmare scenario, and add plenty of raunchiness and sexual hi-jinks and you have a film like This is The End. Brought to you from the same team that produced Superbad and Pineapple Express, two films that left me underwhelmed, This is The End tries so hard to raise the level of shock value and tastelessness and although the film completely loses sight of the bigger picture, it has an abundance of laughs amid all the lewdness.This is The End wants to create genuine laughs at the expense of the next Hollywood Brat Pack with a better-them-than-us mentality. It wisely trades on their likability factor and the public's general perception of these performers from their previous films. The actors play themselves, real-life best friends caught in the aftershock of the turbulence surrounding them, as the world as they know it, spins out of control.There's a party at James Franco's home and Seth Rogen Jonah Hill, and Craig Robinson are just some of the invited guests, along with Jay Baruchel. As more party-goers arrive, so does the Rapture. Other party-goers turned survivalists include: Danny McBride, Emma Watson, and Michael Cera, who is hilarious as he plays against his own geeky type . There are also many surprising cameos from other celebrities with mixed results and funny visual riffs of other films like Rosemary's Baby, The Exorcist, and even Ghostbusters. One by one, the actors send up their own screen personas. (Franco, Rogen, and Hill fare best.)The cleverness of this conceit adds some humor and it is that camaraderie that helps to make the film succeed up to a point. The inside jokes and banter skews their stereotypical public images as stoners, doofuses, and nerds are thrown from one catastrophe to the next.Where the film begins to falter is in its execution. The film downplays their dire situation at the expense of its own plot structure. While laughs are frequent and the childish antics remain character-driven, the story itself begins to ramble. The ramping up of sex and violence (quite graphic at times) tends to upend the well-earned comedic elements.Written and directed by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, the film entertains while it perverts the notion of celebrity worship, ethical dilemmas, religious dogma, and the lack of moral conscience and one-upsmanship in today's self-serving society. That's a lot to digest from a film which is really a basic teen comedy in disguise. Still, the film's biggest asset is its savage wit in pushing the satirical elements to exaggerated proportions. Unfortunately, the film never knows when to say when. It continually overdoes its grossness and vulgarity and becomes a bit exhausting with all its excesses on full display, leading to a rather silly ending after all the hoopla.This is The End is a series of endless outrageous pranks that may shock and appall some moviegoers while thoroughly delight others. Audience reaction will run the gamut depending on your own comfort level of irreverent humor. As for me, I enjoyed much of the fun, the crude humor, and even the offensive jokes of This is The End.

"Don't worry. They yell each others names often, because","you wouldn't recognize most of them otherwise. The sad reality that some people think this is a ""good"" or even ""funny"" movie is a huge indictment of today's society. I noticed Danny McBride is in it. Well, here's one thing you can say for this smegma ... This Is One Movie That Even Danny McBride Cannot Ruin, It Is Already As Bad As It Could Be. I wonder why people who paid $10 to see this in theaters are not rioting in the streets. Really. Why not? Probably the most amazing thing is that most of these people HAVE been funny in other movies or other TV shows. I guess they just phoned this in because they figured it was just an excuse for a party.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Wowza.,"Such a beautiful and meaningful bro love story. I laughed, I cried, it became a part of my dump that day. The fact that it's based on a true story also made it even more meaningful. I've actually been to LA and every day there is just like this movie. The brilliant writers captured the essence of this rapturous self absorbed fake city that I stupidly still love. God help me. Every day a new LA disaster with fake friends all chasing celebrity or any whisp of fame. Most are too pretentious to care but feign their love convincingly before they throw you in front of the next oncoming bus. How I miss it. Carry on Garth, uh Seth I mean.

"Funny, But Not Satisfying","This Is the End is a difficult movie to review, but not because it's unlike anything I've ever seen. When I first saw its concept a year ago, I saw it as something fresh that had the potential to be hilarious, and to be honest it was. I haven't laughed that much during a movie since I saw Airplane! a couple of years ago, which is a decent feat. The problem, though, is that TitE isn't satisfying. It has a happy ending and had me laughing from start to finish, but the story itself isn't very strong, and Rogen+Goldberg stick a few too many dick jokes in. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who's easily offended or hates over-the-top gross out humor, but to everyone else it's worth a view at some point. 6.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A shameless side-splitter,"This Is The End is a movie that really shouldn't have worked, yet had me doubled over laughing for the entire film. The idea of a bunch of Hollywood actors playing exaggerated versions of themselves as a band of survivors in the Biblical Apocalypse sounds like something that should fall flat on its face, but it surprisingly carries the whole way through, in part because the actors look like they're having a ball making it. To say more would risk spoiling some hilarious scenes, so I'll give you some brief non-spoiler comedic highlights: Jonah Hill's shtick as the nicest guy in the world, Jason Siegel lampooning his own role on How I Met Your Mother, Michael Cera as an unapologetic sex and cocaine addict, anything that Craig Robinson does, the fake trailer for Pineapple Express 2, and EVERYTHING involving Emma Watson. So if you're into getting some unapologetically raunchy and ridiculous comedy with a surprising amount of heart, catch it in theaters while you can. That said, approach with caution if you're allergic to the Backstreet Boys because you'll have that stuck in your head after you're done.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Genius,"Simply amazing, fantastically written. Need more comedies like this. The idea that they portrayed themselves gave this a unique type of comedy that I think hasn't been done before, at least not to this level. The next best thing would be for this cast to take this idea but turn it into either some sort or ""trip"" movie or some other adventure and not the world ending which did give it a serious edge. If you see this and think it is as amazing as i do-go ahead and find yourself watching James Franco's roast it can almost make this movie even sweeter to see the real life crazy friendship they have and to almost see that perhaps the James/Seth obsession that they portrayed in the movie could almost be real. Enjoy the watch!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Morality Tale,"It begins as a stoner comedy but ends up a morality tale. Sort of like Cheech and Chong meet Revelations; you know in the Bible. The story is simple, during a party at James Franco's, the actor, there is an apocalyptic event. Yes it spoils the party. Many guests are swallowed up by the earth. Interestingly enough six comedians are left holed up in Franco's house. The comedians become serious. One of them, Jonah Hill, becomes possessed. Yes that is serious. So now you have a scary movie. The rest of the story devolves into a morality play with comedians doing good for their fellow man then becoming teleported up to heaven; a rapture thing. So you get the full Monty from bad boys to angles in just one film. What a bargain!",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A movie for simple-minded teenage boys,"I started watching this film purely because of the decent score it had received. I should have known better. Yet again Seth Rogen and pals star in a ""comedy"", that would only make the simplest of teenage boys laugh.The story itself is fairly interesting and I hold nothing against gore, but the dialog and the attempted humor are on a level that a monkey could achieve, and to be honest, this style of comedy hasn't been fun for over a decade (Beavis and Butthead was good at the time, not now). I understand in some ways that humor is subjective and thus not anyone can like every kind of comedy, but this brain damaging rubbish just makes me sad at the decadence of this society.",3.0,Anonymous,Comedy
An affront to good taste,"As I'm generally not inclined to use drugs and my cinema of choice is also not very lenient towards such stimulants, I went to watch this movie entirely sober and couldn't believe what I was seeing. Over a running time of 107 minutes, Seth Rogen and entourage take a toll on any lucid person's mind with This Is the End, a film explaining its one and only story arc in the title already, and is obviously the result of the exuberant intake of various narcotics.To be fair, it takes until the second half of the film for it to fall apart completely, as the first part is just in the style of the average flick Rogen stars in â€“ over the top, idiotic, and embarrassing, but at least smirk-worthy from time to time. After Emma Watson disappears again after a short and unnecessary cameo (that pertains to every single other cameo in the film, by the way) and the ominous foreshadowing of the title takes greater proportions though, there isn't anything to left to save This Is the End. Scatological humour, downright terrible special effects, unbearable cheesiness, and drugs and gore in superfluous abundance pile up to one of the hugest disappointments the film year 2013 has held for me.Now when a bunch of celebrities meet up, dope themselves to mammoth highs, and then decide to have a whale of a time by making a fully ad- libbed film, who am I to bash them? It's just that the yield of this frenzy cannot possible be enjoyed as long as the same jag isn't reached by the audiences. Thus, if drugs aren't your cup of tea, This Is the End won't be either.",,Anonymous,Comedy

Guess what? It IS that compelling!,"I just saw This is the End with a group of friends and was struck by something I'm sure a lot of other viewers found: these guys are a lot like me and my friends! And that, in a nutshell, is what makes This is the End such a funny, relatable and downright entertaining movie! The movie is full of slapstick, some special effects, and big names, but what it comes down to is the writing. The banter in this film between the actors is so sharp and humorous, that you find yourself sucked into the conversations even more than the plot itself. If you're anything like me, you read up on some behind-the-scenes trivia about the movie and found that about 50% of the movie was ad-libbed. Knowing that made the movie that much funnier. Seth Rogen and his writing/directing partner Evan Goldberg are just geniuses. The way they can take grown men, and reduce them to infantile children is gold. The interactions between the men is hilarious and you feel like the luckiest fly on the wall that ever lived. These actors are some of the biggest players in the comedy world and to watch them take bites out of these roles like they're big juicy apples was amazing to watch. I'm sure Seth hemmed and hawed over whether to make the actors portray themselves, and I tell you, what a difference it makes. You feel like you intimately and genuinely know these people and it makes the experience that much more enjoyable. Without ruining anything, I will say that there are more than a couple stand out scenes in the film and the actors were so good that I couldn't pick just 1 stand out role! OK, I'll backtrack: anything Danny McBride does is absolute genius and this film is no different. Jonah Hill also makes a case for himself to star in bigger comedic roles in the future. (Check out an ""explosive"" scene between McBride and Franco and tell me you won't die laughing). As always, James Franco lends a cool quality to gross out humour but he stands right up there with the best of them! Craig Robinson is effortless in his timing and delivery and Jay Baruchel plays the straight man to a tee. To me, This is the End marks a new chapter in film comedy. And I'm dying to see what Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg have in store for us next.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Party at Franco's,"Well this is off beat. It looks like the boys were inspired by the film Zombieland when Bill Murray turned up in his mansion as Bill Murray.Seth Rogen, James Franco, Jonah Hill, Danny McBride, Jay Baruchel, Craig Robinson, Emily Watson and even Rihanna appear as themselves.They attend a party at Franco's new house where Michael Cera makes a fool of himself and before you know it there is an apocalyptic catastrophe as the earth opens up and swallows up most of the guests.The surviving celebrities try to make do with the available rations of food and water, deal with the erratic and selfish Danny McBride. They then have to turn exorcist on Jonah Hill and figure out that if they are better people. Then there might be redemption.It is very easy to watch this film and sneer as a few of them have made patchy films in the past.I did find myself chuckling a few times.

Great fun. Takes me back the Rogen hits of 2007 and 2008.,"It's felt like forever since Seth Rogen and pals were on top of the comedy pedestal. In their wake they've left a vague area where I'm not even sure who's reigning it besides the odd one- hit wonder. While Knocked Up and The 40 Year Old Virgin have grown stale for me, Superbad and to a slightly guiltier extent Pineapple Express will always be some of my favourite comedies. It's great to see those casts reunited here especially for ""Pineapple Express 2."" Although Jay Baruchel has taken a long time to warm up to me, he really worked as the lead character here considering he hasn't participated much with the gang besides Knocked Up. I actually quite related with him which is a pleasure with a film like this, especially one that ends so epically.Fortunately I really like the idea and I like the celebrities enough to go with their self- referencing humour, even when they're deliberately playing against type such as Michael Cera. It is hilarious for the most part but its biggest problem is the pacing and structure besides the odd unconvincing special effect. The film is presented in chunks and loose segments rather than having them on the journey to a particular thing. It isn't clear until about halfway through how the film could or should end, which makes it occasionally a drag (apparently they didn't know either and had to shoot the ending last minute). It's pretty good, but not quite up to Superbad or Pineapple Express level but perhaps this is a movie best enjoyed with big crowds so the laughs feel bigger and better. I wonder if Rogen and Goldberg have more up their sleeve before they exhaust their style.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The Best Thing Seth Rogan Has Wrote Since The Pineapple Express!,"If you loved the Pineapple Express this movie is on that level. Seth Rogan did a great job in his directorial debut. If you're a fan of Rogan and his click of friends, I don't see how you won't love This is the End. It gets wild and unrealistic but it's all in good fun. I watched it and Man of Steel this weekend and let me tell you that This is the End has more realistic and connect-able characters in it than that big budget sh!+ sandwich I had to eat while setting through Man of Steel. There's great ""Rogan"" comedy throughout this film with the buddy atmosphere you want in a movie with a cast of characters like this.

Celebrity Film made by and for themselves,"Its understood that this film would be a crazy film parodying celebrities and their reaction to the end of the world. But this film still seems chaotic and bland for the most part. Coming out in 2013, this film seems to fit the year it came out with references and stylistic choices representing the early 2010s comedy films of Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg, James Franco, and Danny McBride.I honestly didn't have much expectations for this film, but I remembered it being somewhat funny when I first saw it, but not as much these days. Seth Rogen and James Franco are pretty much the leads in this film despite Jay Baruchel being a lead whose actions kind of guide the film. The jokes run flat and pretty much consist of Rogen/Franco exaggerations/parodies. This is initially funny but it runs itself dry pretty quickly.

Funniest Movie Ever!...If You Like the Actors,"This movie is extremely funny from the beginning to the end. It is very over the top and raunchy. It has some twists and cameos that will shock you. If you like Seth Rogen, Jonah Hill, Danny McBride, Craig Robinson and the others in their normal raunchy roles (Pineapple Express, Superbad, Eastbound & Down, Zack & Miri Make A Porno) then you will love this movie. The theater we were in was packed and the crowd was dying laughing the entire time. There is a reason why this movie has a 8.1 on IMDb...there is unheard of for most comedies.For the bad reviewers, what were you expecting from a movie packed with these actors? Did you expect a mild comedy or something with a deep plot? I personally do not like most Sci-Fi movies, so why would I go to them and them post reviews on how it sucked? There is a 90% chance I will not like it so I do not go. Simply put, you should of stayed home.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Quite a good rubbish :),"As I am no admirer of the actors having leading roles in this odd creation, I did not expect much, but decided to see this movie due to high acclaim. Well, the result was better than I had feared, as most of the participants performed boldly and with a lot of self-irony. As for the script, it is rather hectic and loose, but it's craziness does not live up to which is used in most British similar movies. I personally find the scenes prior to ""sci-fi stuff"" best and most amusing, the very ending is funny as well. Somewhere in-between, the pace slows down, and there are jokes resembling Jackass, or just attempts how far is possible to go vis-a-vis rudeness and dope...As for acting, the best parts are performed by Craig Robinson and Michael Cera, the least interesting - by Danny McBride and Jay Baruchel whom I did not remember from any of the movies. Seth Rogen is much better producer and screenwriter than actor.If you like Canadian comedies, messy fun and blunt jokes, then you will probably enjoy This Is the End as well.

This is the End- This Chaotic Apocalyptic Fantasy Triumphs in Vulgar Laughs and Whimsical Twists on Personalities Despite Being a Tad Pretentious,"It doesn't really seem like an odd question when you think about it but  have you ever had a daydream fantasy of imagining what it would be like  to experience the devastation of the apocalypse, either of religious  origin, zombie led, or alien controlled, with all of your closest  friends right beside you? Well it seems co-writers Seth Rogan and Evan  Goldberg who have written everything together from the good (Superbad),  the bad (The Green Hornet), and the ugly (The Watch) have envisioned  such a scenario in their newest comedy This is the End, which also sees  the two screenwriters sharing the directing chair to control their  apocalyptic fantasy as it unfolds in all of its crudity, chaos, and  humorous twists on celebrity personalities. And surprisingly this  rabidly tongue in cheek, incessantly crass, and occasionally uneven  farce, which initially seems like it's the most inside of inside jokes,  ends up being a rather enjoyable and demented excursion into the  hellish depths of two developing comedic minds. Not everything works  throughout This is the End but it's a script that's filled to the brim  with enough clever jokes, whimsical references, and biting social  commentary to outweigh the occasional sense of pretentiousness and  self-congratulatory trumpeting of its smug Hollywood private party. It  seems the writing team of Seth Rogan and Evan Goldberg has found an  inventive delivery to test the limits of their comedic vulgarity while  also giving a swiftly refreshing breath of fresh air to the premise  that gives us a unique combination of critical self-parody and  humorously grotesque comedy. Taking the Apatovian usual suspects and  placing them in the chaos of the apocalypse was clever enough but  adding in rapid fire dialogue, clever twists on known and unknown  personalities, and a comedic energy not seen in many disappointing  comedies of our modern years certainly makes This is the End worth  risking for more than a few laughs. When comedy becomes expected it  ends up losing its necessary impact but that isn't the case for Seth  Rogan and Evan Goldberg's directorial debut as they allow the  uninhibited lunacy of their characters loose throughout their  post-apocalyptic fantasy world that will inevitably surprise you in its  humorous risks and solid comedic delivery.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Down right Idiotic, hilarious, stoner movie.","This is the End A film brought to you by Seth Rogen James Franco and the pineapple express guys.This is an interesting movie, without knowing anything about it I viewed it late one Saturday night, in the perfect frame of mind so to speak, completely by chance.But let me tell you, it was one of the most enjoyable ,idiotic, hilarious comedy horror movies i have watched since Pineapple Express, probably.Now I should be quick to warn! this movie is not for everyone, some say it is crude, and its references to weed and drugs are blatant, but alas thats why I like it!, its a trashy, goofy, stupid stoner movie, with some of the funniest, geekiest immature dialogue since Pinapple Expess hit the screen.Now there is a story line to go with all the drugs and debauchery, and of course its the End of Time, the Apocalypse ladies and gentlemen, all mankind is being judged!, and we get to spend it at James Franco's house with his stoned out, dumb as f%&k actor friends.Now this movie is not a family movie, its made by guys, for guys, and the best way to watch this movie is with red eyes, it has a target audience, who it will resonate with, and i am absolutely certain this will become a cult classic, it has all the ingredient's needed.To sum up my feeling toward this movie, I was genuinely surprised by it, it felt different, and it took me a while to decide if the whole parody of themselves was going to be detrimental to the movie. It was not, if anything it enhanced it.Now highbrow intellectual stuff this is not, god help the poor sod who comes into this movie thinking he will be intellectually challenged.If i had to compare to this to another movie I would say Simon Peggs Shaun of the Dead, with who it shares many similarities, the apocalypse setting, the over the top comedy, the 'bromance', and often campy dialogue are a few of the things in common.The bottom line is this. IT is a stoner movie, and is best viewed accordingly to get the full enjoyment. Now this is not a prerequisite, it has good actors with a decent story line and you will get a laugh.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
If you have a sense of humor...see this movie!,"I went in with low expectations and left thinking this is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time. The actors playing themselves was a stroke of brilliance and all of them score bonus points for self deprecation. Michael Cera (playing the NPH role straight from Harold and Kumar) is brilliant. There are so many hilarious one liners in this movie I can't remember half of them, only that I laughed hysterically the whole time. Obviously, there are some ridiculous moments but that's the POINT. There is a dumb moment at the end involving a washed up boy band but other than that I was not disappointed. If you have a sense of humor you will like this movie!!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Absolutely Hilarious,"After seeing the trailer for this movie, I had mixed expectations. Mostly this stemmed from the fact that this is the first directing effort from Rogen and Goldberg, and although I have enjoyed some of Rogen and Goldberg's previous movies (like Superbad), I was worried that they might not be up for directing just yet. As for the actors, I love Seth and the rest of the Apatow crew, but this movie in particular struck me as one that would be overdone, with too many ridiculous cameos and plot points, and become unfunny as a result.It turns out I was actually right about it being completely ridiculous, but I was dead wrong about it being unfunny. I honestly haven't laughed this hard in a two hour span since the original Hangover; scene after scene in this movie is just filled with hilarity. The concept here is really fresh as well. I loved that the actors played themselves, as that really opened the door for some unique moments, and as the script plays out, you can't help but admire Rogen and Goldberg for their creativity.All of the actors in this film are hilarious, but in particular Mcbride, Robinson, and Franco consistently had me laughing. Jonah Hill's role is not at all what you'd expect, and I also really enjoyed him. As for Rogen and Baruchel, they take more of a backseat on the laughs, choosing instead to make their characters the heart of the movie. This is really important, especially in a film this raunchy and over-the-top.In addition to the stellar main cast, this movie is littered with several cameos, all of which are hilarious. I won't reveal many names so as not to give anything away, but Michael Cera in particular had the entire theater struggling for air. I don't even usually think of Cera as that funny, but he's great in this movie. Emma Watson also stands out in her cameo role.The one gripe I have with the film is it does trail off slightly near the end. The last ten or fifteen minutes of the film were a bit less funny than I would've hoped, but I thought the conclusion was ultimately satisfying.I am definitely going to go see this again, mostly because I'm sure I missed some of the jokes by laughing right over top of the them. I'd recommend this to anyone who likes raunchy comedies, and bring all your friends, because it definitely makes it better.So, I was wrong. Rogen and Goldberg proved to me that they are ready for the director's chair(s), and I'm definitely excited to see what they come up with next.RATING: 8/10",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Funniest movie I've seen since step brothers,I really do not understand how this movie has gotten so many bad reviews on here. I mean it is not an Oscar worthy film and I think some of these morons writing these reviews were actually expecting something like that. I honestly don't think I ever went more than two minutes without seriously laughing hard. As an intelligent adult I expected a movie where the actors were playing themselves for the actors to act like themselves. So if you think these dudes are funny in real life you won't be disappointed. Danny Mcbride was non stop cracking me up and the back and forth between him and Franco was hilarious. I just wish that Cera lasted a little longer and Paul Rudd too lol,10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
If this is funny the apocalypse of Hollywood is near,"How many ways can you create the same dumb movie? There isn't much to say about this film that can't be explained as follows: The dumb pot comedy brat pack hang out, sexual and drug related humor ensues as the group starts to riff on each other. Throw in some plot about the end of the world and redemption of your sins. That's the whole movie.If you read the critics' take, every one of them says this is a work of genius. It's so self-indulgent it's terrifying. I'm sure they are laughing hysterically at how they didn't bother to write a script and would just stay in character of themselves and use childish humor and they could force out a few laughs. Yes, there are a couple of funny moments but for an hour and 45 minutes? I've seen worse but this was a horrendous waste of time.",2.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Comedy of the Year,"I can't believe I was so close to not even watching this, ""This is the End"" works in many ways, its an apocalyptic comedy, a date movie, a stoner movie, its Seth Rogen and the ""Apatow Mafia"" at their peak and most of all its the most fun you'll ever have at a movie theater this year.Set in Los Angeles, its about Jay Baruchel (She's Out of My League) hanging out with Seth Rogen, who invites him to a party at James Franco's house, when suddenly all hell breaks lose.Its better to go in it not knowing nothing about it, its definitely one of those movies. Apart from the obvious, like Michael Cera's hilarious performance in it, its an original unexpected comedy with a great script. Its about friendship and it has a lot of pop culture references, which I loved about it.I saw it here in Los Angeles, where I'm staying for the film festival, I actually bumped into Michael Cera on the way to the movie, he seemed like a very cool guy, when I asked him for a picture, instead he said ""You know what, I'd like to get to know you instead"" and he shook my hand, it was pretty cool.Overall its a very fun movie, wait to see Craig Robinson in it, I couldn't stop laughing at everything he did, but avoid seeing it with someone who's already seen it, you don't want them to spoil anything for you. As a matter of fact, just stop reading this review now if you haven't seen it and go see it, I really hope this movie gets the attention it deserves. By the way, the ending was just brilliant. Its definitely the comedy of the year up until now.I'd recommend it to people who liked ""Shaun of the Dead"", ""From Dusk Till Dawn"", ""40 Year Old Virgin"", ""Pineapple Express"", and/or ""Superbad"".",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
This is Not Really Funny.,"Frat-pack comedies hit an all-time high (excuse the pun) with THE HANGOVER. In an attempt to raise the bar, THIS IS THE END goes all out as an obnoxious, sexist, and highly outrageous inside joke. And the joke's on Hollywood.The film is essentially set in two parts where we are first introduced to Hollywood celebrities playing themselves. These are not A-list celebrities but established comedians like Seth Rogen, Jonah Hill and actors of similar ilk. Basically, just about anyone from a Judd Apatow production. They are all here and they play themselves in the most unbelievable manner allowed in an R-rated comedy. The central theme is male bonding with Jay Baruchel exhibiting said issues when his friend Seth Rogen is invited to a party hosted by James Franco. At the party they meet Jonah Hill, Paul Rudd, Jason Segel and everyone else you can think of who are not in the same frat-pack league as Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson and the likes. As you can imagine, the party is swinging with alcohol, weed, women and crude sexuality including a self-indulgent Michael Cera. But just when you think this is going to be an amped up version of SUPERBAD or PINEAPPLE EXPRESS, the story shifts into darker territory with an apocalyptic end-of-days scenario straight out of the Book of Revelations. What follows is a bizarre attempt at survival but filled with slapstick moments of under-belt humor, decapitation and dismemberment, exorcism, and an unending array of sex-gags; all of which are nothing new to the genre, but questionable as an outrageous comedy that literally grabs Armageddon by the balls.Is it funny? The answer to that question relies heavily on how much you like these actors or their previous films. We have seen Hollywood actors play themselves in similarly themed comedies. Think Neil Patrick Harris in the HAROLD & KUMAR franchise or Bill Murray in ZOMBIELAND. But by sharing scripting and directing duties with Evan Goldberg, Rogen's achievement, at best, is pulling jokes within jokes. There are multiple references to various Hollywood celebrities (even one about George Cloony and Sandra Bullock), about themselves and characters they have played in their own movies. All this may sit well with die-hard fans but what about the casual movie-goer with little or no tolerance for unintelligent storytelling?THIS IS THE END gets to a good start with cameos of famous actors playing exaggerated versions of themselves. Emma Watson and Rihanna included, Hill even refers to his Academy Award nomination in MONEY BALL. Then things turn for the worse once Danny McBride arrives on his one-trick-pony, playing his usual crass and narcissistic self. In not saying that the film is entirely unfunny, it is also far from bland. Then again, this becomes a matter of choice. What all this boils down to is the fact that these actors are clearly having fun by mocking themselves. And by doing so, they are also saying that they can afford to do so because the awful truth of the matter remains that as long as idiots pay to watch their movies, they get to walk the red carpet and have a blast in the process. But thankfully, all is not lost if you save your time and money for a similarly themed but far more boisterous comedy instead â€“ THE WORLD'S END.",5.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"Over the top, and then some","""This Is The End"" is indicative of how ubiquitous Christian eschatology has become in modern times: The film was written, directed and co-produced by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg in their directorial debuts. The thing is, both Rogen and Goldberg are Jews; and Jewish doctrine specifically rejects the entire New Testament, including the Book of Revelations. The film is a feature-length adaptation of the short ""Jay and Seth versus the Apocalypse"" (2007), Jay being Jay Baruchel; and even Baruchel, who is Christian, nevertheless has a Sephardic Jewish grandfather. Not to mention yet another Jew in the cast, Jonah Hill.This is very much a guy movie, starring (more of less) Baruchel and co-starring James Franco, Rogen, Hill, Danny McBride, and Craig Robinson, with brief appearances by various other well-known male actors, and two women, Rihanna, who is present almost as an afterthought, and Emma Watson, who comes and goes with dismaying rapidity. She wields a fire-axe very effectively and treats us to four-letter words that Hermione Granger never said.The film centers on fictionalized versions of its cast members in the wake of a global biblical apocalypse. Jay Baruchel flies into LAX from Toronto and is met by his old pal Seth Rogen. They spend the afternoon at Seth's house, in as dissolute a manner as is possible for two straight guys who never leave the living room. In the evening, Seth takes Jay to a party at James Franco's house. It's the sort of raucous uncivilized bedlam you associate with fraternities like Delta House; and in fact, there is more than a little of an ""Animal House"" vibe to the proceedings. Without warning, the Apocalypse supervenes. Los Angeles goes down in flames, enormous sinkholes leading to Hell appear on people's front lawns, and lots of people magically ascend to heaven on beams of blue light. So what do you think these guys do? Why, it's the opportunity of a lifetime (literally) to let out their inner children - all of whom seem to be petulant 8-year-olds intent on spending Judgment Day behaving like booze-soaked, weed-choked, self-involved, callous, every-man-for-himself cavemen, only now freed of all inhibitions. When the alcohol and drugs run out, food and water get low, the fires get closer, and hellhounds lurk outside the house, these dimwits try to pull together and defend themselves, but they're no better at that than they are at acting their age.This film is meant to be a satire, or maybe just lead-pipe funny, and it is; and the second half of the film, when the guys are trapped in Franco's house, is supposed to be overdone; but by about the 80-minute mark of the movie's 107-minute running time, their antics were wearing pretty thin. At 90 minutes, I had to force myself to keep watching, because I figured there'd be a wow finish, and there is. The film would benefit from cutting at least 10 minutes from its current length. But that's just me. If you're a member of the target demographic - which I'm guessing is 12-15-year-old boys - you'll probably enjoy the whole thing.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Superbad, Pineapple Express, and Eastbound and Down, smashed together","I have seen every single Arrested Development, and Eastbound and Down. I also have seen Superbad, Pineapple Express, Juno, Scott Pilgrim vs. the world, and other stuff with these actors.This is easily on the same level as Pineapple Express, and almost up to Superbad's Level. Extremely funny, and having all my favorite funny actors in one rated R movie is great.I only can say 3 small points I didn't like. (1) one of the funniest characters dies too early on, (2) there is kind of an awkward and slow paced 25-30 minute section in the middle of the movie where they really try to squeeze a story and emotion into the movie, (3) actor Danny McBride was kind of strange in the mix. I didn't want him to be, he was the dude I wanted to see most. But he didn't have a ""Stevie Janowski"" or a ""Ashley Shaeffer"" character to interact with. So he just didn't make me laugh like I thought he would in this flick.Still, easily a 9/10. One of the best funny movies I have seen in a year or two. If you liked Superbad, and Pineapple Express, and Eastbound and Down, or any single one of those, get ready for your new favorite movie of 2013.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"Tries hard to be funny, accomplishes","When I first watched this movie, I had very high expectations after hearing from my friends that it's the next Superbad, one of my favorite movies of all time. After watching it, I can tell you it is a hilarious movie, but it's a completely different animal from the almighty Superbad. Superbad was funny because of the awkward and relatable characters and situations, and the humor flowed naturally from that. This movie, on the other hand, finds its humor more in individual jokes: its one-liners, funny insults, and the self-deprecating humor of each of the hilarious cast, stemming from the wise decision to have each actor play themselves. The movie definitely delivered everything I was expecting from a Seth Rogen movie, with all the weed and sex jokes you could want. The only thing I didn't like is it was extremely obvious every time the movie was trying to get you to laugh. But hell, I was laughing the whole way through.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Good, not great - still better than most comedies out there","Pretty fun - and how could it not be with such an amazing cast!? The only problem is I had such high expectations and it just didn't quite meet them.It's a pretty simple premise: a group of friends (who just happen to be the new Hollywood comedy masterminds that can be found in Superbad, Pineapple Express, Knocked Up, Tropic Thunder, Fanboys, Zack & Miri Make A Porno, etc.) go to a party when the Rapture/Apocalypse/End of Days arrives and they have to use their survival skills to overcome the fact that they're all playing exaggerated versions of themselves, so they're constantly having dumb arguments! Heaps of cameos at the start - Aziz Ansari, Kevin Hart, Michael Cera, Emily Watson, Jason Segel, Paul Rudd, Rihanna - so it's fun to play 'spot the comedian/celebrity'.Plenty of laugh-out-loud moments throughout, but lots of stupidity at times, as they try to take it too far. It ends up going too long - 1 hour 50 min - and overstays its welcome a little bit.I found it ironic that Jay is essentially the main star, even though he's the least well known of the actors! I did enjoy all the little nods to Freaks & Geeks and Franco-Rogen's relationship... The special effects are good, but it's not actually as horrific/gruesome as it could be - 'Shaun of the Dead' did it much better. Oh, and the ending was pretty annoying too...",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Juvenile stoner humor...,"I watched this movie because of the 7.2 average rating...I've learned that anything over 6.5 is potentially worth a watch due to varying tastes among the reviewers. Usually, as a rule, that works. In this case, I was unpleasantly surprised. This movie wasn't awful, but it barely makes the bar for decent entertainment.OK, so there's a bunch of stars making cameo's at the beginning, and it starts out like it might have a lot of potential. However, it quickly devolves into typical ""guy"" humor using as much foul language as possible while falling back on male Junior High School genital and sex oriented jokes for humor.If I was sixteen and smoking weed, I'd probably find this movie hysterical. Being much older and past that point in my life, I found the movie OK, but very sophomoric. It's kind of like watching ""Animal House."" I was a kid when it came out and it was hysterical then (especially when my viewing experience was ""enhanced""). Watching it now, it just seems silly.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Surprisingly unfunny,"This movie had potential to be so much more than what it was. A couple comedians playing a parody of themselves in an apocalyptic LA, seemed very intriguing to me. The cast featured so many big names, which I expected a lot more comedic action from. I usually enjoy watching movies starring these people, but they did not work out in this movie. A lot of the jokes fell to the ground with awkward deliveries. Other Seth Rogen movies aren't bad, but this one is a flop. This movie shouldn't be labeled as a comedy, but more as a ""meh.. watch if you really like these people"". 1 star for the CGI, which was decent and +1 star for Michael Cera and his coked up kinda funny moments. 2/10, do not recommend.",,Anonymous,Comedy

Think Harold & Kumar meets Zombieland It has all the major players of comedy movies within the last few years and they all play a crucial role turning this movie into comedy gold! The plot couldn't be more interesting, the actors play as themselves in an epic house party turned apocalyptic.It starts off entertaining enough with a more main stream approach to the comedy, then turns into a more silly Harold & Kumar meets Zombieland comedy which probably isn't for everyone because it's so over the top. However, comedy knows no boundaries!This movie pulls out all the stops, the comedic value of all the actors playing as themselves while making fun of each other couldn't be funnier and the clichÃ©s take it over the top, all that was missing was a cameo from Woody Harrelson eating some twinkies!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Good, raunchy fun!","This is gonna be a busy week...let's get things started with This Is The End. This is a pretty easy one to write...the movie poster alone is enough to tell you what this is all about...Smash together a bunch of various stars (but make sure you grab them before they shave or get dressed up), mix in a healthy amount of drugs, and let them run wild. There's BARELY a story holding this together, but that's OK - they're not out to win the Emmy for storytelling here. This is pure, raunchy, over-the-top comedy. And, in that, it's good.Things to note about the movie:All of the actors play themselves. The majority of this movie takes place at James Franco's house party, which you totally believe could play out exactly like this, drugs and all.Evan Goldberg wrote and produced this. He also handled Superbad, Pineapple Express, Green Hornet, and The Watch. There will be references.Of all of those movies, this one is easily the silliest/most over-the-top.Rated R. There is a surprisingly large amount of blood, urine, and demon phallus (google it), soooo...be prepared.Michael Cera deserves ALL OF THE EMMYS for his role in this. He won't get nominated, because BIG MOVIE has no sense of humor, but in my book, he just won all of the emmys.This is a solid, funny flick, that feels like all of the people involved in it thought the whole idea up while being blazed out of their minds at some fancy house party...""Hey, you know what would make a GREAT F***KIN MOVIE?!?

A unique take on the apocalypse,"Hollywood has made millions out of dramatizing the pending apocalypse, but what if the apocalypse were to happen in Hollywood itself? Like, for real.Well, Seth Rogan and Evan Goldberg think they know what it would be like and, in ""This is the End,"" they've gathered some of the industry's hottest young stars - James Franco, Jonah Hill, Jay Baruchel, Danny McBride, Craig Robinson, and Rogan himself, all playing themselves - to illustrate it for us.The question is: how do these guys - who get paid mega-bucks to essentially play at make-believe all day - do when confronted with a real-life crisis, one designed to test their mettle and their basic humanity, in which courage, heroism, self-sacrifice, quick thinking and dexterity with firearms may be the keys to survival? Turns out, just about as well as the rest of us mere mortals would. And that's the kernel upon which Rogan and Goldberg build their affectionate satire, as the boys hunker down in James Franco's pad in the Hollywood Hills to try and ride out biblical doomsday in all its high-tech/CGI/matte-painted glory.The filmmakers capture the pampered movie star lifestyle with canny accuracy: the orgiastic partying, the drinking and casual drug use, the conspicuous consumption, rampant self-indulgence and egotism run amok. Is it any wonder, then, that none of these Hollywood types are deemed worthy of being sucked up in the rapture, but are instead left behind to fend for themselves and to think long and hard about why they couldn't go with all those other good people? And are they truly past redemption or is there some way to still make amends for a life poorly lived so that they too can take that light beam shuttle to the sky? In addition to the leads, fellow celebrities Michael Cera, Emma Watson, Mindy Kaling, Paul Rudd, Rihanna, Channiing Tatum and The Backstreet Boys make cameo appearances either before or after the cataclysmic event.Deftly blurring that fine line between fact and fiction, this super-meta movie features fun, self-deprecating performances and a sly and knowing script laced with amusing parodies of sci-fi/horror and action movie clichÃ©s.Clever and amusing.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
is this really worth watching?,"I avoided trailers, interviews and even posters.

Most underrated comedy of 2013,"It blows my mind that the majority of initial reviews were 1/10 when this was one of the most enjoyable and re-watchable movies I've ever seen. I understand that a lot of the wrong people went to see it expecting a more general audience friendly movie since it had mega stars, but if you can't take a dick joke or 2 and you say ""the f-word"" this might not be the movie for you. I can't help it wonder if this movie was bombed with bad reviews from someone with multiple accounts, because I really enjoyed this movie.I liked the atmosphere that comes with being trapped in a house with the apocalypse happening outside and I liked that they made fun of themselves the whole movie. I also kind of like that a lot of people hated it.I didn't find any of it offensive or over the line where other people did, so maybe if you have a ""over the line"" sense of humor, are hard to offend, aren't expecting a generic Hollywood formula comedy, and specifically liked ""get him to the Greek"" you might love this movie. You may not laugh much, but there's a potential to be highly entertained in this mildly crude and eerie atmosphere apocalypse comedy gem.i give it 9/10 and I rarely even give great movies an 8. I reserve 9 for movies that are 1 number from the best movie of all time, and this IMO deserves a 9!How can the first 30 reviews be mostly 1/10 but this movie is still has an above average rating?",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Worth watching at least once.,"This Is the End begins like most of its stoner/sex/gross-out comedy cousins. (You can read our take on Superbad or Pineapple Express for a quick reference.) Only in this case a gaggle of a-list Hollywood comedians and recognizable entertainment pretty peopleâ€”from James Franco and Seth Rogen to Emma Watson and Rihannaâ€”all play ""themselves"" as they wallow in booze, drugs and casual-cool sleaze.About 10 or 15 minutes in, though, this seemingly formulaic foul flick gets twisted: The ground starts shaking and splitting open, cars crash, people scream, fires rage and the party's Hollywood locale is quickly transformed into a netherworld of rancid smoke, demonic beasts and open sinkholes to hell.It's a surprise genre blending that springs from a 2007 short called Jay and Seth vs. The Apocalypse. Never heard of it? Well, that's because it never saw the light of day beyond a rough-edged YouTube trailer. But that was not the end, as we now can clearly see.The special-effects-laden end result of turning that short into a feature is Â… unique, with ""Is there a God?"" ruminations and the supernatural rapture of believers getting mangled and mashed up with graphic nudity, lengthy arguments about masturbation and ejaculation, drugged-out binges and rapid-fire f-bombs.A postscript: The Los Angeles Times is reporting that directors Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg were actually expecting an initial NC-17 rating for this movie. And that they ""didn't just expect their raunchy Judgment Day comedy to be slapped with an NC-17 ratingâ€”they secretly planned on receiving the adults-only rating. Â… Acting on the advice of distributor Sony Pictures, Rogen and Goldberg intentionally larded the film with a few sexually explicit frames that they felt certain would shock the movie ratings panel and result in an NC-17 mark."" Then they were reportedly planning to snip out a few of the most offensive segments and re-submit for a more marketable R, raking in free publicity along the way. But the result was an R rating right out of the gate, with no edits required.According to the Times, ""The decision stunned Rogen and Goldberg. 'All the ratings stuff doesn't make sense in the first place, but this is like ludicrous,' Goldberg said. Added Rogen: 'We actually made it even a little worse than we wanted and that version got approved. Insanely, we didn't have a ratings issue.'""",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Utter rubbish,"One obvious question such a movie endeavours to answer is: ""how bad can it really get""On the surface, the finest of younger Hollywood are part of its credits, although in retrospect how that came to be raises some very uncomfortable questions.It all starts with a get together, where two friends join a Hollywood style party one of whom is not keen at all. The party gets under way and seems fun until the end of days commences that very evening. As the intriguing (being ironing) story unfolds, it turns out that Satan in the form of a giant charcoal statue with a sizeable p..., commences Aramgedon.This synopsis tell it all. Poor story of particularly bad taste, with ample of tackiness similar to a B horror movie, to the point I found myself wishing they could all just evaporate so that I could leave and head home.In all fairness they were some amusing scenes and decent one liners but could do nothing to salvage this rubbish of a movie.One thing I will not get over, is how such a cinematic junk got the most known younger Hollywood to take part is a question for the ages. Some of the cast, I have a lot of respect for although a massive question mark now hangs.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Apocalyptic bromancing,"First off, I have to say I'm fully behind a film like this in principle. Friends got together and convinced a studio to back them goofing around, being themselves. Is there an element of self-satisfaction about playing yourself? Yes definitely. Is it crass and stupid in spots? Again yes. But I like the loose structure, the fact that you can tell a lot was improvised on the spot. That they play themselves as stoned geeks who are in a geeky sci-fi movie about the end of the world, intending it for an audience of likeminded geeks.And yet it doesn't fully satisfy. It's in the nature of improv that not all of it will pan out, not talking about a few flat jokes here. It's that they can't help being bros, not very imaginative. Putting monsters in there doesn't count as imagination in my book. I just think they could have pushed themselves more, gone out of artistic comfort zones, fooled with their selves, done more with the hallucinations. I guess part of the joke is that they can't act and are really playing variations of themselves each time, something mentioned in just the first scene. You can even see that a lot of their improv is pretty bad, lots of smirks they can't hide. Or does that make it good?Am I salivating at the prospect of this movie done by Korine? Just an extended party montage at the house. You bet.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Amusing bit of fluff,"The premise of this movie is terrific: Celebrities play themselves in a comedy about the end of the world. It's fun to see celebrities mock themselves, particularly a coked up Michael Cera, and much of the charm of the first scenes is simply seeing actors play with the concept.I enjoyed the movie, but I can't say I loved it. It's funny, but it's not hilarious, and while the bits build and there is a sort of story, it's not fully developed because it's essentially a vehicle for the humor.Also, the frat boy humor just wears thin. This movie is inordinately fond of jokes involving bodily excretions and genitalia, and what can be outrageous and edge in the first ten minutes can feel like a dead horse as the second hour commences.It's nothing anyone really needs to watch, but it's a fairly enjoyable way to kill a couple of hours.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
This is the End is Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg at their craziest and I like it,"This Is the End is written, directed and produced by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, in their directorial debuts. The film centers on fictionalized versions of its cast in the wake of a global biblical apocalypse. Seth Rogen, James Franco, Jonah Hill, Jay Baruchel, Danny McBride, Craig Robinson, Michael Cera and Emma Watson among many other actors.I'll keep this review short. The film's theme is clearly about friendship, Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg succeeds in bringing that to the screen in this crazy and raunchy comedy. If you love the actors you will absolutely love this film. The writing is actually really good, smart too. I didn't expect the writing to be this good but these guys never disappoint, I love their collaborations and it's so nice to see the chemistry between them. Let's talk about the jokes, they are good but not as great as other films but it's the execution that matters here, the chemistry and the cast's energy makes the jokes land when they aren't super funny, but I laughed quite a lot and found myself enjoying every scene. This is the End is extreme but in a good way, Seth and Evan are at their craziest in this hilarious yet odd film.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Hilarious,"I honestly have no idea why this movie received such hated reviews. It was soo hard to watch this movie without laughing! Okay, maybe the second half of the movie dragged on a bit but it still had a lot of funny moments. I know this is a bold statement but the movie is 10 times better if you're already a fan of the actors/comedians. Jonah Hill was perfect.. plus the way everyone portrayed themselves how they would really act was brilliant. James Franco even stated in an interview that it was intentionally aimed at making fun of actors being so used to everything handed to them that they wouldn't know how to conventionally act in a natural disaster, or even an apocalypse for that matter. I don't know.. I guess some people don't have a sense of humor or expect way too much from a COMEDY.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"I can see why people dislike it, but I enjoy it","I can see why everyone dislikes this movie in one way or another, I mean I personally don't find stoner comedies that focus solely on getting high to be funny, but with this movie having only one or two instances (Brief instances) of that I felt comfortable.The humour in this is juvenile sure but you have to remember that the audience for the movie is older teens to young adults which is the biggest selling point to the creators with references to sex, porn and drugs.Now the actors themselves are great, especially Michael Cera in his short role, Jonah Hill and Craig Robinson stole the movie for me. Their characters were so well performed and hilarious that every time they said something I was cracking up.The only parts I didn't like were Danny McBride, because I found his acting too over the top and too much of a jackass, and James Franco simply because he just felt too much like a pompous *beep* with anger issues, that simply makes me cringe every time he shouts or argues.Now I know some people will argue or disagree with me, but I'm just writing up my own opinion of the movie which I found to be very enjoyable. Not the best movie this year, but certainly one of the top 10 so far.I'll give it a 7.25/10",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Hilarious, if unbalanced, skewering of Hollywood","First things first, this is a gory movie in a very camp unrealistic way. So don't take the kids to it (do I even have to say that? yeah I guess I do these days).The jokes center around drugs, absurd situations, booze, farts, sex, and more drugs. So on the surface it's pretty immature. Though if you like that kind of humor you need look no further as it's done well. But there are a couple things that make this movie worth a deeper look.First, the whole theme of the movie is satirizing the self importance of young Hollywood stars. There's a reason the apocalypse happens to them. It's a quite brilliant setup that they manage to work through the whole movie.Secondly, the ensemble improv acting of a bunch of real life friends playing alter-universe versions of themselves is a hoot to watch. There are some moments presumably due to the improv where scenes don't work quite as slick as they could but this isn't a tight plot driven movie. Overall the effect is that we've been invited to hang out with them while they just have fun making a movie. I love that when that happens but some people may not, it's a taste thing.And the endless cameos of current young stars are a treat, particularly Michael Cera's bit part of insanity. However, Craig Robinson and Danny McBride steal the show here. They exude comedy in every scene they are in, whether deadpan or mugging.As I said the movie is not without it's flaws. It does drag a bit here and there, some of the scenes could use tightening and joke pacing is hit or miss occasionally. For all that though I recommend it for fans of the absurd like Hell Baby, another partly improv'ed recent comedy.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Meh,"I'm not going to be ridiculous and give it a 1 out of 10, claiming I would have given it zero if it were possible. It wasn't THAT bad. It was certainly fairly average, but not utterly disgraceful.That said... there's nothing new or even slightly clever about This Is The End. Not sure why I went into it thinking that was even a possibility, but I guess that was my own fault.It's basically a whole bunch of show biz buddies 'n' celebrities crammed into one movie without any reason for it, and very little humour to otherwise justify it. These guys have done some decent stuff in the past, but half a dozen or however many films later of pretty much the same thing over and over and it's pretty tired at this point. Bringing in some more friends and adding some fancy special effects doesn't really do anything to spice things up. But I guess they've raked it in, and they'll do it again once they figure out the next thin disguise for what will essentially be the same movie yet again.If you like this kind of thing no matter how many times you see it done over and over, yeah you'll no doubt like this one too.",4.0,Anonymous,Comedy

An unexpected joy,"We all know the comedy formula by now - obnoxious man-child goes about  his business until a life-changing event (i.e. a girl) teaches him the  way of the world so that we gradually learn that he's really quite  sweet after all. It's a clichÃ© fully embraced by silver screen comedy  megastars like Ben Stiller, Will Ferrell and Jack Black. Audiences,  clearly comfortable with predictability, flock to see their hugely  profitable films, because, as bad as their movies tend to be, they are  still lovable actors. Judd Apatow and his entourage of actors -  although they have made their fair share of bad movies too - seem  unsatisfied with simply offering the same thing over and over again.  First-time directors Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen here give us a  strange and dangerously self-indulgent end-of-the-world comedy with  some of Hollywood's most famous offering themselves up for lampooning,  resulting in a Marmite movie that I believe is the funniest of the year  so far.  L.A.-loathing Jay Baruchel arrives at the airport to be greeted by his  lifelong buddy Seth Rogen. The two go home and smoke some weed, and  eventually head over to James Franco's new Hollywood mansion for an A-  list party. Baruchel doesn't want to go because Jonah Hill will be  there, and Jonah is apparently an a**ehole. While Rogen mixes with his  new Hollywood buddies, Baruchel mopes on his own and watches Craig  Robinson sing 'take yo' panties off!' with Rihanna. But as Baruchel and  Rogen go to the store for some munchies, beams of light suddenly start  sucking people up into heaven, and the ground below them starts to  open. It seems the Rapture has passed them by and the apocalypse is  upon them. Holed up in Franco's mansion as demonic monsters prowl  outside, they must survive starvation, Emma Watson wielding an axe, an  exorcism, and most of all, an uninvited Danny McBride.  With disaster movies opening every other week these days, the vision of  the apocalypse brought by Goldberg and Rogen is actually rather well  done. A coked-up Michael Cera, who is previously seen receiving some  oral assistance in a bathroom, is given a particularly gruesome death,  while the likes of Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Jason Segel and Paul Rudd  are sucked into wormholes in the ground. It would seem obvious to most  normal people as to what these idiots need to do to escape their  predicament, but they are far too self-absorbed to realise. It's funny  how aware these actors are of their public perception, and they fully  embrace it. So Rogen is ribbed for playing the same guy in every movie  and is practically always seen with a joint in his mouth; Franco is the  robe-wearing, art-collecting 'pretentious nerd' (as McBride labels  him); Hill is subtly creepy; Robinson is just an extremely nice guy;  and McBride is psychotic and selfish. Baruchel, it seems, is the only  'normal' one, completely untainted by Hollywood.  But the point here is not that Hollywood is evil or that Hollywood  corrupts the soul. I don't really know what it's about, but at it's  centre there is the relatable story of lifelong friends that have grown  apart, but are still desperately clinging onto that special bond they  share. And it is this that makes the film so engrossing. The humour is  as bad taste as you would expect (at one point, Franco and McBride  threaten each other with ejaculation), but it's the emotional core that  dilutes all the cock jokes and gives the movie such much-needed  humanity. It won't be for everybody, and some of the general  strangeness will go over a lot of audience's heads. Goldberg and Rogen  have clearly seen far too many movies and therefore throw everything  but the kitchen sink at the film, but I found this a completely  unexpected joy, and an original one at that. Although it gets a bit too  ridiculous at the climax, the end note will have a big part of the  audience screaming with pleasure with a cameo or five by some  unexpected guests.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

HK Auteur Review - This Is The End,"First off, I want to say I am a fan of the Judd Apatow team. Before Judd Apatow made The 40 Year Old Virgin and Knocked Up, I wasn't really into the American comedies that were dominated by Ben Stiller, Will Ferrel and Vince Vaughn. The improvisational nature of Apatow's comedy and the crude sophomoric jokes infused with a heartfelt message hit me on a deeper level. As a lover of buddy cop movies, I'm also generally a sucker for bromance movies, of which I would argue is a close relative. Most of all, I like Apatow's cast of actors. Seth Rogen, Jonah Hill, Danny McBride, Michael Cera, James Franco... they're all funny in their own idiosyncratic way and seem to have free reign over their own personas.This brings me to my first critique of This is the End. The central gag of having the actors play themselves isn't as funny as the film thinks it is. For example, This is the End's version of Michael Cera is a foul-mouthed cocaine addict. Why? Because the filmmakers thought it'd be funny to do a total reversal on Cera's real life persona. That gag is only truly funny if we know what Michael Cera is like in real life. Most of us, unlike the filmmakers, can only drawn upon Michael Cera's timid on screen persona. That creates enough of a contrast to elicit laughs and it does. However, the filmmakers are ultimately more connected to the joke than the audience can ever be, and that is problematic on some level. I get the feeling I should be laughing harder than the film is making me.Just to reiterate, I did laugh. There were times when the celebrity gag won me over. I liked how the character relationships were set up and they all have great chemistry. Jay Baruchel plays the audience's avatar and reacts to all colors of obnoxious behavior exhibited by the other actors. Actually, the film even takes it one comedic step further. When Danny McBride enters the film, he does his brand of obnoxious behavior that happens to be so overwhelming, the other annoying actors call him on it and ask him to stop.When the film doesn't rely on the celebrity gag and gives something for the characters to do to survive the Apocalypse, it's much more creative and funnier. I liked the graphic novel-like style that went into the world creation of the apocalypse. Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg deliver some surprises to what's going on outside James Franco's house. The parts in between that didn't pertain to surviving the Apocalypse are strung by improvisational dialogue scenes and they stick out as the weaker moments. I recognize the ability to improvise scenes and be funny on camera, but watching the cast react to the fantastical elements was more interesting than watching the celebrities react to each other. As the audience's avatar, Jay Baruchel ends up being outnumbered as he is the only genuine likable character in a cast of six. So for somebody isn't already warm to these actors, they easily come off as very unlikable. And that can get taxing rather quickly. The writing isn't doing enough to build enough character for the cast and the film is completely reliant on what we know of these actors and their past works.Due to its leaning towards it's own self-referential quality than being a apocalyptic survival film, This is the End is ultimately a fan film for the Judd Apatow audience. (Think Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back for Kevin Smith's Viewaskew Universe) If you never liked any of the comedies from the Judd Apatow team, this movie isn't going to convert you. If you don't like none of these actors, I'd tell you to just skip it altogether. I am part of the Apatow audience and like these actors, and even with that, it felt like watching one gigantic inside joke.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Spreads a Misunderstood Notion,"My problem with this movie other than the vulgarity was the surprising but flawed theme(not reflected in score). Many will say its just a comedy movie, however, there is a disturbingly popular misconception. Christianity is different from every other faith and religion itself because it is not about what you do, but what has been done for you. It is the acknowledgment that eternal life is not achievable through man who is naturally sinful. When one truly understands and accepts this it creates a change in the heart that leads to ""good"" deeds. However, God calls even our righteous acts ""filthy rags"". Also, the assumption that only ""good"" people go to Heaven leaves no hope for people that have done wrong, which we all have.

Maybe about 15 minutes too long and a few too many penis jokes for my taste (and I'm an 18 year old guy) but it was entertaining in a year of bad comedies and makes you what to be a better person (if only to survive the Apocalypse). Rogen and Goldberg show they can direct the hell out of a movie, and not just the comedy scenes. There are some genuinely frightening scenes in this film and they are executed very well. Just overall a fun film and goes to show a film about celebrities hanging out can be funny for audience members, too (here's looking at you, ""Grown Ups"").",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Terrible at trying to relate to common people, but funny as heck","Starting off the movie is incredibly slow. Over the first 20 minutes or so we are subjected to watching a bunch of successful drunk and stoned idiots, and they like to make that very apparent, enjoy the perks of wealth and fame. That's irritating for me. I've worked hard my entire life and don't get to go out and buy a 3D large screen television just so my friend can get high and play video games when he visits (That's an actual scene!). They spend a lot of time talking about how they want to make more movies so they can get drunk/high and hang out and be funny while making cart loads of money. They hang out a party filled with celebrities in a very luxurious house and we find out the owner is an idiot and just a bad person all around. They are supposed to be playing themselves and if that's true then I HATE them as people.However after that, it quickly ramps up and is actually pretty funny. It sometimes stretches jokes out too far or gets too dumb, but over all the movie is actually really good. Aside from the beginning the only other complaint I have is the end. They try to shoehorn in some of the worst morals ever and then follow up with the worst green-screen running effect I've seen recently and a completely unimaginative ending and jokes about how they like getting high and partying.If you just cut out the entire beginning scene, it's just Seth Rogen and a friend running to another friends house when the apocalypse starts, which is fine. I don't need any back story on why you guys are friends or exposition that goes out the window once survival is on the line. Cut out the last 8 minutes and it's ending on a perfect note. Remember, just because it's a comedy it doesn't have to end with a joke especially when it takes you 5 minutes to get there. I can't tell if it's padding or just bad writing and editing, but this movie was very close to being amazing if not a bit short.I won't give it higher marks because it's just so infuriating and I don't think that Seth Rogen could even comprehend why it's not entertaining to see complete failures enjoying so many luxuries and being able to party and get high all the time. I get it. You're rich. Now stop rubbing it in my face.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

The plot is provincial, the dialogue juvenile and this mindless attempt at comedy is loosely based on satirical spoofs of a couple of horror classics and frankly is an insult to average intelligence. The urge to warn viewers who admire these actors ""compels me"" to write this review.

freewheeling craziness,"It is a film so stupid that makes you doubt that it is clever ( ?) The question remains of how everything is intended or unintended . Certainly the idea is original and intelligent to interpret the role of the actors themselves, that is a group of Hollywood actors involved to get high as they could at a party super- kitsch , when the apocalypse comes . The two authors Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg , along with Judd Apalow , carry on for some years a type of teen comedy - demented , which is added in this case a portion of the John Belushi's catastrofism. The great Belushi had , however , for his neurotic character , a note of self- irony here is much less noticeable . There is a total identification being spoiled , selfish , superficial . The childishness irremediable , the actors - characters put out in front of the drama of the end of the world , it is absolutely convincing enough to make me think if by chance they are not really so or this is rather an indication of directors are directors or to be childish ( complication : Seth Rogen is both an actor and director), the fact is that throughout the movie I had no doubt that these people are more or less so in reality. Doubt reinforced by the fact that Emma Watson ( Hermione Henry Potter ) is also present in the role of herself and instead has a behavior quite ""normal"" for the situation , quite different from the others, that look like real idiots . Having created this effect of ambiguity seems to me already an extraordinary result ( pure craziness : the artist - not the zany character - seems insane without being one ) , only that it would be worthwhile to see the movie . For a good chunk of the movie you do not know what will happen , and so far its ramshackle vulgarity is tolerable , with moments of comedy in my opinion failed. Then when the voltage has to find a solution, the story slips into banality. The finish is so obvious and silly as to be almost irrelevant. An experiment challenging but ends in a caricatured .",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A film lover's film,"This is the End does to raunchy comedies what The Cabin in the Woods did to horror films. It's a slick, subversive, wholly vulgar film that embraces its roots and emphasizes on the crudeness its actors are known to amplify. And amplify they do; this is one of the raunchiest films I've seen this year and also one of the funniest.This has been a bad year for comedies; there's simply no other way to slice it. Mainstream comedies suffer from the ""maximum antics, minimum laughter"" formula, and all of them seem to take on over one-hundred minutes with only roughly fifty minutes of solid material. Just a few days ago I reviewed Rapture-Palooza, a dead-in-the-water comedy about the apocalypse and a young couple defeating the Anti-Christ. That film's obsession with vulgarity and raunchiness way senseless and gratuitous. It could be said that This is the End features vulgarity that is gratuitous as well, but it certainly makes better use of it and finds a way to incorporate the excessive swearing to great comedic effect. Rapture-Palooza did it in a way that felt like a group of twelve year olds that just found out a slew of four-letter words.The film's story is basic, but viable; it stars Seth Rogen, Jay Baruchel, Jonah Hill, Craig Robinson (who was unfortunately victim to both Peeples and the aforementioned Rapture-Palooza this year, and Danny McBride who join James Franco's lavish home for a house-warming party. All the actors play simplified, egotistical versions of themselves as they party the night away along with many other actors from Michael Cera to Rihanna. Out of the blue, the Apocalypse sets in, sinkholes form, things explode, etc, and the group of actors find themselves stranded and left to fight for themselves in the face of chaos and violence.Many of us have likely seen some of these actors in other films. Seeing them all together, not playing characters, but themselves (regardless of how unrealistic they are) is simply a terrific concept. Similar to, yes, The Avengers, the large group of comedians joining each other on-screen feels welcoming and pleasant, but also slightly contentious as they seem to try and one-up each other constantly. Not to mention, they are a boiling-pot of narcissists, which shockingly works at the comic flame of writers Rogen and Evan Goldberg. I just hope we're laughing at stupid archetypes and not authentic portrayals.One catch with the film that didn't seem to be marketed in the trailer is that this is a film lover's film. This is a picture that is very self-referential and extremely satisfying to someone who has followed mainstream comedies in the last six or seven years. The references to movies past, the brought-up possibilities of sequels, the hilarious banter between cast members, and the terrific in-jokes only some of the audience will understand truly make this a fanboy's comedy. As someone who has paid close attention to comedies of the last few years - what with the huge rise and success of R-rated comedies that pack in hilarity and humanity - this was an enormous delight.And the talent certainly helps too. The always likable Seth Rogen and James Franco play terrific goofball stoners, the underrated Jay Baruchel does some great work with his outgunned/inferiority-conflict, Jonah Hill never disappoints as usual, Craig Robinson, finally, is recognized as the fun and lively comedic talent he is, and Danny McBride is simply hilarious in the role of the lame-brained slacker who can't do right. In addition, cameos by Michael Cera as a sex/coke addict and Rihanna are a laugh-riot.Ultimately, the excursion is rewarding and fun. Its two hour run time may seem flabby, especially considering when the Apocalypse starts to really ruin the lives of the main cast it becomes a bit humorless and redundant, but the dry sections are mere minutes while the laughs are uproarious and surprisingly constant. Directors Rogen and Evan Goldberg (writers/directors of Superbad) brilliantly hold their ground and balance everyone's comedic talent wonderfully. The entire product is light years more durable and serviceable than the average Apocalyptic-fare. I think the second people I'd want to spend the Apocalypse with besides my family are these guys.Starring: Seth Rogen, Jay Baruchel, James Franco, Jonah Hill, Craig Robinson, Danny McBride, Emma Watson, Michael Cera, Rihanna, Aziz Ansari, and Kevin Hart.

Entertaining...

Lacked ambition,"This Is The End was certainly the most anticipated comedy of the year, and if the movie is rather enjoyable, it also disappoints a bit. The pleasure it gives revolves mainly around the crazy atmosphere prevailing within this large group of actors and the delicious dialogues that form sometimes very funny scenes. Unfortunately, the problem lies in the plot, because with such a promising premise, one could have expected something a lot more refined and a lot less confined than this unexpected behind closed doors trip at James Franco's. The linearity of the story and the final outcome, a bit sloppy, just emphasizes the relative disappointment. This lack of ambition is unfortunate because ultimately the movie turns out to be pretty entertaining.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

The beginning does not promises much but you can stand it, but as soon as the aliens or whatever was that happens it's the worst piece of crap Hollywood spit out on a long time. This movie lives from the names of the actors, and nothing else. It's not funny, rather dumb and it's dumb on a all new level of dumbness.

Even better than expected,"So I was excited about this movie, but I had my doubts. There were a lot of things that could go wrong. There is always that dilemma about how to act as ones self. However, I thought the acting was nearly perfect. They were normal enough to make it believable, but extreme enough to be hilarious. Obviously Danny McBride probably isn't as nuts in real life as he was in this movie, but he was believable, I believed him.All the characters personalities fit together so well and there was so many moments in this movie. You can relate to your own group of friends in ways and its just a really good movie. The special effects were also much more than I expected for a comedy.

Hype killed the beast.,"After being hounded by a friend to watch this movie for a couple of weeks I gave in and watched it with him last night on the heels of McGruber, a film I'll never tire of that supplements the perfect humor for its genre of comedy. This is the End was sadly, a disappointment.A stellar cast of some great funny guys, Danny McBride, Craig Robinson and Michael Cera. Thankfully James Franco, an actor I prefer in his dramas, was a highlight like his other comedy dishes, Pineaplle Express and Your Higness. Main casted Jonah Hill,m Seth Rogan and typically Jay Baruchel, were, in my opinion, horribly bad and should probably never go without a script as some obvious improvisation scenes dragged to the point of painful. Anyway, here's the plot.Set as themselves, the six mains are set to live it up at Francos art decor super house with the arrival of Jay, Seth's seemingly good friend and fellow Candianlite. Things go bad to worse as the party falls through, this is a pun as a giant hole from Hell appears in the ground in front of Francos home as he hosts LA's apocalypse to massively erected demons to hell hounds and an axe wielding Emma Watson.It was a shame for myself as the jokes were endless but just were too weak, generic or perhaps not to my style. Most Danny Mcbride, Craig Robinson and Emma Watson scenes were by far the highlight of the film. I also found the gags best worked when bounced around by some of the acts but nearly none really was as hyped up to be.I give This is the End a 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Another American 'comedy' that fails miserably.,"I don't know what it is with American comedies these days but the majority are beyond awful and this ranks near the very top. They joke in the film about each other's careers (as each 'celebrity' plays themselves) but the joke is on us; the viewing public.The fact is most of these guys haven't released a decent film between them. Seth Rogan plays himself which is more less the same character he plays in every other film and it's not funny. The rest of the cast are equally as bad. These are supposed to be the 'new breed' of American comedy actors but if this is the best they have to offer, I'll look elsewhere for my laughs.The only time I did find myself laughing was literally because it was so bad it was funny. I'm sure some of the ""smart"" fans will be quick to tell me that was the point of the film but I fail to accept that as excuse for making such a terrible movie.

Buy this movie,"From beginning to the EndJonah Hill, Seth Rogen, Jay Baruchel, Craig Robinson, Rihanna, James Franco, and Danny Mcbride. The setting to This Is The End is the end of the world, the type of film is a comedy/adventure.In the beginning of the movie Jay joins up with Seth at the airport after a little under a year, then Jay and Seth go back to Seths house, after a few hours, Jay and Seth go to James Franco's house. After Jay gets excluded, Seth and Jay go to a store to get some food and drinks. Then all of a sudden there are blue lights that suck people up into the sky. As Jay and Seth run back to Franco's house, there is mayhem all around them. Out of no where a giant sinkhole appears and there are many casualties.One aspect of the movie I like is the reality of it, the filmmakers did an outstanding job filming this movie. The reality of something like this happening is very real. I out of everything mostly like the credibility, you can tell that a lot of money has gone into make up artists, film production, and many more aspects of the movie making process. The plot of the movie was also outstanding, how they have more than one movie, in This Is The End I believe it extraordinary.The most fascinating thing was the background music/sound, it was utterly phenomenal. The way they set up the tracks/songs to what was going on in the movie could not have been any better, if I may say so myself. The music was set up throughout the movie based on the events that were going on such as, the crackling of fire, the sounds of the demon animals walking around, the sound of the lights from heaven coming down, it was all around fantastic.My overall reaction to the film was great, I loved this movie from start to finish. It had it's up's and down's but, overall it was an amazing, well put together film. my recommendations of this film would be teens 17+ and adults.

Runs out of steam in 'The End',"At first it's amusing to watch these various actors and celebrities have fun with their persona's and public image, but it quickly snowballs into a series of self-indulgent skits and inside jokes before finally running out of steam by the third act. How funny you find these shenanigans will ultimately depend greatly on your affinity for the main cast. If you didn't like Seth Rogen playing Dale Denton in 'The Pineapple Express', then chances are you won't like Seth Rogen playing Seth Rogen either.This isn't the kind of film that will hold up well upon repeat viewing, but as a one-off time waster it offers up just enough laughs to be worthwhile.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

A Totally Polarizing Film!,"""This is the End"" is a fantasy pipe dream about what will happen if the end of the world happens in LA just when a party is happening at actor James Franco's house.This movie gathers James and his real-life gang of friends Seth Rogen, Jonah Hill, Jay Baruchel, Craig Robinson and the most raucous, brashest and biggest a**hole of them all, Danny McBride. There were several cameos from several stars, like Michael Cera, Rihanna, Paul Rudd, Emma Watson, and Channing Tatum in scenes you simply have to see to believe it.They all look like they had a lot of fun as the script (if there was one) took them for a grand ride from one movie genre to another. There is disaster, horror, action, sci-fi, and, heaven forbid, even religious! Of course, above all, there's the comedy.Comedy, of course, is in the eye of the beholder. This movie has some of the most insulting, crass, green, off-color, dirty, sacrilegious, drugged, misogynistic, offensive spoken and physical jokes of all time thrown at you mile a minute. If you are the sensitive type, you might even walk out of this rambunctious mayhem even before the half way point. However, if you are of the majority of their young fans, you will be laughing out loud all throughout its running time!I am finding it very hard to rate this movie. I admit I was laughing at a lot of the outrageously hilarious stupidity being shown on screen. However, I have to admit some of those jokes were really low blows. I just blame it all on Hollywood crudeness. This is a polarizing film you will either really enjoy or totally hate.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Even the souls of comedy actors can be redeemed,"I had a lot of fun watching the film, as Hollywood actors face The End of Days. The plot is deliciously simple: a party in L.A. turns sour when the Apocalypse ends the world and a bunch of moderately famous actors, playing themselves, are stuck in a house awaiting a rescue that will never come.If you are amazed of how many well known celebrities are participating in the cast, know that as partying gives way to panic, most of them die in the first quarter of the film, leaving all but six people to play the rest of the film. Petty and fussy weaklings that they are, the Hollywood actors start to lose their civilized patina and show their true color, turning on each other. I especially liked how Seth Rogen - who wrote, produced and starred as one of the lead characters - started as a nice guy, but turned up to be a duplicitous coward.The is the End joins a list of films (mostly written by Canadians so far :) ) which are original, funny and have ingenious scripts. Perhaps the sexual jokes and weird behavior was a bit over board, but then we are talking about people from L.A., so it might even be realistic. I think the scene I liked best was the failed exorcism which almost worked, but for the friends that were afraid the demon would get annoyed.I would have loved more action from Emma Watson, who has grown into a delicious young woman with an equally pleasant British accent, and could have contributed with a bit of that English wit. I liked how the actors were not afraid to play heavily caricatured versions of themselves, just look at Channing Tatum. He had a lot of guts playing the part he did.All in all it was an entertaining comedy, especially if you know the actors involved from other movies. I even found myself laughing out loud at some scenes. You should watch it, I think.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

The laughter was almost from beginning to end. Honestly, the end is kind of why this film didn't get a higher rating from me.

Silly... and hilarious.,"A who's who of Gen Y comedy turn out for this offensive, dirty-minded flick that revels in toilet humour, sex jokes and showing off a building-tall demon with massive genitalia. It's completely silly... and completely hilarious. The major drawcard is that everyone is playing (jerk) versions of themselves, which means there are Hollywood references galore and a wonderfully blurred line of what parts of their on screen personalities are real and what parts are fake. Nothing is off limits here; Jonah Hill gets teased for his Oscar nomination, Seth Rogen cops abuse about being a sell out and James Franco's often speculated-on sexual preferences are made even more ambiguous. And that's only the tip of the iceberg. Rogen and regular collaborator Evan Goldberg throw everything including the kitchen sink into the script and they achieve an impressively high hit rate with their gags, only the over-the-top final 20 minutes running dry on laughs. Being the current 'it' group in comedy has its perks too, the cameos come thick and fast in the opening act with Michael Cera stealing the spotlight and Emma Watson further expanding her post-Potter career. This raucous movie is not for all tastes, but inbuilt fans will have a blast.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Satisfying as it could be,"There are not many elements for this film to be significant to others because its basic instinct is to show the audience what they can do with an end of the world idea.

It was just full of actors that I adore. Seth Rogan and Jay Baruchel play both main characters and I did enjoy their whole storyline and backdrop. The party scene was by far my favourite. The comedy was just brilliant. Michael Cera usually annoys me but in this he did provide me with a lot of laughs.The film didn't absolutely annihilate the audiences expectations with the action however with the actors that are chosen they really suit the film and this type of comedy.

This is the End Review,"""This is the End"" is a movie based on a short story titled ""Seth and Jay vs. the Apocalypse"" that one can only assume was concocted under the influence of sensory enlightening drugs. The story involves a group of comedy stars who play themselves as they attempt to survive the sudden onset ofÂ…uhÂ…oh who cares? As long as we understand that some threat has forced guys such as Seth Rogen, James Franco, Danny McBride, Jonah Hill, Craig Robinson, etc. to barricade themselves within Franco's new mansion. This of course provides the majority of the comedy fodder.The actors all play cinematic versions of themselves which I believe provides a comedic charm for ""This is the End."" Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg loosely wrote the screenplay, forcing the actors to improvise a good majority of their dialogue. This functions splendidly in that it allows for guys like McBride and Rogen to fulfill their normal on-screen personalities. And have no fear, the raunchy vulgarity comes full force in a series of scenes involving characters forced to confront each other in hilariously crude arguments.What makes the movie's vulgarity funny and not offensive is that it is motivated vulgarity rather than vulgarity for its own sake. Consider the situation of the characters. They've locked themselves inside a house with limited supplies. Their arguments revolve around their surviving this unknown threat that has attacked the world. Their jokes and jibes come in the context of survival, in which they would say or do anything to avoid their death, or I suppose damnation in this case. It is crudeness with purpose and reason behind it.For much of the film the characters are isolated from the world, in fact the only evidence of the apocalypse we view is reduced to snippets of Los Angeles on fire. But Rogen and Goldberg realize the strength of their script lies not so much in story or plot so much as its characters and their interactions with each other, hence much of what we see focuses on the characters in isolation with each other, in which they claw at each other's throats through crude mockery. Fortunately, there is just enough of both story and plot, which is the key to any successful raunchy comedy. Who cares about the strength of the story in a movie that does not require an intricate plot? As long as some form of backbone exists within the movie to carry the gags, the entertainment factor is there. Much credit for the film I believe goes to its actors, who each deliver performances that deprecate themselves and each other to the point of hilarity, where we overlook perceived flaws involving the mechanics of the movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Pretty Funny, Though May Be Dated","While attending a party at James Franco's house, Seth Rogen, Jay Baruchel and many other celebrities are faced with the apocalypse.If you like seeing celebrities playing caricatures of themselves, this is the film for you. Many of the guys involved in ""Superbad"", ""Freaks and Geeks"" and ""Pineapple Express"" have come together to make a film where their friendship is tested by the end -- and it is pretty humorous.Not everything is great. There are dull parts, and the humor relies on the characters being recognizable (for all I know, these guys will be forgotten in ten years). But some of the lesser roles -- Michael Cera and Emma Watson especially -- are well worth checking out.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Stupidly Funny! 7/10,"Review: I actually really enjoyed this movie. I laughed all the way through it, until the end which was a bit corny, but it didn't spoil the movie. Seth Rogen, who wrote and directed the movie, really did push the jokes to the extreme and it was great to see all of the stars together in one film. I liked the fact that they all played themselves and that they took the pee out of there own movies. The whole monster theme does to a bit too far, but that's what makes it funny. All of the actors put in great performances, and the cameos were great choices by the director. The only downside to the film was the ending, but apart from that, I would love to see the whole cast team up again to do another project because the chemistry was great. I know that this won't be everyone's cup of tea, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. A Great Watch!Round-Up: From the beginning of the movie, I had a smile on my face, and when Michael Cera, who is known for his straight cut roles, plays a coked up mad man, I knew that this film was going to bring something different to the table. Emma Watson was a different but great choice for her part, and even Rihana made a small but effective contribution to the movie. Jay Baruchel's whining did get on my nerves a bit, but if think that was deliberate. The person that stood out from the rest, had to be James Franco who played his part well. I was hoping for a twist at the end, but I think Seth Rogen was trying to bring a moral to the story. You do have to have a warped sense of humour to enjoy the film, but if you have watched some of the casts work, then you will know what to expect.Budget: $32million Worldwide Gross: $125millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there comedies about a bunch of Hollywood actors who get attacked by monsters. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Funniest film of the year!,"This movie is funny, like really funny. As I'm sure you know from the trailers it's a bunch of young Hollywood actors playing themselves as they attend a party at James Francos house and suddenly find themselves in the middle of a biblical apocalypse. The movie works so audaciously well because the events happening although outlandish take themselves pretty seriously. So in essence like Shaun of the Dead it's just a bunch of funny actors playing versions of their real selves dealing with it as if it were really going on. The main ones are James Franco, Seth Rogen, Jay Baruchel, Craig Robinson, Jonah Hill and Danny McBride. Many other celebrities show up for the festivities like Michael Cera ( a scene stealer), Channing Tatum, Rihanna, Mindy Kailing and so many more. Many jokes are made at their expense and it culminates into a bizarre, wild experience unlike anything you've seen before. A smart script and smarter direction compliment the material and although it feels a bit long especially for a movie of this type you'll find it hard to see something funnier or more clever this year! 4/5",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
This Is the End,"This Is The End (Seth Rogen/Evan Goldberg, 2013) One of the craziest films I've seen in a while. Intriguing gimmick, using renowned young actors playing exaggerated versions of themselves, much like in Curb Your Enthusiasm or Extras. We never get an explanation as to why some people are sucked into Hell (seriously, what did Rihanna do that was so bad?) and why some were not. I'm not all that familiar with Danny McBride, but I have followed some of the work of the other main actors over the years.This Is The End (for its first two-thirds, at least) is funnier than I expected. I put off seeing it at first because I couldn't imagine Rogen and Goldberg making a comedy about the Apocalypse starring a bunch of comic actors playing themselves, but they (mostly) pulled it off. The film does sort of lose its way during the last half hour, it must be said. All in all though, an enjoyable outing for its first hour but I didn't find the final scene, set in a certain location, to be all that imaginatively done. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Got what I Paid For and That's All I Ask,"This is not a classic comedy. Let me say this up front.This is a play on what would happen to actors in crisis situation. Lots of arguing, lots of one- upsmenship and a lot of improv. And for me, a lot of laughs. It's a star studded cast, brilliant cameos (that should've been used a touch more) Jay Baruchel and Seth Rogen seem to play the straight characters as opposed to what the the other leads brought, which were more caricatures of their real life personas.Sadly I felt a lot of people lost the plot when they started making less mainstream references to Freaks and Geeks, Your Highness, etc. and only found myself laughing at them (some of these references are a decade old) But it redeems itself regardless with other universal jokes and a surprisingly satisfying ending.All in all a laugh out loud comedy worthy of a second and even third viewing to catch the quick subtle humour.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Ridiculously good,"easy 9 out of 10 to be honest. i know that seems too easy and i do not rate films high often but it had me in tears more than possibly any comedy I've seen full stop. Im a fan of Seth Rogan, James Franco and Jonah Hill so I went with an open mind. You go watch this film and just think in the back of your head that they are not funny people then you will just convince yourself that it ain't funny. But the fact is its brilliant, different and funny!!! go see it and judge for yourself but it truly is a brilliant effort at something completely different and it really did work! want to watch it a second time it was that good! Yes it is offensive at times, yes it is silly at times but so what...that's what comedy is about sometimes and guess what...that's real life so all the people slating it for that reason should stop seeing comedy films because every comedy these days is exactly the same in the way of the type of comedy it is aimed at. It doesn't go too far with anything, and it is dark in some places so prepare for a bit of everything (my girlfriend had to look away in some points) but thats why it works so well because it is so different. I love the way they all play themselves as it really does give you an idea of what life is possibly like when you live there with that lifestyle. OK I'm not saying that it is a documentary and is definitely like that but you never know. The Micheal Cera role was brilliant and all the rest of the cast are brilliant in it, even Paul Rudd who turned up for about half a second!",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

What did u expect??? Really!!,I have never reviewed a film on IMDb until now because I feel like I really must defend this film to all you bible pushers that keep creating fake names so u can lower the rating and trash it!! First of all pet me get this out of the way now I am in no way religious but I don't discriminate against anyone who is. This movie is absolutely hysterical no doubt about it.... The characters are playing themselves yes but exaggerated or made up versions of themselves. One review a man was complaining that Cera is a huge druggie and coke head cause he's playing himself in the movie.... Come on people take a joke!! And for all u people complaint about the rapture and them making fun of it and how it offends u then why the HELL would u go see this movie??? It baffles me cause the trailer hides nothing! My only explanation to this is you must not have seen it and are reviewing a movie because you don't like the subject matter. Well guess what you are not forced to watch it so don't force your beliefs by lying and trying to sway people from this movie because it is very funny and not to be taken seriously!,10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Hilarious and inventively entertaining!,"This Is The End is completely bonkers, and that's what makes it work. This sort of R-rated comedy is usually hit or miss with me overall, and while not all of the jokes in this one hit right (the rape jokes in particular, get to be way too much as it goes on) it's overall, whole satisfying and hilarious. Not only is it hilarious though, but it has an inventive and truly unique concept here for a comedy, one that I can only wonder how giddy these people were when they came up with it. The whole cast does some fine, fine work and they all work as truly unique individuals and characters here, and the climax is truly magnificent. There isn't many other ways to describe how much I loved this film, but it's truly so well done and it's destined to be a cult classic of some sort. Oh, and the final scene with the appearance by a certain artist was, well, shocking!",,Anonymous,Comedy
A very creative and in most part a fun one!,"I hadn't quite read the storyline before watching and I assumed it was a pretty ordinary one, the world was ending and all the main characters who were kind of dumb had to fix it (a bit like The World's End). I was very wrong, this movie was much funnier than I thought it would be! In most parts, very entertaining!I recommend this especially to you who like other Seth Rogen films like ""Bad Neighbours"" and ""Superbad"", cause it's got the same kind of taste. If you're having a nice evening with your friend then absolutely! There are a bit of sexual jokes in it, so if you can handle it, watch it with your parents!I give this a 7/10 cause of its creativity and the big amount of laughs it gives you.

"An honest review for ""This Is The End""","Please, please... bear with me here and read my explanation of my rating below.I must preface my writing with a few things. First, I never wrote a movie review on this website before. Mostly, because I am too lazy to and there are many other knowledgeable reviewers who already do so (and my views generally resonate with the majority). Second, I purposely registered on IMDb to write this review (because it was so bad). Third, I just got back from watching ""This Is The End"" at the movie theater.I first thought my views of this movie was based on my age. Perhaps I am getting old and the new wave of comedic humor is upon us. Perhaps the days of Jim Carrey, Chris Farley, Steve Martin, John Candy, Eddie Murphy, and Dan Aykroyd are way behind us (and that's OK). However..., at age 29, I kinda feel like I'm not missing the boat here.I love modern day comedians like Vince Vaughn and Will Ferrell, but this movie was totally different. It was absolutely awful. I actually laughed (probably the only laughing) at how horrible it was. I almost felt embarrassed how quiet the theater was - embarrassed that these actors consciously made this movie with their reputations tied to it.James Franco has a few very good movie performances, and Jonah Hill was fabulous in Superbad. Seth Rogen was OK in a couple movies, but was an ""OK supporting character"" at best. I'm actually quite surprised that he has risen to stardom (or at least some level) as a comedic actor. Quite frankly, I feel it is pathetic.I recently (last week) heard Seth Rogen on The Howard Stern show. He was promoting this movie. It sounded like a great weekend activity, so I checked the IMDb.com ratings (which I generally agree with), and saw an 8 out of 10. The good thing was, I didn't watch any previews or trailers, so I was excited to go into the movie with any biased (or previous) knowledge of the movie.This movie was horrendous. Honestly. I have seen hundreds of movies and honest to God, I cannot think of a movie that was worse than this one. The acting was awful - forced and not funny. I am one who loves any kind of humor (nasty, graphic, sexual, inappropriate, etc.), but scenes in this movie tried making fake humor rather than creating it more naturally.Is this the dawn of a new generation of comedy? Am I (at 29) already old, and in a separate comedic generation? Is 'forced attempts at humor' the new humor - viewers acknowledging that actors are ""trying to be funny"" and thus, must BE funny? Wow, I sure hope not.In my opinion... unfortunately, I feel the title ""This Is The End"" should be a description of these actors' careers. Again - I love Jonah Hill and others in previous films... but this was embarrassing. Seth Rogen was never really good, so I'm not surprised.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A CavalCade of Comedy,"What would happen if six stars of stoner comedy films came together and were forced to face the end of the world? I didn't know either until I saw This is the End (TITE), a film written by one of these stars Seth Rogen, uniting his buddies from his various films to make what can only be an interesting adventure. Well interesting is exactly what you get with this tale and I'm here to shed some light on the latest comedy to grace the screen.When I saw the poser and trailers for this movie there were two ways I could see this movie going: funny and full of insane, and wacky adventure, or another drug filled comedy where all they do is go from point A to point B and get stoned/drunk upon their arrival. TITE however, decided to mash these two path together to make a hybrid that surprisingly entertained me, though that didn't seem the case at first. Stoner comedy fans will rejoice at the beginning, watching Seth and Jay Baruchel getting hopped up on so much weed you'll wonder how their brains take it. Then head into the party scene where not only do we get to see the cavalcade come together, but other stars make a cameo to show off what may be a reflection of their lives off camera. It's crude, it's cursing filled, and has so many awkward/inappropriate/over the top lines that will have the audience either cringing or laughing their heads off, the former option more for me. Once the cataclysm event occurs, as seen mostly in the trailer, the drugs and booze or shifted down a notch and a new ""balance"" is reached that started to put this movie in better graces with me. So what did I like and dislike then.Let's start with the balance of comedy TITE has. Rogen and company bring all of their styles to the table on this one, with each one playing the characters you know and love. The diversity starts with more drug comedy, that makes our ""heroes"" do some crazy and embarrassing situations that had most of the audience cracking up. Yet before this can grow stale, the movie transitions into curse filled talks about sex and all of its related bodily functions, sometimes leading to overexggarated arguments of two stars shamefully arguing about where they left their mark. For me however, the most laughs came from the parodies and quotes of various movies that are cleverly integrated into the dialog and plot to give the movie some pizazz. Rogen's pokes, or is it jabs at Hollywood productions also had me in stitches, and combined with some well-timed and clever quips there were plenty of laughs to go around that brought tears to my eyes from laughing so hard.Of course with a collection of stars this big playing ""themselves"" you would think there would be some good laughs just from the characters themselves. Yes there were some characters I enjoyed, but for the most part the characters you see are those you've seen over and over again. Seth Rogen still plays that funny looking, and rather plain role that indulges in just about everything he can. James Franco, despite his diverse collection of roles, chose to go back to pineapple express mode and play the selfish jerk causing all the trouble, though he is slightly more in his mind. Jonah Hill plays that very soft toned, strange, and high pitched nerd who trades his attempts to be cool with his attempts to be peaceful, I think. My favorite of the bunch goes to Craig Robinson whose neutral tone, girlish screams, and well delivered quips had me rooting for the solo black actor. Of all the actors, his role had the most diversity for me, playing all the fields without going too far into one area, and without overacting. My least favorite character though had to be Danny McBride though, I've enjoyed some of his movies in the past, but I'm over his filthy dialog, arrogant rants, and perverted mannerisms that make him the wild dude that many like. His character is definitely the most annoying of the bunch and adds that black sheep/ doesn't give a damn edge that the movie needed, but could have toned down a little more.Despite all of these things though there were still some over the line moments that I didn't care for in this movie. Although this is supposed to be a comedic take on the apocalypse, there are some things that didn't need to be shown. Seeing the guys play soccer with a decapitated head and seeing cannibalism at its ""finest"" are just two areas I'm not comfortable with watching. I also don't enjoy the concept of butt, or for that matter, regular raping as well. Sure the awkward reactions of the guys is fun to watch, but the concept penetrating someone in that way is not my cup of tea. Yet the biggest thing at bugged me has to be the visible shots of the devil's penis. Sorry I don't find seeing the male anatomy in all its lava orange/ brimstone gray glory, but that is something I think best left for the adult only films if you like that stuff though get ready to relive the Dante Inferno game all over.Factoring in everything though, TITE isn't a half bad comedy and was a fun idea to watch on a concept vaguely touched in the comedy world. I think the actors worked well together, the comedy stays rather fresh and appropriate, and although not the most surprising plot has a few things that may shock and surprise you. Overall Rogen did a good job making fun of a holy topic in a way that won't get him smite, but for those who are a bit more sensitive on this topic avoid the film. My scores are: Comedy: 7.5 Movie Overall: 6.5-7.0",,Anonymous,Comedy
The Pits of Hell -- or Just Another Weekend in Hollywood,"Whether or not you think ""This Is the End"" is funny will depend almost completely on whether or not you think Seth Rogen and the scruffy, schlubby circle of actors he's become associated with are funny. Because this movie exists as nothing more than an excuse for these guys to roast each other, playing exaggerated versions of themselves in a movie about the end of the world -- or at least the end of L.A.I was afraid the film would feel like an inside joke that I was not in on and that it would be two hours of watching a bunch of guys who think they're cuter than we do -- kind of like a Youtube video with better production values. But that's not the case -- these guys really are pretty funny, and there's enough of an actual story to make the film more than a random assortment of one-liners.Of all of them I like Seth Rogen and Jay Baruchel the most, and they both mostly play straight man to the others. Michael Cera is hilarious in what amounts to a prolonged cameo, and Emma Watson gets a laugh as a homicidal, axe-wielding Hermione.Grade: B+",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Non Stop Laughs,"Although the film had a very thin script, it is full of laughs and has outrageous gags that works in the end for a very enjoyable film. I would not recommend this movie to people easily offended though, for me, the offensive is hilarious. Reportedly Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg (the co- directors) had a running joke on set to see how many people would say ""I can't do that"", Seth was the only person to not say so. The movie provided an interesting insight into a Hollywood party that isn't real but makes you wonder how some celebrities are in real life. For example, is Michael Cera really a coke head that slaps women's butts and has a huge penis(per Mindy Kaling's opinion), doubtful but fun to imagine.At the heart of this film is the bromance between Jay and Seth and to a lesser extent Seth and James. I felt that Jay's character got too bad of a rap for the first 2/3 of the movie. He is described by everyone else as self righteous, to me he just appeared to not enjoy himself but due to this labeling he seems to move into the role later on. Their story is somewhat sad though, watching two old friends drift apart.Some not so great parts. At 107 minutes, the movie felt as long as it was. For Rogen and Goldberg's first foray into directing it wasn't anything special from a direction aspect. The film benefited mostly from the script written by the two and the performances from the group. That it is for parts I did not like about it. It was that enjoyable.I would highly recommend seeing this movie. The laughs are nonstop, the cameos are epic and the movie is somewhat believable in how the cast would react to the apocalypse. 9/10-HaileyEdited by Josh W.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Very funny,"I wouldn't be too surprised if this turned out to be the funniest movie of 2013. It's kind of shabbily plotted, and its final half hour is a tad weak, but who cares when it's as funny as it is. The concept is pretty brilliant: a bunch of dopey Hollywood actors (everyone playing caricatures of themselves) barricade themselves in James Franco's house during the Biblical apocalypse. The six who are left alive: Franco, Seth Rogen, Jay Baruchel, Craig Robinson, Jonah Hill and Danny McBride. Tensions start to rise when McBride, the defacto villain, basically in full Kenny Powers mode, starts eating more than his share of food and wasting water. The film is at its funniest when the guys are just screwing around. At one point, when they're all bored out of their minds, the guys film an impromptu sequel to Pineapple Express. There are some pretty nifty, cheap-looking but fun special effects. The six main actors are all fantastically funny. It'd be hard to pick one out of any of them as the best (well, Baruchel kind of has the straight man role, so one might call him the least good, though he's still plenty funny). Michael Cera, who pops up at the party at the beginning of the film, might be the highlight playing a coke-snorting, woman molesting a-hole who gets his comeuppance in a particularly horrible way. Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg have built up a nice little career as writers (let's forget about The Green Hornet and The Watch). This is the first time they take the helm as directors, and they do a pretty good job. You definitely have to be a fan of these actors to like this movie, but if you are, you'll definitely enjoy yourself.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

So Funny It Hurts!!,"""This Is The End"" is the directorial debut of screen writing duo Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, who also brought us ""Superbad"" and ""Pineapple Express,"" and to be honest, this is their crowning achievement. This movie primarily focuses on a group of comedians trapped in James Franco's house during the apocalypse. Aside from having a great premise as it is, the film's main draw is the fact that all these actors are playing exaggerated versions of themselves, which becomes the basis for some truly laugh-out-loud moments. For the most part, the script is fairly loosely written, which leaves a lot of room for improvisation by the actors. Those improvised sequences are where the film shines, because it creates a sense of camaraderie among the actors which adds a lot to the enjoyment factor. You get a sense that all of these guys are really good buddies just having a good time making this movie, and that's something the film captures really nicely. But above all else, the movie is just plain funny. It is quite often very sophomoric and juvenile, but it never insults the audience's intelligence. For me, every single joke hit hard and made me laugh to a point where my face began to ache! Movies don't get much funnier than this, and the credit really goes to the cast for making this premise work so well. Towards the middle of the film, it starts to feel like it drags, but it picks right up again towards the end that I don't mind. I easily could watch this movie 10 more times, and laugh every single time. I can't recommend this movie enough, I loved ""This Is the End.""",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Flavor(-ing),"The movie is either really tough to sell or you will be overjoyed watching it. I can't (as many who have watched it) the least bit of neutral rating and writing about it. I thought it was funny as hell (pun intended)! But this won't be seen as such by some, because humor is really very specific to people. Things that I thought were hilarious, other people will find boring.The ending, without giving it away of course, will only appeal to certain audiences too. And it's all because of a joke that hit close to home with the actors (and filmmakers I suppose). I was delighted by it, but there has to be some knowledge to get it and even think of it as funny joke. Generally speaking most jokes and the movie itself was made as a labor of love and I'm sure was what Rogen and the others thought of as funny. This isn't Being John Malkovich!

Very dark comedy,"Tropic Thunder, Very Bad Things, maybe The Cable Guy. This was raunchy, vulgar, and graphic; but I expected that. The movie does a great job skewering Hollywood actors. I was surprised to see Emma Watson, I have a feeling she really enjoyed her part. All the actors that played themselves looked like they had fun with their part. Kevin Hart is a great example, he essentially ""roasts"" himself. I think the premise for the movie was, ""what would the viewing public like to see happen to us?"" Let's say you hated James Franco's take on himself here, you might wish for his character to meet a grisly end, wish granted. Franco and Hill both have a couple serious roles under their belt, i.e. Moneyball. I'm not aware of any dramatic movies with Seth, Jay, or Craig.

But there was no creativity with it at all. It was literally the same jokes over and over again just recycled and said in a slightly different way.By the end of the movie, I started laughing at the movie instead of with the movie. The movie averaged about one penis joke for every two minutes. I felt like I was trapped in Ron Jeremy's mind. And then there was the weird religious twist to it. Not sure what they were going for with it, but I am definitely a believer after this film. If Hell is anything like watching this film, I want to repent right now.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy

So Seth Rogen is the same guy in every one of his movies, Danny McBride is jerkier than ever, James Franco is still stuck with memories from Pineapple Express and still thinks he's besties with Seth, and the recently Academy Award nominated Jonah Hill is trying hard to be the nicest guy ever.As mentioned above its an almost perfect stoner movie. This is The End is exactly what you'd expect when Seth Rogen teams up with Evan Goldberg. Its raunchy, juvenile and situational. This is a movie where you'd want to appreciate the idiocy and callowness of 30 year olds running around during a weird scenario. Our protagonists, Seth Rogen, Jay Baruchel, Jonah Hill, Craig Robinson and Danny McBride finds themselves stuck at James Francos house when all hell breaks loose outside and the forthcoming events are nothing short of uproarious. I am sure the cast had a splendid time shooting and the enthusiasm could be felt. The same could be said about Seth and Evan directing them, they did have a blast and it could be seen on screen. The utter stupidity that's smeared through to the end had me in splits. Where in some movies the stars might have emerged as legendary heroes saving the day, you snigger at protagonists' sheer helplessness here instead.There are many scenes where you think the cast was just ad-libbing but you can't help but chuckle at them coz it felt like they were having a natural argument or conversation like they would in real life. Like those repulsively hilarious argument between James Franco and Danny McBride about the cum on a porn magazine. Having played their own exaggerated counterparts, the actors got a real chance at making fun of their own movies. There were loads of references to other movies that as soon as I finished watching it I had an immense craving to watch Pineapple Express and Superbad again, thanks to the mock-sequel that was played in-movie. And then there were the cameos, its just stupendously hilarious how each of them turned out to be.Post the 2nd act it takes on a dark shade but they even managed to make a poke fun at it making way for more laughs. And when you thought it was losing steam, it quickly picks up the pace ensuring even more entertainment. Had those scenes been a bit trimmed, it would have been perfect. I was also a bit put off with the excessive bromance.We're are not unacquainted with movies like this, we'd previously got Shaun of The Dead and Zombieland sharing the same genre. In an industry populated by endless stoner and apocalypse movies This is The End stands out. It carves a niche of its own, inducing a kind of natural comedy into scenarios like this. Much like the ad-libbing cast, This is The End is unpredictable, ridiculously dirty and prodigiously hilarious. Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen has indeed hit pure comedy gold with This is The End.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Comic Brilliance,"This Is The End was hysterically funny at most times, and generally had the audience laughing throughout. Sure there's some rough language, some occasionally tasteless and almost juvenile humor, but it's all in good fun and it doesn't feel forced - all part of guys having a good time and making fun of celebrities. What was interesting was that for a comedy, there was a bit of a storyline, about friendships, about how they can stray and nearly fracture under stressful conditions.All of the actors filled their parts well: Jonah Hill, Craig Robinson, Danny McBride, Jay Baruchel, Seth Rogen and James Franco were great as exaggerated versions of themselves. The actor cameos were great. Michael Cera was terrific as a coked out life of the party, and Emma Watson stole some of the comedy spotlight as an axe-wielding survivor taking on the guys.Overall, a great laugh.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"A crude, self-mocking, hilarious attempt at an overused post-apocalyptic story","Wow. I was expecting this movie to be funny but I never expected it to be as funny as it was. This Is the End is the best comedy to come out this year. It stars James Franco, Craig Robinson, Jonah Hill, Danny McBride, Seth Rogen and Jay Baruchel as themselves. The group finds themselves in a sort of apocalypse while partying at Franco's house.The best part of the movie is that the actors play ""stupider"" versions of themselves. Most of these actors have reached household name status, so it's fun to see them make fun of themselves for our entertainment. They know exactly what their fans want to see and they do it, whether it makes them look bad or not. The funniest bits are when they are making fun of each other or referencing one of their previous movies.The choice of music was selected perfectly for each scene (once you see it, you'll understand). The guest appearances of many well known actors like Emma Watson and Michael Cera add to the comedic effect. The role that Cera plays in this movie is probably his funniest yet.The most surprising part was the storyline, which I was expecting to be the downfall of the movie (as it is for most comedies). The storyline was well-written and went really well with the comedy. There was a good balance of comedy, action, character growth and those emotional scenes. Each of them had to come to terms with what was going on and accept it in their own terms. The plot wasn't mind blowing or amazing by any means, but it worked really well with the movie and the actor's performances made up for the flaws in the plot.Without the undeniable chemistry between these five friends, the movie would have suffered. This Is the End was ultimately about the relationship between these five guys, so it literally depended on the chemistry between the six actors. They are all clearly great friends and great comedians, which is what made the movie so great. The movie takes place mostly in Franco's house, so there's not much going on and it all relates back to the six friends.The movie was written and directed by Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen. They are behind some of the best ""weed-smoking"" comedies that have come out like Pineapple Express and Superbad. The story comes from a short that they both did together back in 2007, along with Jay Baruchel, called ""Jay and Seth Versus the Apocalypse."" Apparently they've been wanting to do this movie for a long time but never really thought it would happen. This Is the End is probably going to become their biggest hit, so far.I highly recommend seeing This Is the End in theaters with a good group of friends. I've already seen the movie twice in the past week and it was still funny the second time. If you love just one of the six mains actors, then you'll probably love this movie.It's worth watching the entire movie just for the last five minutes.This Is the End is a great mixture of comedy, action and spoofs. The entertaining, self-mocking performances of the six main actors makes the movie worthwhile and one of the best comedies to come out in a very long time.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Movie Star Masturbation,"*May Contain Spoilers*I am not a twenty something stoner, let me say that right off. However, I do not need to be stoned to find something funny. I love to laugh and I seek out comedy, and thus, I am open to all types of comedy. I want to laugh. I was hoping This Is The End would make me laugh. It did. Twice. Once when the lady in the convenience store said something off screen no less. And again when Jonah Hill reenacts Rosemary's Baby. That's one laugh per hour. That's not good. Here we have what I guess we could call The Brat Pack for the 2000's: ""The Frat Pack"", let's call them. They partake in yet another ""romp"" wherein they imbibe drugs and call one another effing dix. They all ready did this in medieval drag. It wasn't very funny then. Now, in apocalyptic drag, it's simply abysmal. We're asked to find the Pack playing themselves hilarious in and of itself. One would think self-satire would ensue. It doesn't. Self congratulation certainly does though. Not only in the tone of the film but literally in the dialog as each ""celebrity"" attempts to justify their aww shucks, I'm just good folks down to Earth movie star. Well, if these movie celebrities were such good folks, they wouldn't have foisted this dreck on their fans and movie audiences in general in the first place. You can seriously tell that these guys think gracing the world with their ""comedy"" is to do the world a favor. It's a kind of arrogance that's so delusional and masturbational that it devolves into actual ten minute conversations about the actors masturbation styles. It really would not have surprised me if the actors unveiled their genitals for the cameras and masturbated into the lens. This is not hyperbole: they would have thought it hilarious. It's a toss up as to who comes off the worst in this. It's as though the Pack is competing to see who can be the least charming and most obnoxious. Danny McBride certainly claims this prize. Is he supposed to be today's surly but lovable philistine, a la John Belushi? Probably. John Belushi, however, was funny. Embarrassing cameo? Let's give that one to Channing Tatum. As for what unfolds story-wise we have a premise and nothing else. No creative thought is put into it. The film bogs down for the better part of two hours on one set: five assholes in search of a movie. It reeks of rip-off, this monster improv session with rapidly diminishing returns. Brackish looking, shrill, dark, heavy handed zero fun. Sitting there wondering what the budget went to...paychecks for the Frat Pack, Payola for the movie critics maybe and the rest for marketing.

An Overall Great Comedy,"This is the End was a movie of which my expectations came in somewhat higher than usual, but why wouldn't it? With actors like Seth Rogen, James Franco, Jonah Hill, Danny McBryde and the rest of the stoner clan all together on one screen, one would be reasonable to expect a top notch comedy.The Verdict? It was...good. With a movie that has essentially no plot to it at all, this movie does a good job at keeping the comedy at a high level, while pushing forward to the next point of action without any lulls or dull moments. Every actor provides their own funny moments throughout the movie and no one is left out. There weren't as many gut busting laughs as I thought there would be, but there were also enough laughs all the way through the movie to keep you engaged and laughing most of the way through.Overall, I was satisfied with the movie and thought it was definitely the funniest one of the year (so far). Honestly, how could you go wrong with virtually every funny comedic actor and put them on one screen. If you love comedy, I would highly recommend going to see This is the End.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"Dumb, adult fun","Every once in a while a film comes along that seems to have been made for such a 'niche' audience that I'm amazed it ever found its way into the mainstream cinema. 'This is the End' is one such film. The amount of areas of film and popular culture you have to be into to really appreciate this film knows no bounds. Basically, it's a group of comic actors who have appeared in a string of adult-natured comedies, playing - apparently exaggerated versions - of themselves during a party that happens to coincide with the end of the world.To enjoy this film you're going to have to be okay with adult humour, bodily-function gags, appreciative of the humour of Seth Rogen, graphic violence, celebrities sending themselves up, frequent drug references i.e. 'stoner humour,' have at least a reasonable knowledge of Rogen's (and James Franco, Danny McBride, Jonah Hill to name but a few) filmic career, pop culture, comedy, sci-fi and general stupid movies that only exist to purely entertain and munch popcorn to. If you're into all those, give this one a watch. Luckily for me, I'm - believe it or not - able to appreciate all that, so I thought 'This is the End' was great!I don't know why, but I'm a sucker for actors who play themselves in films and generally lampoon themselves. Here, so many famous faces send themselves up (and in a biblically-apocalyptic setting!) that I was in heaven (assuming that 'blue light' chose me... which it probably wouldn't). There's little to say about 'This is the End' apart from if you're into most or all of the themes I've mentioned then you're probably going to have a blast with this film. I know a lot of people will not like it and consider it a little too 'self-indulgent' from the actors, but I didn't care. You don't need much of a story when then (adult!) gags come thick and fast. Just put your brain on hold and enjoy spotting one cameo after the next.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

There's plenty that's funny here and I'm sure many scenes that would make one say ""OMFG"" and possibly leave during that moment but, really, if you know what to expect and like this kind of ""anything goes""-type humor at its most disgusting with a mix of some religious discussion, This Is the End should be right up your alley.

Funniest Movie of the Year,"""This is the End"" is very easily one of the funniest movies I have seen in my entire life. It worked for many reasons. I absolutely loved how the characters were put in the drastic situation so that they were at their peak of crazy and acted out, bringing out their true characters, literally. The way that each character played an over exaggerated form of themselves made for great humor because they were able to poke fun at the media's image of themselves, and it made it feel like you were joking around with a few friends the whole time. Once this was established, it was able for the funniest lines in recent movie history to pour out one after another. Lets not forget the funniest exorcism in movie history and the surprisingly hilarious two minute discussion of ejaculation. The cameo of Michael Cera was the funniest cameo in recent memory. This review is getting sloppy, but just know that this whole movie is worth the price at the theater to see it with an audience rolling on the floor laughing to get the whole experience.

"The chemistry of the cast, strung with the improvised dialouge and laugh out loud scenes is a refreshing relief from samed tired slapstic comedies","The story begins unpredictably, where actor Seth Rogan picks up fellow friend and actor Johnny, Jay..(?), never remember his name, and soon join like actors at a wild festivity at James Franco's crib.The cameos made by Michael Cera and Rhianna are the most memorable, but the seemingly forced addition of others come off as unnecessary and irrelevant to the plot. Eventually, chaos erupts and the apocalyptic fun begins.The star cast: James Franco, Jonah Hill, Seth Rogan, Jay Beruchel, Craig Robinson and Danny McbRide, are what really make this movie so good. Supposedly, 50% of this movie was improv, and the realism felt in the dialogue create a genuineness impossible to create in any scripted film. Also worth mentioning is Emma Watson's small role, and the story behind creating her character. Apparently, Seth Rogan questioned her character because he felt that it might seem ""rapey"" with her being the only female in a house with five guys. His comedic choice to incorporate this uncertainty in the film was genius, and somehow completely works.My main criticism would focus largely on the artificiality of the props and the gore. It would be a shame to see future films cross more into what I can only describe as gore humor, similar to that of the Scary Movies franchise.All in all, Seth Rogan and Evan Goldberg's auteuristic homage to late 80's to early 90's comedy films is a refreshing relief to the same tired slapstick movies tagged as comedies to come out in the past 10 years. The chemistry of the cast, strung with the improvised dialouge and laugh out loud jokes and scenes, is a genre I look forward to seeing more of.6.4/10",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"""This is the End is one of the funniest movies I've seen in quite a while - the last one being Ted (2012)""","A few days ago I saw This is the End, released on June 12, 2013. This apocalyptic-comedy flick stars contemporary movie actors like Seth Rogan, James Franco, Jonah Hill, Jay Baruchel , Danny McBride, and Craig Robinson as fictional versions as themselves in the aftermath of global apocalypse. The film also stars in a supporting role Emma Watson (the 23 year old English actress, who was well known for her role as the female wizard Hermione from the Harry Potter film series), Michael Cera , Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Paul Rudd, Jason Segel, Rihanna, and Channing Tatum as fictional versions of themselves. Most of the actors that star in the film are, of course, mostly modern day comedic actors. Both Seth Rogan and Evan Goldberg wrote and directed the film. Speaking of which, here's a fun fact: Seth Rogan said that ""the party scenes were the most stressful for me to direct because there was so much going on"".Just as Wes Craven's awful slasher/horror film, New Nightmare (which was released on October 14, 1994), This is the End stars people as themselves. The plot of This is the End starts off with a Canadian comedic actor Jay Baruchel, arriving in Los Angeles to visit an old friend and actor Seth Rogen. Seth then invites Jay to attend a housewarming party hosted by James Franco where they find other celebrities like Jonah Hill, Michael Cera, Craig Robinson, and Christopher Mintz-Plas.At the raucous party, there is drinking, drugs, sex and other questionable acts. While the party is still going on, the global apocalypse begins. So, the movie stars like Seth, Jay, Danny, Craig, and Jonah decide to remain with James Franco at his house.""This is the End is one of the funniest movies I've seen in quite a while - the last one being Ted (2012). The humorous acting and writing is in great part what make the film so hilarious. One example is Danny McBride's well timed remarks: ""Hermione stole all of our sâ€”t"". But if you're wondering what makes that so funny, you will have to see it for yourselves. Seth Rogan and Evan Goldberg did an awesome job writing the screenplay's funny one-liners.This is the End has an element of a horror-comedy genre. The horror comedy genre actually perfectly fits into the movie because it makes the film hilarious and suspenseful. In what is probably the funniest scene of the movie, Jonah Hill is shown possessed by a demon (same scene in the television commercial for the movie). That scene recalls to two classic exorcism-horror films : Rosemary's Baby (1968) and The Exorcist (1973). I really appreciated how that similarity pays tribute to the classic exorcism-horror films.Although the movie is good, the one disappointment is the ending. The physical moment of the ending just didn't really fit in. The ending also didn't take the film seriously. If you are at all curious about how the movie ended, you all have to see it for yourselves. Disappointing ending or not, the movie is still worth watching and paying for in the movie theaters.106 minutes of the film was overall very funny due to the acting, jokes, and one-liners.

Crass sexual, drug related humour replaces British sarcasm and cynicism. Silliness throughout, with a little bit of sentiment thrown in. Similar to the Hangover in terms of a group of old friends learning about each other and a couple of exorcisms. 1 actual and more of self realisation and forgiveness. In no way a cerebral movie.

Something Fresh I Think We All Needed,"It's the kind of movie you into either thinking it will be different because movies so often shy away from rather dark titles, or know it will be different because you know the comdedic artists behind the movie and how solid their earlier work is. It takes off like a jet, taking a minute to get going, accelerating to a good roar, then really kicking in the afterburners. You can really feel the inspiration throughout most of the movie, only really slowing down from the steady whirr near the end, which can honestly be attributed to the nature of the movie's plot. I can't say I would have done it any other way, but artsts are artists for a reason, so it does leave a feeling of an unfinished movie.Now, even though I would not recommend most 7/10 movies because I'm so picky, this is one of those movies that can comfortably get by with a little bit of stagnation because of how relatable the characters are. You simply can't help but feel a lot of the same panic of the more knowledgeable character in the movie, or the general fear and hopelessness of the other characters.

"The end of the world, stoner style.","'The Is The End (2013)' is a comedy in which a variety of comedic actors - including Seth Rogan, Jay Baruchel, Craig Robinson, Danny McBride, James Franco and Jonah Hill - portray exaggerated versions of themselves as they try to survive the literal apocalypse. It's a mixture of absurdism, dark humour, satire and self-deprecation. The celebrities aren't afraid to poke fun at their public personas, mixing the uncomfortably close to home with the wildly left of field, and this 'real life' aspect adds some flavour to what would otherwise be a relatively standard story. Having said that, the story is still fairly barebones. It's not all that important in the grand scheme of things, serving only to put its characters in an apocalyptic situation that pushes their relationship to the absolute limits. It's good enough for what it's trying to achieve, and the flick features just enough character development to feel relatively substantial. The most important part of the picture is its comedy. Thankfully, that element is really successful; the affair is often really funny and, even when it isn't, it's always enjoyable. It features some surprisingly believable special effects, too. Ultimately, it's an irreverent and rib-tickling comedy with an absurd premise and entertaining characters. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Depending on your sense of humor, I'd either suggest this or tell you to stay as far away from it as possible. There's more cuss words used and sexual jokes than I can even count, so if you're modest in the mind I definitely recommend you don't waste your money as it will offend you.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
I don't wanna die at James Franco's house,"This Is The End is a 2013 apocalyptic fantasy comedy that follows a group of actors who are stuck in a house together during the end of the world.Written and directed by Seth Rogan and Adam Goldberg, This Is The End is a very wild comedy that takes some of the best comedic actors of today and amps up the volume to 100. It stars a fantastic All Star cast that plays over exaggerated versions of themselves and throws them into a hilarious state of panic when judgment day, is brought upon the world. It's as raunchy as you would expect coming from the creators of Superbad, and entertaining enough that you won't be able to look away from the ridiculousness that issues.If you're a fan of any of the actors involved with this movie, then you will definitely not be disappointed.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Wow this cast,"Hysterical. An awesome new idea for a movie to star actors playing themselves or exaggerated versions of themselves. Fun premise and story. A lot of surprisingly cool scenes. So many rofl moments. All-star cast of the best comedians. I love how they made fun of themselves. All the cameos are awesome, frequently making fun of themselves as well.

I think its time we talked about the elephant in the room..,"A lot of people hate this movie but I just rewatched it for the third time and It gets better every time. Some of the comedy is just so relatable and so damn funny. I remember when just the idea of liking and going to see this movie when it came out just seemed cool. Jay Baruchel was about my age now when it was made and I can relate to his character quite a bit. I also love horror more than any other genre so for me, this is kind of a horror spoof movie. Its not a comedy/horror, it's a horror/comedy since the overall plot is horror based. The weirdest horror/comedy at that. The CGI is also exceptional for a movie like this. I expected it to be all hokey but it was rather impressive. I recommend this movie to teenage boys everywhere who havent seen it yet. It's before the current teenagers time as it was catered to my youth but it's still perfect for any era of high schoolers. I give it an 8 out of 10stars for laughs, good CGI, and for just being overall cool",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

One of the most stupid films I've seen,"I read a few positive results for this movie, and decided to give it a chance, especially because it was rated as comedy. I must say the only smile I managed to produce was when the film was over. I guess the relatively high score of this film is because it gets reviewed by people who like this kind of humor.For me it was total boredom. It is a mix of adolescent-type movie with warm friendship feelings, reunions, whatever. It starts silly and evolves into total nonsense. In summary you spend most of the time with the main characters yelling around because something is burning, falling down, or chasing them.Even Eurotrip was more fun than this crap. Avoid it at all costs.",2.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"It is just not one I can say I liked, all things considered.","Mediocre middle hinders.'This Is the End' adds some uniqueness alongside the standard apocalyptic fare, the mass cameos are amusing and the fact that the characters are playing exaggerated versions of themselves is a good touch. The apocalypse elements are done well enough, though the bits at the start are where it peaks.The middle of this movie dragged a fair bit for me, I didn't really find it all that comical; the beginning, again, has the most amusement, as well as a fun end piece featuring that Floridian boyband. This is based upon a short film, so I guess it was always likely to feature lull moments - after all, Seth Rogen type flicks do tend to play off quite thin premises anyway.Speaking of Rogen, he doesn't actually stand out that much here, surprisingly. To be honest, none of the cast really do all that much, come to think of it. I wouldn't even say there is a star performer onscreen, which is disappointing given the big names involved.All in all, not necessarily a terrible picture but it is just not one I can say I liked, all things considered.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Only six of them are left hiding in Franco's house.These are friends and it shows. They are hilarious together. They are playing their alternate selves like the great comedian each one is. There's a surprise short funny cameo by Emma Watson. Michael Cera is insanely ridiculous. Danny McBride does a hilarious douche character which is completely his on screen persona.

Best Apocalyptic Comedy Ever,"A new comedy classic has arrived in Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg's masterful creation, This Is The End. The ultimate apocalypse movie with too many celeb/pop culture references to count, this is a film that can easily be considered the comedy of the year. Check out my full review.James Franco is having a huge party at his place, and all his best buds are in attendance. Jay Baruchel is with his best bud Seth Rogen, but he's not big on the party scene and really isn't feeling much like staying. When the two take a trip to a store to blow off some steam, the apocalypse comes in terrifying fashion, complete with demons, rapture, hellfire, and sinkholes.Going into the movie knowing very little about what to expect, I adored every moment of This Is The End. The direction is stellar and the music selection is comprised of tunes you won't soon be able to get out of your head. The six lead actors play off each other and every other actor to make an appearance in the film delivers, sometimes mocking themselves in highly memorable fashion.For the first third of the film, Michael Cera kind of steals the show as a coked-out crazed version of himself, slapping around Rihanna and getting blown in Franco's bathroom. My favorite cameo comes by way of Channing Tatum, who clearly has a sense of a humor and has cemented my respect by appearing. There is also a certain boy band that cameos at the very end, bringing back a familiar 90's tune and ending the film on a high note.More than the cameos, there is a ton to be said about the phenomenal performances from the six leads. It's difficult enough to maintain consistent character arcs, story, and one-liners with one two characters, let alone six. There is no clear stand-out among the group, as they all fight for the the title on more than one occasion. James Franco is super laid-back and obsessed with Seth Rogen. Jay Baruchel is best buds with Seth and has trouble trying to live with the rest of the crew. Craig Robinson tries to stay on everyone's good side. Seth Rogen is the same lovable character you'd imagine him to be in real life. Danny McBride is hated by everyone and causes a major rift amongst the others with his outlandish behavior, annoying none as much as he annoys James. Jonah Hill is overly nice to everyone around him and always sticking up for them. Throw these six people into one house with little food and water to spare during an apocalypse. What's the worst that can happen? Each actor seems to have a blast digging into each other and more than one joke is made at the expense of films they have done in the past.This is a technically very well-made film as well as being solidly acted, and there are lines you will be quoting for days to come. I want to see it again, immediately. I still think I prefer the original title (Jay and Seth vs. The Apocalypse) but I'm totally okay with the new one as well, as it pretty accurately portrays the somber mood and gives you a hint of the darkly perfect comedy.The horror elements of the movie are done very well and easily stay in sync with the comedy elements, which come fast and fresh. Once you hit the faux trailer for Pineapple Express 2, it's clear that This Is The End isn't slowing down any time soon. This is a movie to be remembered for years to come. Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg are my heroes. This Is The End is the best apocalyptic celebs-playing-themselves horror comedy you're ever likely to see.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Apocalypse Farce,"Beyond the comedy that can be expected from laughing in the face of an imaginary survival situation, the jokes are entirely consistent with the typical roles of each of the actors in their other movies. They play themselves in the film, so if you don't like Seth Rogen's jokes in any of his other movies, chances are that you won't like him here either. If you do think that Jonah Hill's aggressive sarcasm and Craig Robinson's ironically-timid big-black-man attitude, then you will definitely laugh your way through.Don't be fooled by the trailer. Unfortunately, most of the celebrities that aren't in the main group of 5-6 actors don't have much screen time.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A Resurgence for Rogan and Pals,"Five years ago, the Hollywood movie scene was in love with Seth Rogan and his band of unconventionally lax co-stars. In the time that's passed, the comedy group has put out more misses than hits. Fans were clamoring for the guys to get back together and work on projects that included the familiar faces that made films like ""Knocked Up"" and ""Superbad"" so hugely successful with movie-goers. And after half a decade, our dreams have come true, as Rogan, Franco, Hill, McBride, Robinson, and Buruchel come together in this dream-team apocalyptic comedy. We're even lucky enough to see the likes of Michael Cera, Jason Segal, Paul Rudd, & Christopher Mintz-Plasse.But you have to get past the 'wow' factor of all that star power. After all, it sure didn't help films like ""Valentine's Day"" in terms of quality. Actually, more often than not, it can do a lot to hinder the quality, and what you're left with is a miscast, over-budgeted film with less-than-desired character development and screen time that's unevenly distributed for the sake of getting the biggest names involved a good chunk of the spotlight. This film really breaks the mold.This is the End not only delivers us the very best of this generation's biggest comedians, it also brings something very original and unique to the table. The film stars each actor as themselves, and takes us to the world of fame, fortune, and Hollywood partying. Jay Buruchel, not a fan of the wild, fast-paced Los Angeles lifestyle, visits the city to spend time with Seth Rogan, who's adopted the scene as his own through his success in recent years, along with some famous new friends. Buruchel is reluctant to go to a big Hollywood party at James Franco's house, but goes anyway as a favor to Rogan.This film portrays the two main characters the way you would expect them to be in real life, which is great because it won't take you long to invest in the characters if you've followed their respective movie careers closely enough. The other actors all have a unique twist, (with the exception of maybe Robinson) which is also good because it shows the men in a new (usually hilarious) light - and provides a bit of suspense in discovering new sides to very familiar shapes.The acting is great for what the movie is. It isn't phenomenal, and you shouldn't expect it to be based on the silly premise of the movie and the catalog of performances by each of the film's main characters through the years. This film provides some of the best comedy I've seen since the 'golden age' of last decade though, and it's downright hysterical.Having said all of that it's nothing groundbreaking in the world of comedy. It's definitely something new, and breathes new life into the comedy careers of the main stars of this film. The nostalgia is incredible on top of that, as most fans of these guys have been waiting a long time to see them paired up again in some fashion or another. For many like myself, hope of seeing something as funny as the movies that introduced all of these stars to the world of comedy was beginning to fade, and a lot of us began to wonder if they had lost their touch and played all of their best cards already. This film not only debunks that, but it makes two things vividly clear - Rogan needs to write more of his own movies, and these guys have plenty left in the tank.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

ADULT COMEDYUpon looking at the name ""Seth Rogen"" on the credits, one would have to expect his name to be synonymous with many gross out and rather embarrassing humor one may not want to admit in real life, but can only be shown in a movie. And this movie is expected to consist to have that and more, including the likes of other actors such as Danny McBride, Jonah Hill, James Franco, Craig Robinson and Jay Baruchel who co-wrote, co-directed and co-produced with Seth Rogen since they were playing themselves- sort of. The set up has Jay just visiting his friend Seth in LA, and after awhile, Seth manages to convince Jay to attend to James Franco's new expensive house who happens to be throwing a party. And it's not soon afterward, the apocalypse were to happen, leaving James Franco's new house as one of the houses left standing stranding whoever is left inside. This entire set up is only an excuse to showcase many crude jokes and never before seen embarrassing situations one wouldn't do in real life if the world is really going to the end. Because I remember scenes and images, I managed to recognize some embarrassing situations from the long syndicated show ""The Simpsons"", and some acknowledged movie references especially from ""The Exorcist"", which is nothing like I've ever seen before. The movie is rated R for a reason and that there's a reason why it's given that rating for many young kids are going to be incapable to understand it. Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Emma Watson, Mindy Kaling, Michael Cera, David Krumholtz, Paul Rudd, Martin Starr, Rihanna, Channing Tatum, Kevin Hart and Aziz Ansari also have some memorable bit scenes as well.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
this film is like poison in your consciousness,"I went to see This Is The End thinking it will be silly and funny, judging by the trailer of the film. However, experiencing the film last night was like one long bad trip, and an unfunny, too, I must add! Most if not all of the film's jokes revolve around perverted sexual references, drugs (esp. Marijuana, of course!), and gore/violence. The film was completely tasteless and uncreative, and it does not deserve 8/10 on IMDb. The people who LOVED it, just like the actors. I have no problems with the actors. They probably could have made a much better film. The writing is poor, and so the result is mediocre. In any case, go see the film and judge it for yourself, but watching felt like being inside the mind of a mentally ill person who watches PORN or plays violent VIDEO GAMES all day while smoking WEED and snacking on junk food. I can go with Peter Sellers or Monty Pythons any day for silly tasteful comedy.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy

For the Cheech & Chong crowd. Period.,"This movie clearly appeals to a certain demographic - and from reading the wildly differing reviews, it's clearly misunderstood by people who should not have walked into the cinema to begin with. There's a way to offer differing opinions without being morally insulting to the creators or to those who appreciate it, though. Simply put, Seth Rogen and this particular troupe of actors have a very specific ""green"" following. This movie was never meant to appeal to everyone. It's unabashedly for a crowd that indulges in some of that organic greenery beforehand. If you've seen any of their previous movies, then you know that going in. If you haven't, well, then you made an unfortunate mistake. One doesn't walk into a Cheech & Chong movie and then complain about the amount of marijuana without sounding a tad naÃ¯ve.To begin with, this is a social commentary on the drugs and debauchery and vanity of Hollywood - and the self-centered actors who probably feel largely invincible most of the time. To criticize the movie for satirizing these things only proves that one don't understand satirical comedy. In fairness, yes, the jokes are likely only going to land with an audience that is just as stoned or drunk as the people on screen, and that's because the plot is written like a bad trip. That's the whole point! What makes a good movie is being able to take your audience along for the ride. And in this case (as with many others) Rogen knows that there are millions upon millions of people out there who like to watch movies (his and others) stoned. Being high for this is like being a rollercoaster drop that never ends. It's insanity as soon as the action starts unfolding. The inebriated audience feels just as lost and panicked as the cast while it's happening - and that's what makes it great, while you're going through it with them.The plotlines are surely the reactions of people who have lived a largely vapid existence and do way too much partying to really know how to deal with what's happening. But that doesn't make the creators or the audience members who appreciate it lesser human beings. Some of the backlash has a very conservative and judgmental undertone, which is totally unwarranted and unfair. To each their own, I say. But at least give credit where credit is due. Some of the most influential geniuses and prolific artists/creators in history (if not all of them) indulged in various vices and you're kidding yourself if you believe otherwise. That's not to say that I'm calling Rogen and company geniuses, or that this movie is a historical classic... but I'm not entirely ruling out that making fun of themselves for the debauched people they are isn't also worthy of some respect and admiration. They managed to give their pot-smoking audience a really great trip, knowing they'd be totally high going into this. They took us on a ride along with the cast, in a sense making it interactive because the cast was as stoned as we were.They movie doesn't tell you to get high first. That would be unethical. But it's implied when you see who's in it and who made it. You don't have to be high to watch it... but you definitely understand the intensity and the mind-numbingly awkward conversations if you are.All in all, the bad reviews seem more about general discomfort with the subject matter than an actual critiquing of the story or the plot - and that can be whittled down to an unprepared audience member walking into a movie they had no business seeing if they hadn't smoked a joint first. It's probably safe to say that if you like your greenery when you watch a movie, then you'll probably enjoy this experience. If you're sober, it's not really meant for you. This is not Frozen. This is an audience tripping out to a cast who are themselves tripping out at the end of the world. Maybe there is something genius in that.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

It's a load of colourful sh*t.,"I thought I would always love comedies featuring Seth Rogen / Jonan Hill / James Franco for example Pineapple Express, Superbad, Knocked Up ----- I kept that belief until now.This movie is a HOT MESS, it is so bad that I feel offended. First off Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg had never disappointed me once before and I've always admired their brilliant and funny storytelling, but I guess they were high when they wrote the story this time. Most of the plot doesn't make sense at all. Second, boring sex-oriented jokes filled the film. Yes sex-oriented jokes are funny most often but the director shockingly made all of them so tedious throughout the 107-minute film. I laughed 3 times during the film, that's it. Ultimately the biggest flaw in my opinion is it doesn't have a clear theme. I believe theme is the soul of every film, and it holds true even for comedies. In Superbad it is the bromance friendship and in Knocked Up it is new-dad love and responsibility run through the whole film subtly and make us laugh and touched simultaneously. That's the missing crucial part of this film â€“ I don't know what kind of theme the film is trying to deliver. Unquestionably it is the most stupid 10 bucks I've ever spent.I'm guessing you folks like the film only because of the cast. But let's face it, just by having Rihanna, Emma Watson, Channing Tatum on the cast does not justify a 7.8 out of 10, really.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Apocalyptic Insanity,"The most obvious thing you will know about This is The End is it's an apocalyptic comedy with its stars playing themselves. It sounded like a gimmick for them to just have fun in the midst of destruction. While there's dope tripping and endless vulgarity, the film is surprisingly able to find its own heart underneath the craziness. But of course, this is all about joining the survival of these popular comedians as they mess around the situation. There are kinds of audiences that will enjoy this very much, while the rest of the viewers may also tag along only if they can. But really, this movie is so likable no matter how crude these people can be.Predictably, the plot fills their usual thing: slapstick, constant phallic humor, and more drugs; plus some humorous gore, inside jokes, and apocalyptic mockeries. If you're a fan of this kind of comedy, then definitely you'll get a limitless joy within the disasters. But the film is funnier when the cast is simply making fun of themselves by trying to find a way to survive, like making stupid decisions and cry for their hilariously unreasonable complains and demands. Since that's whole point of this, I guess it succeeds as the best part of the film's humor. Even inside James Franco's house is as chaotic as what's happening outside of the end of the world. It's pure insanity.Besides of its ridiculousness, the film actually has a story in its characters. It mainly focuses on the friendship of Jay Baruchel and Seth Rogen. Their bromance at least gives this insane apocalypse some sense which keeps the experience from being a completely vapid outrageous comedy. It's not the most compelling one either but it adds sweetness through the disasters going on. The cast sure loves mocking around, but the other side of Baruchel calms the idiocy down a bit and gives most of the heart of the film; while Seth Rogen and James Franco do their usual comedy part which is pleasurable enough to watch. Craig Robinson and Jonah Hill also had some memorable laughs. And finally, Danny McBride steals all of his scenes.This is The End is nothing more than a self-indulged fan service, but it somehow succeeds for being smartly dumb and at least makes it up to itself after the endless amount of crudity. I mean imagine, what's better than an apocalyptic movie starring Bruce Willis or John Cusack? Definitely an apocalyptic movie starring a bunch of high on pot manchildren. And both do have in common: it has self-redeeming characters who make preposterous ways to survive. The difference is this is a comedy. All of the stupidity is indeed in purpose, almost like spoof of the genre without referencing much about its other movies. Well, self-awareness is always respectable to everyone. Anything else, This is The End is a fun time at the movies. It actually lives up to its promise, and it seems a full scale of ridiculous is already enough for this to be a solid entertainment.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
I walked out before the end.,"Seriously. I'm amazing how this movie got such high reviews overall. Yes, many people realized it was trash (good job), but others thought it was the equivalent to a comedy sent down from above?? I saw this pile of manure at the theater and walked out with my wife and got our money back. The manager didn't seem to surprised and quickly refunded our money.Why was it so bad (as in not funny, stupid, idiotic, etc)? For starters, it made any of the Scary Movies seem like they were written by nuclear physicists. If you like draggy, unfunny, gratuitous lewd scenes with blood and tasteless (not funny or exotic) sexual references, scenes that you just wish would end so you go get to something interesting, combined with drug references in a very worthless script then this movie is JUST the right movie for you.Finally, the preview doesn't even come close to representing what this movie is really about.The other odd thing, is that there were so many high ratings? It makes me wonder if Seth's friends hired a bunch of kids to pad the database to make the movie seem like it's really worth something more than toilet paper.But then again...this is just two peoples opinion. It's up to you if you want to take a chance. If you leave quick enough you may get your money back too.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Chix Chat on Film: Funny as hell,"This is the end of the way I view a film as a comedy. I experienced some of the funniest and some of the most disturbing situations imaginable in this film that played out one possibility in biblical proportion of how the world would end. The fact that everyone used their own names made the story have a realism about it that even further played into the comedy. I don't typically associate special effects with a comedy, but this film had some pretty good effects going on with the hell mouth sized sink holes, the rapture and the devil-dog. I was rather impressed that they weren't SyFy channel fodder, which is typically hard to swallow. The majority of the jokes were potty humor and there were an excessive number of phallus symbols, skeet and penetration innuendo, but the raunchy jokes won laughs even though some came with a bit of a grimace because it is somewhat embarrassing to admit. Who would have imaged the apocalypse as a situation comedy? Obviously Seth Rogen, who is the co-writer and co-director, he played the story straight and even takes a jab at his own acting prowess. There were quite a few talented entertainers in this story and many of them also played into the areas that have characterized their presence in Hollywood. Michael Cera comes across as this out of control drug abusing, womanizing whiner, which is the antithesis of every role that I have ever seen him portray. And the slap that Rihanna placed on him for his inappropriate behavior simply cracked me up. In all honesty, I know that the situation with Danny McBride was making fun of Magic Mike, but Channing Tatum was just done wrong. Good thing that he is obviously secure in his manhood, but he did use his actual name. This film was just plain funny, and one scene that made me laugh out loud, that I don't think others in the theater quite understood was when the elderly lady responded as to why she had placed a sign in her establishment. I could hear that I was the last person to stop laughing at that bit. Who would have thought that you could leave an apocalyptic film, feeling good at the end? Obviously Seth Rogen, the musical ending had me moving in my seat with a smile on my face, which was just the icing on the cake. I give it a green light.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Comedy?,"This is the end........of comedy.About 10 years ago I might have found this quite funny as it would have been something different to a good mix of comedy for example there were more slapstick or family films to watch now pretty much every film seems to include tonnes of swearing and very little else.There is little or comedy acting on show in this film even though I do think James Franco is a good actor just not a good enough comedy actor.There has been very few films that I have found funny this year and most have this very same problem.I don't mind swearing in any film but it takes more,much more than that to make me and other people laugh check out Beverly Hills cop 1 & 2 for films that had plenty of swearing but had an actor who had great comic timing and fantastic scripts throw in some slapstick mix with some good jokes and that laugh of his and you have a 2 films that were adult but unlike this is the end they were very very funny.",3.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Doomsday has never been this funny,"The new comedy, ""This Is The End,"" is a brilliant parody that shows us how a small group of privileged, self-absorbed Hollywood celebrities would react if they had to try and survive an apocalyptic nightmare.The movie's most brilliant conceit is having the actors all play themselves. It centers on a group of friends who've all co-starred together in various Judd Apatow projects. (Oddly enough, Apatow does not get a producer's credit on the movie.) They're gathered at James Franco's house for a party when all hell â€“ literally â€“ breaks loose. Several recognizable stars perish in the first act, and the survivors â€“ Seth Rogen, Franco, Jonah Hill, Craig Robinson, Danny McBride and Jay Baruchel â€“ barricade themselves inside Franco's ultra-modern Hollywood Hills mansion as the Book of Revelations unfolds outside the front door.These guys aren't used to being even slightly uncomfortable, let alone forced to live without basic necessities like food and water. Seeing these coddled creatures suddenly thrown into survivor mode is fodder for lots of comedy. The bickering over who gets to eat the house's lone Three Musketeers bar is classic. But mostly, the dilemma serves as a jumping off point for lots of wild, raunchy, sometimes surreal laugh-until-you're-gasping-for-air humor. It's a genuinely hilarious film, one helped by the fact he actors aren't afraid to poke fun at themselves and send-up their public personas and previous big-screen performances. After a while, though, even jokes at their own expense get old. Comedies work best 90-minutes at a time. At 107-minutes, the premise does start to wear a little thin.While the movie is about celebrities, at its core ""This Is The End,"" is a relatable story about friendship. The central relationship is between Rogen and Baruchel as they struggle to keep their (on-screen) bromance strong as they grow apart and their careers go in different directions. Rogen co-wrote and co-directed the movie with his childhood friend, Evan Goldberg and their portrayal of friendship feels honest and real, despite the unreal circumstances in which the characters find themselves. (Watching the movie, I couldn't help but wonder if the pair drew on their own friendship for inspiration and if Baruchel â€“ the least known of the actors â€“ is merely a surrogate for Goldberg.) Your friendships say a lot about who you are, and a person's innate goodness and worthiness becomes a major theme. But it's unlikely you'll walk out of the theater reflecting upon any of that. What will probably stay with you are the dick jokes. And I get the feeling that's just fine with Rogen and the gang.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Debauched genius, gets under your skin, sucks you in, elevates.","I am a puritan-born a straight-laced mother-ivy league, clean of mouth, mind and body. I did not expect to like this film, I expected it to be raunchy and frat boy level humor. On 2 out of three, I was correct. It was raunchy, frat boy level humor, but SO much more. And I loved it- I am ashamed to say. Loved it so much I went back again, and might yet again. Here you have debauched genius in the flesh and spirit. These actors masterfully play themselves with such honest realism and also tongue in cheek wit and sarcasm, it defied my expectations. You get to see their flaws in all their vapid childishness and sincerity, along with their sneaky wit and brilliance. This is a deconstructed satire about Hollywood life, full of its juvenile egotism and masquerade's, beautifully and hysterically depicted by people I would have been loathe (until now) to acknowledge as masters of their art. There are running parodies and references of/to other films both classic and not, along with a hilarious belly-button self expose of the California life style. Their ability to make so far-fetched a reality completely believable and even... exciting and fun yet at the same time horribly scary is what kept me hanging on through the darkest (and it got pretty comically dark) of scenes.

A refreshing end of the world story with laughs.,"""This Is The End"" takes what your previous knowledge of what Seth Rogan and Even Goldberg's can do, and completely sets a new standard. The Film is as stated by Rogan mainly ad libbed, but it's so hard to tell because of how good all of the actors truly are with one another. Having a funny script is one thing, but having actors who can better it takes the movie that much farther, and it does just that. A majority of ""stoner comedy's"" have a linear plot with no progression in story, but this has a different take on it. The movie has some emotional toll to it, half due to the story since we've all been in some of the human relationships with friends while the other half is you don't want your favorite actor/character to die, or something bad happen to them.With just one scene coming to mind that is a little to far, all of the actors give an amazing performance with references to their previous works, and a twist in the story in the second half which is almost shocking that the movie took that turn it did. Overall it's a very solid movie with laughs along the way.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Celebrities and drugs are cool and funny,"This Is the End (2013) is a sublime post modern comedy in which all of your favourite celebrities, portraying and portrayed by themselves, do cool and funny drugs and have hysterical hours-long scatological arguments while an apocalypse happens in the background.I was relieved that this film barely focused on the boring premise of real life celebrities enduring a comedic apocalypse. Rather than make use of this premise for wacky and creative shenanigans, this film averts our expectations by being another fantastic Seth Rogen stoner comedy, like every single other film he has ever written.Drugs are really cool and funny and This Is the End spares all of its running time to remind us that drugs are cool and funny, frequently featuring its celebrity main characters engaging in the recreational usage of drugs, because using drugs is really cool and funny. The celebrities themselves are also really cool and funny, and them doing drugs makes them even cooler and funnier, making This Is the End the coolest and funniest film ever made.",2.0,Anonymous,Comedy

My 3/10 rating is generous.,"One of the worst movies I've ever seen, definitely one of the most overrated. As other commenters have stated, I am still trying to fathom the high score it has received on IMDb. It defies logic. There is nothing about this movie that is even in the vicinity of an 8. I smell something untoward going on with the rating system here.The movie reminds of ""Bruno."" Almost just as crass, almost just as offensive, almost just as bad, definitely similarly overrated. I was never angrier after leaving a theater than I was when seeing Bruno about which I complained often about wanting my money back, but I was similarly upset about wasting my time on this movie. Where does one start? To start, it's not a movie. It's some kind of experiment, semi-reality based, semi-scripted. The weak plot takes a back seat to the crass, offensive, juevenile dialogue. There is so much time spent on hearing characters rant about their bodily functions you forget that they are supposed to be in the middle of the apocalypse. When the plot does take center stage, it's clear the whole movie is just as an excuse for the writer (Seth Rogen?) to show off his black book of Hollywood friends. In fact the whole experiment seems to just be an excuse for cameos from random celebrities.Laughs were few and had I not had such high hopes for this film based on the misleadingly high reviews, I would have walked out.

The Avengers of Comedies,"This works both extremely well as a comedy and a horror movie delivering characters I care about, and also some good performances.The stand out performances for me are McBride, Baruchel, and Robinson.

Hill has a funny arc , but is really a side character, and you could completely take Franco out of this movie and replace him with Segel or Paul Rudd who I think would've brought more to the role once again Franco sleepwalks through another movie.No real significant flaws to mention , didn't want it to end definitely a must see for everyone who loves these guys, but if you don't like their humor then definitely don't see it you already know you won't like it.Just For Fun To Nail In the avengers comparisonTony Stark = Seth Rogen Bruce Banner = Danny McBride Thor = Jonah Hill Steve Rogers = Craig Ferguson Natasha Romanoff = Jay Baruchel Hawkeye = James Franco",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

A Lukewarm Horror Comedy - not here nor there,"We learned to expect much more from Rogen, Baruch, Franco and team.

The cast is good as usual, but they do not sustain interest. The intellectual level of the directors could certainly have maintained interest without having to resort to cheap frights during the movie.

While preparing my popcorn I thought I would enjoy a comedy that at least will not make me grumpier of what I was. Well, they proved me wrong. Not even that I could not eat my popcorn but I thought I would not finish the movie. The only reason that made me see the credits is that I wanted to see how far the stupidity of the whole crew ( I am angry not solely with the cast but the writers, one of them mentioned twice, the producers etc.);anyone who was responsible for launching that feature throughout the theatres. I do not how they even managed to win anything. Respect to the game of acting but these young actors represented the opposite of that.

Refreshingly different!,"I was a little surprised to see so many negative reviews of this movie, so I decided to write my own.I am a big fan of pretty much all the main cast members and started the movie with high hopes. And I am happy to say that I was not disappointed!All of the cast members basically play a caricature of themselves, and I really liked that they weren't taking themselves too seriously.Michael Cera surely was a standout, as was Danny Masterson.The story itself has a few nice twists and kept me interested and entertained right through the end.Is this the best comedy ever made? Surely not, the humor is not very deep and there surely are more ""artistic"" efforts out there that the critics here praise.But it is a pretty unique comedy that is equipped with a cast to pull it off, and some truly hilarious moments in it!I'm still amazed why the majority of reviews here differ so vastly from the IMDb score.Anyway, that is it for now.

"Apparently those ""classy"" ones didn't get this","Religious people, of course you're mad but this movie is not only making fun of Christianity it also makes fun of the dumb Hollywood celebrities yet the actors themselves.If you don't get the humor why do you bother to comment or have an IMDb account? Go watch your stupid ""artistic"" movies you don't even understand a thing and show off to your loser friends and have fun in your little worlds, but you can't make a movie like these bunch of friends because you are criticizing all the time and I mean please, you don't have the imagination, duh. Maybe this movie is not a 10/10 but because of those art freaks who they think they are super cool, I only wanted to protest. By the way you extra sophisticated people, these people are way more trained than you and they teach acting classes, just take a moment to consider which one of you known better.About the movie, it was hilarious and I'm really glad that I didn't read the reviews before I watched it. If you are not ""that"" religious you will laugh so hard. In this movie ""The Judgment Day"" is happening while James Franco having a party at his new home at Hollywood.

A near perfect Halloween horror / comedy / stoner movie,"Let me start off by saying this movie is not for everyone. If you cant handle gratuitous violence, nudity, drug taking and generally ripping the p out of the Christian belief system then stay away. If you can on the other hand then this movie is for you. Far too many films these days try to cater their comedy to a larger audience and try to be so politically correct to the extent that it become's clichÃ©d and frankly boring. This film is completely shameless in its delivery of pure unadulterated stoner humour and left me rolling around in stitches laughing my head off throughout at least 50% of the duration of the film. You cant please everyone and it doesn't try to. At times it feels like it goes out of its way to offend certain people and the thought of those people getting offended while watching this film only serves to add to the hilarity. What also impressed me was the quality of the horror, it will lull you into a false sense of security and there are plenty of jump out your seat moments. The only films you could compare this to are something by Quentin Tarantino and I feel that the Seth Rogan crew gives even the master of shock horror / comedy a run for his money.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Predictable and immature comedy,"This movie is terribly predictable and the dialogue didn't have enough wit for me to enjoy most of it.

It's not like any other film I've seen, full of pop culture, gore, disgusting humor with a freshness that just kept me watching. I won't give too much away but where by design or accident the film also has a strong message and this gave the film the backbone to keep me interested to the end..

A huge disappointment from talented people with a great idea and a big pile of money,"First off, I'm not just someone who is negative for the sake of negativity. My review is not based purely on my personal view on this, but also the movies content and overall comedic effect from a neutral point of view.'This Is the End' has a lot of great potential to be comedy of the year. The cast and the overall idea for the movie are screaming 'success' at your face! But you should never leave a big bag of money in the hands of two silly and ""stupid"" first-time directors. Granted, they're good script- writers and generally have track of what's funny and what is not - but the question is whether they can control the fun? NO is the answer, unfortunately.I will admit that it started out good and I thought that if it just continues to build it from there it can only be good. I was, however, horribly wrong.The film is crowded with stupid overly silly over-the-top sexually explicit scenes, which also run longer than what I thought was ever possible in a movie. There is several over-long almost boring scenes where adults talk about semen, masturbation and rape in very immature ways. Things which are not even funny at the first sentence, is driven out to a three or five minute long scene. How do people find this funny? Well, Americans will hate me for this and probably stop reading after this, but 'typical stupid sex-filled American humor' is what it is.The film did have its highs but most defiantly also its lows. I laughed a lot about four or five times but that was it. The idea was great though but unfortunately not executed well at all.I eagerly await the British competitor, 'The World's End', which will defiantly (or at least hopefully) be a lot funnier than this mess.4/10",2.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Funny as Hell,"When I saw the first trailer for This is the End I knew this was going to be great and a movie for me. Seth Rogan and James Franco did not disappoint. This was the best movie I have seen all year by far. The plot is basic but the end result is hysterical. Seth Rogan, James Franco, Danny McBride, Jonah Hill, Craig Robinson, and Jay Baruchel are trying to survive the apocalypse in the home of James Franco. The twist is that the actors are playing themselves and that gimmick worked better than I could have imagined.Before seeing this movie I had my honest worries. When a big group of celebrities come together for a movie like this one of two things can happen. One, it will be a huge success and a comedic masterpiece, or two, there will be way too many stars and it will be a mess like Movie 43. Luckily almost everything in this movie worked. The constant movie references were perfect for a movie lover like me. I am a big fan of these actors and their movies. I wasn't a huge fan of Pineapple Express but I loved Freaks and Geeks. The constant posters and actors of Freaks and Geeks in the background were subtly hilarious. I was also a little worried about some of the characters but each of them worked and was funny in their own way.In the beginning of the movie Jonah Hill was kind of annoying. With the introduction of his character I was afraid of something I like to call the Grown Ups affect. Meaning, the writers make that one guy who isn't funny on purpose like they did with Rob Schneider. Jonah Hill was annoying and at first I didn't like his character but he grew on me and grew on me and he was a star in the movie. Danny McBride was the hero of this movie however. Danny McBride is so good at what he does. He played the same character in this movie as he does in every other accept its better. He is a jerk but he is such a funny jerk. His first scene is hysterical where he cooks all the food and rips apart all the other actors. He and Franco have great scenes and the scene with the gimp almost had me on the floor crying with laughter. Danny McBride was easily my favorite character but picking out a favorite scene was impossible.At first my favorite scene was with Michael Cera. His scenes with him on coke were too funny for film. This was the first role I liked Michael Cera in. If you know me then you know I don't like Michael Cera but everything he did in the move was solid gold. Even his blazer was funny. He was beyond satisfying and whoever came up with the idea of him on coke deserves an Oscar. My favorite scene turned into Danny McBride eating the food, then the scene with Emma Watson, then the sequel to Pineapple Express, then the gimp, and so on. In the end I can't choose a favorite scene. Everything in this movie worked and it had a good story to back it up.The story was basic but carried out perfectly. The movie was in James Franco's house for most of the movie and that was perfect. Having the main characters going thru the city, running into other actors with pointless cameos would have been a disaster. There were many cameos in the movie but none of them were too much to handle. Rhianna Aziz Anzari, Paul Rudd, Channing Tatum Martin Starr, and so many others had just enough screen time to be funny and not take the focus off the main characters. A few references went over my head because I didn't know all the material Seth Rogan could have drew from but I got most of it. The friction between Jay and the rest of the group was a well written conflict added to the story and the characters were done well enough to get an emotional connection to. From the start the movie was funny. Jay and Seth have a weird conversation about glutton and it was so simple but funny. The writing in this movie had Seth Rogan's name all over it. He is such a good writer and he knows how to write a funny script. The random conversations from a milky way bar to the best way to drive in the Hollywood hills the writing in this movie was like no other. The words were more funny then the actions. Franco carries around a prop gun and the scene when they are passing it around and Jonah pretends to shoot was hysterical but not as funny as Jonah Hill praying to God to kill Jay. The writing reminded me of Tarantino's writing and everybody knows I idolize him. Overall, I feel like This is the End was made for me. It is a movie I always wanted made. I always thought it would be a good idea to have a movie where actors play themselves and even though they played exaggerated versions of themselves it still worked. This is the funniest movie I have seen in a long time and is probably in my top 5 favorite comedies. The writing was brilliant, the actors were funny, the scenes were memorable, the lines are quotable, and the movie itself was all around great. I will but this on blu ray the day it is released and I will watch it again and again. I will admit that this movie is not for everybody and I understand if you did not like it. Fans of Seth Rogan and his comedy will love this movie. This is the End easily gets the WillyT Comedic Crest, which is the highest rating for a comedy, and obviously gets the WillyT Seal of Approval.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Funniest ""end of the world movie"" ever made","I saw this movie TWICE in theaters. So yeah, it pretty awesome. EVERYBODY is in it. There is three stages to the story. Each stage gets better and better. You don't know what is going to happen next. Every one uses their real names and that makes it even more hilarious. I would put this over the Hangover and Superbad. It's over the top, it's jaw-dropping, it does not get any better. Inside the house the guys are arguing and trying to stay sane while the whole world is crumbling around them. The whole time you're wondering, ""What is happening outside."" And then we find out. Everybody was on the edge of their seat, laughing hysterically, begging for more. Very impressive gentlemen. I still think about this movie and chuckle to myself. I mean the writing, the cast, the filmmaking, the FEEL, everything. I cannot say enough to back this masterpiece. EPIC.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

I won but at the last minute I decided to watch something 'funny' instead. It was easily the worst movie I can remember myself watching on the big screen. In the beginning it might look promising but after twenty minutes I abandoned all hope. It was so bad that we laughed a couple of times out of disbelief because what was going on. I would avoid this movie as if it was the bubonic plague.

The Funniest Comedy in an Awfully Long Time,"""This is the End"" is one of those films that you'd expect to be funny, and somehow exceeds your expectations in ways you never imagined was possible. A movie that leaves you laughing so hard, your literally gasping for air. A movie you will quote for years, watch repeatedly and instantly refer to as one of your favorite movies. Believe it or not, ""This is the End"" is THAT good. Its the Seth Rogen movie audiences have been waiting for since ""Pineapple Express"", and the funniest one since ""Superbad"". In this day and age, its hard to make a comedy this memorable, since time and time again, the same jokes get recycled. But when you get out of the fictitious/formulaic/gross-out realm of comedy these days, there is an entirely different spectrum most comedies neglect. Satire. ""This is the End"" is a comedy based on comedies. Never before has a comedy been this self aware of what it is, and rarely do actors ever be themselves just for the sake of laughs. In this case, it really does work. Every actor in the film plays a satirical version of his or herself. Seth Rogen is the pothead, Danny McBride is the creep, James Franco is the poser, Jonah Hill is the fake guy, Jay Baruchel is the shy one and Craig Robinson is the token black friend. They play their stereotypes to their advantage, and the fact that they are aware makes room for even more laughs. This holds true for the rest of the cast of comedic cameos, all except for Michael Cera. There's sort of a hilarious surprise with Michael Cera, but I don't want to ruin it in this review.Not only does the film work as a comedy, it also surprisingly works as a horror movie. There are plenty of jump scares and thrilling showdowns that awry during the course of this faux-apocalypse that will leave you on the edge of your seat and eagerly cackling with joy.There isn't much I want to discuss anymore, because a movie like this is better off seen to be believed. What can I say? Sit back, relax and get ready to laugh your ass off.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

This is the bored,"I'm slowly slipping into despair with Hollywood big movies. Obviously someone thought it would be funny to get a load of tedious celebs to play themselves and then pretend it was the end of the world. Ooh...hilarious! The saddest part though, is that the ""jokes"" are only funny if you're about the age of 14. True, Rhianna falling into a big hole in the ground was welcome (oh if that would only happen in real life so we could be rid of her terrible music and pathetic life tales) but the humour was nothing short of juvenile. Maybe if you have some kind of fawning worship for the b-movie actors in this flick you might enjoy the whole ""irony"" of it all but for everyone else the whole experience is tiresome and annoying (just like Franco's Oz movie, or Rogens Guilt Trip). I cant find anything to recommend in this bore of a cinematic yawnfest, and it ranks well with the equally irritating Internship. Luckily I avoided Grown Ups 2 for my own sanity, so right now both these movies are the worse thing I've seen so far this year.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Hell is watching this film for all eternity.,"What a great concept for a film: the biblical Rapture occurs, leaving behind a group of self-obsessed, degenerate actors and celebrities to cope with the Apocalypse. What a shame, then, that the on-screen 'talent' involved areâ€”in my humble opinionâ€”amongst the most over-rated performers in Hollywood today, making this a virtually joyless experience for yours truly and anyone else who has ever suffered through a Seth Rogan film and been left wondering how he, and his regular co-stars, came to be quite so successful.According to the trivia section here on IMDb, about 50% of the film was ad-libbed, and it really feels like it, opening with a full 15 minutes of utterly inane chit-chat between undeservedly over-privileged stoners Rogen and Jay Baruchel that only a fellow partaker of the weed could possibly find funny (but then, when you're high, anything seems funny). The scenes of chaos as the Apocalypse occurs provides some relief from the unscripted drivel, with a few fun deaths for some of the stars (seeing Rhianna fall down a huge chasm to her doom was like a dream come true), but the film soon settles back into puerile garbage mode, the guys discussing each others dicks and ejaculate ad nauseum until the appearance of a couple of well executed CGI demons that sadly fail to rip the obnoxious survivors to bloody ribbons of flesh.",3.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A funny end of the world with our favorite comedians,"This movie's ratings are all over the place. Some find it medium, others love it, others hate it. I am one of those who loved it. This is pretty much what I expected and wanted to see as I am a fan of most of the actors that were part of it.It doesn't have a very profound story line, yet it is very refreshingly original. I loved the idea of the actors all playing themselves. For the most part they play the kind of character that is associated with them, but a bit exaggerated. And sometimes the character they perform is a bit surprising, like in Michael Cera's case. I couldn't stop laughing about him doing all the coke and having lots of sex. I was also very happy to see Craig Robinson as one of the main characters.The end of the world idea was pretty good. It is a bit different than other apocalypse movies (well at least because it is a comedy and also has a devil in it). And while a lot of time takes place in James Franco's house, it is pretty great to see what it is like on the outside.

"outrageous fun, and a solid satire on fame","You don't expect that a movie that purports to be a silly comedy about the end of the world happening to the ""real"" Seth Rogen, James Franco, Jonah Hill, Danny McBride, Craig Robinson and Jay Baruchel to have poignancy or a satirical message, but that is what you actually get here. As the directorial debut for Rogen and long-time collaborator Evan Goldberg, they really put the work into this. A 30 million dollar flick that looks bigger and bolder than it does, though weirder than you'd expect at times. Mostly, it's full of gross-out gags and tasteless jokes.But why then does it work so well, as a laugh-a-minute (even more sometimes) comedy that, up to a point, even takes it characters seriously? Because the actors have, naturally a rapore, and don't mind making knuckleheads of themselves. It's also an example of dumb being done smart, which can also be seen in Superbad and Knocked up and up to a point in The Green Hornet (The Interview, their follow-up, is even bolder and mostly works as well).Celebrity culture can be easy to lampoon, but the targets here are not exactly obscure or in-jokey, at least too much. When McBride shows up, practically unannounced, eating all of the character's stashed-away-for-the-duration food at Franco's place and proceeds to mock them mercilessly, every line is a zinger and is funny even if you don't know (by some chance) that Hill got nominated for an Oscar for Moneyball. Rogen and Golderg rely on the character's behavior, and a knowingness that the characters do dumb things.The difference in quality between this and more super-low-brow stuff - let's say the Scary Movies flicks - is in the timing and quick-witted spontaneity and the embracing of the crude humor. When a demon shows up with a big swinging, uh, phallus, it certainly isn't subtle. But if just reading that you chuckle, then you know what you're in for. The actors are all game for being made jokes out of one another, and recognizing their idiocy especially in the back-drop that is presented here. And it's a real MOVIE as well, the filmmakers take the back-drop seriously and present it not as a joke - it can be rather terrifying to see some of the crazy things happen around these character (rapturing, holes in the ground sucking people in, fires, demons, crazy CGI creatures).Among all this, the ""characters"" are, to varying degrees, self-obsessed ego-heads (Hill especially gets a fun part to play as himself with a 'Oh, I act nice, but really I'm this"" sort of guy), all basically not equipped for such an apocalypse as is happening to them, and Rogen/Golderg have great enjoyment, but take seriously within the scope of what they set out to do, in making the character dynamics count. So, within the scope of the story, every character has something to do, a viewpoint, even (gasp) arcs to go through, all leading up to that wonderful plot device known as the Rapture.Ultimately, This is the End is all in good fun, revels in the ups-and-downs of these characters and their conflicts that bring them down to base levels, and the mockery is knowing and clever. It's also stylish and fun, and shows young filmmakers really strapping in and taking people for a ride. It's the kind of flick you can watch over and over. Especially if you have been aching to see PIneapple Express 2 featuring Woody Harrelson.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A Bag of D**ks,"Firstly, the sheer amount of ego needed to produce such a colossal pile of sh*t, is in itself worthy of marvel. Is Seth Rogen really that overpaid and under-worked that he easily had the means and time to plague us with such an atrocious movie? It was like sitting through the daydreams of a 13 year old pubescent boy, while somehow all the while being uncomfortably aware that the boy is systematically picking his nose with one hand and scratching at his crotch with the other. Yeah, that bad. The acting was mediocre at best, the jokes horribly cheap and the plot boring and one-dimensional. All that I came out of with from this movie was the hope that the events might somehow transpire so that Seth would actually end up being sucked into the sky and I'd never have to witness his scruffy face again.In conclusion, truly a bag of d**ks.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Easily one of the funniest movies ever made,"This Is The End is easily one of the funniest comedies known to man. It is guaranteed that you will be laughing from start to finish. Plus besides the humor in it all, it also has some elements from every genre. Action, Horror, Comedy, and Drama. This is the kind of film that will go down in history as one of the best comedy films ever made.I had a blast while I was watching it. The writing is what makes the jokes come together in a ridiculously hilarious way. Not to mention that even though the acting and the characters are not meant to be taken seriously, the performances were all very well played. This Is The End is a very funny comedy that also has some moral lessons and touching moments thrown in as well.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Backstreet's Back, Alright!","What if you and your best friends throw a party, but outside your house you notice that there is the Great Tribulation and all of you are going to die? Organize a party that will smash badly, of course!This is the sense of this absolute masterpiece of the American crazy comedy, a film that makes you understand that, despite what may happen, the group of your friends will never separate and will always remain attached, even to death.Seth Rogen is always at the top, in all his films that he has made during his career, James Franco always good, professional and nice in his person and all the good company (Jay, Danny, Craig and Jonah), we don't talk about it they are good, nice and very professional too.Even though the concept of the Great Tribulation is fictitious and cannot be found in the Bible, only one thing that is not written in the Bible can be found biblical: the beauty of Emma Watson, and the stroad participation of the Backstreet Boys.Because, to make a party that breaks, you have to bring everyone and you have to make it last long, to enjoy it in the best way. This film is the demonstration of all this, and Rogen always does it with humor, sympathy and common sense of religion.In short, a party at the end of the world! Let's celebrate, guys!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Genius-This is the end,"I love the concept of this film, especially the fact that they play themselves, which is for one, completely unexplored, and two absolutely genius. Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, the directors of the film, who have made some superb films already and in my opinion some of the funniest films of this era, but this is no exception.The unbelievable cast, just sets off to a great movie, with the main cast being Seth Rogen, Jonah Hill, Jay Baruchel, Danny McBride, Craig Robinson and James Franco, all terrifically funny, all playing their parts brilliantly. I'm certain their is no-one funnier than Jonah Hill, creating yet again being part of a comically genius movie.The movie, which shows an apocalypse in a totally different light, and shown through a comical eye, how famous people would react and how they interpret the situation, is just golden, and really doesn't get much better. It is set in James Franco's house, LA, which is a perfect setting for this movie, with Franco's new found fame, which shows how fame is gone to his head, in a very funny sense.I heavily recommend this movie to almost everyone, obviously not kids and some more mature people may not find it that funny, but for 95% of the population who have a good sense of humour, definitely go this movie. Absolutely outstanding, full of jokes from start to finish, go see it (now). What are you waiting for.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Apocalipse Now,"There are a lot of things I can think of doing if the coming apocalypse occurs, staying with my best friends, staying with my girlfriend, or if single find ask out a celebrity on a date (yeah I know long shot but hey, end of days is coming doesn't hurt to try) but holing up with these characters under the same roof is not one of them.I do like the idea, in a way it's the kind of idea we all might have on the possibility of the worst coming, why not hole up with people you like/love. This is sort of that idea only problem is some of these characters don't exactly like or love each other back which makes it all the more funny because this is also one of the last things you would want to happen.There are some good gore even CGI effects; OK, not all CGI was good but I think that just added to the humor. But really were in this film for the group of six and what they do during the apocalypse, this kind of comedy really wouldn't of worked if it wasn't for the ensemble which consists of Seth Rogen, Jay Barshel, Danny McBride, James Franco, Craig Robertson, and Jonah Hill whom all play themselves well sort of.What makes all six of them funny is how they react or handle a rather bizarre and logically ridiculous situation, one of my favorite moments is how their struggling to ration the food, water, and supplies. Or another making a home video sequel to Pinapple Express out of boredom, which is funny because it sort of reminds me of the same ploy in the film ""Be Kind Rewind"" but just the mere ironic fact that four of the cast members Seth, Franco, Craig, and Danny were all in that film. And of course the video journals they make which are also funny because of the honesty or dishonesty they express.Also the fact that each of the actors are playing themselves or at least contrary versions of themselves. In a way each of them aren't parodying themselves but actually more satirizing on their fame and identities to the public eye. It's not a easy rope to walk, satirizing on yourself but at the same time playing yourself in small doses. It's sort of the satire on what we don't see a celebrity say or do when out of the public eye, it's a bit funny because it's true sometimes that one celebrity might act nice when in reality he or she isn't. As a saying goes reality is a whole different story indeed.There is some physical humor but it's powered more by verbal humor and this film has some dialog that is just hilarious. Most of what the characters say will make you laugh your head of and may'be even grown a bit at the same time. Though at times some of it is funny because there are some parts of the verbal humor that could be true, and really made me think if this is what this person or that person was thinking or feeling in their time in Hollywood; or likewise what we think of them.There are cameo appearances where even they play contrary to themselves, seeing what they do and what happens to most or all of them. Though my favorite cameo no doubt is Emma Watson whom is hot as usual. Her appearance is funny because she seems really out of place in the film it's not the type you'd actually see her in and that's the point, as if it's an actor/actress in a project for the paycheck despite how ridiculous or bad it is.But what she does at the end made me crack up and turn me on at the same time. Why the hell her character didn't get transported to heaven is anyone's guess but that's just how the story went and on a side note I'd go with her if it's the end of days.The pace and the humor never lets up, due to how things just escalate and get worse or should I say more ridiculous by the minute for the six. All six just get funnier and may'be even a little crazier. But let alone the fact this film takes place in one spot throughout most to all the film, much like a bottle episode in a TV show; I always liked them because they were usually about characters in one spot arguing and working out differences.There are times when it's almost touching (I said almost)as we see some of them bonding mainly Seth, Josh, and Craig. But also work out issues weather they like it or not, but then again in the forth coming apocalypse what the heck else are you going to do.Overall, ""This is the End"" is absurd fun which is funny to the end.Rating: 3 and a half stars",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
If you laugh at dick jokes and are under the age of 18 you will enjoy this.,"Well, there's lots of profanity, comedic actors feeding off each other, sex jokes, drugs, and excessive use of the word ""dick"", but nothing really funny.If you're still in puberty and you're the kind of person who laughs at Uranus jokes and cracks up at the mere allusion to the word penis then you will find something to like. If you have a single braincell in your head and have grown above cheap puberty antics then you'll squeeze nothing from This is the End no matter how hard you try.The cast seem to think they're funny without any good gags or wit. They feed off each other like a pack of schoolyard kids. The director seems to have given them free reign to improvise at will which results in remarks and unscripted dialogue that fall terribly flat. The sheer reliance on low brow sex humour and use of shock words like ""titty f*ck"" only reiterates how bad the film is. When they grow tired of the sex jokes and swearing, they turn to drugs and throw in a trip-out sequence that is pointless and witless.Falls flat on its face in every conceivable way. I laughed while watching the trailer: can't say the same for the actual film. A low point for all cast and crew involved, a downright embarrassment for anyone of reputation to be caught up in.

"Misleading Trailers! Bad Directing, characters lacked authenticity!","They definitely tried to make a good film and I'm sure this was a fun movie to make, but it unfortunately fails. BummedÂ… I was looking forward to this movie! The only reason why I give this a 3 instead of a 1 is Danny McBride's performance. It's one of those movies where you know it sucks early on and there's nothing it could do to redeem itself. If there was a way to calculate how many people walked out of the theater, I have little doubt this would hold the all-time record. It's because of the style, which I would imagine lays blame mostly on the directors.I liked the trailers, because it made the movie seem as though it was going to have that element of authenticity/realism with the characters, while being a far-fetched comedy, but the character style is beyond over the top stupid. Here's a thought, why not just make the movie the way you want to present the movie in the trailer? If it wasn't for the trailer I would have thought that they intended to make what they ended up with. A stupid comedy can work if it has an element of authenticity in the characters a decent portion of the time. This movie starts off like it could be that way, but early on the characters just... oy vey!!! Which BTW, has nothing to do with the story transitioning into craziness, but that's about the time when the characters turn over the top stupid. The whole, ""playing themselves"", was totally for marketing this movie (technically they used their real names). Even if the actors played over the top far-fetched versions of themselves this movie probably would have been good.It's generally true that comedy works when you have that certain element of authenticity in the characters (to varying degrees). With the exception of Airplane, Naked Gun and Spaceballs, which has the intentions to be stupid on stupid throughout, although those worked, generally they don't, like this movie. This may seem like random movie drops, but it's a rip on the degree of the stupid on stupid nature of this movie, being that it's much more comparable to those then it is to a movie like Superbad. I loved the movie Superbad, because the characters had that believability. On the other hand if you liked Pineapple Express (which I hated, for the same reasons), you may like this movie, although several reviewers said they liked PExpress and hated this movie). Just to pull another unrelated random comedy out of my butthole; Dumb & Dumber (which I consider a classic) is a movie one may think would fall into my stupid on stupid category, but Lloyd and Harry had a fairly realistic world interacting and operating around them, which was part of the reason their over the top antics had credibility. Nothing against ""This Is the Ends"" crazy world, but they had a lot more flexibility with their characters to achieve such credibility.There were a handful of scenes that still made me laugh. All of them involved Danny McBride (had no opinion prior, other than two dreadful movies I saw him in, PExpress & Hot Rod). Just about every scene Danny had, he at least did something that gave it a chuckle. Going back to the whole realism thing, Danny has that authenticity/believability (while different, his ability to be believable when being surrounded by and doing far-fetched things reminds me of Zach Galifianakis), which makes his scenes in the movie funny that few others with the same lines could pull off. This dude has talent; he needs to be cast in some leading or significant supporting roles. If McBride's stock isn't soaring yet, I definitely want to buy some.Spoilers Scene - everyone wakes up and they give Danny the spiel about all the crazy things that happened. He then proceeds to give this logical breakdown that they were tripping on Acid and goes down the list of people based on their appearance. Hilarious! It actually made me question it, until the head falls off. Scene - the sticky magazine scene. Danny should win some type of academy award for that scene. Seriously! Franco also does a good job. There's one point where Seth Rogan is busting up, so they cut to a back shot and you can totally tell he's laughing. The Pilgrim line particularly cracked me up. Scene â€“ A subtle line, but it caused me to laugh the hardest. The part after Danny drinks the water, Grabs Franco's gun and puts it in his mouth, takes it out and pushes Franco's arm down, ""That's what I thought nerd."" It's not funny in writing, but it's my favorite part in practice. Scene â€“ I went back through and virtually every scene with McBride, he does something that's at least subtly funny. The whole Emma Watson incidental rape discussion scene is funny on paper, which turned out semi funny in practice, but it's Danny's sincerity throughout that makes it funny. Then up in the interview room when he says, Herminey took are crap (it's the way he says it)Â… good stuff! There are a couple other scenes as well.I like virtually every actor that's in this movie in general. Jonah Hill is one of my favorite actors (his role in this sucked). I don't understand why directors don't get it. Perhaps they strive for character authenticity and they turn out stupid, or maybe it's something that's difficult to achieve (I don't know I'm not a director)? I really hope it's not by choice. Sure there are people out there that like stupid on stupid, but there are far more people out there that like some element of realism in the characters with their stupid and you won't even lose the stupid on stupid crowd as a fan base, so in the end it seems like a win win.",3.0,Anonymous,Comedy
silly but fun,"Those who believe in the holy scripture are familiar with the rapture, the end of the world. In the south we hear often about it. Now in This is the End you get a sense of what it will be like. With a cast of notable Hollywood stars in Seth Rogen, James Franco, Jonah Hill and Danny McBride, they get caught up in being held up in a house. Suddenly their supplies run low and are forced to creep outside where some devilish creatures are there to create harms way. This sets up a unexpected scenario but the lines create some funny scenes. I unexpectedly found this to be an upbeat hilarious movie. It is not high brow humor but does come with a punch. So have you been saved?

Can't believe this is what accounts for humour these days,"I went in watching this thinking I was getting light hearted humour only to be faced with multiple freak deaths that were upsetting. Recycled, dark humour that is just off key and uncomfortable. Great to know kids these days will be watching these degenerate pot heads thinking it's how to live. I'm tired of drugs being glorified in modern movies. To quote the paparazzi in the movie, Why can't Seth Rogen play another type of character? The deaths were gory and uncomfortable. And of course, black woman get's killed off first and pretty sure I saw two black people die subsequently after that.

loved this movie,"I sorta kinda remember hearing about this movie a few moths ago, but didn't think much of it at the time. I was bored this evening and saw it being promoted by Comcast so I figured what the heck, and I rented it.They sort of slowly unveiled the plot, which was good... If they had sprung the concept of the movie on me in the beginning I possibly would have disliked it... But they eased into it, which let me work my suspension of disbelief into it.Maybe my expectations were low but I thought it was hilarious. It was obvious a lot of the dialog was ad libbed... but with a few exceptions where I thought the dialog was a little awkward & forced, I cracked up through the whole thing.I particularly enjoyed how a lot of these actors let themselves get parodied & particularly thought some of the cameos were hilarious. Which possibly made this movie for me. Between Danny McBride, Michael Cera, the big scene for Emma Watson, and Channing Tatum towards the end... I was laughing threw the whole movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Apocalypse Comedy Now!!!,"I am going to begin my review of ""This is the End"" by stating that this comedy is one tour-de-force zany trip. Does it make it an infinite comedic classic? Probably not, but its still worth the ride. The writer- director team of Seth Rogen & Evan Goldberg do helm this one as an outlandish mock festival with a fair amount of laughs. Numerous comedic actors play themselves including James Franco, Jonah Hill, Danny McBride, Jay Baruchel, Craig Robinson, and Rogen himself. The premise is that they are at a party at Franco's mansion and in less than 127 minutes, an apocalyptic catastrophe wreaks havoc and puts all the actors in a tailspin survival crisis situation. There is plenty of mocking around here, as they all play presumed versions of themselves. There are a plethora of ""over the top"" scenes in the flick, especially with McBride & Hill; but in the end, it's all part of the territory. I really cannot acknowledge any acting performance here because they have all that Memorex (is it real or is itÂ…) tone to them. To end my review, I still do recommend you to take the backstreets or the main road, and give ""This is the End"" a try; but it will not be the end of the world if you miss it either. **** Good",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Absolutely pointless rubbish,"I had higher hopes with a great line up of comedy actors but it was tasteless, pointless and lacking in consistent humour throughout. Perhaps this is better suited to a lesser evolved taste in comedy, but normally being a fan of Seth Rogan and a number of the other actors in this, I'm personally really disappointed with this performance. This film has no real story throughout other than loosely following the biblical apocalypse. There are some places where it did manage a chuckle from my wife and me, but typically we spent the film periodically looking at the bemused expression of the other; thoroughly disappointed with both the storyline of the film, but also the normally over-judgemental users of IMDb who actually rated better films than this much lower.

Everyone plays his or herself in this movie, so it feels much more like the guys filmed themselves at a party rather than a Hollywood film that's been thoroughly thought through. James Franco hosts a party at his house, and his pals Seth Rogen, Jonah Hill, Jay Baruchel, Danny McBride, and Craig Robinson, have a great time until the world starts to end.

And they certainly aren't going to want to pay to see it.Based on cast, previews, and ""8 out of 10""!, I went expecting a great comedy. Hmm. There were a couple of chuckles here and there, but, uh, mostly? This ""movie"" is just a bunch of narcissistic goofing around with good special fx and a bunch of marketing slathered on . . . icing on a turd.If you really want to see it, wait to watch it at home for free with some of your friends.

The expendables for comedians.,"I do love it when actors make parodies of themselves.What I really liked about this movie is that the actors are playing very selfish versions of themselves and the versions that are played up in the media, which just shows the fun side to this guys, and the fact that they are all actually friends in real life which was a big up for me in the film because friendship is a big one for me.Another positive the film had going for it was the movie references and the celebrity cameos. Celebrity cameos are normally annoying but here they all work because the celebrities are either making fun of themselves or are just completely off base with how they are seen in the media (e.g. Emma Watson or Michael Cera). As someone who watches a lot of movies, I liked the movie references especially the fact that they make fun of some of the bad movies that they have been in.The only few things that go against the film where probably just the last third where jokes are unnecessarily dark and really pandered to the ""toilet humor.""

Great Movie!!!,"I just seen this movie in the cinemas and I really enjoyed it. It was really hilarious! Seth Rogan, Jonah Hill and James Franco are some of my favorite actors. This was such a unique film unlike any other I have ever seen. Also having Emma Watson was a huge plus. She was great in the film as well. We sort of get to see a different side to her. It constantly kept me laughing throughout the entire film. It was just one of those films you don't want to end. Rhianna also made an appearance at the start of the film.

Humor and comedy being violated...,"It is very easy for many writers and directors to think that humor and comedy are an easy subject to work with. They believe in themselves so much, that they interpret this as a natural talent from birth. So they make a movie that we supposed to laugh, or better say ""laugh out loud"" with their sense of humor.Well I have news for them. Their sense of humor lacks of humor. Even if someone becomes more moderate in judging them will say that their sense of humor is made for youngsters that do not exceed the age of ten. Imaturity, stupidity, dominate this parody of reality shows and whatever else is out there only made for brain cell damage. The length of the movie was sweltering and tormenting. As for the end?

McBride and Franco's hate for each other is good fun; Mcbride overall steals the movie. Jonah Hill is the only one who doesn't get much laughs despite his effort,he is better off being a sidekick than a random character being out shined.Chaos ensues, actors egos get inflated and bloated.

"The Funniest Comedy of 2013,","This Is the End is a brilliant movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding comedic cast. It's a very well written storyline that see's Seth Rogen and his usual group of friends finding themselves put in to an apocalyptic adventure, it's a laugh riot from start to finish, there were very few scenes that didn't have me in stitches. The huge cast all do a fantastic job, everyone plays an exaggerate version of themselves to full effect, they weren't afraid to make fun of each other and also making them look like horrible people, a dedicated cast all around make this a winner. The movie is also surprisingly stunning at a visual aspect, Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen put a lot of work in to bringing this project to life, the effects are phenomenal and the film looks a lot more expensive that you would have expected. A very fun comedy that I hope to watch again and again, if you're a fan of satire or Seth Rogen, you are going to love This is the End, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good comedy.Jay Baruchel flies out to LA to see his close friend Seth Rogen, who takes him to a big party at James Franco's house.

Egocentic foolishness,"1. No writer. I retired and started writing novels. This story should have hired a real writer. 2. No screenplay. The story wanders because someone turned on a camera at one of their parties and they decided to make a movie. 3. Some fun special effects. I'll give them that. But that wasn't the actors or director who did that. They knew a special effects team who could accomplish a number of cool effects. 4. Actors playing themselves: does not a movie make. I adore Emma Watson and I'm frankly embarrassed for her. 5. Watch the last fifteen minutes: that part is pretty good and fun.No doubt this movie was planned over a weekend with too many beers involved. They must have said, ""Oh! We know how to make movies!""

A Wonderful Surprise,"Before I saw this film I was pretty excited for the unique approach and possibilities that it brought upon itself. The idea of actors playing themselves in an Apocalyptic setup already had me laughing. But what I got was so much more then what I thought I was going to. This is The End offers a mixture of comedy, action, disaster, and horror film all wrapped into one unique and flavorful film. Furthermore, I hope they make more films like this where the actors play an exaggeration of themselves because it makes for some really great opportunities for some great comedy gold. Or at least really bright silver. However there are some issues thought. No movie is without flaws, but aside from that it is a good time to watch with friends or just by yourself. Either way, this film is worth buying at full price and a movie fit for a grand movie collection. Check it out, you won't be disappointed.

Best comedy in a long time,"Being a fan of these types of comedies usually produced by Juddd Apatow or in this case directed by the men who brought us Superbad I was delighted when I heard of this films arrival, and when I watched this film I was not disappointed. I loved this movie and it was possibly one of my favorite comedies of all time, it was fantastic and that is why It deserves a ten. Better than any other comedy that I have seen in a long time, I will buy this on DVD. Seth Rogen and Evan have brought us a comedy that I believe will be timeless and a comedy classic, if you have time I completely recommend you watch this comedic masterpiece because you will not be disappointed.

A fun and crazy party with the best Hollywood comedians leads to a series of devastating events just destroyed the city.,"James Franco throws a party at his house. So six Los Angeles celebrities are stuck in James Franco's house. Friends like Seth Rogen, Jay Baruchel, Jonah Hill, Danny McBride, and Craig Robinsom attend. The problem is that they suddenly find themselves caught in the middle of the strange and catastrophic events that have devastated the city of Los Angeles. The only way to truly escape it all is to prove to themselves that they are good and worthy to lift themselves up. It's the apocalypse !. Ending Summer 2013 !. Nothing ruins a party like the end of the world !. Suddenly, the Rapture hits and the Biblical Apocalypse has begun !.Practically the entire new generation of American comedians are flocking to this irreverent, vulgar, mischievous, wild and funny comedy written and directed by actor Seth Rogen and screenwriter and producer Evan Goldberg, both of whom are making their directorial debut here.The film is funny and entertaining and the special effects are state-of-the-art, with spectacular images that include earthquakes, disasters, huge destruction, giant monsters, hungry cannibals and other things. However, the film indulges in the most tasteful, crude jokes, continuous sexual references and filth, and adding lots of blood, grotesqueness and mutilated limbs here and there.The main fun of the film is locating and watching the large number of actors who appear parading throughout the film, and being entertained by the nonsense that usually jumps out at us. They play a delirious and exaggerated version of themselves while facing a maddening end of the world. In addition to those previously mentioned, we can also name other famous people who usually appear in brief cameos, such as: Michael Cera, Emma Watson, Mindy Kaling, David Krumholtz, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Rihanna, Martin Starr, Paul Rudd, Channing Tatum, Kevin Hart, Jason Segel, among others .The motion picture was mediocrely directed by Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen, both of whom are known writers, producers, actors and directors. Evan Goldberg is famed for his work on Superbad, Knocked Up, Pineapple Express, Funny People, The Green Hornet, 50/50, Goon, The Watch, This is the End, Neighbors, The Interview and The Night Before. Goldberg works alongside longtime partner, Seth Rogen. The duo directed This is the End and The Interview as well as the upcoming AMC series, Preacher, and Hulu show, Future Man. Goldberg and Rogen also produced the soon-to-be released, Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising and Sausage Party. Â¨This Is the EndÂ¨(2013) rating: 5/10.

There were funny moments, but mostly felt mundane. Then the dance at the end just confirmed my gut feeling through out the movie.

Perfection.,"This movie is comedy gold. I have seen it 4 times now since it came out and it's worth the pay every time. I have been excited to see this movie for quite some time now, and when it came to theaters to theaters it exceeded my expectations. The plot is just an amazing idea. A bunch of immature Hollywood movie stars such as Jonah Hill, James Franco, Jay Baruchel, Seth Rogen, Danny McBride, and Craig Robinson are the main stars in the film. I can't say which of them did a better job because all of them brought me to tears from laughter during the movie. The best part of this movie is easily the dialogue. The one-liners and conversations that were put into this film were just absolutely hilarious. The action was even surprisingly good! I'm still stunned by how gut-bursting and excellent this movie was. It is truly a movie I could watch over and over again and not get tired of. A comedy with a very high user ratings? Don't see that too often. The only mildly negative thing I will say, is that it is a very very crude and sexual movie. Language is used every second throughout the movie, especially sexual references, and the violence is very graphic. If you can get past all that, and find the humor in those perverted jokes and such then this is the movie for you. With the cast in this movie it's pretty obvious what you are going to get from it. I know that there's some huge critics of Seth Rogen out there but he (and the rest of the cast) honestly did a hilarious and outstanding job in this movie. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND GO OUT AND SEE THIS MOVIE. A true comedy for the ages. A must see. Easily one of, if not my all time, favorite comedies I have seen.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

The special effects were amazing for a comedy and the jokes although very crude and immature are wet your pants hilarious and quite witty at times. The pace of the movie is flawless as there are no dull moments at all everything is fast paced and catches you of guard multiple times. This movie pushes limits so expect that. The scares are definitely not predictable as in most movies. All in all, stop reading this and go watch this movie.

I missed the end of This is The End,"There are so many apocalyptic movies out these days I decided that if I was going to see one, I wanted it to be a comedy. So I went to see ""This is the End"", which supposedly about the end of the world as seen by some Hollywood types, playing themselves, sort of. I thought it would be a spoof of those other movies and of Hollywood. Sounded good.Instead 90% was about a bunch of unpleasant people holed up in James Franco's house deciding to live it up as best they can with drugs, booze and the little remaining food, further fortified with plenty of sex and bathroom humor. One guy is angry because he didn't even want to go to Franco's party and now he's stuck there with a bunch of people he doesn't like. I empathized with him totally. I never laughed once, although I did crack half a smile at one line,(but forgot what it is). The other people there kind of snickered once.I suspect the writers and maybe the actors were as high as their characters when they made the film and I the audience would have to be the same to enjoy it as much as they did. Maybe they should have passed joints out with the tickets like those 3D Glasses. It may have a great, hilarious ending I missed.

An instant hilarious classic in modern comedy,"When was the last time a movie blew your expectations away? And it did it not with lots of drama, emotions or even action, but comedy? Well for me it was a long time ago. And I'll tell you, my expectations where very high about this one. I love Evan Goldberg movies and with the help of Seth Rogen something good had to come out of it. So when this movie began I was a little worried. Though I cracked up many times at the beginning at at the party sequence there was something missing. And I'm not saying it was bad at all! There where some really funny references with celebrities and coked up Michael Cera was some really funny I'm just saying it was going somewhere different than I expected. But ten minutes later the apocalypse started. hit the fan celebrities died and then we got the five friends trapped in James Franco's house. From here the mechanic, the acting, the improvising, the writing just improved by the second. And this lasted till the END of the movie! The chemistry between all of the actors was so natural and the timing of the jokes was so spot on! Danny McBride had some of his funniest scenes that I've seen in his movies in This is the End and Jonah Hill played this version of himself that I just crack up when thinking about it. Of course Franco, Baruchel and Robinson also where hilarious and smartly done. The Emma Watson sequence adds some lady badassery to the movie! And *SPOILERS* *SPOILERS* by the time near the ending when they go out of the house and encounter the ""new"" McBride was my favorite twist in scenery o the movie. The gimp man! I was gagging for air in that scene! When Channing Tatum says like ""I loove hiim"" I went full on peeing my pants laughter. What follows... Celine Dione, The Backstreet Boys did the satirical part of the movie. The be good do good to go to heaven was smartly written and the awesome never-ending party in the skies was a perfect representation of what we actually would expect heaven to be! By the end you had this feeling of having had the best and funniest time watching this awesome ****. This movie showed the audience and the industry that we don't need all the cheap hit comedies that use the getting hit in the balls and fart humor that is getting worse by the day.

I love these guys too, especially Jonah Hill, Seth and Michael Cera but this movie... I can't find the exact words, but it sucks big time!

Ridiculously hilarious and totally enjoyable,"This movie came as a surprise package, totally enjoyable, ridiculously hilarious and I thoroughly entertained. It stars all the new gen rising stars especially the actors from comedy stream. Seth Rogen, Jay, James Franco, Jonah Hill, Danny McBride and many others are just awesome. But I thought Channing Tatum's cameo was a bit foolish and others come for couple of frames. Could you believe it Seth Rogen directed this movie, well he did a hell of a job in the first movie.Pretty acceptable graphics for a fantasy movie, but sometimes it was dirty and sexual. The story centers around the Hollywood celebrities who meet at a party thrown by James Franco and soon after everything turns hell when the beginning of the end roll out. A bunch of celebrities trapped in a house preparing for the apocalypse and doing everything they could to protect each others.The filmmaker superbly used the theme songs and movie songs especially the Backstreet Boys' song during the end of the movie for a dance like 'Slumdog Millionaire'. So far it was one of a fine comedy of the year which was based on the short video. Loved it, hope you will do same as well. Recommended.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Yet another group that think that if they appear in movies together then success is ensured, well this is evidence that it doesn't. The special effects where not bad too, which I feel where wasted in this movie.

Extremely funny,"Went into this with mixed feelings, thought it might be a bit self indulgent or full of in jokes and while at times it was probably both of those things, for the most part it was just extremely funny.Kind of like watching a really long episode of your favourite sitcom. The true talent of the script was to very quickly set up the characters (exaggerated versions of themselves or playing up to / against their public personas) and then just give them lots of space to riff off of each other, make loads of alternating self deprecating / aggressive comments.The humour is vicious at times but there's also a real warmth in the relationships. So it's both really funny and with that feel-good feeling you get from truly great comedies. Maybe at times it wanders to far into the realm of fantasy and it would have been nice to have the pre apocalypse scenes extended a little. I'm hoping that the Blu-Ray will have lots of deleted scenes.So yeah, I liked it. And I went in with no expectations so I'd recommend this one to anyone. Best comedy I've seen in a long time.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Comedy films have reached a new low,"This is the end (2013) was honestly one of the worst films I think I've ever seen! It wasn't funny at all, I mean AT ALL! I didn't even laugh or chuckle one time throughout the whole thing. Seth Rogen was soooo irritating here, I already hated Seth based on his previous roles in films, but this just made me hate him even more! And the rest of the cast was not quite as irritating, but still. The dialogue sucked, so did the acting as a matter of fact. Also, the loaded up WAYY too much on the non stop crude/sexual humor, it got to where it was just over blown, stupid, and annoying. Channing Tatum's cameo was the only part I actually enjoyed, and that's kinda sad. This movies was just dumb all the way around, except for the 10 seconds of Channing Tatum, that just about sums it up. 2/10",2.0,Anonymous,Comedy
One of the Funniest Movies Ever,"I usually don't find that much at the movies worth laughing at these days due to weak plots, weak scripts, and over used jokes. I've seen all of the Judd Apatow and Seth Rogen films and some I find entertaining and others I find disappointing. This, however, was hilarious. I went to a 5:15 screening on opening day and had to buy tickets in advance 'cause it was going to sell out, which it did. Meaning, everyone cut out of work early or were unemployed, and had to see this movie. I was afraid that all the funny things would be in the previews or that the trailer would sell it as really funny but then it wouldn't be, but, it was as funny as I had hoped...though, it was not an alien movie, which is what I thought, but that's fine. The only other movie I've laughed as much in the past 10 years has been 'Bridesmaids,' and probably the only thing other than that is 'Airplane,' which I've see at least 10 times.I really feel I need to watch this movie again because it's non-stop jokes, and so I feel I need another viewing to get more out of this movie. Another thing is the movie is totally original. The only thing I could remotely say it resembles is 'Ghostbusters,' though, this story is very different. The performances were all great. I spent the majority of my 20s hanging out with celebrities and going to their house parties, and so if you were ever wondering what they're like, this movie was spot-on. Michael Cera playing the obnoxious, pervy actor, Jonah Hill playing the possibly gay, somewhat femme actor, the over the top bro love from James Franco towards Seth. They pretty much played out what actors probably would do in case of an apocalypse.I don't even want to go into the lines from this movie and what happens and spoil it for anyone, but the whole crowd at the theater was laughing the whole time, having a good time, and my friend and I were quoting the movie and recounting the funny scenes throughout the rest of the night.I read a few comments saying it was all potty humor and sexual gratuity and drugs? It was very low, especially considering what is normally in these guys films. And, why would you see one of their films if you're easily offended? This film was actually pretty tame and low on the offensive scale compared to a lot of what is out there today. I almost feel like the people that gave it the bad reviews either went in their with the intention of not liking it, for whatever weird, psycho reason that is, or realized, like me, that it was not aliens and it was a biblical apocalypse, and got offended that that kind of humor and the bible were in the same movie. Again, why would you see a Seth Rogen, Jonah Hill movie if you're easily offended? Oh, and the people who thought this was dumb and humorless I bet you they love shows like 'Everybody Loves Raymond' and 'Mad About You,' shows that are generally popular but pc and void of flavor or humor.This was extremely funny, very well written, and I absolutely loved it. I don't even have any complaints 'cause I got absolutely everything I wanted from it and more.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
One of my favourite films to date!,"I'm really surprised at the reviews for this movie, I thought it was hilarious and I absolutely love the characters in the movie, if you've never heard of half of them, or never seen them in films then I can see your point, but I love their humour and think they made a fantastic team.I'd definitely go watch it again, and I think it's brilliant the way they play as themselves and reflect on their acting career. If you've ever seen, knocked up, pineapple express, 21 jump street or anything like that, then I think you'll love this film. I think it was absolutely fantastic!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Oh please let This be The End...and it was bad,"I was really looking forward to this film, and was quite let down, it was not as good as I was expecting it to be. Im not sure why many others loved it so much, the trailer was funnier than the actual film. Don't get me wrong, It does have its funny moments, but for me wasn't the level I hoped for, was only a few times I laughed a little. The film mainly centers on Jay and his relationship with Seth. But overall it tried too hard to be funny, and because of this it was just over the top and pretty stupid. There was way too much revolving around smoking weed and other drugs, and too much smack talking about penis sucking and semen. It was just not needed and it became really irritating, speaking of irritating, Danny McBride is, as always plain stupid and annoying as hell. The film has the same level of crude humour and sexual talk and penis's as Your Highness and the same amount of drugs as Pineapple Express. If you loved them movies then you'll enjoy this. Otherwise I wouldn't really recommend it.",5.0,Anonymous,Comedy
This Is The End...of a good run of films..,"Total rubbish. I hope they made this film to drag themselves back down to reality, i just wish they hadn't released it so we all had to suffer. Not funny and not entertaining. If you want to watch a demon then please see Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny, if you want to be demonised then sit back and watch these over paid idiots make a film for themselves that was funny only in their own minds whilst they were drunk on fizzy wine whilst high.It really isn't funny. Franco getting proper roles is a joke, at least the other ones know they are a joke. Shame this contains no jokes just another step to 'Idiocracy' (WATCH IT!)",3.0,Anonymous,Comedy
This Sucks,"I only made it about halfway through the movie...I kept watching and waiting for it to get funny, but it never did. Maybe I'd have found it funny if I'd been shrooming and had just watched Pineapple Express, but this movie just plain sucks.Most of the actors in this movie are generally funny, although Jay Baruchel is an absolutely terminal actor. Other than playing the role of a dork, he simply has no talent but, somehow he got mildly famous.I guess this movie was a commercial success and some people liked it. Maybe there are just more people high on dope these days, which might explain the popularity of the movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Really??  I just don't get it...,"I realize I'm probably in the minority on this one, but I totally do NOT see why people think Seth Rogen is funny. Or Jonah Hill for that matter. Or Michael Cera. Or Danny McBride.But I sooooo wanted to like this movie! I'd heard it was funny. And that the way the characters poke fun at themselves was great. But I had to turn it off after 20 minutes. Its horrible! I don't subscribe to the whole ""crude = funny"" theory, and that's all this movie aspired to be: crude.Don't get me wrong, I'm no prude. I like a well placed F-bomb as much as the next guy. But this film had only the crudeness and zero humor.If you like Seth Rogen and that type of humor, you'll probably think this movie is hilarious. If you don't like his previous work, don't waste your time here.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The Apatow disciples put a fresh spin on their comedy,"Even an outrageous stoner comedy can successfully appeal to a wide audience with a little ingenuity. ""This Is the End"" could've stopped at being a comedy in which a bunch of friends are faced with the apocalypse, but what really makes Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen's film work is that there's a big glass window where a fourth wall ought to be.""This Is the End"" takes advantage of those who count tabloids and celebrity news amongst their guilty pleasures, creating a sense of being shown behind the curtain and feeling on the inside just by having all the actors play themselves and making sporadic jokes about their real-life careers. As the film goes on, the actors become characters more than they actually play themselves and the authenticity wears off, but part of what makes the movie so effectively funny is that it peels off certain layers that 99.9 percent of other films (not labeled documentaries) have, regardless of how closely these actors all resemble their actual personalities.Rogen and Jay Baruchel star (again, as character versions of themselves) as old-time best friends drifting slowly apart. Baruchel comes to Los Angeles to stay with Rogen, who insists they party with his other Hollywood friends including Jonah Hill, James Franco and Craig Robinson. It's not Baruchel's scene, but he puts up with it. At the party, however, the Earth begins to shake, fires erupt everywhere and sinkholes form in the earth, including right outside Franco's house. A number of actors and celebrities playing themselves in cameos die, including a coked-up Michael Cera and other A-listers whom under normal movie circumstances we aren't used to seeing get killed off just like that.Baruchel, Rogen, Franco, Hill, Robinson and a crazy, reckless Danny McBride end up (for the most part) the lone survivors and board themselves up in Franco's house. Their attempts to figure out how to survive become the comic material from that point forward, along with some satanic twists. Meanwhile, their attitudes toward each other rear their ugly heads and cause even more friction.This all sounds like a thought-out, creative, original comedy plot, but some will see it as nothing but a dumb comedy masquerading as something innovative. Rogen and Goldberg are up to their same-old humor: masturbation jokes, random references, lewd physical humor and penises abound. But they innovate just enough to give their shtick a fresh coat of paint. Comedy trends and actors come and go; if these Apatow disciples want to remain relevant beyond this first decade, this is the kind of creativity that will be required of them. Simple, clever and effective.The film is garbage as a take on the apocalypse; it's all about the social scenarios that emerge from it. The few action sequences and visual effects scenes are borderline horrendous, but it doesn't jump into these dumb stoner-movie parts until after sufficiently building up the character-focused parts of the story.That said, it's hard to buy into the bromantic heart of ""This Is the End"" unlike previous movies featuring these guys (""Superbad,"" ""Pineapple Express,"" etc.). Rogen and Goldberg assume because the actors are playing themselves that this establishes a relationship dynamic between Seth and Jay to the point that we're willing to root for them to overcome the riff they endure in the film. That, or Rogen and Goldberg just didn't care. Either way, their films usually succeed more at creating sincere relationship moments and they end up empty in this one.""This Is the End"" marks a successful experiment at twisting familiar genre tropes into something novel. It's not as well-rounded of a comedy, but it doesn't lack for moments of hilarity and it's certainly the best this crew has done in a while when it comes to stoner comedy.~Steven CThanks for reading!
