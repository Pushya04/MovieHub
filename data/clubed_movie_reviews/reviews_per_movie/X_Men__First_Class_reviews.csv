"A prequel that does not, in any way, suck. Amazing, isn't it?","There came a point, about half way through this film, when I emerged from the world of wonder on screen, took stock of my emotions in that instant, and realized that yes, by God, I am LOVING this movie.I didn't really expect to, of course -- although certainly, I hoped for it. With such an incredible cast, an able director at the helm, a story of Bryan Singer provenance and the inclusion of some of my favorite, if lesser known, X-types (Darwin! Tempest! Havok!), I was eager to see this beloved band of merry Marvel mutants redeem themselves after the massive failures of X3 and X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE.Which they do. And how!One thing that the avid comic fan must do when approaching this movie, however, is to divorce themselves utterly from almost all established four-color X-Men continuity. Oh, some bears up, but by and large this is a whole new origin story, a reboot of epic proportions, and yet it is a retcon so cleverly done, and one that offers up a such a delicious mélange of complex relationships and sensible motivation, that all of the many discrepancies inherent in having Mystique on the side of good or having Moira McTaggert a CIA agent simply do not matter.Speaking of McTaggert, Rose Byrne is both comely and convincing in the role, and almost every other actor is perfectly, one might almost say forcefully, cast. McAvoy brings a kind of laddish charm to Charles Xavier that he mixes nicely with both decency and naïveté, and Michael Fassbender's nascent Magneto is relentlessly, even heart-breakingly, compelling. Their chemistry is electric -- theirs' is one of the most multi-faceted and sincere bromances the screen has seen in a good long while.The younger cast all impress, though particular praise must go to Oscar-nominee Jennifer Lawrence as the petulant but pitiable Raven/Mystique (The Academy Awards have been good to young, hot X-chicks; let us not forget that Rogue herself, Anna Paquin, won for THE PIANO). Former child star Nicholas Hoult is also outstanding as the troubled Hank McCoy, and perhaps the most surprising kudos must go to teenage dream Lucas Till, who conveys the particular anti-social asshole-hood of the turbulent Alex Summers very convincingly indeed.The biggest letdown in the movie, acting-wise, is January Jones as Emma Frost. True, she is appropriately ravishing, there can be no denying that, but she lacks the the zing of the written character. There is very little intelligence, snark, or even personality behind her interpretation of this most intriguing of mutants; she's just kind of Stand There and Look Pretty -- which, for one playing Emma Frost, is something a travesty.The only other weight under which this movie really labors is the fact that it is a prequel, and it therefore suffers from the feeling of inevitability that besets all such endeavors. Anakin Skywalker HAS to go Dark Side. Bilbo Baggins HAS to find the One Ring. And Magneto HAS to turn against humans; Mystique HAS to join him; Xavier HAS to end up in a wheelchair. With these definite plot developments looming, their eventuation is bound to be a bit of an anti-climax.And yet the fun part about X-MEN: FIRST CLASS is the journey it takes us on to get us there. Offering up plenty of surprises, some kickass action sequences, mighty fine special effects, sly humor and a killer cameo, it is without doubt the best comic book movie of the year – nay, decade – thus far. And considering how overcrowded that list is, this is really saying Something.Huh. A prequel that does not, in any way, suck.Amazing, isn't it?-- Rachel Hyland, geekspeakmagazine.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A franchise is reborn...,"Beginning with a crime-thriller and a fantasy film on his directorial résumé, it is safe to say that Matthew Vaughn may have already found his niche genre in the super-hero field despite only directing four films in seven years. His first super-hero project, 'Kick Ass,' opened in 2010 to solid critical acclaim and a finalized gross of three times the film's ordinary $30 million dollar budget. And after only two years, Vaughn returns with 'X-Men: First Class,' an origins story to accompany the Bryan Singer/Brett Ratner X-Men trilogy released between 2000 and 2006. It's intelligent, enthralling, well-acted, stylishly directed, and most importantly by focusing heavily upon the relationship between the two central protagonists, it does not feel like a conventional super-hero film.Set within the political context of the Cuban Missile Crisis in the early 1960's, Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) is an up-and-coming Professor whose life is drastically altered when he is introduced to the other members of society who also share the same mutant gene as himself that supplies them with super-human abilities and traits. After stumbling upon the shape-shifting Raven (Jennifer Lawrence) within his mansion, the telepathic Xavier then encounters Erik Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender), the son of Jewish parents who were murdered during the holocaust by the narcissistic former Nazi scientist, Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon). Erik, who can manipulate all metal objects around himself, wants retribution and nothing more from Sebastian who is now a successful and evil underground figurehead who commands a team of mutants (Azazel, Emma Frost and Riptide) to do his bidding for him. But, once his plan for world domination is revealed, they find that it far exceeds the constraints of humanity, and Xavier, Erik and a rag-tag band of young, hide-away mutants (Havok, Beast, Darwin, Angel and Banshee) who were discovered by Charles, must combine their powers in one last attempt to stop Shaw from destroying the planet and humanity as a whole.Instantly where 'X-Men: First Class' works is in regards to its two central characters; Charles Xavier played by an incredibly affluently sounding James McAvoy and a rage-fuelled Erik Lehnsherr played by a stern-faced Michael Fassbender. Their instant on-screen chemistry provides the drive and ammunition for the plot to carry itself forward. Both characters have differing ideologies and their constant clashes due to this aspect allow the script to be brought to life. Instead of simply infusing their relationship with formulaic violent clashes, Vaughn has instead opted for more articulated verbal battles between the two characters regarding their stance within the society they are now becoming a part of. Xavier is an intellectual being who believes that humans will eventually be accepted within society as equals alongside humans, while Lenhsherr believes that mutants will always be hunted and unable to live peacefully side-by-side with the human race, his evidence for this resides in the anti-Semitism and hatred he received at the hands of the Nazi party during the holocaust. This heavy-set contradiction in ideologies allows their relationship to be imbued with pessimism, while they may be shown as friends and fighting together initially, fans of the comic books and films in general know this does eventually turn into a bitter rivalry and it's this development which drives the plot forward.Aside from the script, it would also be rude to not praise the action-sequences which take place within the confines of the 1960's X-Men universe. With a modest running time at two hours and ten minutes, there are more than a few well-choreographed action sequences that would adequately satisfy any of comic-book-to-film aficionado's wishing to see this film. Each character's power or ability is at some point represented in a destructive or defensive capacity, taking full advantage of the fact that while many super-hero movies tend to concentrate on the aesthetic nature of the artillery characters can be seen to withstand from governmental agencies or blindsided human opponents, here it is shown and constantly emphasized that human reaction would be futile due to the overwhelming power the mutants possess. These scenes also allow the less important characters to show their physical presence on-screen. For example, during the climactic fight sequence at the conclusion of the film, every mutant character that is identified to the audience is finally shown using their abilities to full capacity, most notably the henchmen of Shaw and the rag-tag team of Xavier and Lehnsherr. This therefore accounts slightly for the lack of depth that has been attempted in these secondary characters due to the time and story constraints.While it is a very good and accessible comic-book/super-hero movie, 'X-Men' does also contain two central flaws. The first is superseded in a way by the strength of both McAvoy and Fassbenders performances, as Kevin Bacon is constantly overshadowed as the one-dimensional antagonist of the piece. His plot to ultimately destroy humanity becomes second fiddle to the ever intricate complex relationship between Xavier and Lehnsherr, and his appearance seems too modelled upon that of a James Bond villain. He has the slick hair, the beautiful women and the villainous underground Club to boot, but Bacon unfortunately doesn't have the charisma to be accepted as a worthy opponent to the protagonists. The other flaw has to do with a minor aspect of the production itself, as the non-diegetic music, most notably during the action sequences, begins to diminish in its impact as the film carries on, leading to it eventually becoming the generic, genre-related fanfare associated with the conventional comic-book films.'X-Men: First Class,' is not your typical comic-book movie, it may contain certain elements associated with the comic-book genre, but by placing a heavy emphasis upon the strength of the plot and the script at the film's core instead of the action-set-pieces taking place, Vaughn has intended, and succeeded, in transcending the stereotypical conventions of the genre and has created a film which will appeal to a wide range of audience members.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Almost pitch-perfect!.... An X-tremely good job!,"What stands out in this movie (besides the look of some of the mutants), is the clever way in which all the pieces fall into place as a prequel which cements the backdrop and tone for the previous X-men offers. This one however, stands above them though for the consideration and tact that has gone into developing these understandably complex characters. Resulting in a more complete movie experience.The leading cast do a brilliant job in giving you a sense of their conflict with ingredients such as prejudice, ignorance, a sense of belonging and bitter revenge giving the film a more humane feel than a lot of dramas allowing you to connect with the characters more easily.The special effects- lets not forget, are top notch as expected, but surprisingly very in-keeping with the film and doesn't take away from the other elements of it. The violence is clean but present, pitched right between a young and adult audience. There's also a decent amount of ironic humour thrown in, which, considering the party tricks on offer (by that I mean the powers and peculiarities of the mutants), just comes and goes naturally without feeling forced as like a lot of comedy moments in films of late.Bottom-line, this is a well-constructed, well acted Marvel film. I wasn't totally convinced beforehand, casting James McAvoy as the young Xavier, a full head of hair and northern accent doesn't seem the best fit after all. I can say that he fully realised that role and showed his range in playing a more commanding lead. Michael Fassbender has great screen presence and does a good shift as the Magneto to-be and Mr Bacon adds another interesting element to the story. All the supporting cast give a solid performance with everyone focused on the exciting job at hand and no weak links.Easily worth the cinema admission and thank god they didn't make it in hit-and-miss 3d, there's just no need! The best of the X-men franchise.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
X-Men,"With Matthew Vaughn at the helm, X-Men: First Class is a classy, fun time that brings the best out of it's strong cast. The action scenes and dialogue pop with a ferocity, and breaths life into a incredibly engaging storyline.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Superb! Rock-solid script, two amazing lead performances (the film is basically a bromance).","What you need to know about this movie before you go and see it.  1. Michael Fassbender and James McAvoy are superb. Each one, alone,  would have made the movie terrific, but together? Forgetaboutit! Every  step of the way, every scene, every emotion, these two men own the  movie and watching their bromance is a treat from start to finish. Make  no mistake about it, even when the world is on the brink of utter  destruction what really matters is how these two men relate to one  another. And when you watch the movie, you will care.  2. Everyone in the cast is good. Kevin Bacon has never been better, and  Jennifer Lawrence is wonderful. Rose Byrne and January Jones aren't  given much to do, Ray Wise and Michael Ironside only have a few short  lines, but - across the board - the entire cast are a delight.  3. The story is tight. You've got a bad guy with a plan, which he sets  about executing in A/B/C fashion. Against him, the good guys work  together. Their motivations are different, of course, but they pretty  much want him stopped so they unite. That's it.  4. Charles and Erik are fascinating characters. They debate. And  viewers can debate endless about them, and about who is right, etc. As  you watch you desperately wish they could stay friends, but you  understand why they ultimately can't. Even if they themselves, in these  early days, don't understand it yet. To have that so perfectly captured  in a Summer Blockbuster movie is part of what makes this a treat and a  future classic. But, aside from their relationship to each other, the  movie takes time to make each of them interesting in his own right. We  get to see Charles as a teacher, for instance, and come to understand  how he impacts upon the lives of those he tutors. Some of Erik's best  moments (away from Charles) are in his comments to Mystique about her  appearance, making it clear that this man has more to him than the  shadow of his past.  4. Most supporting characters have very little screen time. But that's  okay, since this isn't THEIR story, really. Of the bunch, it is  Mystique and Beast who are best served. Both have terrific character  arcs that - in a lesser X-Men movie - might have been the highlight of  the film. Here, their stories serve as quality background material to  the main event (Charles and Erik). Beyond that, we just learn enough  about everyone to know what they can do and like them a little bit,  mostly through their banter and most obvious character traits. Once  scene where most of the supporting characters are clearly terrified  will certainly go a long way towards making you care about them for the  rest of the movie. On the downside: Shaw's two henchmen don't get  ANYTHING to do except use their powers, and at the end of the story we  know as much about Emma Frost as we did at the beginning. But these are  the exception, not the rule.  5. Visually, this movie is a treat. The FX are good, no surprise, but -  much better - the actual sets/costumes are beautiful. Whether it's a  remote CIA lab or a lap-dance club, whether it's the Magneto helmet or  Mystique's everyday clothes, you are always admiring 'the look' of  what's on screen.  6. There are action scenes all during the movie, but - having said that  - the movie builds as it goes. The first half is more  story-heavy/character-heavy so that when the action REALLY starts we  care about everyone. And, again, it works. Even with the scant details  given their characters, when Banshee and Havok (for example) go into  battle you are invested in them to a certain degree.  7. There are surprises. Deaths, betrayals, cameos and name-dropping.  But, as well as being cool, all of this makes perfect sense for the  story/universe of the movies.  Superb! Rock-solid script, two amazing lead performances (the film is  basically a bromance). Haven't been this excited about the X-Men  franchise since X2: X-Men United.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Fantastic X-Men prequel,"Exhilarating action, formidable foes, well written, and highly entertaining throughout! I love Matthew Vaughn films or least most of them he's very good at his craft. Kevin Bacon is always great at villain roles along with the rest of the cast is so good. Part of me remembers seeing this in the theater that was fun especially then I had people to go with, in the last several years I mostly go by myself I hope that changes eventually either way X: First Class is exactly what you want it to be!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Saga Begins,"In 1944, in Poland, the boy Erik Lehnsherr unleashes his magnetic power when his mother is sent to a concentration camp. The evil Dr. Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) brings Erik to his office and kills his mother, increasing his abilities through anger. In New York, the wealthy Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) meets the mutant Raven (Jennifer Lawrence) and invites her to live in his manor.In 1962, the CIA agent Moira MacTaggert (Rose Byrne) discovers the existence of mutants working with Shaw and the invites Professor Xavier to recruit mutants to work for the USA government. Xavier teams up with Raven, Erik and a group of young mutants. Sooner they learn that the evil Shaw has the intention of beginning a nuclear war to destroy the world and increase his power.""X-Men: First Class"" is an entertaining film for fans of action films with superheroes that discloses the beginning of the saga of the mutants. The plot has many flaws, like for example: why Erik destroys Dr. Shaw's office, kills the guards but does not destroy the killer Shaw? How Xavier and Raven become best friends after a five- minute dialog? Why the lack of gratitude of Raven after the accident with Xavier in the end? The power of Azazel is so exaggerated that becomes impossible to be defeated.Kevin Bacon is a great villain and the insertion in the context of the Cold War and using the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 as background is a funny joke. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""X-Men: Primeira Classe"" (""X-Men: First Class"")",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Possibly the best X-Men movie,"After X3 and Wolverine Origin our expectations for the X-Men franchise were pretty low if not gone completely. This seemed like a last ditch effort by Fox to make something out of X-Men. When pictures were being released I laughed at them with my friend. Beast looked weird and everything looked cheap. I went to the theater thinking, ""I don't know why I'm seeing this it's gonna be stupid.""What they made was so much more than a prequel. A lot of the times when these movies are made there only function is to explain why everything you already know came to be. This actually had a story to tell. And was the beginning of a great franchise. Casting was good. Even their self referential jokes were good.I don't know if Bret Ratner hated X-Men and was deliberately trying to ruin it but he did. Goddamn he did... So much that not only was the past the only place to go by the fact that they used time travel to correct this later on.They made the characters real, who we know but different. They aren't set in their ways yet. Magneto has his evil foundation but he's not there yet. Xavier isn't the teacher but it does come naturally to him. It's fun to see them young doing what kids do.The story is exciting and worth telling. A lot of really cool things happen. The 60s feel it's nice too.Little did we know then they this was the start of saving X-Men.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best Xmen film yet!,"Xmen: First Class is simply fantastic. Strong emotion and explosive action. The acting is top notch. Delivery from every actor is at it's best, more so from Mystique, Beast, Xavier and Magneto.The story is more character based than action, however the action sequences are still superb. Personally i'd have liked to of seen it being a 15 and have a more adult but it wasn't a big issue. Also some more background story from the bad super's would have been good but again this wasn't too much of an issue and would leave some nice room for upcoming xmen movies.I don't want to say too much but to break it down... Go see this film no matter what you are into. There is something for everyone. 9/10 easy",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Mediocre action movie with several embarrassing moments,"Everything went wrong with the X-men movies when Bryan Singer decided to stop directing them. The first X-men film was an amazing picture with excellent cast and superb directing despite the lower budget. X2 was even better, larger, deeper than the first one. Then Brett Ratner and the producers managed to screw a great story with just simply wrong timing and cutting and unnecessary rewritings of the script. I don't even mention Wolverine which was a mediocre Hollywood trash on the level of Daredevil or Elektra.The story here in X-men - First Class is not bad, you can feel that Bryan Singer had some ideas during the writing session. But the final result is very, very disappointing. We have a lot of interesting characters here but no time for a reasonable dialog between them. The young versions of our admired heroes are saying the silliest lines - repeatedly! - to each other with harsh, annoying, nonstop score in the background. The viewer has the feeling that it's just a two our long trailer of some summer blockbuster-wannabe - and I know it was meant to be a summer blockbuster but after the first two episodes I was expecting much-much more from this franchise.Matthew Vaughn is an otherwise extremely talented director, I love all his previous movies but this is lack of any of his virtues. Maybe the ironic view or the humor is missing here which he had before in Stardust or Kick/Ass. X-men is probably not that franchise where you can turn things to a grotesque, sarcastic direction, Vaughn tries it a couple of times and he usually fails. (There are some scenes that are supposed to be funny.) Okay, and what about being cool? Layer Cake is one of the coolest movies ever made, but that also can be said about X-men and X2. Well, this movie is unfortunately not cool at all. Maybe it tries too hard to be cool but this huge effort to overdo everything makes it undignified and embarrassing.The cast is superb though. It's nice to see that the producers had some money for the actors too not just for the action sequences. James McAvoy is great as always, Michael Fassbender is a perfect young Magneto, he just has some stupid lines and he can't do anything with them. But we have here the amazing Kevin Bacon, the very talented Jennifer Lawrence (watch Winter's Bone instead of this film), the coolest chick of the picture: January Jones (in a very silly costume - most of the costumes were probably borrowed from the wardrobe of Kick/Ass) and such great actors as Michael Ironside for insignificant tiny roles. Sadly, the script doesn't make an opportunity for any of these great actors to do something memorable.Well, at least the action sequences are pretty spectacular. However, there's nothing you haven't seen before in the earlier movies - or in somewhere else.Briefly: X-men - First Class is a mediocre Hollywood trash with wasted talents, ruined ideas and nice action sequences. Enjoy if you can.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
X  Marks again marks the spot! Great Film!,"There are plenty of big action scenes throughout but it's the first half of the film that really impresses. Establishing these characters and the entire universe is done remarkably well and in a remarkably moving manner. This new spin on familiar ""bad guys"" Magneto and Mystique does give the actions and emotions for the characters a new level of appreciation and helps give them so much more depth and pathos. Both sides of the fence (Xavier's vision and Magneto's contempt) are advanced and the brilliance of the plot is that both sides are understandable and relatable. The viewer can simply sit and watch it unfold but also be emotionally invested in the journey. During the second half, plot threads move towards resolution and action picks up. Xavier is a shining example and his journey throughout the film matches that of Erik.First Class never undermines the audience nor talks down to them and does all that is expected of it. It delivers great action, humor, effects and a strong connection between heroes, villains and those developing in between. The retro design is suave and making this a period piece gives it a cool and unique flavor. The collaboration between Singer and Vaughn apparently was a perfect blend. Vaughn did a brilliant job and Singer's vision from the first two films stayed in tact and was enhanced. I have to add that the score had a perfect heroic theme but was also moving and very well done. The overall impact of this film leaves you with a great sensation of a job well done. Fast paced yet filled with depth, spellbinding visual effects and a gripping finale. In the end, they succeeded in re-establishing these characters in a superb and interesting manner. There is more to offer and more depth to appreciate. I certainly can't wait for a sequel and inclusion of Scott and Jean from the original trilogy.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Clever, exciting, funny and stylish. What more could you want?","I love the Xmen, I won't beat around the bush. There are so many mutants, heroes and anti-heroes that you relate can to at least one of them. The franchise has had its ups and downs. The first two films made the superhero genre what it is today. Stunning set pieces, breath taking special effects and a group dynamic that was brilliantly cemented in the second film. The third struck a middle ground where the spectacle overshadowed the narrative but was still a fun ride, and the last title Xmen Origins: Wolverine, was the only miss-step in the series. Xmen first Class is really very good. It manages to keep up with the first two whilst retaining an originality in its own right.The Direction is great, Vaughn's clearly got a knack for angles and keeping the audience engaged whilst the story chops and changes. The look of the film is modern, yet still has a 60's and almost retro look about it. The special effects are very good, though some how not quite up there with Xmen: The Last Stand. The energy is fast and relentless and the action sequences blend in with the dialogue sequences seamlessly.The acting is very good, though Patrick Stewart and Ian Mckellen are definitely missed, McAvoy and Fassbender do excellent jobs and really are in keeping with the characters you already know and love. Emma Frost and Sebastian Shaw are deliciously malevolent and Moira Mctaggart is perfectly pitched. My only reservation about the acting in the film is of Mystique, who I believe wasn't quite right, her motives in the film don't seem in complete continuity with the rest of the films.A sequel has already been planned and I shall be eagerly awaiting it. Having Storm back in the series would be a personal highlight for myself, but not necessary. I would highly recommend this film to anyone that has watched the original films and even for newcomers.One thing I will add that I have noticed since watching the original trilogy is that in 1980 Charles is walking, but according to First Class he loses this ability in the 60's...",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Absolutely first class! 11 out of 10.,"Of the original trilogy, the first X-Men movie still rates the best.....until now.This prequel is an absolute stunner - from storyboard, script, mutant characters, pace, cinematography, Foley FX, VFX....you get the picture.

"Rushed and unspectacular, saved by Michael Fassbender","Things were looking good for the X-Men back in 2003. The first film was a box-office success and was a pretty solid blockbuster. Then X2 came and the bar was raised not only for X-Men films, but for superhero movies in general. Bryan Singer had made an exciting action film that had interesting, fully-developed and endearing characters. Then Singer dropped out in order to make Superman Returns, and for some reason left the job to Hollywood s**t-stain Brett Ratner. X-Men: The Last Stand was an over-populated, lazily directed mess, and Ratner had thought it would be a good idea to cast Vinnie Jones. It seemed to be the closure of the X- Men series, until X-Men Origins: Wolverine came along and gave a backstory to fan-favourite Wolverine. Even though it was directed by the Oscar-winning Gavin Hood (who directed the excellent Tsotsi), it was the worst of the lot. Studio interference has made it a bumbling, boring mess of a movie. But still the X-train carries on, and still had the ability to attract rising director Matthew Vaughn.Set in 1962, it follows a young Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) who is graduating from University and living with his best friend Raven (Jennifer Lawrence). Xavier is seemingly fascinated with genetic mutation that has given him the gift of reading minds, and given Raven the ability to morph into anyone. Meanwhile, vengeful concentration camp survivor Erik Lensherr (Michael Fassbender) is on a mission to find the fled Nazis that led to the death of his parents, and, ultimately, to find Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon), who first discovered his gift for magnetism. Shaw is now on a quest to strike a deal with the U.S.S.R. that will lead to the destruction of America. Lensherr realises he must join forces with Xavier and recruit new mutants in order to fight this threat, and eventually being accepted into a discriminative world.One of the underlying themes of the X-Men films is the idea of discrimination against the mutants. It is the key thing that eventually lead to Xavier and Lensherr (later to become Professor X and Magneto) ultimately becoming enemies. Xavier feels that the best way to show the human population that the mutants do not pose a threat is to rise above the 'racial' hatred. Magneto takes it as a way to feel superior, and therefore hell-bent on teaching the humans a lesson. Magneto feels deeply about this due to his childhood in Auschwitz, and the death of his parents. This deep-rooted hatred is explored early on in First Class as Lensherr scours Europe killing people on his Nazi list.This is one of the problems with First Class, as the film is bound to the fate that we as the audience already know. Xavier must lose the use of his legs. Magneto and Raven (later to become Mystique) must become evil. Hank McCoy (Nicholas Hoult) must turn into Beast. The Cerebro must be built. Often the film becomes so insistent in developing these ideas that it loses focus on its own storyline and characters. As a result, the plot can often feel muddled, and the new mutant additions are thinly-conveyed and uninteresting.The one true masterstoke in the film is the casting of Michael Fassbender. I've long been an admirer after seeing him as Bobby Sands in Hunger, and then go on to make Fish Tank and Inglourious Basterds. He portrays Magneto torn both by anger and helplessness devised from his childhood, and plays it with utter conviction. His early scenes travelling across Europe are the best moments in the film, and makes me wish they had gone ahead with their earlier plans in giving Magneto his own origin movie. McAvoy, however, although possessing a lot of charm, suffers from having Patrick Stewart's shoes to fill. His friendship with Raven is just not convincing.There's a definite feeling that the film has been rushed. Vaughn's earlier efforts in the fantasy field - Kick-Ass and Stardust - flowed, and never lacked in the special effects department. Here, the film seems to frantically pacing for the climax, with no real moments of character development, and some of the special effects don't come near to the standards of other films these days. It is, though, undoubtedly enjoyable. The action scenes don't exactly blow anything out of the water, and don't even surpass the original two, but they are at least fun. I hope if they do make another film, they concentrate on the story rather than looking at the future, and set the foundations for what could become a solid franchise in it's own right.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"The origin story that the ""X-Men"" universe deserves","Superhero movies have been thriving in both Hollywood and public consciousness for almost 10 years now, and one of the biggest reasons has been the origin story. ""Spider-Man"" in 2002 revealed how the emotional power of a superhero's motivation can humanize even those characters with the most extraordinary powers. ""X-Men: First Class"" provides this oh so necessary background to a franchise whose last two film entries sacrificed depth of character for mutant and superpower pageantry. Wolverine might be the most popular character from the ""X-Men"" world, but the story of how Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr developed two different ideologies and became Professor X and Magneto encapsulates the comics' core. ""First Class"" recognizes this all the way.When the action-packed but unmoving ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" was announced, it came coupled with the hiring of a writer for ""X-Men Origins: Magneto."" ""First Class"" essentially gives us that story. This is a film about Erik's decision to become Magneto and Michael Fassbender revels in the spotlight as the powerful metal-bender who eventually leads what becomes the Brotherhood of Mutants. Fassbender will continue to be an acting force to reckon with in the future as he brings incredible depth to a character already written so well.""X-Men: First Class"" has to be the best-written superhero film since ""The Dark Knight"" and maybe ever behind the first two ""Spider-Man"" films. The script is loaded with thematic insights into the notion of being an outsider — the very notion that's made this comic so universally loved. The fascinating complexity of Magneto and Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) gets abundant attention and even the minor characters exude that feeling of learning to embrace and understand their powers and differences for the first time.The film opens with a scene directly from the original ""X-Men"": a young Erik at a concentration camp gets separated from his mother and bends a metal gate. A Nazi doctor takes note of this ability and meets with Erik, eventually killing his mother in front of him as to provoke the anger that triggers Erik's powers. That villain happens to be a mutant himself, one who in the '60s becomes known as Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon). Erik's one goal is to avenge that death. This background alone, that of a Holocaust survivor, makes Erik such a challenging character for an audience. In his pursuit of Shaw, Erik meets Charles (James McAvoy), whose own quest to find other mutants with the help of a young CIA agent named Moira McTaggert (Rose Byrne) also has him tracking Shaw. As it happens, Shaw's plan is to incite the Cuban Missile Crisis and start a nuclear war, setting the stage for mutant supremacy.Ian McKellan and Patrick Stewart are tough shoes to fill, but Fassbender and McAvoy make those characters their own while commanding the screen much like those venerated talents. Despite the film leaning heavily toward Magneto's story, McAvoy impresses here as a rallying leader figure. He has a youthful charisma that a bald wheelchair-bound Professor X never gets the luxury of wielding in the original films, but he demonstrates a maturity we've never gotten to see from McAvoy, who's always playing teenage or 20-something characters thanks to his boyish looks. The chemistry between him and Fassbender echoes that between McKellan and Stewart but in a much different way. With this film now in the ""X-Men"" canon, I think revisiting the original trilogy would actually make the original films' Magneto-Professor X subplots more powerful. That's how well the writing team captures their relationship and story despite the many other things going on.Director Matthew Vaughn strikes a nice balance between the grittiness of a ""Layer Cake"" and the superhero fun of ""Kick-Ass."" Vaughn milks the most he can out of a PG-13 rating as some gruesome deaths are left to the imagination or shown simply without the blood. Graphic enough or not, ""First Class"" keeps a dark tone with the exception of all the teenage mutants learning to control and showing off their powers. Even then, they remain firmly rooted in the script's core ideas and messages.""First Class"" forces you to keep track of several mutants, but only a couple feel hollow or ineffective. Despite being a comic book icon, Emma Frost appears to be nothing but a fembot as played by January Jones. A telepath like Professor X but with the ability to turn her skin into diamonds, she serves Shaw with seemingly no regard for her own interests, whatever they may be. Jones provides no edginess to the character, who essentially serves the same purpose as Mystique in the original films as the faithful but alluring evil ""assistant.""Lawrence as Raven aka Mystique and Nicholas Hoult as Hank aka Beast represent an effective use of subplot. Both play young mutants who possess powers that exhibit physical characteristics. As young people, they wrestle with questions of fitting in or embracing who they are, which echoes the larger Erik/Charles storyline on a smaller scale.Regardless your thoughts on ""X-Men: First Class"" as a stand-alone film, it unquestionably does great justice to the power of the ""X-Men"" story as a whole and reminds us why this message has universal qualities that all can identify with. Not only are there the questions of conformity, but also of human nature. The climax reminds us of one of the major differences between Charles and Erik: one has faith that humanity will come to accept mutants and the other doesn't. Although we've been trained to agree with Charles since Bryan Singer's first film in 2000, ""First Class"" helps us come to realize the power of Magneto's argument, proving he's not so much a villain, but a character with a darker and perhaps more realistic world view.The talent runs very deep in this retro-fitted backstory to the ""X-Men"" universe that refocuses the franchise for the better.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Action Film Indeed,"The biggest problem of these prequels is it's kind of messy to the original X-Men movies. Well, the filmmakers said this is a reboot but there are some references to the original X-Men series. Anyways, ""X-Men: First Class"" is fun and had a lot of great action. It's the biggest X-Men movie ever made and it's better than the last two X-Men movies.The filmmakers stated that this movie is a reboot but things from the old X-Men movies had an appearance to this movie. The problem of giving reference from the old X-Men movies to this reboot is it doesn't make this movie stand alone. Maybe the references only made for the laughs but if this is a prequel then it'll be a total mess.The best parts goes to the action(obviously). Matthew Vaughn knows how to make big and awesome action scenes. The best parts also goes to the scenes of Michael Fassbender. He really steals the show. He made Erik/Magneto more dangerous than ever. It's fun and intense to see him do something menacing. The rest of the cast is also pretty good. James McAvoy gave a lot of heart to his role. Him and Fassbender had good chemistry.Overall, ""X-Men First Class"" is good especially if you are looking for large scale action. I guess large scale is one thing that's missing to the first four X-Men films. X3 had a large scale action that left us hanging in the end. This one has the action finale that is intense and really big. Maybe the reference of the old X-Men movies is only made for the laughs. By the way this is Matthew Vaughn's thing. There's action plus comedy.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
What a disastrous start for the reboot.,"The first two X-men films, X-men (2000) and X-men 2: X-men United (2003), were brilliant movies. The next two films X-men: The Last Stand (2006) and X-men Origins: Wolverine (2009), were pretty good, so I was worried that the fifth film would be a downer, but then I saw the trailers for it and I was pumped and ready to go. The film has an excellent plot idea. The formation of the first team happens during the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 and two future enemies, Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto (Michael Fassbender), meet for the first time.But, that is where the fun ends. Unfortunately, the execution of this script is not good. There is a tedious boring buildup in the first half of the film and by the time the movie ends you wish you had those 2 1/2 hours back. It is a huge disappointment. It is slow and in parts, even silly. When attempting a film such as this, the fifth one in a series, you really need to pay attention to freshness. We already know that the mingling of Mutants with Humans is a metaphor for ethnic tensions in the real world. We also know all about Charles and Erik's history with each other, which I felt was not conveyed convincingly. The ""frenemies"" relationship that Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen conveyed in the first three movies was much more convincing and emotionally charged and they were well into the enemies' stage of the relationship by then.The soundtrack is awful and even some of the special effects look off. The dialogue is cartoonish and it really gives the impression that the second stringers made this film. It almost felt like I was watching one of those Live-Action Japanese super-hero shows, like the Power Rangers, especially when the soundtrack came into play. And, when you are attempting to do a big blockbuster prequel, based on one of the most popular super-hero teams ever, don't highlight one of the most boring, stupid characters ever, Banshee, with his silly sonic wings and his dorky sonic scream. I always hated that character. I'm sure I will watch this again someday since it is a part of a set and I can't complain too much since they made it through five movies before they screwed things up, but wow, what a sad mood I was in when I left the theater.6.4 (D+ MyGrade) = 6 IMDB",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Grand-Scale Storytelling Mixed With Superb Action,"Fox can breath easy again because I think it's safe to say the even the extreme fanboys will be putting down their pitchforks and torches and smile after seeing this amazing film. I know for a fact that general audiences are going to love this movie. I know some fans can be irrational and hold on to their hate because they expect certain things they read in their books but I can't seeing anyone being that irrational when faced with a result that delivers what First Class manages to deliver. It honestly is a genre-defining movie on a level with any comic based film that has come before it. Everything in this movie is exceedingly better than what Fox delivered in their last two efforts with this franchise. Going back to the beginning and re-hiring the guy that brought us those films was a splendid idea. The acting here is superb and the dialogue is rich. Every character feels absolutely believable no matter what abilities they have on display. No cartoonish villains or cheese in sight, every side of the issue is presented by people who believe they are the ones who are in the right and the underlying message of tolerance and bigotry only add to the depth of this film. If not a genre-defining movie than maybe it redefines the comic book genre. It restores the sense of epic adventure and grand-scale storytelling that we saw in X2. In fact, it perfectly complements that great film and probably surpasses it.This film is to X2 what Godfather 2 was to the Godfather. Seriously, First Class is an exceptional ""flashback"" look that links the best of the X-Men trilogy to the past. Instead of DeNiro playing young Vito Corleone we get James McAvoy as young Charles Xavier. Marlon Brando and Patrick Stewart made their respective characters popular but both were more fleshed out by incredible younger talent. I'm not placing the X-Men film itself on a par with the Godfather but both have become legendary in their particular genre. I am, however, saying McAvoy has a bright future as a complex and talented actor. Just like the young cast of Godfather 2 was legendary, the young cast of First Class has many great days and projects ahead of them.Love this entire cast but Michael Fassbender delivers the best performance with an amazing presence and command of the screen. Everyone was extraordinary. What many expected indeed happens. By that I mean every scene that Fassbender and McAvoy are in together absolutely sing. It won't surprise anyone to know that Kevin Bacon, Oliver Platt and Jennifer Lawrence are superb in supporting roles but Nicholas Hoult did stunning work as the Beast and deserves some love as well. January Jones and Rose Byrne are hot as can be but aren't just simple eye candy. Sure, the story is compelling and the action is amazing but the performances elevate this movie far above a common summer flick.Movie of the year so far...",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"""Fluid Pace: Classy and Stylish Prequel""","Director Matthew Vaughn is back for a more conventional super hero movie after wowing audiences with last year's ""Kick Ass."" He has redefined the ""X-Men"" series with a very stylish work of cinema as attempt two at creating a prequel is successful with ""X-Men: First Class."" Like ""Origins"" there are a plethora of characters that the audience has to worry about, however, with the smart use of time and space Vaughn develops the roots of various mutants with a fluid pace. James McAvoy (""Wanted"", ""The Conspirator"") and Michael Fassbender (""Inglourious Bastards"",""300"") set up the best on screen matchup of the year with their respective portrayals of Charles Xavier (Professor X) and Erik Lehnsherr (Magneto). The film commences as Erik is separated from his mother and killed by a man named Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon, ""Frost/Nixon""). This is followed by background of a young Charles as he befriends a very familiar character, Raven aka Mystic (Academy Award Nominee Jennifer Lawrence, ""Winter's Bone""). After this brief exposition, the audience is taken on a nonstop thrill ride as the mutants influence the Cold War. Erik embarks on a path of vengeance to kill Shaw. Since their last encounter Shaw has started his own mutant army and has a very dangerous right-hand woman, Emma Frost (January Jones, ""Mad Men""). Meanwhile, Charles and Raven are tracked down by a woman named Moira MacTaggert (Rose Byrne, ""Bridesmaids"") for their mutant expertise. Everything is connected in one way or another as the 1960s setting makes the film a cool cinematic rebirth to a new ""X-Men Trilogy.""The Good: Director Vaughn reinvents the film series with a very well written script and a dark old school spectacle. Combining the classic feel of the 1960s and the Marvel comic book guise with McAvoy's ingenious, sexy interpretation of Professor X and Fassbender's rugged vindictive portrayal of Magneto makes this the best superhero film of the year. The casting of two big name congenial actors as antagonists (Bacon and Jones) along with giving their motive multiple purposes is smart cinema. Cinematography finishes it all off with a mixture of ""Mad Men"" flare in a comic strip.The character development of Angel Salvadore (Zoe Kravitz, ""It's Kind of a Funny Story"") is very irritating, failing to produce a motive for her later actions. This can be attributed to the fact that even though Vaughn does a good job juggling the plethora of characters, it is inevitable that one falls through the cracks. Also, the fast pace of the film foreshadows a climatic ending which in actuality fails to impress after the interminable build up.Vaughn is following in Christopher Nolan's footsteps as he transforms his second superhero comic into motion picture form. He uses more of a comic book approach than Nolan casting to perfection and creating one of the best prequels to ever be made.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Solid action, overrated film","It definitely got the action right, and it's so loaded with fancy mutant superpowers that any X-Men fan will surely love it. The pacing is good, both directing and acting are decent, and overall it does have the potential to deliver a great deal of entertainment to sci-fi and action lovers. Unfortunately, it's also pretty far from a perfect film. The plot is predictable, the scriptwriting is extremely cheesy, and several themes were copied directly from X-Men (2000) and X2 (2003). Predictable? Given that it's a prequel the ending is bound to be given, but when everything until then is about equally obvious, the narrative clearly has a problem. Cheesy? This film has so many so awkwardly unnatural and over-the-top dramatic lines it's almost physically painful to watch at times. Unoriginal? The fact that the entire background for Erik is based on the same themes as the background for Wolverine as presented in X2, and that this background defines the recurring themes of First Class speaks for itself. The thing that bothered me the most, though, was that the film encompassed so many interesting stories and managed to connect them and properly attach them to the main story - but that it constantly felt like it never got the chance to actually explore any of them sufficiently to make them more than superficial add-ons. Could it be that what the narrative here really needed was less action, less superpowers, and more emphasis on the actual characters?",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An Excellent Prequel With a Compelling Storyline and Exciting Action Sequences; First-Class Entertainment,"""X-Men: First Class"" is an excellent prequel to the original ""X-Men"" trilogy. It has a compelling storyline chronicling the adventures of Professor X and Magneto, or should I say, Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr before they became enemies, as depicted in the three movies that form the original ""X-Men"" trilogy. Not only a compelling storyline, but ""First Class"" also promises amazing sequences of intense action.""First Class"" chronicles the adventures of Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr before they became enemies. Set in 1962 during the Cuban Missile Crisis, the two met during a mission in which Xavier and the CIAs are trying to track down a guy named Sebastian Shaw, who apparently is a mutant and acts as a threat to the world. In that time, Xavier found Lensherr trying to stop Shaw from getting away using his mutant powers and told him to let it go as continuing to do so will result in the drowning of Lensherr and Xavier. Later, Lensherr and Xavier become allies and learn of Shaw's intentions of starting World War 3 that would bring mutants into rulers of the world with most of the world in turmoil. Xavier and Lensherr then decide to recruit other mutants and create a mini mutant army to stop Shaw from igniting the start of World War 3. Apart from stopping Shaw, ""First Class"" also tells the story of how Xavier and Lensherr became enemies and split the first generation of X-Men.""First Class"" is truly a fantastic prequel to the popular ""X-Men"" series. With a compelling storyline, it has action-packed sequences that would keep audiences hooked until the end. The action sequences are much more exciting than that of ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"". The fighting scenes were very entertaining and should be enjoyed by audiences.Besides the action sequences, the script, and the special effects of the film were excellent. The script had no awkward lines and the special effects of the film were real and life-like. The acting was also great and there was no problem with it. Well done!Humor also plays a role in this film. In serious moments, sometimes to cheer the audiences up, humor is added. The jokes and humor in the movie was pretty funny.Overall, ""First Class"" is a mesmerizing mixture of a compelling storyline, action-packed sequences, amazing special effects, and funny jokes. Matthew Vaughn has crafted a fantastic prequel that serves as a pleasant addition to the ""X-Men"" series (although ""Wolverine"" was disappointing). This movie has great storytelling and awesome sequences of intense action.In terms of recommendation, ""First Class"" is a must-watch summer movie that should be on your list of must-see summer blockbusters of 2011. The compelling storyline will keep audiences interested, the fighting scenes should keep audiences excited, and the special effects should make audiences satisfied with the film. Anyone disappointed with the last ""X- Men"" movie, ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"", should be relieved after watching the new, fresh, and amazing ""X-Men: First Class"".""X-Men: First Class"" is truly first-class entertainment.Prince AJB's Rating: 10/10 (Excellent)Thank you for reading my review on ""X-Men: First Class"".

A very good and fresh prequel/reboot,"I liked this movie a great deal, while not as good as the first two movies it is an improvement on Wolverine. It is not among my favourite superhero movie but I can think of worse. It is not perfect by all means, while it was good to start with with a touch of atmosphere some of the music later on became rather generic and Jennifer Lawrence I had mixed feelings on, great looks and personality but sometimes forced delivery and her character being not as well developed as the rest. The visuals however are spectacular, with imaginative photography and editing and first-class special effects, costumes, lighting and settings. The story is mostly compelling with the action/thriller based moments genuinely intense and cracking while making way for some nuances on the social and political side of things. The script is well written too with some memorable lines, the film is well paced generally and Matthew Vaughan's direction is what makes the film so fresh. The acting is fine mostly, Kevin Bacon is a good and charismatic villain but James McAvoy and especially Michael Fassbender are terrific. Overall, very good and fresh. 8/10 Bethany Cox",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
First mission,"The X Men trilogy seems to have been nicely wrapped up. Of course 20th Century Fox do not want the film rights to revert to Marvel films.So they have to continue the series either with the Wolverine spinoff's or in this case with the prequels.X-Men First Class should not had worked but be seen as a cheap knock off prequel. However director Matthew Vaughn has injected a lot of love and verve here.Like X-Men 1, the film starts in a concentration camp during World War 2 where Dr Schmidt/Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) is experimenting on Jews and Mutants including a young boy called Erik Lensherr.In New York City, a telepathic boy, Charles Xavier meets a young shape-shifter called Raven (Jennifer Lawrence), whose natural form is a scaly blue-skin.Xavier invites her to live with his family as a sort of foster sister.After graduation from Oxford University, Xavier later meets the more volatile Lensherr who discovers that Shaw is also a powerful mutant and wants to take him down for what he did to him in World War 2.Yet at the same time there is something about Shaw's outlook that attracts Lensherr and this causes friction with Xavier.Here is an origins story that really meshes with the X-Men films as we see the forming of the friendship with Professor X (James McAvoy) and Erik Lensherr/Magneto (Michael Fassbender.)Both actors excel in their roles. You root for both of these characters even though the seeds for their rivalry has already been sown.The film has great production design and costumes. It shows as the film is set in the past and uses historical events such as the Cold War and the Cuban missile crisis to drive the story along.The performances from Kevin Bacon as the villain is instrumental in making the film work. He is a despicable villain and amoral.He is the one that points Magneto the dark side that not matter what good the mutants do, humans will never accept them.I was sceptical of how good the film would be when it was announced, thinking this as a cynical milking of the franchise.Instead it has breathed new life to the X-Men films in more ways than the Wolverine spin off did.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Will always be my favorite,"I grew up watching the Xmen animation and the early 2000s movies, but never did considered myself a big XMen fans. I only know and like Storm during that age.This movie still didn't turned me into a big X-Men fan but I am a big fan of this movie. I think the casting of young Charles and Erik were perfect.This is the movie that introduced me to Michael Fassbender and I became his biggest fan. Unfortunately his role after this movies were never as good as Magneto. I do loved him in Fincher's the Killer so thank you for that...And always been the biggest fan of James McAvoy since his Atonement... becoming Jane... and the movie with whats her name and her piggy's nose. Big fan James! But him as Charles was mind blowing. Truly the perfect fit and chemistry with Michael.The story was thrilling. Lots of action scenes that used the mutant powers in an interesting way and they introduced new characters pretty good too. Even the cameos.The music by Henry Jackman is definitely iconic. I did missed hearing his soundtracks in the later movies. The First Class theme is so well done and an earworm. The theme song also warmed up to me as well.Compared to the latter movie, I think this movie set the reboot well. Too bad they didn't use what Matthew Vaughn has created to the fullest. The relationship of charles and erik was wonderful in this movie and I would have like to see it continued more in the later movie (semi excludong doft).

*A Fresh Start*,"!! Possible Spoilers!!*X-Men: First Class* is a breath of fresh air in the X-Men franchise. It serves as a compelling origin story, exploring the formative years of Professor X and Magneto. Director Matthew Vaughn crafts a stylish and energetic film that balances character development with thrilling action sequences.The film excels in its portrayal of the complex relationship between Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and Erik Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender). Their dynamic is the heart of the story, showcasing their friendship, rivalry, and eventual ideological divide. The supporting cast, including Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique, Nicholas Hoult as Beast, and January Jones as Emma Frost, deliver strong performances.Set against the backdrop of the Cold War, *First Class* offers a unique perspective on the mutant world. The film's visual style is both retro and futuristic, capturing the essence of the 1960s while showcasing impressive special effects. The action sequences are well-choreographed and visually striking, complementing the film's overall tone.The film's exploration of the mutant's origins, particularly through the character of Sebastian Shaw, provides a compelling antagonist. Shaw's manipulation of historical events, using mutants for his own ends, adds a layer of complexity to the narrative.The introduction of the younger versions of familiar characters like Beast, Mystique, and Havok is executed well. Jennifer Lawrence's portrayal of Mystique is particularly noteworthy, showcasing the character's vulnerability and her eventual transformation into a hardened warrior.The climactic confrontation between the X-Men and Sebastian Shaw's team is a thrilling spectacle, with the use of Cerebro to amplify the mutants' powers being a standout moment. However, the film's ending, while setting up the future of the franchise, leaves some loose ends, such as the fate of characters like Moira MacTaggert.While not without its flaws, *X-Men: First Class* is a successful reboot that revitalizes the franchise. It provides a strong foundation for future installments while offering a compelling origin story for some of the most iconic characters in comic book history. It offers a new generation of fans an engaging introduction to the X-Men while providing long-time fans with a satisfying origin story.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Great movie! Great actors! best prequel yet!,"usually I am not a fan of marvel comics, but i made an exception for this one :) If you followed the comic book series, it uses similarities from the comics to the movie. And we also get a cameo appearance from Hugh Jackman(Wolverine). I may have not noticed the infamous stan lee appearance that he always makes in the movies that deal with his comics. But I am sure it was there. I think its a great movie for ages 5 to adult. It has history, very mild violence, some comedy, drama, and romance. All the elements to live up to the X-Men franchise. It is not at all disappointing if you have knowledge of the other movies or the comic book series. That is the only flaw I see. It is definitely a tribute to the fans of X-Men. Personally I am a DC comic books fan, but if you are a comic fan or just a fan of the movie series your in for a treat :) but if you have no knowledge of either of those things you will be disappointed.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Great way to reboot the franchise!,"I'm surprised I didn't write a review when I first saw in theaters. I must admit that I wasn't necessarily looking forward to it back then because 1. Every previous movie had been worse than the precedent, and 2. I don't like prequels in general. But I was very gladly surprised by how well done and fun they managed to make this movie. As a lifelong X-Men comic book fan I was also very happy they tried to stay close to the original material, maybe more so than with previous movies. In hindsight though, it's clear that they were perfectly setting up the next movie, Days of Future Past, which I still think is the pinnacle X-Men movies; so for that if nothing else, I strongly recommend First Class.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Excellent effects and an unusually strong storyline.,"As if the X-Men franchise was not complicated enough, what with spin off Wolverine and more to come, we now go back to basics with a prequel set in the 1960's, complete with reasonable period detail.The film starts, not unsurprisingly, with the cause of Magneto's reason to hate. Mother and young son are swept up in the persecution of Jews, led by a scene stealing Nazi doctor, Sebastian Shaw. Kevin Bacon, an inspired and unlikely casting choice for this particular role. Whether such background material is suitable for a pure entertainment film, is perhaps debatable but the opening scene is strong and very effective.Perhaps anything that makes a new generation hit Wikipedia to find out more, is no bad thing.Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto (Fassbender) has every intention of enjoying his revenge stone cold and follows the ex-Nazi trail through South America and ending with an early standoff with his nemesis. There follows a very effective SFX scene with a quite spectacular use of a super yachts anchor chain, possibly the most realistic CGI sequence in the film.The story switches to Charles Xavier (James McAvoy), initially using his telepathic powers to seduce women in leafy Oxford, whilst attempting to persuade his sister Raven/Mystique (Lawrence) that turning blue occasionally is really not the end of the world.Charles and Erik come together in an uneasy friendship, following Erik's doomed attempt to kill Sebastian and his henchwoman Emma Frost (January Jones), a character that struggles to keep her clothes on throughout the film.The pair come to the attention of the CIA via agent MacTaggert (Rosie Byrne), who discovers mutants led by Sebastian, are keen to push both the USSR and USA towards World War III. A task made easier as the Cuban missile crisis looms large with the very real possibility of nuclear Armageddon.The CIA initially are somewhat reluctant to trust the mutants, but subsequently realise their potential and place them under the very loose control of MIB agent (Oliver Platt), who happens to have a ready built facility for just such an eventuality.The team recruits more mutants and soon we have, Beast (Hoult), Havoc (Lucas Till), Darwin (Gathegi) and Angel (Kravitz) in training for the coming battle ahead.The film is a risky move, prequels or reboots are not always successful; certainly we have a talented cast, good script and competent director in the form of Matthew Vaughan. The studio knows that a successful restart should spawn at least another film, if not two.On the basis of this film they need not worry, this as good as it gets for a comic book reboot. X-Men never intended to emulate the moral complexity and darkness of the Batman franchise, the series always represented a brighter, more colourful world and that tone generally continues here.There are certainly plenty of scantily clad women to attract the target audience but they do get some decent screen time and something to do, notably Jones and Byrne.There is occasional humour to lighten the mood and Fassbender and MacAvoy make a good job of recreating the characters we already know. Bacon is a stand out, especially in the earlier scenes, although there is the faintest whiff of Austin Powers as the story progresses but this is a minor quibble.The film does lag slightly in the middle phase, after a very strong start but picks up for a rousing although necessarily CGI heavy, send off. Most loose ends are tidied up and the stage is set for X-Men the ""middle years"".Whether audiences need another rebooted comic book franchise, remains to be seen but this is quality fare and certainly no quick cash in.SummaryYet another comic book blockbuster but representing solid entertainment, with some fine character recreation, excellent effects and an unusually strong storyline.Recommendedhttp://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Entertaining, but doesn't hold up.","Watching all the x-men films, preparing for Deadpool & Wolverine, and I was most excited for this film First Class... it was entertaining and worth watching, but not as great as the hype.At first watch, the pacing is rushed. The film leans on 1960s tropes as filler for character development. And it rushes through scenes, likely because of the enormous ensemble cast.The first few scenes in the 1960s were handsome and well done. But the scenery and sets become heavily CGI and gimmicky the second half.Fassbender shines in his role, and was by far the best part of the film. I'd watch him as Magneto 8 days a week.The wide angle and broad shots are too zoomed out, and make you feel really removed and like you're bouncing around the movie from scene to scene.For me, I actually preferred the very first X-men film more than this prequel 'reboot'.

Superhero prequel fails to breathe new life into tired franchise,"X-MEN: FIRST CLASS is a film that aims to breathe new life into a somewhat tired franchise (so far consisting of the original trilogy and two stand-alone Wolverine stories) by telling the back story of the Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen characters from the original movies. Thus we're handed a bright young cast of up-and-comers who engage in their own superhero adventures.The setting is the early '60s, at the height of the Cold War. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender, playing the early versions of Stewart and McKellen respectively, recruit some familiar and not-so familiar mutants to help them wage a war against generic bad guy Kevin Bacon. What follows is watchable but overlong and fairly underwhelming, offering exactly the kind of CGI-heavy spectacle as the other films in the series while failing to engage the brain properly at any time.It goes without saying that McAvoy and Fassbender - particularly the latter - are by far the best things in this movie. The rest of the cast, including Jennifer Lawrence, are lacklustre and some of them, such as Nicholas Hoult playing a goofy boffin, are downright embarrassing. Bacon's on autopilot, while Rose Byrne gives one of the most excruciatingly wooden turns I've seen in recent months, a surprise given she was pretty good in previous movies like SUNSHINE and 28 WEEKS LATER.Like the STAR WARS prequels, this film was conceived of a way of starting afresh while at the same time bringing back some old and much-loved characters who are a guaranteed box-office draw. But the film rings fairly hollow, and while it works as a bit of spectacle, it's one of those movies you forget about straight after. It says something that the most excitement I had was seeing one of my favourite character actors, Michael Ironside, in a role amounting to little more than a cameo as a ship's captain. I find Matthew Vaughn a hit and miss director and this is more miss than hit, unfortunately.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Greatest ever Prequel movie.  This XMEN is truly First Class,"Did the X-men film makers name this entry, First Class because of its quality? That was a bit arrogant of them to do that, isn't it?

This is the only prequel movie of any series or franchise that is better than its originals. This film simply got it right in nearly every area. Mainly and crucially it got it right in the motivation, friendship/enemy developments of the main protagonists, Charles and Erik. The character that truly stands out is Erik/Magneto played brilliantly by Michael Fassbender, an ultra cool, dangerous, yet lost soul enraptured with inner hatred and turmoil. Whenever he gets into action or at an emotional high, he carries the most exciting and thrilling piece of aura about him complemented with a pulsating piece of soundtrack! Soundtracks generally should be subtle to drive a story but here, an exception can be made, as it enhanced an already bad-ass character into something I would disturbingly worship. Charles's journey was also done extremely well (played with incredible zest by James McAvory), as we see him shake off his young slightly womanising immaturity (which was fun to watch) ready to take on a huge responsibility for his own kind and to pursue his belief that there can be harmony between mutants and humans, an ideology that is in complete contrast to his friend Erik's who believes in the survival of his own kind, at any cost. Survival of the fittest. But no film can be truly great without a great villain. That box was ticked by Kevin Bacon's evil evil Nazi general and...boy is he evil and so damn COOL. I think I need help, I am being overdosed with evil coolness.Its the character drives, motivations, and relationships that truly elevates this superhero film above most others. The pacing was exquisite and energetic. The tone was deliciously vibrant due to its 1960s backdrop. The actors were superb, all of them. Aside from Charles and Erik, Raven/Mystique journey was truly moving. Other characters also had enough attention for us to be interested in their fates. Actors will only perform their best when there is good direction so kudos to a fantastic job by director Matthew Vaughan. The story itself was clever and intriguing, integrating the well known Cuban crisis history with the fictitious mutant evolution.I admit continuity with previous X-Men films is not tight, it is a bit loose despite obvious references to the previous X-men movies. But I would say it has better continuity than the Star Wars prequels.There was just so much joy to be had in this film that I feel rather overwhelmed by it as I was not expecting a superhero movie with this kind character depth. Only Nolan's Batman movies retain that crown but this is a different universe, colourful, vibrant, intelligent and truly entertaining.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
What's Not To Love? Superb In Every Way!,"Just like X2, First Class is a film classic that will endure and resonate for years to come. Bring on the Next Class!Both Erik and Charles are two of the coolest and most charismatic characters to ever hit the big screen. Now I know why Magneto was reading ""The Man Who Would Be King"" in X2! I really love this film. The acting is superb and the dialogue is rich. Every character feels believable. No cartoonish villains, every side of the issue is presented by people who believe they are the ones who are in the right, and honestly felt that way. This movie delivers on its characters, and the action scenes are there only to advance plot and build character, and that's the best kind of action sequences. The X-Men have hit their stride again and while still at Fox... go figure!Xavier is a fleshed out and complex character. Mystique proves why she's a fan favorite. Magneto is a vicious but charming and persuasive bastard. Hank is a tragic and endearing figure. Alex is filled with emotion. Darwin is pure empathy. Emma is as sexy as sin. Shaw is a perfect villain. The FX is Oscar worthy. What's not to love?",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Excellent movie.,"Now I'm sure everyone knows who the X-Men are and know about this movie. The trailer really didn't look impressive at all and if I wasn't such a huge Michael Fassbender fan, I probably would have waited to see this movie on DVD. I saw this the day it was released but my computer got a virus so I haven't been able to get a review out until now.Keep in mind I'm a little biased since my favorite actor plays Magneto but I absolutely loved this movie. Sure this isn't about the original X-Men but I feel like movies and comic books are two different entities and if you like one and not the other then that's fine. I used to get upset about stuff not being faithful adaptations but now I don't care since all it does is help people find out about something and they hopefully want to find out more about it and find the original material.The thing that makes this movie so great is that it's not really a superhero movie. I mean sure there are mutants with powers but this movie puts way more emphasis on the story and the main characters as opposed to nonstop action or way to many mutants with powers like in X-Men The Last Stand. This movie is basically a drama with superheroes in it. They utilized Fassbender and McAvoy to a great extent and Jennifer Lawrence (Mystique) and Kevin Bacon (Sebastian Shaw) did great as well.I liked that they made the movie very dark (as dark as they could make it for PG13) much like The Dark Knight but added in a fair amount of light hearted moments. Magneto was a dark serious person while Professor X was more of an easy going guy. I thought it was a nice touch in seeing how he acted when he was young.Of course there are a couple of nit picks I have with the movie. The kids weren't really given enough screen time but I guess it gave you just enough for the first movie and hopefully we get to see more of them in sequels. Also I liked January Jones in Mad Men but she really does not do any good as Emma Frost. Sure she's good to look at but she's given most of the screen time out of Kevin Bacons henchmen which is weird since she can't really act well. Also I don't think Azazel and Riptide even talk at all during the movie.Overall this has been my favorite movie so far this year. I plan on seeing Super 8 this week so we'll see if that can top this movie. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A fine reboot to boot,"Well let's be completely honest Hollywood had lost their control over the X-men film-saga when ""the last stand"" came out. The bigger is better principle isn't always the right way to go. And it's a shame they need reboots to deal with the issues created by shitty films.It's even worse when the reboot fail. But this is NOT the case with ""X-men: first class"". I was afraid I had seen a bit too much promo clips and so on. But even this was not the case. I can gladly say the promo's don't give away too much.The story doesn't really climax in the movie. When Michael Fassbender's Magneto is faced with Kevin Bacon's character, it builds up to a lot more expectations than what is delivered on screen but this being said the film introduces new characters which is more than welcome. And again in comparison to ""Last stand"" they introduce them more properly. It's not here is character Y, and this is his death, we needed somebody to kill.After seeing this I'm hoping Marvel will continue making movies but I'm also very much so actually hoping they do this with eye for detail, respect to the intricate story lines and quality of the film!In ""First Class"" they prove they haven't lost the battle with ""X-men""!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
First Class all around!!!,"I went to see X-Men: First Class on Saturday afternoon with my lovely wife. As the end credits rolled a sense of real satisfaction from watching an incredibly solid film washed over me. I liked the movie a ton but would my wife feel the same? She hasn't read many comics and doesn't follow the exploits of most superheroes. In other words, she represents the general audience when it comes to superhero fare. The film was able to garner high praise from her with the epic statement, ""If you see the guy in our building who sells bootleg DVDs and if he's got X-Men: First Class, buy it. I want to see it again.""Now kiddies, I by no means condone or comply with the purchasing of pirated videos. I categorically do not! But if that is your cup of tea who am I to judge. But the fact that my wife a non-comic book fan was totally enthralled and entertained by this film is no small feat. I know I annoy the hell out of her with my fan boy rants and ravings, but she tolerates it because she loves me. Aw! But I digress.X-Men: First Class hit so many nails on the head it should apply for a carpentry license. The casting of James McAvoy as Professor X and Michael Fassbender as Magneto originally drew some skepticism from this humble reviewer. Patrick Stewart and Sir Ian MacKellen seemed to be born to play the roles they made even more famous in the previous three X-Men films. How could McAvoy and Fassbender top these fine thespians? They didn't top them but they definitely matched them. McAvoy, who was told not to do a Stewart impersonation, gave the role of young Professor X a sense of joy, wonderment and hope that Stewart's portrayal lacked; which isn't knocking Stewart, by no means. X-men: First Class portrays a Charles Xavier before he became wheelchair-bound, so of course his world would seem a little brighter and rose-colored. McAvoy pulls off this Pollyanna portrayal with perfect aplomb. McAvoy is one of the best young actors of our time. He is solid in everything he does. See Wanted, Atonement and The Last King of Scotland to see how good he is.Michael Fassbender's portrayal as Magneto, Master of Magnetism, is spot on. While Sir Ian played Magneto as a man full of pi$$ and vinegar that has seen it all, Fassbender meanwhile plays the future villain exactly the same but with a little bit more gravitas and pathos. Fassbender's portrayal is so human you can't help but like his Erik. Even as Magneto's quest for revenge begins to take permanent root, gut- wrenchingly you begin to actually root for the man even though you know he will become the murderously human-hating purveyor of Superiority.Director Matthew Vaughn masterfully weaves a tapestry of swinging 1960's James Bond-like intrigue, Munich-style man-hunting and Marvel Comics mayhem with pitch perfect plot and pacing. Together, this becomes a crazy quilt of must-see appeal. Vaughn shows us three dimensional characters that we want to know even more about. Because of his direction and assist with the script, Vaughn gives us a Mystique we never saw in the first three films. She goes from partially- clad set piece to full-fledged character as portrayed by Oscar-nominee Jennifer Lawrence.When I first heard about Kevin Bacon playing Sebastian Shaw, I must admit it gave me pause. I was like, ""Mr. Footloose himself playing one of the nastiest X-Men villains of all time? No way""! But after seeing X- Men: First Class, my world view was a little shaken. Now Bacon is a great actor, we all know this, but sometimes folks are miscast; Jessica Alba's Invisible Woman anyone? After seeing Bacon do his version of a Bond villain I had to admit it; he did his thing! That's a term used in around the neighborhood. With his mutant ability to absorb energy, Bacon's Shaw absorbed our attention with his slick oiliness every time he was on screen.Honorable mentions go out to Rose Byrne as Moira MacTaggert, Nicholas Hoult as Beast and January Jones (wooden acting didn't bother me here) as Emma Frost for their performances. It was cool to see Moira finally fleshed out by a capable actress in Byrne. And Hoult was nerdy-fun as hairy Hank McCoy. Hopefully we'll see more of this actor in the future. Other X-Men, Banshee (Caleb Landry Jones) and Havok (Lucas Till) are given appropriate screen time and give the film much needed comedy relief.Make sure you see the mutant gathering montage in the middle of the movie. There are some mutant cameos not to be missed; one in particular is laugh out loud funny.X-Men: First Class is definitely on the level of X2 and easily surpasses the miss that was X-3. Although X-Men: First Class, plays fast and loose with not only the comics' continuity but the previous movies as well, I suggest checking that simple fact at the door when seeing this film. I know there will be Hardcore fans who won't be able to get past that but please get over yourself otherwise you will be missing one of the better superhero films ever made.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Movie of the year!!!,"WOW!!! Mathew Vaughn has done it again! This absolutely wipes the floor with x men origins wolverine and X men the last stand, and in my opinion is even better then x men 1 and 2. The story is so well told, all the characters are brilliantly fleshed out and every one of them either has a really interesting character arc or is just awesome or funny. The script is perfect ranging from effective humour, to really dark but emotional scenes (especially a stand out one in a concentration camp), the action is both inventive and astounding with some very clever uses of powers. But the best thing about this is how well every character is explored and how they show some real depth here, in my opinion this is even better intellectually then the dark knight. Everyone gives a great performance too. Nicholaus Hault brings pain and frustration to the character of beast expertly, as does Jenifer Laurence to the character of mystique. but ultimately this is a film about Charles and Erik and when they need to James Mcavoy and Michel Fassbender really display magnificent acting capabilities and presence, the film charts those two coming together as friends and then falling apart, and it does so brilliantly and there performances cement this. I cant recommend X- men first class enough See more",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"It's textured, layered and flat out FUN. Works on so many levels. Movie of The Year.","Overall, X-Men is a great film. It features outstanding performances (Fassbender and McAvoy are amazing), a smart script, and plenty of action. I love the fact that when we meet Erik (Fassbender) in this film, his life is more about revenge than anything else. Here, he's a lone wolf and he's on a very specific mission and he's Machiavellian in his approach to whatever ends justify the means. I also loved that we get to see why both Xavier and Erik want to be friends. You see the moment they meet. You don't just start the film and they're buddies and that's exactly what the story requires. We also get to see something quite tragic and deep about their relationship because it's not a small thing that makes it crumble. It's only one element in their relationship but it's as complex as it gets. This film is just so textured and layered and that's refreshing in so many ways.They really have delivered a rarity in Hollywood – a prequel that not only outperforms the original film, but one that gives the audience credit. If you really want to enjoy the subtleties of First Class you should see at least the first two X-Men first. It's certainly not necessary because this films stands up all on its own but it makes it even more interesting. No time is wasted or needed explaining what they are about to set up but it's fascinating to see these characters introduced and eventually grow to what they become. We're treated to character and story development, expanding the X-Men saga rather than retelling it for everyone whom missed the first installment. Personally, I'm pleasantly amazed that Fox of all studios allowed the release of a blockbuster sequel that doesn't cater to the lowest common denominator. It's refreshing to be treated as something other than a drooling movie-going moron. X-Men First Class works on so many levels and I absolutely love it!If you are concerned that this film may not live up to the hype, don't be. If this instant classic isn't the best movie of 2011, then this will truly be the best year in cinematic history. First Class is just flat out awesome.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
This film is goooooooooood! Watch it.,"I believe most people understand the concept of the x-men by now. If you have seen the previous 3 x-men, you will definitely say this blows them away completely.I have got to say, I found the previous 3 x-men films really boring. This prequel definitely has the edge and the director got it right! It follows how the x-men started and who these two main characters are.The female characters are really sexy! Really sexy! I can't believe the cleavage in this film. Where did they find these characters.This is a definite watchable film.Anyway, without boring people - please watch it! It is on the same wavelength of batman alike. Very nice and good film at it's best!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
NOT an 8+ movie....C'mon people,"Look, I liked it. It was a quality film and the acting was good enough. But to rate this movie at 8+ is just a bit ludicrous. After all this is a movie about a comic book; not a character study or a cinematically beautiful piece worthy of Oscar acknowledgment. By placing an 8rating on this movie places it in the category of Godfather, Pulp Fiction, Shawshank, Shining, Requiem, etc. And it is just not worthy of that company based purely on its merits as a film. It is extremely popular and will probably sell many tickets, but that does not mean it should be so highly rated. I only felt like writing this review because looking at the top250 I see too many GOOD movies with mass appeal rated over more quality works that saw less tickets sales. Dark Knight at 10!? Haha, no sir. This movie follows that theme - quality fun summer flick but by no means a movie that should broach the 8 star rating. When reviewing films one doesn't need to be a prude but one definitely needs to use context...",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
it's the X men can't help but love'em,"The X-Men are my favorite comic. The closest sci-fi comics ever got to real science fiction. Un like most comics its characters are far from cartoons, they're 3D characters - so no wonder they didn't need to add the special effect. The movie was true to these aspects of the comic, it even kept some of the original story, I wish it was even closer, but understand the wish to tell the story differently so I'm pleased with the fact that the concept remained the same. Using a real historic event as the backdrop to the story is also a good addition. And above all the actors all give their share to the final outcome. Kevin Bacon is superb, Michael Fassbender also excels. But as I said they all do well, and once you believe the characters and the story is good, what else is there to ask.To sum it all: keeping the tradition of good X-man renditions in-fact it's better than the last of the original trio (didn't see Wolverine yet). So if you like the comic - go see it, if you like good thought provoking sci-fi go see it too, if you're none of the above you probably won't be reading this at all so that's it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Dense drama is this summer's blockbuster to beat,"Comparisons can be made to Christopher Nolan's reboot of Batman, where scripting and story are refined and the genre is examined. Commonly in these types of films there are scenes of obligatory rivalry, villainy, comedy, exposition, where the dialogue is clunky and the scenario is cliché. A good example of this is the movie ""X Men Origins: Wolverine"". A good measure of a bad script is when your characters end up in a bar. The bar is the place you write your characters when you don't have any original ideas. To my memory, there are only a couple very brief scenes in a bar in XM:FC. And these sparse bar scenes are for mainly for comedic gain.This dense origin script knew what central themes it was examining before it set about to make action sequences. In other words, action scenes don't exist just for the sake of action. Characters have motivations that drive the action. The only place I might fault the storyline is trying to embed itself into the Cuban Missile Crisis. The antagonist seems to have free access to anywhere and can somehow easily convince the powers that be to instigate nuclear war. Fortunately, it doesn't matter since Kevin Bacon makes a great villain. I have never been a big fan of Kevin Bacon, but he shines in certain moments, like in ""Mystic River"" or ""Animal House"". Here he is allowed to be creepy in a very convincing way, almost making the extra aspect of possessing special powers unnecessary.Although there is much buzz about Michael Fassbinder (I raved about him myself in my review of ""Inglorious Basterds""), I was impressed by the performance of James McAvoy. He takes on the persona of a younger Sherlock Holmes. He is convincing when he puts his fingers to his temple in order to project his mind. This type of activity could easily come across as silly if not approached properly. The Magneto character without much surprise is as strong as Darth Vader in screen presence. The audience almost trembles as Magneto occupies the screen, ready to get angry at his past.One thing about this tentpole film is that it resembles the original X Men film, where emphasis was placed on character instead of action. Both these films have limited action sequences. It is actually refreshing to not require some over-the-top CGI to have a good time during the summer blockbuster season. Case in point is the noisy ""Transformers 2"", where it was just meaningless nonstop destruction. The director Matthew Vaughn infused elements of his strong film ""Kick Ass"" into XM:FC. There are scenes where teenagers work out together their issues, sometimes not knowing if their choices are the right answer. Teenage struggles work as a metaphor with having special powers. They struggle with their identity, deal with sexuality, and personal appearance. It takes very dedicated script writing to flesh out the large number of characters being juggled around in this story. Much credit must go to the screenplay writer, even though Bryan Singer wrote the story.The music by Henry Jackman is hardly original, it borrows heavily from the memorable soundtrack of ""Inception"", including the use of guitar to add texture to the pulsing strings, etc. Perhaps big summer films require the wall-to-wall bombastic music to carry the momentum, and I won't deny it works. But you sometimes wonder if this is a situation where the editor puts temp music in, in this case ""Inception"", and the director gets married to it. This diminishes the ability for the soundtrack composer to come up with something unique. It even sounds like Jackman hired Johnny Marr again to do the guitar.As for the direction, there is a lot that could have gone wrong. There is a fine balance with story pacing. You want to keep the momentum going without losing the beats necessary to establish emotion. Again, this is done to perfection in Nolan's Batman series. In XM:FC the intelligence of the main characters comes across with very competent acting. So Vaughn should be commended for getting good performances from his cast. I expect to see this film again, primarily because it has so many characters with their arcs, that I need another viewing to take it all in. All the mutants introduced in this film are given situations that are explored. The special effects are top notch, except for a couple iffy wide shots, but they are not distracting. Speaking of not distracting, I am glad the producers didn't try any hokey 3D conversion for this flick.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Another great installment. But where to rank it!?,"I almost want to say 'hands down, best X-Men movie thus far' but I just cant decide. First class did have it all. The writing was pretty clever, the way they wrote the main story around the Cuban missile crisis. The actors portrayed every character flawlessly. There were beautiful women; beautiful men for that matter, and plenty of action and momentum to keep you pumped throughout the film. Even a cameo that made a few hairs stand up, from sheer BAD- ASS.We are inducting this movie into the franchise; and with honor I'd say. Its not a reboot or a sequel or even a prequel. Just another story line in the creative world of X-MEN. We started with the first 3 films followed by the epic spin off 'Origins: Wolverine' and now we get to witness how it all started with 'First Class'. These first four films success are greatly thanks to Wolverine. Played by, in every film, Hugh Jackman. Geniusly I am definitely gonna add. I think we can all agree, for sure, that Jackman cannot be out played for the role of everyones favorite X man. Not just the almost freakish way he physically looks like the character but the way he becomes Wolverine is what really takes you away. This is where the conflict comes in as far as where to rank the new installment, critically. Taking the franchise in a new direction, first class introduces characters not as popular as Wolverine. An X-Men movie without him!? This may be a disappointment to movie goers. Despite these new characters, you most definitely will not be disappointed.First off, I have to say excellent job to Michael Fassbender playing Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto. Right away, his performance makes the absence of wolverine extraneous and makes way for a character even more powerful and just as conflicted. Fassbender Plays magneto brilliantly as well. Before this film, Magneto was arguably, the top super villain created. Post film, I will say with confidence ""thee number one"" super villain. As its told in this film, Erik Lehnsherr is a Jewish German whose family is taken to concentration camps in 1944 Nazi Germany. But is emancipated by Sebastian Shaw played; wonderfully evil by Kevin Bacon, to be an apprentice slash lab rat. As Lehnsherr grows up, he is fueled by hate for what had happened to him and his family and sets out for revenge. He advances his powers with rage and anger, becoming an extremely powerful and deadly weapon. Within his campaign he meets a man named Charles Xavier, played by James McAvoy. Who for the first time in his life, gives Lehnsherr some sort of vision and feelings besides his tunneled focus for revenge charged by hate.McAvoy brings into being, a Professor X with a bit more spice then I would have expected, compared to his older self played perfectly by Patrick Stewart in the first three installments. Despite his early mild frat boy style we still see Xavier compose the authentic trait of compassion we all know to be Charles Xavier. It was a nice surprise to see a young, newly deemed professor, with other things on his mind, like girls and having fun rather then his life devoted focus for helping mutants and man kind alike. As we see the professor start to develop that life long devotion, James gives us a benevolent, yet thrilling ride into those big shoes Xavier will have to fill to become Professor X.With a mutual compassion for the discovery of new mutants, Together Erik and Xavior become a team, finding and offering mutants a chance for something great. We get to see mutants like Havok, and Beast played by Lucas Till and Nicholas Hoult and other familiars like the young Mystique played by Jennifer Lawrence. These young group of kids struggle to harness and control their great gifts, with the first of many lessons taught by Professor X. With common enemies, the team helps agent Moira MacTaggert, played by Rose Byrne, and the CIA find the extremely dangerous Sebastian Shaw. A mutant powerful enough to turn humans against each other using nuclear war, with the intention of the extinction of homo sapien and the rise of mutants.This is an epic adaptation and one of many possible story lines in the X-Men universe. Its a story of coming of age and fulfilling your responsibility for who you are meant to be. A tale of a two sided coin where on one side a man raised by hate and fear believes our species to be an ignorant race and will only fear what they do not understand. Which will lead to a violent vindication towards mutants, and a war to the death. While on the other side, another man believes that even though this may be true, there is good in everyone and this war will be fought to educate the world to result in peace and unity. No matter the side, war is inevitable and both sides will fight for their beliefs, at all costs.As a Marvel fan boy, keep um coming! There are so many characters and so many ways Marvel studios can take them. Maybe there are some things that didn't exactly happen in the very first comic book. Or maybe the time line is a bit off here or there. So what, these stories are wonderful cinematic adventures! We can rate these movies all day, and each film will see every spot on the rank line, but no doubt, each one are incredibly entertaining and totally fun to watch. If you're like me and these Marvel films bring you back to when you were Wolverine fighting Magneto on the playground at lunch, or if you have never even heard of the X-men you will enjoy them all. As far as rank goes 'Hands down best X-Men movie thus far' Why don't you guys see it, and let me know.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"X-Men First Class – The pre-boot of a dying franchise, directed by Matthew Vaughn (director of Kick Ass) and produced by Bryan Singer (directed X1 and 2), recipe for success?","Two years have gone by since the release of the last X film; X-Men Origins: Wolverine. This being the origin story of the franchise's most popular character, so naturally expectations were high. However, when the film turned out to be nothing more than an action flick lacking character development, story and general attention to detail many fans, including myself, felt cheated. Rumors of other Origin projects, this time focused on Magneto and Deadpool, took off and fizzled out as soon as X-Men First Class was announced. This at first seemed like a wild stab in the dark for the studio after Wolverine failed to deliver. However, it eventually became clear that it would fill in the history for several main characters at once; Professor X, Magneto, Mystique and Beast, as well as introducing several new heroes and villains to the screen. Sounds too good to be true right? Well fortunately, it isn't!This film may well be the best X-Men movie to date, rivaling only with X-Men 2. Finally there's something in this film that's been absent from the franchise for far too long: the ability to make us care about the characters. The majority of the film's characters are relatable and have their own personal conflicts such as insecurity, anger and loyalty. These are especially noticeable with James McAvoy's Professor X and Michael Fassbender's Magneto. Both actors have a brilliant fresh take on the characters. Professor X is far less serious than his previous portrayal. Yes he lectures students and advises the FBI, as you'd expect, but he's also out in the field fighting the bad guys with the rest of the team and is out drinking in bars when he's not on the job. He's young and it shows. Magneto here is vengeful, powerful but clearly human. He's been through some pretty dark stuff so has a right to be angry and Professor X knows this. These two together have great chemistry and their friendship feels real, even though we know that ultimately their views will separate them. The rest of the X-Men do get their time to shine, Mystique and Beast also deserve a mention for character chemistry, but they're all ultimately shadowed by Magneto and Professor X who seem to steal the show slightly. Although not all of First Class's villains are convincing, Kevin Bacon's Sebastian Shaw is casually brutal which really works for a threatening bad guy, and the bright red teleporting Azazel (yes, he is pretty much a red Nightcrawler) is pure ninja in a fight.Moving on to the action, the fights between the X-Men and the Hellfire Club are brilliant and even the training is great to watch. First Class really does have some great jaw dropper moments. Sadly the film does have a weakness, well, depending on how you look at it. First class doesn't quite seem to know where it stands with the other X-Men films in terms of continuity. Hence the term coined at the start of this review; pre-boot. I'm not going to list all the things that stop it from linking up with Origins: Wolverine or X3, but you might just have to pretend those films didn't happen for it to all make sense. Some of us already were anyway",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
No class,"Say, you wanted to see a bunch of sketches that explain the X-Men as we've come to know them; how Magneto came by the helmet, what threw Xavier on the wheelchair, a bunch of ironic reversals about who sides with who as eventually the deck is stacked. You will probably have a good time.Everything else is mostly dismal. When the arch-nemesis warns a bunch of fresh-cut mutants they are going to be 'enslaved' by the human majority, the filmmaker cuts to a close-up of the one among them who is black. It's this much without class, without some finesse. For the entire movie we fly back and forth; from Vegas, where the ideal place for the lavish, secret hideout - accessed no less by a revolving couch - is adjucent to a strip joint, to the 'concealed CIA base' that is a dozen acres covered with buildings that look like CIA. Or freely, magically transported outside the home of a Soviet general only there to be reminded that our presence could light the fuse of another world war.It is James Bond stuff at best. Like with James Bond, the filmmakers attempt to infuse some credulity to the comic-book shenanigans by situating them inside swathes of history that hold some familiarity and allure. So, everything is hastily crammed inside the box that reads Cold War history. There are ex-Nazis hiding out in Latin America - with a veiled reference to Colonia Dignidad. The climax is a liberal enactment of the Cuban missile crisis.Oh, we're served again with 'us and them' trite dilemmas, as in all the previous X-Men films. There are people who are understanding, awe-struck before the mysterious powers, but a handful of them; most are ignorant dumbasses or the scheming scum we have come to understand populate the upper echelons of the military - secret government aristocracy.What is basically left, is the noisy, effect-laden attractions; watch this because you can't think of a better movie where a submarine is lifted out of the water.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Just not that good,"I went in to this movie with pretty confident that I would be enjoying this movie. I'm not going to go as far as to say this movie was bad, but I found myself constantly waiting for something more. When you're just going to do a 'reboot' or 'reinvention' or whatever you want to call it, you don't need to go way the hell out of the way just making stuff up. Star Trek did a great job of keeping it simple. XMen-First Class is way too long. The key is doing more with less. You lose flow to the movie when you have these scenes that drag on and on trying to build up these relationships, that fans of the comic should assume already.Again, this movie wasn't bad, but it could have been a lot better. I recommend waiting until DVD to see this. It sets up well for other movies, but overall it was way too long and had too many corny scenes. Acting by the younger crowd was less-than-stellar.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
a great movie in its own right,"I've seen all the X-Men movies and I wasn't sure if I would have liked this one, too. I didn't like James McAvoy that much and I feared that this movie could prove a letdown. I was wrong. The movie is great, well directed, CGI good to watch without being more important than the movie itself and - most of all - the acting was really good. McAvoy and Fassbender were great in depicting Xavier and Erik. Their emotions look real, not acted, their chemistry great. And the other characters work well, too, villains and good guys. I liked also the Bondesque style of the part during the 60s. Drama and humour are well mixed and they give depth to a good action movie. Just a last line: Magneto is right in distrusting humans.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Is Everyone Joking?,"So I saw all of the initial reviews and ratings about this film and was psyched to see it. Some people were saying it gave ""The Dark Knight"" competition for best comic book adapted film of all time. Are you kidding me? This film was just like every other X-Men movie made. There was nothing new or unique about this one. I have to admit that the film had some great potential and throughout the film I was sitting on the edge of my seat waiting for the film to make a turn for greatness. It never came. The actors did a good job, but some of the screenplay was so flat that it took away from the film.The difference between a film like ""The Dark Knight"" and ""First Class"" is that ""The Dark Knight"" brings a serious, dark, and realistic tone while ""First Class"" continues the same trend X-Men have always been on. There is nothing magical about this film. There were some great scenes and cameo appearances, but overall this movie let me down tremendously. I was expecting so much more from a film that got 87% from RottenTomatoes. Is everyone joking? Do not have high hopes for this one.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
X-Men: First Class (2011),"The Movie is simply fantastic. Strong emotion and explosive action. The acting is top notch. Delivery from every actor is at it's best, more so from Mystique, Beast, Xavier and Magneto. What I also like about First Class is that the movie takes place in the past (the sixties) and uses historical events (the Cuba crisis and the Cold War) to make its point. Erik claims that no matter how many times mutants save the world, normal people will always see them as enemies. Professor X still wants to believe in the good of the people. With that message the foundation is laid for X-Men 1-3.Overall, this isn't a bad movie, it's a good movie! It's a fun Blockbuster Summer action film to enjoy with your friends. See the movie!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Reasonable effort, not on par with the original 2 movies.","X-men has always been a bit odd to me. Lots of characters and powers can always make for a fun time, but also for the potential to get too caught up in this side of things rather than strong character development and storytelling.The other side of it is that for me X-Men has also always been a kind of halfway house between the dark, adult themed batman reboots and the popcorn and cheesy grins of spiderman, I think the original 2 movies of the series carried this off very well with a good mix of decent acting (Patrick Steward, Ian McKellen) vs the more fun elements with wolverine, rogue and a decent interplay between characters like wolverine and cyclops.Unfortunately a lot of these elements are lacking in the new movie, it's definitely an enjoyable film, but leaning considerably towards the cheesy popcorn style with occasional efforts at character development. Perhaps I was unreasonable in my expectation, but I loved the first two movies (not so much the two after that) and I was really hoping this would get back to that sort of standard, which it doesn't.The original X-Men movie left me desperate for X2, unfortunately having seen First Class, I'm not that bothered about wanting to see ""X-Men: Sophomore Year"", and that is quite a disappointment.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best X-flick behind X2. I love you Michael Fassbender,"Man V. Freak Evolution has a new name By Ryan Crews 3.5/4 StarsThere once was a tale of a more evolved human kind. A band of outcasts known as the future: the mutant kind. Their story has been and continues to be told through an up and running X-Men franchise, made fresh by its latest installment, X-Men: First Class. First Class is a world class prequel that exposes the pasts of two old chums (as they are seen in the original films: X-1, 2, & 3). Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto (a five-star performance by Michael Fassbender) and Charles Xavier/Professor X (a jolting James McAvoy) join forces to defeat the energy absorbing antagonist, Sebastian Shaw (an evil-intent Kevin Bacon) and his squad of mutant baddies with mutant domination on their mind. The film delves into Fassbender's (Inglorious Basterds) medal-bending maniac's soul-driven desire for revenge against the Nazi regime that stole away his family and into McAvoy's (Atonement) telepathic visions of a mutant and human co-existence. As Lehnsherr misinterprets fascist hatred as the foundation of all human nature, his innocence is lost which develops the passion of Magneto's inner Frankenstein monster. The hatred brewed turns him into the very same prejudiced man that he preys upon, impervious to McAvoy's philanthropic attempts at getting in his head. The direction by Matthew Vaughn (Kick-Ass) pays homage to Bryan Singer's take on the first two films which adds a depth to the X-Men that had not shown up in the past two installments (The Last Stand and Wolverine). Its storyline is as intriguing as a superhero plot gets. It plants the X-Men straight into the 60's Cuban Missile Crisis and morphs history to its advantage to add to the powerful effect of the film, and the effect is groovy baby. Nicholas Hoult is ferocious as the mad scientist, Hank McCoy/Beast. He comes in and leaves a mark almost as if asking what would a comic book movie be without the nerds? The only weak side of the acting pool comes from Mrs. Betty Draper herself, January Jones (Mad Men) who plays a very comic book feeling villain known as Emma Frost. Frost could have been a dynamic, cinematic creation if only Jones didn't look like she was just there to look hot and read her lines. First Class is full of spectacular visual effects, intense, crafty acting (congrats, Fassbender for the role of the year, so far) and cerebral summer fun without all of the worries of skin cancer. It's an enthralling ride that gets in your mind like Xavier himself as it is full of freaks, geeks, and mystique's (pun intended, nerds). It's totally worth a single days pool-fair.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
X Men: First Class,"X Men: First Class is a real comeback for a franchise that could of, but didn't, loose its original 'shi-bang' as it were. This new addition to the series has brought it back to life, and back better than ever, this instalment is by far the best with fantastic acting, superb directing and mind-blowing action.Not only does this film deliver a new, untold story, but it also caters for those non-X Men fans with funny lines, character development and plays at a fast and exciting pace. This addition also ties up various loose ends that the previous films (although chronologically latter films) didn't answer, with the odd joke along the way.Not forgetting the cameo with Wolverine, that was fabulous, I doubt that was cheap.X Men: First Class has a franchise of its own, and I hope to see another soon.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
What a surprise!,"I gotta confess something: when I saw the ""X-Men Origins"" I said to myself: ""For Christ's sake Marvel, PLEASE STOP making x-men movies, 4 movies are quite enough to saturate the story!"". The movie was not that bad, actually. But several and several movies from one single comic is something that deserves concerns.Well.. When I found out that a new X-Men movie was about to debut, I got excited, but at the same time, concerned about saturating EVEN MORE the comic. OK, the trailer looked AWESOME, fantastic actors and amazing special effects. ""WOOOW!"", I thought. But after seeing this movie, the first word that came to my mind was ""WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW!!""... man, it worth SO much! Without a doubt, the most terrific from all previous. In addition to an excellent script and memorable dialogues, Charles Xavier, played by James McAvoy, was absolutely captivating..Excellent choice from director Matthew Vaughn. I gotta say that ALL the support cast was great too. (WHAT WAS THAT LINE PLAYED BY WOLVERINE??? LOL!!!)But for Magneto, my fav. character, played by the fantastic Sir Ian McKellen in the previous ones and now played by Michael Fassbender, I must write a separated paragraph. Fassbender, what a stunning actor! He completely stole the scene. His feelings for revenge and friendship, all mixed up with his fears and traumas, developed a remarkable performance to the audience. Magneto is that unique type of villain that people LOVE to hate. And Fassbender seemed to know exactly what that means :) It was kind of sad to see his friendship with Charles Xavier ruined by his hate and desire for revenge. But the final scene of them, man.. was epic!For me, personally, was a delightful surprise. I recommended to all my friends to go see this movie. But Marvel, PLEASE, 5 movies is quite enough, OK? The fifth movie was the highest achievement, don't need to make any other after that, seriously :)",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

MARVEL is definitely on a roll. Superb Film!,"MARVEL is definitely on a roll! It all started with the huge success of X-Men over a decade ago. So, it's fitting the high water mark comes this summer with X-Men First Class right in the middle of it. Thor was great earlier this summer and Captain America looks even better. Iron Man and the Hulk kicked butt recently. So, if Marvel gets their hired out characters rolling, the sky is the limit. I don't know about Sony's Spider-Man but Fox managed to return the X-Men to greatness. Can't wait to see what Fox does with the next Wolverine and the whole world is eagerly awaiting the Avengers to assemble!One of the best improvements about First Class over X-Men is that much valuable screen time is spent on background character development. They actually pick up from the scene of young Magneto shown in X-Men. I believe that was probably needed in the first film, but they had so much else to introduce that they got away with showing much less. That's the beauty of this film and now I see why they choose to save Scott, Jean and Storm's introduction for future films. Taking the proper time to establish Charles and Erik was a must and it is very well done. Even in X2, the newer characters that were introduced got very little time devoted to their past. It worked but the way new characters are introduced here works better. People in general are smart and can read between the lines, thus negating the necessity for cumbersome background information in general. Some of that is on display here but they truly flesh out the characters that need it the most. Apparently the director figured out this delicate balance because First Class flows smoothly, with hardly a stutter along the way to break up the action but still delivering an intelligent and moving film.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Enjoyable within its genre.,"This movie works out as good entertainment but was it truly necessary and does it also adds something to the movie X-men franchise? Not enough, in my opinion.Really, I was not opposed to the idea of a prequel/reboot for the movie series but I feel that the execution of it is lacking just a bit too much and the movie is filled with some missed opportunities and poor executions of potentially good and interesting ideas.Don't worry, I liked this movie more than I didn't but the movie is receiving so much praise, while it in fact is still really such a lacking movie, that I feel that I should counterbalance it.The main problem I had with this movie, concerned both the Magneto and professor X character and their relation. I never got the feeling that they were true friends, which could had given this movie and all of the other X-Men movies so much more emotional impact. Besides, I never felt that Magneto was ever a good guy. He pretty much is a rogue and dangerous person from the start on already, who never had any good or noble intentions. So it also really seems unlikely that they ever were friends in the first place, since they are driven by completely different motivations and have different goals. Their friendship should had been the key and center of this movie and something that should had been build on in future X-Men movies but the movie has far too many other distractions in it, for it to ever work out.It to me also never felt like these two were the same characters, who also got portrayed by Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen in the other X-Men movies. They look nothing alike and even sound completely different. This thought constantly distracted me and prevented me from ever truly liking James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender in their roles, even while in fact they are far from bad actors of course.But yes, it's simply still an enjoyable movie for what it is. It features a decent enough script, decent characters, decent action and decent entertainment in it. nothing ever truly stands out in my opinion and the movie does has its slower and weaker moments still but overall this is one fine movie to watch, if you simply want to be entertained for a couple of hours. If you are expecting this movie to add more insightful depth or emotional impact to its characters or just the series as a whole, you are wrong. In that regard this movie really doesn't add enough to the series, though it still remains a welcome addition.It's also a movie that does still surprise, in some ways. One thing it really surprises with is its villain. Kevin Bacon sounds like such an unlikely choice to play a villain in a superhero movie but he often was one of the highlights of the movie and simply did a good job with his role and he seemed to be having some fun with all of it as well.Also the inclusion of the some new characters and the first introduction of some character that were already familiar to the series, all are welcome additions. Most of the characters get plenty of screen time and enough action to do, so it never really feels as if some of them simply got put into the movie to fill up the screen with or to help to make the movie long enough. They all serve a purpose and with their mutant powers they also help to make an impact with their roles, on the story.A bit of a pointless prequel that doesn't really add enough to the franchise in my opinion but it simply remains a fun and entertaining film, with plenty of action to enjoy as well. As a superhero flick, this movie does simply not disappoint, despite all of my criticism.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Not just the best X-Men movie, but the best summer movie this year!","It has been a long time since I enjoyed a movie that much! If one looks at it as the reboot part of what it is and looks at it separate from the other movies it's even easier to love. The inconsistencies bothered me a little the first time I watched it, but only at the back of mind. By the time I got home I already wanted to see it again, and by the time I got back to the theater to watch it again this weekend I had decided to accept it fully for what it was and I enjoyed it even more. I had nothing else to do that day and watched two other movies I had never seen before but re-watching First Class was still the highlight of my day. On top of all that, through this movie I've discovered quite the love for James McAvoy. ;) I've spent all week finding and watching everything else he's ever been in!To make a long story a little less long, they would be crazy not to make a sequel to this movie!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A surprisingly good prequel that does what it sets out to do,"This prequel to the popular series is better than I expected, especially considering class is never officially in session during the movie. It's another origin film designed to show us how the original X-Men came to be and how their founder, Charles Xavier, teamed up with Erik Lehnsherr to thwart a thermonuclear war in 1962. Along the way, we learn about the Erik's inner demons and thirst for revenge and Charles' implacable sensibility.I was interested in seeing this movie not just because I wanted to know how it all began but because I was already emotionally invested in the series, having seen four X-Men movies just in the past decade or so. That's how Hollywood is getting you nowadays, you know. Make a big movie, then make a sequel, then a prequel, then a spin-off, all designed to keep you coming back, because you know each character and recognize a bit of yourself in them as well. Here, you have the dark side (Magneto) and the light side (Professor X) - much like Darth Vader and Obi-Wan Kenobi in the Star Wars films, right? A classic setup.We learn that Erik, later to become Magneto, is a concentration-camp survivor who saw his mother shot to death when he could not perform his extrasensory powers to the camp commandant under duress. Now he is out to find that commander, some twenty years later. Alternatively, Charles is a ladies' man who's also exceedingly bright, working on a theses about genetics. He's a telepath and wishes to learn more about genetic mutations. His childhood friend Raven has her own mysterious powers - in her true form she is entirely blue with red hair, a striking if possibly unwelcoming figure.The unifying agent that brings Erik (Michael Fassnbender) and Charles (James McAvoy) together is one Sebastian Shaw, played by an oily Kevin Bacon. Shaw's plan is to get the US and the USSR to declare war on one another, thus wiping each other out, thus (apparently) leaving only mutants, who shall inherit the Earth. Erik wants to kill Shaw; Charles simply wants to stop him. They're consistently at odds with each other as they recruit other mutants to their cause in 1962, even as Charles helps Erik break down his own barriers to harness his powers.This gets the CIA involved (Rose Byrne), and then there's a well-done standoff at the US-USSR blockade showdown (you know, the Bay of Pigs) that tests the wills of everyone involved. I liked that; good action.A recurring theme in the X-Men movies is the battle between being who you are (i.e., a mutant) and being accepted by society (i.e., a mutant who looks like everyone else). It's not hard to draw a comparison between being a mutant and being ""different."" Do you want to just fit in, or do you want to be your own person? Raven, aka Mystique (played to perfection by Jennifer Lawrence) isn't sure, either. Neither are some of the other mutants, leading to a schism that would later show up in each of the other films.First Class isn't really anything special, but it's pleasing to the eye (both in effects and in cast choice) and keeps true to its familiar characters. It fits in fairly seamlessly with the other films. It's easy to follow, of course, and the cast does a very fine job. McAvoy seems to be getting better with each role (good thing, because he was one terrible actor when he started); Fassbender, Lawrence, even January Jones (as Emma Frost) are fine as well.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
435th Review: Outstanding Prequel - simply superb,"Forget everything you have seen in other prequels - this may well be the film of the series (Even without Wolverine). It is certainly a group effort and it is superb.Every scene and every actor delivers a deeply satisfying film that perfectly prequels and expands the X Men series.For this reviewer, this was easily the best film of the series so far - the script has real purpose and drive - and the action doesn't kick in too soon - we get tons of back story and character development, something of a rarity in action summer blockbusters.All in all, probably will not best Transformers or Pirates at the box office, but it certainly deserves to - hugely better than expected - and a good film all over.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Fantastic introduction that will blow you away,After already creating four X-Men movies making a fifth one may be considered pushing it but instead X-Men: First Class came as a fresh surprise with a new perspective. For all not new to the X-Men this movie is a nice surprise as the plot look away from the classic 'human hatred towards mutants' story to a more mature and balanced story. rather than build up from the fame of the previous X-Men it starts fresh and allows the laymen audience to better understand the X-Men world and the characters.The best thing about X-Men: First Class is the fabulous manner in which the characters are introduced and developed. the audience may feel a bit lost in the beginning but the film quickly unravels. James McAvoy does a fantastic job of portraying Charles Xaviar with his casual charm and trusting voice. Michael Fassbender also provide the perfect contrast portraying Magneto as the mysterious character he is. that combined with a great cast make this movie an enjoyable and entertaining experience.,9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The tone is breathtakingly perfect.. GREAT Film!,"After seeing this wonderful film I have to ask one question... can certain fanboys please shut up now about how this thing differs from their comic books? Apparently, a few fans couldn't leave their own expectations, cartoons and comic books at home. Too bad they assume ""they're doing it wrong"" by judging the film they see versus the one that's running in their fanboy head. Maybe that matters to a few but when the people involved deliver such an outstanding movie, does it really matter?Bring on Scott, Jean and Ororo in the sequel and in Xavier's true solo ""first class."" A movie this good is guaranteed at least a few sequels. Personally, I love this movie. It rivals X2 as the best of the bunch. The tone was breathtakingly perfect. Setting it in the early 60's was brilliant. This gives the film something no one really has seen before in these type of films and certainly elevates it from the X-Trilogy. As a fan of that trilogy, it is everything I was hoping for and maybe a bit more. This is the Xavier and Magneto story everyone has wanted to see since X1 and it's done remarkably well. There's no question that this film is going to surprise the doubters and frustrate the haters. There's no way anyone could hate anything about this movie unless they went in to view it wanted to hate on it. Wonderful in every way.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The X-Men in groovy training pants,"Marvel Comics and its embodiments have been rearranging and manipulating the past and present to include how super-heroes would have done it differently since the golden days of Captain America punching the lights out of Hitler. Fast forward to the early '60s and we get revisionism of the Cold War by splicing fantasy and realism to include a look at where ""mutants""--super-humans with odd mutations in their DNA giving them special abilities--fit in to society. Is the world ready to accept these flukes of nature even if it's to save the Kennedy/communist era world from nuclear war on the brink? Well, at the center of the story involves two men who look at the dilemma quite differently: an idealist junior professor from a handed down wealthy background and another man who survived from the ground up in the bleak Nazi concentration camps.The beginning of X-Men: before distinct suits and names, before mutants collectively showed their ugly or beautiful side--however you want to look at it--for fear of ridicule, misunderstandings and unequal treatment. Think back to when glasses, fat kids and braces got the giggles and swirlies in the john, except the characters here instead transform certain flawed characteristics into epic super powers that would cause the normal person to stand still in their tracks and not quite possibly believe their eyes. Professor X: a telepath with persuasion; Riptide: wind control; Banshee: voice projection; Azazel: instant teleportation. These are just some of the select super heroes and villains before they knew everything about what it is to truly being one.Where there are specially gifted spread out, they all have something in common and the story brings them closer together to either destroy or save humanity. Some mutants still find it in them to do good, others say the heck with the regulars who won't except them for who they are, and then, of course, there are the true villains who exploit their powers for gain. As a boy Erik (Michael Fassbender) was introduced to Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) due to being sighted as talented in the dreary concentration camps of Poland in 1944. Erik's powers of controlling metal objects only came out with extreme rage, so Shaw being the nice Nazi he is callously disposes of someone to see this come out. This creates a tormented vendetta against the man who unlocked his hidden abilities but also took something that can't be given back. By now Shaw is a little harder to get ahold of with a strong group of mutants behind him. He uses them to press a political agenda to pit Russia and the United States against each other, while he reaps the reward of the fallout.What made ""X-Men: First Class"" work was there was a layered story that was dramatic while not missing out on a constantly moving adventurous side. Since this squeezes numerous characters, frequent location and language changes, not to mention two battling nations in one reasonably lengthened movie, some things do fall a little too in place to benefiting the story all coming together in one big related catastrophe at the same time. Some complex inventions and training sessions came a little too conveniently, but when are they ever realistically shown? While the mutants are at the forefront, the regular humans miss out on depth and range. Their personalities go from completely wooden to just tentatively going along for the ride to nail it home that they're utterly closed-minded to push a definitive persecution tone without question.This is an entertaining experience that's both for comic book fans and regular cinema goers as it takes it all a little more seriously than other massive budget popcorn pictures by measuring out fantasy and injecting realism--including violence and people that ""actually"" die in a comic book story--to make one's imagination crack wide open and put in the direct moment. That is till someone has to go back to the day-to-day grind where they might daydream of stopping that bully, taking out that robber and if there was a power to give themselves a raise at work, I'm sure they'd do that to.

good prequel reboot,"Fox decided to reboot the X-Men franchise with new actors as younger versions of the familiar roles. This prequel takes place mostly in 1962 before and around the Cuban Missile Crisis. It's a good start especially if the most important part of this exercise is to get good young actors to refresh the franchise. James McAvoy is the new Charles Xavier. Jennifer Lawrence is Mystique. Nicholas Hoult is Beast. Michael Fassbender is Magneto. With them as well as others, the franchise looks to be on solid grounds. As for this movie itself, it's a little bit slow at times. I think we're suppose to go weak in the knees every time a new actor for each iconic role is revealed. It's still great to see the new actors in action.

Matthew Vaughn was definitely the guy I'd go for, that was the first reason why I wanted to go watch the flick.Actually, there were a couple of more reasons why I wanted to see this movie real bad.James McAvoy, reason no.2, with awesome movies like Wanted and Atonement to his name, 'him in the boots of Charles' - I was a bit inquisitive.Reason no. 3 - Magneto, My favourite character in the X-men saga (with Cyclops sharing the same position in the list) I was not sure whether Michael Fassbender was the right person for it(But you know what? He was impeccable as Erik.)Reason no. 4 - The awesome trailer and the trailer's music. I couldn't help humming the music every now and then.Reason no. 5 - Kurt's(Nightcrawler's) father Azazel, I was looking forward for this guy because Marvel Comics had manifested him as one of the most powerful mutant(tel-e-porting in a different dimension even in the Mutant Chronicles is no joke, Right?) Although they modify the story every now and then (Geez !!! what about the part where Mystique falls in love with Azazel in Germany and conceives Nightcrawler?)Reason no. 6 - The Oscar nominated actress Jennifer Lawrence(for Winter's Bone) had bagged the role for Raven? ""CURIOUS""...........!!!Reason no. 7 - Rose Byrne, I am watching her movies ever since I saw her in Troy and Wicker Park. Was looking forward to watch her as the famous Moira MacTaggert.Reason no. 8 - Kevin Bacon, Although the trailer 'hardly' showed him hither and thither, I was looking forward for his role as Shaw and guess what he proved to be the finest of all!

So no questions there.Some great acting by the entire crew with the HellFire Club's lead Kevin Bacon as Shaw, Riptide(he never spoke, dumb-ass!

She has this little chubby baby face, the makeup on here wasn't anywhere near as well done as the first 3 movies, her acting wasn't the greatest and, again I'm sorry, but she didn't come close to Rebecca Romijn in the first three movies. Not for makeup, not for acting, not for the action sequences and not for her sexiness. I feel she was a very poor choice for this roll.But hey, other than that it was a good movie. Great story, good actors, script and effects were well done. No other complaints about it.I loved Logan's small roll in this flick. Perfect.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
embarrassing to watch,"It's a complete terrible tedious rubbish of a movie. All positive reviews here are fake! The story was very boring. The SR-71 Blackbird aircraft should only have one or, rarely, two seats, and it is not hollow inside. The submarine had a way too large interior for its size, not to mention its interior was completely unrealistic. The scene with the missiles at the end was embarrassing to watch. I'm not sure why there are so many positive reviews. One might begin to wonder whether somebody is manipulating the system. And how could this movie possibly have an 8.0 rating? I no longer trust IMDb and its ratings. IMDb has become corrupt, unfortunately. I demand that IMDb does something to fix this.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Stylish prequel and a welcome addition,"When the words prequel and reboot are mentioned about the same film I get a little sceptical. I loved the X-Men series and so wanted this to be good. Gladly, this was a welcome addition and an example of a prequel that works brilliantly on many levels but also takes a few liberties in some areas. If you are very aware of the past X-Men films there are a few things that differ with the continuity that you'll be aware of. At first I was irritated by this but I realised that it it simply what happens when some prequels like this film are made. If this sort of thing does irritate you be aware of this and you may end up enjoying it after all. I sound cagey in this respect but I do want to keep this review spoiler free. Just be aware of this as there is special effort made for this film to show its individuality in many respects.The performances were all good and some very good, Kevin Bacon as Sebastian Shaw occasionally came across as goofy for a villain but showed his worth when he needed to be threatening especially once the third act came along. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender did very well together and had a brilliant rapport. I thought it would have been difficult to replicate this given the chemistry that Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen had in the X-Men trilogy. They did very well together and I really believed their friendship, that is not to mention they do well in scenes when they are not together as well. The other mutants started out fairly same old same old but came into their own at the end. Although despite their somewhat weak introductions as characters I did find myself caring about then once that climax came along. There were scenes with plenty of tension especially involving Erik/Magneto that had a great deal to do with Fassbender's performance. The action involved was consistently good and also wasn't a constant in the film where the focus was very much on the characters and it also made me appreciate the action more when it came. The action got better as the film went on and there was a genuine effort by the film makers to make a film that could be both exciting in terms of action and make it a brilliant character story.In summary if you enjoyed the previous X-Men films you should enjoy this one as it really makes an effort and the performances while not especially brilliant from the supporting characters were fantastic from the leads. These performances made me want to see McAvoy and Fassbender in these roles again. It features an amusing cameo as well.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Do not expect this to be like the first x-men movies!,"First class is a lot different than what I expected. The film has less action and more slow parts instead. Now when I refer to slow parts I would like to tell you it is story, but it is actually lots of your time wasted by them trying to tell a story about shallow characters. You sit through a 132 minute movie which should have been an hour and twenty minutes because the rest is a waste of time and boring. Yes, I know that movies like x-men are not supposed to have a best picture of the year type of story, but if you are going to have a shallow story do not waste my time prolonging it just give me action instead that is better than nothing. The movie in better than ""The Last Stand"" and is worth watching a second time I would say but no more than that. It does have decent characters (Magneto and Xavier and Kevin Bacon) but the other ones are pretty bland and than other characters are introduced in the beginning like the woman from the CIA, but than her character is completely forgotten in the rest of the film after her introduction(look at the deleted scenes on the blu ray which include her and the movie will make a little more sense)",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The perfect prequel for the X MEN franchise,"I nearly loved the original X MEN trilogy and also the rebooted one with the new cast. Since I had the chance of re-watching this a week before Christmas, I can finally review it but considering there are already 835 reviews to date I won't be that long.When the film begins Erik Lensheer (Michael Fassbender) is taken along with his mom to Sebastain Shaw (Kevin Bacon) to a facility and Shaw tests Erik's ability of morphin metal, but when Erik fails Sebastian makes his henchmen execute his mother and when Erik grows up he meets Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and with the help of Raven Darkholme (Jennifer Lawrence), Hank McCoy (Nicholas Hoult) and some others form the X Men and Erik will manage to avenge his mother and stop Shaw and his diabolical plan.The cast was great. Fassbender and McAvoy are great as the younger versions of the characters previously portrayed by Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart, and while I love Rebecca Romijn as Mystique, Jennifer Lawrence is good as well. The supporting cast is full of many beloved faces (Hoult, Matt Craven, Michael Ironside, Oliver Platt, James Remar, Glenn Morshower and even Hugh Jackman in a cameo) and Kevin Bacon is pitch-perfect as the villain. There are various funny moments but instead of explaining them here, it's best that you see the movie for yourselves.Overall, a great prequel and a superhero movie that is also lot of fun, and that is the most important thing.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
X-Men: First Class,"As most summer blockbusters have lost its credibility and novelty in recent years, this 120 minutes prequel gratifies me with its intricacy of different characters and the visual thumps (Magneto Vs. submarine scene is expressly phenomenal notwithstanding that it had been seen in the trailer).The overwhelming bromance between Professor X and Magneto has meshed well with the gay trend and indeed the film can be introduced as a mutants version of BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN without too much toil (taking account of the overtone of the similar social situation between gay and mutant), plus nearly all female characters are curbed as wallflowers (Rose Byrne, Jennifer Lawrence) or stereotyped femmes fatales (January Jones, Zoe Kravitz). It's a man's world, even for mutants.A major merit is that the film magnificently applies the Cuban missile crisis into and plot and subsequently maneuvers a credible Cold War milieu, which according to the director Matthew Vaughn, he got the inspiration from earlier James Bond films.About the cast, James McAvoy plays a brainy-over-brawny hoot with ease while Michael Fassbender exudes a menacing characteristic which could widen his remit into an unprecedented area (2011 dooms to be his year, JANE EYRE, A DANGEROUS METHOD and SHAME, I bet at an Oscar nomination is unquestionably within his reach). The mutual attraction between them is mesmerizingly fruitful. But the villain Kevin Bacon is pigeonholed as a shallow badass which falls into the so-called Hollywood miscreant's formula, although his language versatility is the only saving grace.Still the film cannot or dare not to be a true alien from its kins or to be distinguished from other Marvel pics, hackneyed tactics are ubiquitous (compared with Vaughn's groundbreaking previous work KICK-ASS 2010), and some parts are tedious enough to bring about a tad repellence (notably the invincible Kevin Bacon Vs. human soldiers, and the assault on the mutant base, the slaughtering is purely annoying and corny).Now it is not clearly whether the film will reignite a further sequel since its the box office transcript is well underperformed. It's a pity that it is much more entertaining than THOR and the newest installment of the Caribbean pirates.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
X-Men: First Class is a must-see superhero film.,"X-Men: First Class is a good summer blockbuster. Director Matthew Vaughn (Kick-Ass) crafted an engaging and entertaining film that, in the X-Men film series, is bettered only by X2 (2003). It acts as a prequel/reboot covering the origins of the X-Men in an alternate history where the powerful mutant Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) attempts to ignite a nuclear war between the USA and the USSR. Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender) are signed up by US intelligence to foil Shaw's plans, and in the process they become good friends. The CGI is not perfect, but it's put to very good use. The story is solid (helped by the good script) with doses of effective humor throughout. Strongest in the film is the characterization. There are several notable performances. Bacon, McAvoy and especially Fassbender are in excellent form. The supporting cast is fine too (Nicholas Hoult, Zoe Kravitz, Jennifer Lawrence being the standouts). Better superhero films have been made, but First Class is definitely a WOW movie. It's a good example of what summer movies should be like. I recommend seeing it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
X:Men First Class seems to be an illustrious installment,"X men:First Class, the fifth installment of the X Men Film Series substantially uncovers the genesis of the mutant group of X Men(spearheaded by Prof.Charles Xavier) and the antagonist rival mutant group Brotherhood Of Mutants(marshalled by Erik Lehnsherr(familiar as Magneto)) to tackle the eternal unacceptability of mutants in the conventional human world.The movie has recurrent skewed allusions to Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962.
The film chronicles the confrontation between the aforementioned mutant groups with Sebastian Shaw, who is hell-bent on intimidating humans and usurping power to hegemonize the world.
The film flaunts an ensemble cast of Michael Fassbender, James McAvoy,Kevin Bacon and Jennifer Lawrence flunks at engendering the desired thrill, generally anticipated from the X Men films.The storyline is too predictable, and though Matthew Vaughn steers the film on individual acting performances, the ensuing chemistry between Fassbender and McAvoy fails to build up, thus rendering the film lacklustrousness and insipidity.Tough the inception of the mutant groups is effectively depicted, but fails to live up to the desirable expectations.
The ending seems illustrious and set-up, and though the conceived idea was beyond doubt, erudite, it's subsequent portrayal seems to be much below par.The risk of the commencement of third world war through the exploits of Sebastian Shaw seems a bit too far-fetched.The entire narrative of the cold-war was skewed to suit the film, with rare allusions to true facts.
Henry Jackman's sterling music fits exquisitely to the film, and is probably one of the best tracks ever furnished in the X Men Series.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"truly, First Class!","X-Men: First Class is exactly what every super hero franchise should have; a back-story about the origins of protagonists that builds their moral character for future iterations. Director Michael Vaughn introduces us to young Charles Xavier, whose telepathic abilities would make him a leader of the X-Men in the future and Eric, whose tragic loss in childhood would make him harness his magnetic abilities to overpower greater forces. Their friendship that brought the First Class of mutants together, would eventually see them parting ways to either moral end. The stylized action and class we saw in Vaughn's impressive 'Kick-Ass' is replicated here in a James Bond like epic, set during the cold war with super heroes who save the day.Kevin Bacon plays the doomsday villain, Sebastian Shaw, whose abilities can harness any energy around him. With the cold war at its highest tension point, he plans nuclear Armageddon during the Cuban missile crisis. Meanwhile, the young Charles has grown up (James McAvoy) with Raven, aka Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence), whose mutant abilities can take on any human's appearance and together, they discover fellow mutants with some help from the CIA. Erik's (Michael Fassbender) vengeful pursuit of Shaw brings him in alliance with Charles as they recruit mutants into their team to save mankind from the threat of annihilation in the Cuban seas.Outstanding performances with the sheer intensity of Michael Fassbender and composed intelligence of James McAvoy delineate the determination and ambition of their younger characters whose friendship will be forced to the other ends of morality when they grow into Patrick Stewart's Professor X and Sir Ian McKellan's Magneto.Even though in shorter roles, Kevin Bacon, Jennifer Lawrence, Nicholas Hoult and Rose Byrne are impressive. For a super hero movie, the acting is indeed First Class. Not to forget, the visual treat of January Jones as Emma Frost.Vaughn consistently builds the dramatic tension with the situations between USA and Russia, Shaw and Charles, and finally, between Charles and Erik. The backdrop of the Cuban missile crisis and Shaw's doomsday plan remind us of the Mr.Bond but with the X-Men as heroes, Vaughn brings a truly unique dimension to good v/s evil.The special effects as the mutants test their powers, are dazzling.The sequences involving Magneto lifting the submarine and then stopping a barrage of missiles are jaw dropping.Vaughn leaves no stone unturned in unleashing action that is visually striking while some exemplary acting keeps one engaged in an intriguing plot. X-Men:First Class is not only a system reboot but it also sets certain standards for super hero films especially this season. Seldom has it been so much fun in going into to the past of our favorite characters and relating every incident and event with who and what they become. Not since the transition of Darth Vader himself, has it even been so pleasing to see a villain proclaiming himself as Magneto did.The lines of morality are blurry and one cannot take sides too easily in the formation of the X-Men and while being entertained, one can clearly sense the feeling of fulfillment in an almost flawless story that you wouldn't want to see the end of.

Not Since X2 Have I Been So Amazed,"I honestly underestimated this movie, But I can say now I was no less than stunned. And how my doubt would have been lessened all the sooner had I known Matthew Vaughn was directing. Yes, under his direction we don't get a Brett Ratner purely action driven mainstream flick, or a Gavin Hood cliché fest. The amazing thing is that this is a prequel/reboot so the vast majority of the audiences have an idea of what's going to happen.The brilliant thing is the screen play still packs quite a bit of surprises into it all. The story is highly involving and best of all the characters portrayed here are interesting and the actors playing them talented. Jennifer Lawrence is a very good Mystique, and James McAvoy I knew from the start wouldn't fail me. Michael Fassbender was perfect as a young Magneto, putting so much emotion into the villain every second of his screen time astounded me. Emma Frost is given much more screen time this time around, and is a lot better portrayed by January Jones. Beast was awesome, damn it, the characters all get their moment of awesomeness. I can't possibly go over all of them in this review without dragging it on. I can only add that Kevin Bacon was quite the antagonists and Zoë Isabella Kravitz was a very luscious Angel.And the score by Henry Jackman was undeniably awesome. It has a modern feeling to it yet so packed with emotion and sharpening each moment.

An Honest Review,"I wasn't the biggest fan. I'm not going to say that it is the absolute greatest, or even the greatest X-Men film on earth.Honestly, if you were to ask me, they should have just killed the franchise after the travesty that was X-Men The Last Stand. And killed it in the same way that you put down a beloved yet rabid dog.But clearly they didn't and instead they gave us the oddest reboot I've ever seen.I can't really complain about this one like I do so many others. And I'm inclined to give them some very serious props for how they did it. They effectively killed absolutely every argument I have against reboots and remakes.Most of the time, with reboots and remakes, the complaint is that they are doing it because the originals were popular and made money and want to bank on that success, however they tend to redo it in a way that takes out all the charm that made the first ones so beloved, rewrite the history that fans love in such a way it's insulting, and dumb it down to appeal to the masses whilst upping the special effects in the hopes that no one notices.Usually it's all done with the explanation that ""Millennials don't understand satire and/or dark humor."" At least that is how it went with Robocop, The Evil Dead, Nightmare on Elm Street, Scream, The Amazing Spider-Man, and so on and so forth.X-Men: First Class seems to break the remake/reboot laws. Rather than re-writing the history (because the first two were really good) and destroying everything that made them so loved...they rebooted the series in the past, recast the actors, and largely left the future chronology in place.And, to reassure audiences that they weren't destroying everything they loved, they added the opening scene of the very first X-Men movie and made sure to add as much Googie architecture as possible while siting well remembered past events to assure us that, yes, what we loved is still alive and present.It shut people like me up. I can't hate on it for being a reboot because it addressed my concerns and moved on nicely.Plus the cast was great. Michael Fassbender was awesome, January Jones, Caleb Landry Jones, and Rose Byrne were outstanding and to add a cherry on top they threw in Kevin Bacon as the Big Bad.Was it because Bacon is awesome or just to give people my age a link to Jennifer Lawrence so we can still play 6 Degrees? Who know? The only problem is that, by rebooting it, they left a lot of the source history completely jumbled. The characters were largely left hanging and, though it worked for a while, the jumbled characters made the reboot franchise kind of fall apart in X-Men: Apocalypse.So 7 of 10 IMDb stars. It was a solid movie and I loved that they took the time to reboot it in a way that would kill all my instant reboot hatred...but had they written it a little tighter, it could have lasted long as a killer franchise.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
X-Men: First Class is another worthy entry in the Marvel Comics film series,"Having previously seen the three X-Men films not to mention read the comics during the Chris Claremont '80s, I had a big interest in seeing this depiction of the beginnings of the team of hero mutants as founded by one Charles Xavier. That said, the real exciting action doesn't go into high gear until near the end but by then there is real compelling drama concerning the main characters of the later known Professor X (James McAvoy) and his initial friend-turned-nemesis Magneto (Michael Fassbender). They along with Kevin Bacon as someone Magneto wants vengeance against-Sebastian Shaw-make the film truly worth seeing and brings this entry down to earth whenever things seem to take a direction that I'm not sure of. Having said that, the director Matthew Vaughn is one who takes care to make sure the other mutant characters don't get too much short shrift so on that note, X-Men: First Class comes highly recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A breezy popcorn movie for kids.,"I'm perfectly willing to accept that certain characters and plot points must change when you adapt from one media to another, especially when you're talking about a two hour action movie aimed at kids. However, the liberties taken with the characters in this movie are simply too much for me to wrap my head around. Sebastian Shaw is a WWII Nazi war criminal? In the comics, he's an amoral, American businessman who joins a secret society, kills all the leaders, and usurps control. That's a pretty scary guy. Does he really have to become an over-the-top Josef Mengele stand-in? Charles Xavier and Mystique are now step-siblings? OK, I'm willing to accept Shaw as a Nazi war criminal if I must, but this is just bizarre. Most of the characters have their nationalities switched around for no apparent reason. Furthermore, their ages are all messed up, with Havok (Cyclops' younger brother) being particularly paradoxical, now that he's old enough to be his elder brother's father. Seriously, I can forgive a lot of stuff, but this is just sloppy beyond belief.OK, so the continuity is all messed up, the characters and their interactions are completely revamped, and this is apparently meant to be a reboot, not a prequel. How is the actual movie, once you get beyond the issues regarding the source material and continuity? Well, I'd like to say it gets substantially better, but there are several really annoying aspects to it. First of all, there's a token black guy who's introduced and then almost instantly killed off. Seriously? I can't believe that we're still doing that in 2011. Emma Frost, the White Queen, was never one of my favorite characters. I always felt that she was one of the worst examples of the objectification of women in comic books, and she's played completely straight in this movie. Her stripperific costumes are toned down quite a bit, however. The X-Men, after weathering an attack by Shaw and his associates, go through an intense week of training, where they each suddenly have individual epiphanies and become self-confident bad asses, getting beyond whatever psychological issue was holding them back. Ugh. It reminded me of a horrible 80s movie, but, luckily, we were spared the training montage set to Eye of the Tiger. However, what really annoyed me was the ease with which characters flip-flopped between good and evil. One simplistic speech is enough to change almost anyone's mind, it seems. Then again, this is a comic book movie for kids and young adults, so I guess you can't really expect anything deep. Action movies aren't generally known for their deeply philosophical dialogue and strongly written characters. The X-Men have never been intellectual, highbrow entertainment, but they were written better than this, and they deserve better than this.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best Superhero Movie Ever,"I didn't expect anything from this movie. I was 100% sure it was a very low budget spin-off with almost no advertising. I didn't want to spend 8,50  (x2) to go to see it in theater. Anyway I was forced to, mostly because there was no room for ""Transformers 3"". Let me point out that I'm a comic book maniac/reader/collector so I watched every comic book related movie by far. I have to admit that this one is the best I've ever seen. The reason? it is a STORY, with characters, thoughts, dialogues and so on... It's not a blow-up-everything summer blockbuster, but a very well played drama. If you liked chris claremont's x-men, where the action was the last part of the stuff you'll LOVE this movie. Michael Fassbender (Magneto) and James McAvoy (Xavier) perfectly fit their roles. Even Kevin Bacon is perfect as Sebastian Shaw. And what about Mystica? I think she's waaay better than rebecca romjin stamos from the first 3 movies... OK she's less hot, I must admit it, but After this movie I consider her a better actress than the model rebecca. some side notes: - as a comic book fan the most notable thing to remember is that x-men have their blue/yellow original costumes. And they rock! - I'm very interested in history (I mean, general history - the one you study in school), so I think that the part regarding Magneto's background and cold war is really well done - as an architect I have to say that rooms, furniture, and design objects are perfect. The guys who worked at the settings earned their pay.Did you remember Elektra or ghost rider? well, the times have changed.

"Not quite first class, but a good effort.","Superhero movies are a lot like buses. You spend so much time waiting for one, then as soon as it shows up and you hop on, you turn around to see another twenty buses coming from right down the street. Just this year we've already seen The Green Hornet and Thor, with Green Lantern and Captain America yet to be released. X-Men: First Class sits in the middle, yet another product of the studio that has currently saturated the mainstream movie market like no other in contemporary history. First Class does little to stand out from the rest of Marvel's films, but that being said, I found the near two-and-a-half hours absolutely flew by.This film is an origin story: the tale of how such prominent fictional characters of popular culture became who we now know them to be. Set in 1962, the film follows the roles Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and Erik Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender) play in the formation of the X-Men, both good and evil. And because the men more commonly known as Professor X and Magneto are not yet archenemies, Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) plays the villain, a greedy and ambitious mutant responsible for the death of Erik's mother eighteen years ago.The film's subject matter can at times become quite dark, which makes it all the more disappointing that an adequate script was not thought up to match the personas of key characters. In what is becoming a worrying trend for lovers of the spoken word such as myself, more and more action films are ditching the idea of putting together even cohesive dialogue in favour of easy-to-digest clichés and excessive visual grandeur.Now I don't demand Shakespeare from these kinds of films, but it makes it exceedingly difficult to take the plight and the motives of the characters seriously when they don't seem to take it seriously themselves. An early flashback set in a concentration camp should set a gritty tone for the rest of the film. Instead, it is made almost comical through painfully awful dialogue and wooden delivery. Corny one-liners sneak their way in at a rate of about two per scene, all culminating to promote a character's self-respect in the least subtle way possible. You're proud to be a mutant. We get it.The film doesn't really start to pop until the final half hour, a highly engaging set piece on the ocean in which Charles' mutants attempt to thwart Shaw's plan, only to discover some bad news they hadn't bargained for. For all its screenplay issues, First Class does a solid job of characterising both Charles and Erik, two powerful yet polarising figures who seek peace and redemption respectively. The way in which they decide, in a surprisingly platonic manner, to stand on opposite sides of the law because of their differing opinion on who is their true enemy, is a joy to watch. I can't help but think that, in a less profit-driven film, these two characters would be fleshed out further, but I can't fault First Class for going beyond its duties in terms of characterisation, considering it's a straight-out actioner.A minor gripe rests with the film's laziness in maintaining the setting. We are told that it is set in '62, but without the black-and-white televisions featuring JFK, and the odd Beatles mop-top worn by an extra, you could be forgiven for thinking the film is set in the present day. Also, it seems most blockbusters set in this time go with one of two options when establishing a background. The film's events are linked either to the threat of Communism and a nuclear war, or the counterculture (think Summer of Love, Woodstock, all that). First Class went with the first option, and regardless of the backdrop set in the comic books (which I am not familiar with), I could have gone without it.Finally, an honourable mention goes to the film's ability to tie up all loose ends, and explain, to a simpleton like me, some of the intricacies of how the X-Men came to be. These include the genetic mutation of Beast, the purpose of Magneto's helmet and how Charles ends up in a wheelchair. But put simply, in a choice between 'give it a look' and 'don't waste your time', it's a yes from me.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad.

Great Characters; Great Actors= Excellent Film,X-men First Class brings the X-men franchise back into the spotlight after two pretty lackluster X-films. First Class goes back to the very beginning of the story of Professor X and Magneto showing us their journey to friendship and destruction. The movie is technically a prequel but it more or less plays like a reboot so that it is very accessible to new viewers but still has several nods to the previous films that will keep fans interested. The movie brings back Bryan Singer(who directed the great X-men and terrific X2) as a producer and brings in Matthew Vaughn(of Kick-Ass and Stardust fame) as the director. This film looks to be the promising comeback for the series that has had a couple of weak entries in the past. Is this possible? After watching the painful X3 and the mixed bag that was X-men Origins:Wolverine the franchise is getting sort of old. Can X-men First Class re-energize this tired franchise or should we pray that this team never makes a comeback?Want to read more?

First class? Not quite...,"A prequel designed to pave the way for the franchise retcon of Days of Future Past, X-Men: First Class charts how Professor X (James McAvoy) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender) meet and become friends, enlist fellow mutants to form a special team, battle against ex-Nazi megalomaniac Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon), and ultimately part company on bad terms after an accident leaves Xavier paralysed from the waist down.On a good day, I would have declared X-Men: First Class to be a hugely enjoyable superhero romp; unfortunately, I recently re-watched X-Men 2 and saw Days of Future Past earlier this week, both of which are so good that this one actually seems quite disappointing in comparison. McAvoy and Fassbender excel as the younger versions of Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellern, the lovely Jennifer Lawrence lights up the screen as Mystique, and the special effects are top notch, but the story seems less involved than the aforementioned X-Men films, while Matthew Vaughan's handling of the material is nowhere near as stylish or sophisticated as that of Bryan Singer.It's perhaps a bit harsh on a film that essentially serves its purpose, but having been spoilt by the excellence of Singer's entries in the franchise, I now expect much more from my X-Men.7/10, which is not bad, but still the lowest rating that I have given to any of the X-Men films I've seen so far (The Wolverine being the only one I have yet to watch).",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An Honest Opinion for X Men First Class,"Firstly, this was the first X Men film I have seen. And boy, after watching it in the cinema, it sure did deliver beyond expectations. For some reason which I'm still not certain of, the X Men films never really did attract me, maybe because I thought it would just fall into the stereotype of traditional over rated Marvel releases that have you falling asleep because you feel like your watching the film for the sake of it. Back to the point, this film had me walking out of that cinema with a smile on my face so wide, the grand canyon would be put to shame. This wasn't a smile of ""oh that really entertained me"", no, because films are not for entertaining, but for gripping you and pulling you into that screen. This sure did that. Box ticked for sure.Lets start with the cast, and wow, just brilliant. The relationship between each and every single member of the cast was just astonishing. This was because you could feel it, not just see it. I loved James McAvoy's performance of a dry sense of reserved humour backed up with that Oxford knowledge, which I believe gave him the edge over Michael Fassbender, who I must say should not be left in the dark. The sense of emotion was beaming from Magneto, maybe he does actually have magnetic powers, because he sure did attract me to his sense of feeling for those whose his character had lost. But of course, me being me, I do like a villain! Therefore I say, take a bow Kevin Bacon. For me, Kevin was my personal favourite from the film. His edge of darkness and sly character really carried a strong performance throughout. He really took centre stage with this and did not hold back on anything, his movement, voice and charisma just had me grinning all the way. He had everything a marvel bad guy should have. An evil background, arrogance, slyness, and of course, a really cool costume. Well, a really cool helmet which was taken from the latest NASA space shuttle.Next, what else gripped me from this film was of course, the Directing of the cast. For this, I take my hat off to Matthew Vaughn. And from some reliable sources, ""he should have done the others"". And after seeing First Class, you can clearly see why. As the saying goes, he did exactly what it says on the tin, he did a first class job! This was because he did not play it out like the good guy catching the bad guy, he added levels which had the mind ticking over constantly. I found myself asking myself, what happens next, oh my gosh where will it go now, and stating I was not expecting that. And that is what a brilliant director does, he reaches out beyond that fourth wall and draws in the audience, making them feel a part of the story, getting them to look in all directions, keeping them guessing until that final scene.Overall, I'm not a film critic. All of the above probably has no sense in it. I'm just trying to give an honest cinema going opinion of what I saw. And what I did see, was simply, amazing. It blew beyond all expectations, had me transfixed for the entire journey, had me smiling, wondering and enjoying. The choice of cast, which was strengthened by the bond of the young uniting to take down evil, lead with expert knowledge, took this film to the max. The screenplay with the thrilling and jaw dropping battle scenes in comparison to the one on one scenes which were intense yet heart felt had me feeling like this was worth the money. For a first time X Men viewer, this is a feature that is worthy of any audience and does everyone who took part proud, it is an outstanding achievement in the industry of film. Just brilliant.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Vaughn Conjures up Solid X-Men Origin Story,"I saw X-Men first Class at the theater the week it came out and its out on DVD this week. I was not a member of three guys at the time of its release. However, with its DVD now available for viewing this seemed like a good time to write up a review.This is an X-Men origin story by director/writer Matthew Vaughn. We are introduced to Young Charles Xavier (Prof. X) and Erik Lehnsherr (Magneto) in the early part of the film. Other than some of the cool special effects and smoking hot half naked chicks this may have been my favorite part. Vaughn's origin story of the two characters is very well done. It certainly helps the viewer understand the motivations of the characters later in the film.As the plot progresses the CIA discovers the existence of mutants in 1962 working for terrorist Shaw (Kevin Bacon). As a response to this threat the CIA recruits Xavier to assemble a team of mutants to work for the CIA. The film then shows a montage of recruitments and mutants honing their powers on both sides of the law. As could be expected conflict follows as we become aware of Shaw's evil plans.I found the film to be a little bit campy. Other than the origin stories the film is set in the early go go 60's. We see a lot James Bond/Austin Powers type gadgets and shaggy lifestyle depicted. This could have been problematic for the film but it seemed to skate the line of campiness without going full blown over the top with more than a modicum of success.The special effects and fight scenes in the film are top notch. I especially enjoyed the fleshing out of the Mystique character. Similarly, the way they created and utilized the character Beast was spectacular. Admittedly some of the action was a bit over the top but this is a based on a comic book series and it aiming to be fun escapism. That being the case I felt the film did more than an adequate job in providing fast paced action entertainment.As an aside for Marvel purists, and comic nerd friends the film does not adhere strictly to cannon and you should prepare yourself accordingly. That being said Vaughn does a good job of capturing the spirit of the X-men and hopefully introducing them to an ever wider audience. Who knows it might even generate some more comic book readers.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Better Than the Original Trilogy,"This first installment of the second ""X-Men"" trilogy is better than any of the films in the first trilogy.Michael Fassbender and James MacAvoy give much more committed performances than they need to playing younger versions of Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart. We get the origin story of the first X-Men clan and learn how they broke into two factions, tidily wrapped around a revisionist version of what actually took place during the Cuban missile crisis.I don't care much for superhero movies as a rule, but on average I enjoy the X-Men movies more than any others. They're not as bloated and self-important as the Avengers or Batman series.And I really envied Michael Fassbender all of his cool leather jackets.Grade: B+",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Doesn't Hold Up,"I think the novelty of watching the birth of big names in this story has clouded a lot of peoples judgement.Big storytelling problems:1)The origins of both Magneto and Xavier were really sprinted through at the beginning of the movie.2)The idea of Mystique being Xavier's foster sister not only isn't as interesting as her comic book origins, but also has absolutely no link in the original movie trilogy that this movie is supposed to precede.3) This being the origin of the war (a war at least as politically, militarily and motivationally complex- and longer- than the historical Cold War) between mutants and humans, there was a lot of opportunity here to showcase more than the development of the school. I get that the complexity of the comic book world can't be compacted into thee films, but while watching the original trilogy I found this fantasy world far more challenging and interesting.4) Kind of an addition to number 3: Magneto and Xavier's brief discussions about their opposing viewpoints come off so one sided in Charles' favor. The metaphorical subject matter here is oversimplified to a point where there is very little relatability and empathy with Magneto. Even for those of us (the vast majority) who disagree with Magneto, the original films did a far better job of bringing his humanity and personal struggle to light. One of the most extraordinary aspects of the X-men canon is it's realistic reflection of morality. What is morality? Does something have to be right or wrong? Does intent or motivation factor in any way? These questions were present in the comic books and weighed in heavily in the trilogy...they get lost in a Superman-esque depiction of Xavier's moral code pitted against Shaw's psychopathic rampage here in the prequel.5) By having mutants be directly responsible for the entire Cold War (like ALL of it. Like against the will of humans...) a lot of metaphorical resonance is lost in the following story. These historical events helped shape our understanding and analysis of this fantasy world. That they have been ENTIRELY manipulated by the fantasy world itself is somewhat cheapening.6) Almsot every human was very caricatureesque. It was very cartoony and hard to take seriously.FIlmmaking Problems:1) the CGI and special effects were a little lacking for 2011. I;m not sure how this happened, this franchise seems pretty big budget.2) The screenplay was super half-**ss. This movie was scripted so that a blind man could understand every emotional detail. Even then though, the character development is shoddy and tends to leap in some way from one place to another throughout the film. The exceptions here being Magneto and Xavier....who hardly show any development at all. Their Friendship is a foot note, and their characters are at every stage fundamentally the same as the stage before. Too simple for young adult audiences.3) Supposing you're one of those people who are like ""Dude, shut up, I watched this for action, adventure, bad**ss visuals..."" i give you that that's totally part of the magic of the both comics and movies...but were you satisfied with sh*t like banshees lame flight scenes? Or Magento's underwhelming displays of power? Or how about Havok's greatest display of strength being his cutting a statue in half? The one scene with any good edge of your seat action was when Shaw raids the military base. Period.4) The villains, without exception, were hard to watch because they were all acted poorly and given very little exposure.Sidenotes:-The wolverine cameo was stupid and gimmicky.-The beach scene was anticlimactic.Magneto blaming Moira for Charles' injury lasted about 30 seconds and either needed to be elaborated upon or cut entirely.Charles telling Raven to go with Eric was indefensibly stupid, uncharacteristic and again, in no way relevant to the story of the trilogy.-Who chose the lineup of mutants here? Just super underwhelming. And none of them do anything too cool with their powers. It was like watching a b-string circus. I'll admit I'm kind of excited see if Mystique and Azazel's affair and Nightcrawler are incorporated in the future though.Jennifer Lawrence, Nicholas Hoult and James McAvoy gave the only good performances in this movie, and even then (with he exception of McAvoy, who seems to genuinely be trying to squeeze water from a stone here) the performances are brought down by the story, screenplay and generally poor filmmaking.This is a really successful franchise...like really very successful. Who OKed this? How many people were down, read/watched/reviewed this before it's release and were like ""looks good to me."" Seriously. This movie didn't hold up to precedent, and without the novelty, if the comic books and trilogy hadn't been around, it would have flopped very very hard.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Gets better every time!,"X-men: First Class 88This movie is great! I loved it even more after every time I watch it. Story is superb, acting and the choice of cast is perfect, music is awesome. Matthew Vaughan's sense of storytelling in this new chapter of the X-men series is wonderful. It is a great way to introduce basically new characters in a new chapter of their lives that we have never seen. It has a good sense of mood, with a fun atmosphere. The overall style to the film is great, with good set pieces and clothing to fit in with the 1960s time period. It is possible to have an X-men film without Hugh Jackman's Wolverine for over a minute. With a good b-plot, good music, fun,smart storytelling, Vaughan's new X-men characters will be beloved!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"I think this is where superhero media started to get really annoying, a soft reboot?","Having realized that Bryan Singer and Tom Rothman destroyed the original franchise, we got this soft reboot. This time without a massive focus on Wolverine.This one even starts with the same opening as the first X-Men. But instead of fast forwarding to the present day we get an exploration of Xavier and Erik through the Cold War years. It's almost similar to an X-Men version of Forrest Gump. Only this time we get a criticism of both superpowers from a group of mutants that act in their own self interest and all have varying degrees of a superiority complex.Seriously, all of the mutants in this film believe they are ""more evolved"" than humans, which is unironically what the people who were oppressing Erik and his family believed about themselves. The main guy is a eugenicist and he might have learned it from the most famous eugenicists in history. And all of the mutants agree with his worldview, just some disagree with his methods. If mutants were real then this would be a troubling mindset to have, especially considering the term ""more evolved"" literally doesn't make sense. We all exist at the same time so we are all equally evolved. Maybe a genetics professor would understand this but I guess not.Aside from the disturbing framing and authoritarian tendencies of everybody in the movie, it is just marginally better than whichever previous installment you think is best.All of the scenes where the mutants interact with each other are the best scenes. I wish we could have gotten an entire movie about all of them just being people and being accepted by each other. I would love that movie much more than what we got here. Luckily this film is over 2 hours long so they had plenty of time to give us all that good stuff before it went to mindless violence or cartoonist villains.Also, hunting Nazis is awesome. Erik is my hero for that. I hope he killed a lot of them.I can see why fans like this one so much more than the campiness of the original trilogy. But all of the inherent authoritarianism and eugenics are too overwhelming for me to like it all that much.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
X-Men: First Class should be my favorite in the X-Men series.,"The main story is that Professor X and Wan ciwang met when they were young, fought together, had differences and finally parted ways.

An indifferent film that has enjoyable moments but something is missing,"At some points, quite an entertaining movie, but something was still missing. Despite the experienced actors, the performance was at times tougher than in any school play. The script wasn't quite the worst in this film series, but still quite childish. The beginning of the film was jumping and there were too many unnecessary sidelines. Somehow I enjoyed the camp spirit of the 60s, with James Bond or Batman vibes. However, it alone did not support the film very far.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best of the X-Men,"I am a fan of Marvel in general and I loved all the previous X-Men films so I expected to enjoy this film anyway and had quite high expectations. It did not disappoint and is in fact my favourite film of the franchise. This is saying something considering the fact that Wolverine is my favourite X-Men character -although he does feature with an amusing cameo.One of the things I loved about this film was seeing the origins of many characters and seeing how relationships formed and developed. It was interesting to see the contrast in this film from the main three, particularly regarding Professor X and Magneto.The fact that this film is a prequel to the main films means that anybody could watch it and understand the story line. I definitely recommend this film to anyone and I think that those who would not normally watch this genre of film may be pleasantly surprised.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of this decade's best superhero movies (http://themoviemaven.posterous.com),"The original ""X-Men"" in 2000 propelled the meteoric rise of superheroes into the next decade and beyond. The first installment was followed up by a spectacular second, ""X2."" Unfortunately, the third, ""The Last Stand"" (with the change of director from Bryan Singer to Brett Ratner) fell flat. Crammed with too many characters, it's big on style and nothing else. ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" has its moments. Director Matthew Vaughn (""Layer Cake,"" ""Kick-Ass"") with Singer's return as a producer brings back the ""X-Men"" that fans worship.""First Class"" is more of the origin story of the future Professor X (Patrick Stewart) and Magneto (Ian McKellen). They're young men learning about who they are, what they're capable of, discovering their superpowers and others like them, and where they stand in the world.The story opens in Nazi's concentration camp, where metal-bending Erik Lehnserr (Michael Fassbender, ""Pride & Prejudice""), as a little boy, was separated from his family. Discovered as a mutant by a psychopathic doctor (Kevin Bacon), he's forced to mentally move a coin and fails, resulting in the tragic death of his mother. What follows is a terrifyingly powerful scene as Erik's power is unlocked by rage. He carries this deep-rooted anger to adulthood, turning into a vengeance-seeker and later a full-blown villain.Telepathic Charles Xavier (James McAvoy, ""Wanted"") grows up in a sprawling, remote estate. One day he finds Raven/Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence), a shape-shifting blue mutant, masquerading as his mother in his kitchen. Since then they live together like brother and sister. There's a glimpse of their university days, where Charles is quite a charmer with the co-eds and eventually becomes a renowned professor in genetics mutation.A CIA agent, Moira MacTaggert (Rose Byrne) stumbles upon the existence of mutants while in pursuit of Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon), which turns out to be the same Nazi doctor who killed Erik's mother. Sebastian is also a mutant, with the power to absorb and release energy force. He's accompanied by diamond-encrusted Emma Frost, twister-spinning Riptide, tailed devil Azazel.An underwater incident leads Charles to Erik, where Charles saves his life. From then on their friendship grows. Erik's intensity is balanced by Charles' calming influence. They travel together to track down the other mutants - wing-sprouting Angel (Zoe Kravits), ear-splitting Banshee (Caleb Landry Jones), ape-like Beast (Nicholas Hoult), evolving Darwin (Edi Gathegi), fiery Havok (Lucas Till). Their relationships with the mutant proteges display their mentoring ability. The training at Charles' estate to control and manipulate their powers for good provides some of the lighthearted scenes.Even with a common bond, Charles and Erik's ideological differences drive them apart. Charles believes that mutants and humans can co-exist peacefully, whereas Erik seeks to destroy for fear of being dominated.With Sebastian playing the United States and Russian governments to start World War III, the world now discovers the mutants and their abilities during the showdown off the Cuban coast. Erik is most powerful with Charles' assistance when he can find that place mentally between rage and serenity. Sebastian meets his demise in a fitting fashion.Once the missile crisis is averted, however, the humans, united by the fear of the unknown, turn against the mutants. With Erik out of control, Charles tries everything in his power to turn around the situation. Charles is struck and ends up paralyzed. The moment comes when the mutants, influenced by their own personal experiences, must choose side in determining the future of the human race.The retro design and archival news footage provide ""First Class"" an authentic feel. It's unfortunate that it's missing a few of the main mutants; most notably Wolverine, Storm, Cyclops, Jean Gray. If you blink, you'd miss a surprising cameo or two.It's a thrill to see the superb special effects be put into exhilarating use; the interesting mix of superpowers, an anchor ripping off a ship, submarine and missiles suspended in the air. But that's not what makes ""First Class"" a real first class. It's a lot more than good versus evil. The dynamics of Charles and Erik's intense friendship, underlined by solid acting, is the strongest point. The genuine human emotions and implications - rage, pain, agony, fear, isolation and longing - to be ""normal,"" to be tolerated for being different and be accepted in society are the pillars of the story.An extraordinary blast from the past, ""X-Men: First Class"" will go down as one of this decade's best superhero movies!The MovieMaven (http://themoviemaven.posterous.com)",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
a classic and a genre-defining movie!,"This second go around for the X-Men is as good as the first if not better. I seriously hope this is the start of another trilogy. Sure, they have a lot to live up to but this film seems more sophisticated and has a better story than the very first X-Men movie, which was primarily about setting up this universe. Here, the characters previously introduced are fleshed out in a comprehensive and cohesive manner, and the newly introduced characters are blended in seamlessly with the story. The cast-selection is perfect, even in the established roles. I had my doubts whether anyone could fill Patrick Stewart's or Ian Mckellen's shoes but that really wasn't the case. These actors just took the younger roles and played it perfectly. I loved the action and the heart of this film and, again, it all perfectly blends with what's come before without relying on it at all. This stuff stands on its own and stands tall.I remember back in May, my friend and I walked out of the theatre after seeing Thor smiling. We loved that film and anointed it the best of the summer. Well, maybe we were a bit hasty in our judgment. I knew this X-Men movie would be better than X3, but I wasn't expecting to walk in and see a classic and a genre-defining movie. Thor still rates right at the top of the summer but right now, X-Men First Class is the best movie of the year. Bring on the sequels!",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Almost Perfect,"X-MEN: FIRST CLASS – CATCH IT ( A- ) X-Men: First Class introducing into the friendship of Professor-X and Magneto. The movie starts with their childhood, where we see how one lives a perfect life and other tormented. We have been aware of story and believes of Professor X and Magneto. They have been clearly showed in previous X movies. The X-Men:First Class is a really good movie which some great action sequences specially in the end and where all young mutants get attacked by Sebastian Shaw and his disciples. The movie did a really decent job in presenting each mutant and its talent plus in bringing variety of youngsters all together. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbeder complemented each other to the fullest. Though, I felt we didn't get to see them spending much quality time which indicate the true friendship. Michael Fassbender has this power to adopt every role, this man never disappoints. He shines through his roles. James McAvoy was a perfect choice to play Mr.Nice & Naughty Professor-X. after the lead mutants, Jennifer Lawrance Aka. Raven Aka. Mystique got the best scope in showing her adjustment with being BLUE. Stepping into Hot shoes of Rebecca Romijn is a huge deal. We have been seeing Mystique unique, tall and sexy. Jennifer Lawrence is nothing like her but she sue is great actress. I think she was better human than Mystique in this movie. Nicholas Hoult is charming as geek but as Beast, well he was more of a wolf than a Beast. Lucas Till is stunning in swinging flames. I just love his heavy voice since Hanna Montana. Zoe Kravitz is sweet little sultry Angel. Caleb Landry Jones as Banshee is cool, he get to do some amazing stunts. Edi Gathegi as Darwin, Jason Flemyng as Azazel, Álex González as Riptide were good. Now lets talk about other cast Rose Byrne as Moira MacTaggert is top on the weird CIA Agent. Oliver Platt as The Man in Black was right out of ""The Big C"". Kevin Beccon as Sebastian Shaw is pretty good. He wasn't as strong but he was wicked. January Jones as Emma Frost is Ice-Cold and apparently if too be believed she is Ice Cold in real life too. I think it won't be wrong to say that this girl has become the 2nd most hated actress in Hollywood after Katherine heigl. Their imagine in media is not shaping good. Anyways just like in Unknown she was Ice cold in this movie too and luckily she was the Perfect choice. So, the X-Men: First Class is almost perfect movie with some great action and performances but still their was something missing just like in Thor. There is something missing in movies that has not been able to made them A 101% Perfect Roller coaster ride. P.S Cameos by Rebecca Romijn as Mystique – older, Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, Sasha Pieterse as Teenage Girl by the aquarium are appreciated And I was shocked to see Brendan Fehr as almost Nonspeaking Communications Officer's role.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Imperfect, but I'll give it a passing grade","Although not underwhelming, There is something missing from X-Men first class. I felt it took a little long to get going and there were too many characters that didn't amount to enough. As an origin story X-Men first class did an adequate job of getting the characters where they need to be without too much contrivance, As an action film, it's coherent and competent, often visually stimulating, but the story was a bit scrappy. I felt it took a little long to get going and there were too many characters that didn't amount to enough.Michael Fassbender may have second billing but the movie belongs to him. The majority of the drama in the film surrounds him, and subsequently his performance was the best. James MacAvoy doesn't quite have Fassbender's commanding presence but he brings a nice slyness to the picture. Jennifer Lawrence meanwhile is just a waste of talent in a role that is surprisingly under defined, and as Raven, she looked a little clunky.As I said, the film is a little slow to get going but the climax was strong enough. I was impressed with the camera work, and the overall assembly was nice, The appearance of Michael Ironside was a cute touch My only comments would be that Beast looks too much like Cookie monster, and Kevin Bacon spends a bit to much time in a Greek helmet that looks rather big on him.Looking back on the experience, I'll say that X-Men first class has skill but the product is incomplete.

Man by nature is being tuned to a whole new categorical.,"In fact, the fact that the highest ratings of the movie titles with ""X-Men"" can not inspire the viewer, whose goal in going to the movies - a bucket of popcorn, cold ""Cola"" and lots of positive emotions directly from the spectacle, which he expects to receive . At the same time there were fears that the movie can be a tedious and cloying, especially after the promises made by Matthew Vaughn from the movie to make complicated mix of youth melodrama, like ""Twilight,"" and other things, that so typical of the summer blockbuster. However, all expectations after the scene display their talents Eric were some dull, useless, because the movie - it's not just action and melodrama, it is also an element of culture, an element that can, if desired to embody anything.Rant on the topic of how good the story was not worth it, because he's really good, but no more. It has some inconsistencies and small plot ""appendixes, but they do not do anything wrong the general concept for how to write off all at the expense of"" the starting point ""and the fact that this film adaptation of comic books, comic books, moreover, is not the most famous Russian public, it turns pretty easy. No, nothing delusional and objectively excess is not observed, but difficult to call all of these plot moves riding genius. The script just fine. More precisely, even so: is simple, because even good.Everything goes through some sort of unwritten plan, as usual, and I must say, very confidently. Sometimes even a thought that, come this tape years ago, eleven commercials, will it be now, if not universally accepted classics of the genre, or at least included in the list of his rules.In ""First Class"" There is nothing flowery and, often, fills all the empty space. All lines are the heroes have a logical ending, and perhaps that's why nice to watch all this action. Yes, of course, who would be there that may say, but the pathos is also present, but, in fact, it strongly enough in comparison with many similar bands, and when it is, the characters seem even heartier, perhaps, may have even some on-screen life is waking up.All this, of course, is not very easy and very pleasant to an eye a couple of James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender. Their duet looks as organically and naturally, because guys are not devoid of distinctive features and play their characters with great devotion, that neither can not affect the overall level of acting. Just a little surprised by the ease McAvoy, but this is the surplus of the image, not otherwise. Fassbender is, in fact, magnificent, and I say this almost without exaggeration. His image is powerful, hot, passionate and extremely interesting artistically.Mummery excellent main characters and a good story canvas strengthened and that the action as the main driving element of most summer blockbusters, which, incidentally, ""X-Men"" could be considered with interest, looks almost the most minor details of the painting. Yes, everything is done at the highest level and the director of most scenes you can put a solid ""five"", but ""First Class"" is surprisingly skillfully won it on the feelings of the characters, not how beautiful or, conversely, they are operating their awful abilities.In general, turned abruptly on all sides. Tape is without doubt a good and attractive, but in this case, probably all. It seeks not to be supersereznoy and raise topics that she does not pick up on the forces, and this is its main advantage. ""First Class"" - a reference sample of summer blockbuster, which must appeal to many. It's simple and delicious. In the film, there is nothing complicated and abstruse, and the curse for this Matthew Vaughn makes no sense.

Souped-up same-old,"Sorry, folks, to be the party-pooper, but I thought this was just another comic-strip movie with brilliant CGI and better-than-usual performances. It was easy to feel that McAvoy and Fassbender would physically ""grow up"" to be Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart, BUT the transition from headstrong good-guy Erik to super-baddie Magneto seemed to come from nowhere. Kevin Bacon's villain was from the school of Blofeld and I liked the notion that Mutants played a key role in the 1962 Cuban Crisis (although it somewhat detracts from the brinkmanship skills of John F. Kennedy!). This is only a prequel in the sense that we saw the Mutants honing and controlling their ""gifts"" before pitching them against Kevin Bacon's Doctor Doom in routines that we have seen too often in Marvel comics and movies. Reminding us that Superheroes are just as insecure as the rest of us has also been done before, more successfully with Batman and Superman than with the over-angsty Spiderman. The ""conversion"" of Erik and Raven into Magneto and Mystique was little more than a postscript to link back to the Trilogy. Otherwise this was quite a lot of souped-up same-old. The blockbuster I'm really looking forward to this summer is Cowboys and Aliens. I also hope the Alien prequel will do a better job than X-Man: First Class; the Alien movies set a very high standard.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Definitely Not Bad... But Seriously Questionable!,"There are some accusations here of mafia reviews to pump up the films viewability. I won't exactly agree with that conspiracy theory but after watching the film I have to say it's worth something to look into it.I'd leave the acting, plot, character development and other technical aspects of the film for other reviewers to debate. The most alarming, and for that matter, disappointing, aspect of the film for me is its story. Where in Marvel Universe have they pulled this one out?!I have a copy of Marvel's compilation of synopsis of the first X-men series (i already forgot the exact title of the comics) once, and this certainly was nowhere in those pages. i researched other materials online for traces of where they got this version of the X-men origin and i couldn't find any. if they are trying to stage a prequel to the first X-men series, at least they should have kept that story in mind and create a storyline that will make the two add-up.The real First Class was Marvel Girl a.k.a. Jean Grey, Cyclops, Beast and Angel. they are the characters that shaped the early days of X-men. if they brave to create a story of X-men without Wolverine, they should have stick to the original material or at least give respect to it.contrary to what the other reviews are saying, this take does not save the X-men franchise. it only succeeds in further entrenching the confusion and complications created by the first trilogy. it is far from being batman begins to batman.Marvel Entertainment should reclaim rights to the X-men franchise and get Chris Nolan on board.

Good acting, good direction, good script...films in general should have this, but a good summer film can back up it's special effects and action with quality filmmaking. And finally, they should focus more on the deeper things, like themes and humanity than their shallow action or comedy elements. First Class, much to my surprise, embodies all of these and creates a truly wonderful summer blockbuster.While many might be skeptical that the fifth X-men film would certainly be one of the worst, the fact is, it's probably the best. Where the other films tried to focus on the Marvel universe and the wow factor of the X-men and their powers, pleasing fanboys with wonderful visuals and nods here and there, First Class puts it's characters first. Sure, it's nothing we haven't seen before, but the focus on the characters first is a welcome change. In fact, it makes me think of the original X-men film, a film which is now more than ten years old. The quality of the filmmaking here is leagues beyond the original film. Here we have top notch performances, and while there is certainly no outranking Patrick Steward and Ian McKellen, the entire cast for First Class seems to work so very well. I can't remember enjoying the entire ensemble cast from the original trilogy as much as I did here. This is certainly thanks to Matthew Vaughn, who seems to do an extremely good job handling origin stories. Much like he did with Kick Ass, this film is well grounded, despite featuring a large number of mutant power-fueled action sequences.And that's the real trick here. The film strikes the perfect balance between action and drama. There is one scene in particular between Charles and Erik that is very touching and goes far beyond any scene from any of the previous X-Men films. The action is very fun too, and some of my favorites of these involve Banshee's combination of flight and super sonic super powers. Suffice to say, while this film could have simply been a great action film with great performances, in the same way Thor was, it goes beyond by adding a load of heart. There's even some nods to the original films, including an applause inducing cameo, that will have fans salivating.Suffice to say, I can't praise the film enough. It's certainly not without it's flaws. Kevin Bacon's performance, when in comparison to the others, is a little underwhelming. As others have said, he hams it up. And it's not even so bad, except that everyone else just plays their parts so well, his seems a little, as stated, underwhelming. Other parts seem to be thrown in without much to do, namely Darwin, who is barely on screen. But these are minor complaints, as this is a fantastic comic book film. While Marvel's lineup has come a long way, their films continue to get better and better. First Class is a large step in the right direction for the X-Men series of films. If they were to say they were giving the series a reboot, with this kind of quality, you would have no complaints from me.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Possibly the best Marvel film so far,"It's not 'The Dark Knight' reader. Don't go into first class expecting a gritty, boundary pushing superhero movie that will totally blow you away. It's honestly a tad formulaic, a few of the special effects are a bit off, the concept is a bit silly, the nitpick list could probably go on for a while...Despite this, I absolutely loved this movie. X-men one was good, but too short and anti-climactic, X2 was a great blockbuster that really ramped up the franchise, X-men three was kind of a let down but not as bad as some say, Woloverine was just a bit rubbish, it had it's moments but... meh, First Class I feel, puts them all, even 2, to shame.Let's start with the performances which I must say were all excellent. James McAvoy's Charles Xaivier (Professor X) was charming, intellectual and just plain likable, I think he really got it down to a tee. The same can be said of Michael Fassenbender who's Eric Lehnsherr (Magneto) was tragic, rage filled and in a lot of cases quite frightening. Without giving anything away, there's this scene in Argentina and I mean... DAMN! It turned into like a Tarantino film, it was thrillingly put together. Honestly this is an awesome Magneto. He owns the screen whenever he's there. The Villain, Robert shaw, played by Kevin bacon really strikes a chord on the douchometer scale. While I didn't really like him I think that was the point. He was a great overly nasty villain who the rest of the cast were able to play off perfectly. I really, really hated this guy, which was great. As for the rest of the cast they were all great too. Mystique was far more interesting here than in the prior three films, Beast was a good sort of metaphor for ugliness and the attempts to stop it, CIA agent Moria (or whatever her name was) was good, hell they were all good.I think the film was actually more a character piece than anything else. The action scenes were great and all but it's the characters, the performances, the scripting that make this film shine above most of today's blockbusters. I'm not saying it will blow your mind, nor do I think it will change your outlook on film, but a a summer popcorn film, it is one of the best of it's kind.My favourite Marvel film was probably Spider-man 2, but now, good god does this give it a run for it's money.I hope Marvel will carry on to make movies of this high an entertainment value.I love this film, it's a big exciting summer blockbuster, definitely the best of the year so far, with lots of action and lots of thrills that ultimately boils down to a character study on race, Human relations, and a friendship tragically falling apart under conflicting ideals.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Didn't meet expectations of XMen Series,"I went into the movie expecting this one to top-off what earlier Xmen movies had done; but this one was not so exciting.I guess the reason this one was slow, was because there was a lot of story building in the movie and it just spoiled it for me. I knew what Xmen were and also the ones that had the powers, so it was not a surprise. The real action is only towards the end, unlike the others where you see a lot of Mutant stuff from the very beginning.But, one thing I did like was the introduction about some of the characters that we saw in previous movies and how they came to be and how it all began; it is good to see the ends meet and this one did take care of the beginning.One thing on how the movie ended left me thinking if the writer has something up their sleeve and is there going to be some more between the First Class and the First Xmen - there are obvious gaps that can mean more movies that I am looking forward to.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Enjoyable despite the plot holes - the good outweighs the bad,"I generally find it quite hard to enjoy movies that have so many plot holes and inconsistencies, but managed to this time. The great, engaging cast (January Jones aside) and depth of characterisation had much to do with this, as did the flawless editing and cinematography.It's a shame they didn't spend more time working out details like why Raven seemed to grow up most if not all of her life in England yet has an American accent for some reason (I know the real reason was Jennifer Lawrence being incapable of mastering an English accent, but what about in the movie?), how her brother-sister back story relationship with Xavier is completely inconsistent with anything in previous films/comics, how non-Americans can so easily find themselves working for the US government, and I could go on and on.None of these issues completely drag the plot down since none of them are completely crucial to it, but you get the feeling that if they had spend a bit more effort addressing these problems this could have been a real masterpiece (well at least as far as big budget epic blockbusters go). Shame!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Entertaining and engaging,The first X-men movie was great. X2 was even better. The Last Stand was a big let down and the Wolverine spin off I haven't bothered to see yet. So this would either be the final nail in the mutant coffin or a much needed revival of strength. It turned out to be the latter. The best part was definitely James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender. I enjoyed every second they had on screen separately but together they were pure gold. They echoed the equal genius of Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen in the previous films and they didn't try to imitate them but instead made their own interpretations of Professor X and Magneto. Kevin Bacon was also a nice and evil pig of a villain and I had never seen Mystique be this interesting before. Beast and Azazel were cool too. However I didn't really connect to the younger recruits like Havok and Banshee then again I didn't connect with Cyclops or Storm in the previous films. The action was pretty good. The final battle in particular was a feast for my eyes. The thing I feel could have been better was the pacing. It was just a little too fast. I barely had time to get to know the characters. That aside this was an effective popcorn flick with some good action and a well executed story.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Acceptance vs. Dominance.,"Saw this on the day it came out. The local Cinema was packed with audiences, though sadly not for this but perhaps fans of Pirates and Kung Fu Panda 2. Which is a shame as this more darkly comic, brutal and engaging sequel is more than what the 4th instalment of the Pirates' films has promised.This film has the subtle whit, the daring and brutal action (coin scene), emotion, character development and welded plot that is required from these types of superhero/comic films. This film succeeds where the rushed complexion of X3 and Wolverine: X-Men Origins left us feeling hollow.This film is most on par with X2 (X-Men 2/X-Men United), exceeding X1 and surely exceeding X3 and Wolverine combined.The real stars are James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender as the brilliant Charles Xavier (Prof. X) and elusive Erik Lensherr (Magneto) respectively. They play the parts will similar presence and calibre of their former counterparts Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen. They reinvigorate the characters adding further depth, energy and a likability which allows us to develop an affection for them and we become sympathetic to Magneto especially as he deals with internal demons and the power he releases.Kevin Bacon' Sebastian Shaw as the central villain really is a surprise. He pulls it off excellently with good amount of Machiavellian manipulation and power, which stems the actions of Magneto. He doesn't do internal monologues or make some small evil scheme feel like a grandiose escapade, to quote a beloved character from ""The Dark Knight"", 'some men, just want to watch the world burn' by initiating WW3. As well as being a period piece, the backdrop of the Cuban Missile Crisis and the intense climate of fear and paranoia driving the countries leaders is well told. Very much akin to Alan Moore's Watchmen and subsequent 2008 film by Zack Snyder. Additional to him is the femme fatale, right-hand woman, January Jones' Emma Frost who can rival Prof. X. She provides an excellent performance, chivalry is definitely not dead. The young mutant cast is an ensemble of likable, learning kids who get thrown into the mix very early on. The key themes identified were Acceptance and Dominance; Prof X and Magneto. Conflicting ideals that sometimes meet head on and diverge violently.Matthew Vaughn didn't herald much of the creative ideas of this film, as the hand of Bryan Singer is felt in the control of plot and character development. But regardless, there IS character development! Dir. Matthew Vaughn has pulled off a excellent superhero summer action film with enough endeavours and allegorical metaphors to keep us busy. It doesn't feel too Bryan Singer-esqe but it feels rejuvenated with a much more mature sense of style.Overall - 8.5/10I have to watch this again.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Fantastic Fantastic Fantastic,"This Movie is without a doubt THE BEST X-men and THE BEST prequel EVER made!!! and i ma not just making it up as a X-men fan, every thing about this movie was perfect. The acting By James McAvoy nailed his role as Xavier. And i also believe that Jennifer Lawrence was fantastic and beautiful.oh and Kevin Bacon... what can you say for Kevin Bacon?? The man was outstanding in his role.Until now i really wasn't a fan of Superhero films, but this really changed my mind.One thing that i wasn't so sure of , was the absence of Logan OR Wolverine. But 10 Mins into the film i totally forgot about him.and Again, the best prequel or possibly the best superhero film so farRating : 10 /10 for sure !!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Not the Dark Knight, but not Wolverine","As we all know the genre of interest in the past decade has been superhero movies. They're probably the biggest most popular group of action blockbusters and if recent trends are any example we're about to get more of them than ever. So kick up your britches because if my personal expectations are accurate X-Men: First Class might be the last good superhero movie we get, before producers with money in their eyes take over everything.X-Men: First Class (as if you need me to tell you) is about Professor Xavier and Magneto and how they united as the X-Men for the first time before the stories in the previous trilogy took place. Mystique is the only other X-Men that really gets a developed back story, and the others in the mutant cast are there almost as replacement for the more popular mainstream teams from the trilogy. It all takes place amid the mounting frustrations between the U.S. and Russia (because Watchmen proved that's the best sort of place for a superhero movie to take place, too bad the developers of this movie didn't quite understand why that was such a great setting) during and up to the Cuban Missile Crisis where the film takes its climax.Let's cut to the chase, X-Men is good because it offers great action lets perhaps the most interesting X-Men in the original movies (come on who cares about Wolverine, am I right??) Professor Xavier and Magneto take the spotlight. Powers are shown off in nice cool ways, and they even had another bad guy step in to take Magneto's place, a role in which Kevin Bacon does very well. All the actors did great with their roles, especially the two main characters. If you liked the X-Men trilogy (or at least the first two) then you'll find more to love with this movie.But this is by no means the next Dark Knight (as I've heard multiple people saying now) this movie is not an origin story, this movie is a prequel, and it quite visibly suffers from things that all prequels suffered from. First off, why does X-Men need a prequel? Because the third movie offered a crappy end to the first two movies? In a world where Spider-Man and Batman are already getting reboots to their story lines, why can't we just remake the third X-Men movie and actually make it good? Enough gripe about that though, this movie suffers from Prequel syndrome. While the story is centered around Charles Xavier and Magneto it doesn't do anything that's unexpected with the characters. Mystique even gets her storyline rehashed and set at an earlier date with little to no explanation of a background or anything. Its simply a movie about characters that already have detailed and finished story lines and this movie by no means attempts to mess up that cycle. This movie delivers all the character to the points they start at by the time the first X-Men movie roles around, and that, frankly, is incredibly disappointing.I'd like to say that the character in the movie are so extravagant and well played that that doesn't matter, but for a two hour long movie almost none of the characters get as much development as they deserve, they're like the little electronic cars that some of us to play with as kids, they're predestined to circle around the track right to where we expected them to be. This isn't like the Dark Knight this is like someone made a prequel to the Batman Begins explaining exactly how Bruce's parents made him and why they were destined to got shot in that alleyway. There's almost nothing there to tell that hasn't already been said, and everything else they try to do with them are just curves in the track making sure the warm-up is all said and done before the actual plot begins with the first movie made way back when.Look, as much as I want to like this movie, its simply just another X-Men movie. If you are fine with that than so be it, but don't fall into the trap that so many people are. Just because they made two bad movies before this one doesn't mean that this mediocre rehash is the next gold bar on the pile.I give it 7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good prequel. Intelligent movie,"X-men First Class is a great movie, and an intelligent one. I didn't go in with high hopes after seeing X-men Origins: Wolverine, so this was an amazing movie. I think that's why I enjoyed it; I didn't go in with high hopes, and the blend of action and great characters made it what it is.I've never been a fan of X-men, so I found myself a little lost and not making connections to the other movies, but I took little notice of that. The special effects were amazing, and it was a smart movie (unlike some movies out there)Also, how the historical events fit into the movie was really interesting and cool (I can't say much more without a spoiler)Here's my breakdown: Special effects: superb. Acting: Pretty good. Story: Surprisingly fresh. This is the best X-men movie so far, and you can go in knowing nothing, and come out thinking it was pretty cool.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not bad,"Overall its a decent action flick. Its got its ups and downsUps: Magneto's character was really well done. They did a really good job bringing out the tortured element of Eric without making him a wuss like *cough* Anakin Skywalker *cough*. The actor who played him did a pretty good job as well. The Action was great and kept you on the edge of your seat the whole time. It had a really awesome cameo (not going to spoil it) The historical aspect was well played The fictional history was well woven in with the actual history. Good Screenplay. The Tension between Charles and Eric was well done and it really shows the beginnings of their odd friendship. Which is essentially the main point so overall good stuff.Downs: The Dialogue was quite cheesy (but then again it is a comic book movie). The Charles Xavier actor was poorly chosen and did not portray the mutant saint very well at all and was a disappointment.Kevin Bacon was laughable as the main villain. I mean literally laughable. Not in the Heath Ledger Joker awesome way, but the cheesy Adam West Joker way. The actress who played Mystique was poorly acted and the character was poorly executed. She is one of my favorite Mutants so seeing her portrayed like Bella from Twilight particularly got my goat.There's more ups and downs, but I cant go further without spoiling it. Its worth seeing defiantly, just don't go in with high standards. Its way better than X-men: Wolverine and X-3. But it still doesn't hold a candle to X-2 or X-men. But it shows hope that the franchise can be saved after 2 horrible movies.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
No Climax! All Hype! Biggest let-down ever!,"This movie, which is my first to review, was the biggest cinematic let of all time! We have all seen previews that make us think a movie will be something it is not, but that's not even the problem here.The problem lies in the ultimate buildup, which was quite good, with no climax. The movie pitters out midway through and never recovers, in fact it gets worse. It actually feels like they ran out of time and money and were writing the story as it goes. The confrontations are lame and forced.In summary, the first 30 minutes were an 8.8/10. After that the next 20 are about a 6.5 and the final hour is a slow decay from there down to 0 and then negative. You know it's bad when you are in California and nobody even claps at the end of the movie. The fact that this is on the top 250 movie list is insulting to all movies ever made.Final thought: All of the previous X-men movies were better than this junk. I think that people are either paid or film staff is encouraged to write positive reviews when in fact, the movie sucks. That is the only way this has a positive rating.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Absolutely outstanding film,"I just came back from the theater and both my wife and i agree that this was an outstanding movie. The storyline was crafted superbly and the characters were well done. The acting was good throughout the entire cast, especially the main characters McAvoy and Fassbender mesh really well together. I would highly recommend seeing this movie, even if you aren't an X-Men buff. It's entertaining and let's you understand the back story. I'm really hopeful that the box office numbers are high and that the studio decides to continue along this story line. The actors and actresses fit their roles perfectly and the i could see this becoming a franchise. I'm keeping my fingers crossed for more.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Mediocre, at best","I generally agree with the ranking of movies on IMDb. But this one .. I already had bad expectations, but I was disappointed. It's juvenile , the characters completely unconvincing, the story simplistic, the acting really bad. Some of the action scenes are OK, I have to admit. But the whole thing, it's like the X-men for kids. Xavier, but especially Magneto, those character were convincing in part 1&2. But now. As I said, I wasn't expecting much for the 3rd added movie after those first 2 very good ones.And again, I never write reviews. But at the time of writing, XMEN FIRST CLASS RANKS 8 !! X- MEN1 RANKS 7.9 , XMEN2 RANKS 7.7 !! I mean , really ?? I don't even believe it. Some reviews don't seem real, they're corporate. For example: "" Fast paced yet filled with depth, spellbinding visual effects and a gripping finale."" Or: ""The viewer can simply sit and watch it unfold but also be emotionally invested in the journey."" Those are ADVERTISEMENTS ! really. Depth ? Emotionally invested ? I don't believe it.They're isn't anyone, not even passionate xmen lovers or who-ever finding this movie better then nr 1 or 2",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Why you call them ""X- Men""? Here a ""First Class"" answer is ready in this film.","X-Men: First Class is the rewind version of the story. Magneto have had no choice! Michael Fassbender did an excellent score. Professor X was expected with more personality that I missed in James McAvoy... Kevin Bacon, man you are an excellent villain! You preserved more hollowness in disguise. This movie is worth watching. if there are mutants hiding around us they will love it...:PI was astonished of the main characters that are existed in the glossy Marvel Comics pages. They did appear with no alteration in the movie. I was appreciated with this work. Director Matthew Vaughn, he did an excellent job. He has worked like an eye witness in every impact of the story. The massage was very tough to reveal but it is well calculated and involved with the political clips of Cuba-Russia attack of 1963; not to break any relationship between Russia and USA but you will happy to know that the mutants are behind the diplomacy of breaking the war. :PThis film already make a debt and it will be loved by generation XX.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Mostly excellent, but left me wanting","It's obvious to anyone who pays even the slightest attention to the industry that Hollywood has, over the past decade or so, become obsessed with comic book adaptations, and 2011 is choked with more of them than any year before. Thor kicked things off a few weeks back, and soon we will be seeing Green Lantern, Captain America: The First Avenger, Cowboys and Aliens, and The Adventures of Tintin, along with several other lesser known comic films. This week, Marvel Studios unleash X-Men: First Class, directed by Matthew Vaughn (Kick Ass), a prequel to the previous three X-Men films. Well, the first two anyway. This is in fact the second time we've had a movie this year which is the fourth in a series (not to mention the fifth in series Fast Five), and it is becoming hard to get enthused about the endless sequel/remake/reboot machine that Hollywood has become. So, what's to get excited about in the latest X-Men film? As it turns out, quite a lot.Perhaps most importantly for many fans (myself included), X-Men: First Class makes almost no reference to the last film in the series, Brett Ratner's execrable X-Men: The Last Stand, while subtly maintaining links to Bryan Singer's excellent original two movies. Set in 1962, First Class tells the origins of Charles Xavier's (James McAvoy) research into mutant genetics, the formation of his school for gifted youngsters (mutants), and the forging of his friendship, and ultimate rivalry, with Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto (Michael Fassbender). Having Singer back in the fold as producer and co-writer really pays off, and only highlights how his lack of input on the film series he began effectively destroyed The Last Stand. Singer's knowledge of the characters and mythology ensures that much that was great about the first two films is back on display, and this is clearly his film. While Vaughn does a competent job in the director's chair, his sensibilities seem to be more suited to less conventional projects, such as the merciless deconstruction of comic book superhero tropes that was Kick Ass. Still, First Class is a welcome return to form for the series.The period setting of First Class also adds very welcome variety to the franchise, and the costumes, dialogue and settings all playfully allude to the swinging sixties ideals reminiscent of early James Bond, or perhaps more accurately the Bond-lampooning Flint films. Two particular montage sequences closing out the first and second acts winkingly recreate not only the free-spirited mood of the time, but sixties filmmaking techniques as well. It's clever, and it works as a nice counterpoint to some of the darker elements, which are where First Class's strength really lies. While this is a Marvel film, Singer and Vaughn clearly are striving for a more real-world feel than the Avengers universe of the most recent Marvel adaptations. Interweaving the plot into such a defining real-world event as the Cuban missile crisis is ambitious, yet for the most part it works. While it's maybe a little silly, it is fun to see this kind of revisionist history creeping into the X-Men universe, and it's nice to have a Marvel film that doesn't need to play by the Avengers rules.So, all things considered, X-Men: First Class is largely a successful entry into the series, but I have to add a little addendum to my review: in all honesty I was a little disappointed with the film for one reason. Now that this story has been told, it's unlikely that we will ever see the long-rumoured Magneto movie. And in light of the fascinating Magneto storyline which constitutes about a third of First Class, there is so much more that could be done with the character. Lehnsherr is presented here as a deeply abused and troubled man, torn between his anger, his desire for revenge and the promises of redemption from Xavier, his closest friend. Fassbender is terrific, more than equal to the performance of Ian McKellen in the previous films, and it's a great shame that we won't see his story fleshed out into a full feature. As much as I enjoyed First Class, I kept coming back to this. But I guess this doesn't amount to much more than nit-picking to most people, so really any fans of the series, or even just quality action movies, should check this one out.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
X-ellent in every way.,"Here on IMDb, X-Men: First Class has garnered the highest rating of all films in the X-Men franchise so far. Given the fact that this film features only a few of the familiar characters of the previous films, portrayed by different, younger actors, and the complete absence of Wolverine, the (current) rating of 8.1 somewhat surprised me. That was before I had seen it...Being a pretty big X-Men fan myself, I was excited to see this, regardless of plot or characters. However, I was also a little wary of what to expect, for the reasons stated above. I suspect that anybody reading this might feel the same way. But rest assured, any doubts were quickly dispelled no later than the opening scene. First Class starts off very well, with the exact same opening scene as the first X-Men, featuring a young Erik Lehnsherr being separated from his parents in a Nazi concentration camp. What follows after this familiar story is something completely new and particularly dark and brutal. I won't give away any important plot lines, but suffice it to say there won't be a single person left wondering why Magneto is so resentful of ""normal"" people. This event also sets the tone for the rest of the film, and, to a great extent, explains why First Class is such a success: this film is all about character. Whereas all the other films were mostly about cool superheroes and special effects, First Class is all about character development and the history of those who would later become Professor X and Magneto. This concept might have failed big time if it wasn't for the superb screenplay. I take my hat off to whoever managed to incorporate every little, but crucial, character and storyline and made it flow together so beautifully. Literally everything comes together in this film, everything you might have wondered (why is Xavier paralyzed?) is given a credible and fitting explanation.Another real strength of FC is its cast. Everybody in this film is right where they should be. Kevin Bacon is the perfect villain (but we already knew that), James McAvoy not only looks, but sounds and moves like the young Charles Xavier would. Jennifer Lawrence is a convincing, young (and believe it or not, insecure) Mystique. All other characters are perfectly cast as well, humans and mutants alike. However, I feel that most credit is due to Michael Fassbender, an actor I am now ashamed to say I had never even heard of before. The way he portrays the 30-something Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto is stunning. His entire physique, down to every little twitch in his face, truly captivates all the pain and agony Erik has had to endure throughout his life. It makes you sympathize with Magneto and understand why he is the way he is. Whereas the ""old"" Magneto was little more than a bitter old man who despised Homo sapiens for undisclosed reasons (with no discredit to Ian McKellen intended here), Michael Fassbender does something I thought was almost impossible in a superhero flick: he gives Magneto a soul.In case I might have given the impression that X-Men: First Class is no more than some wishy-washy character drama, don't worry. There are plenty of awesome action sequences and special effects to keep the more adrenaline-pumped movie-goer satisfied. And before I forget: there are two small, but awesome cameo appearances which I know you will enjoyFinally, a small note on parental guidance: I was absolutely baffled to see that half of the audience consisted of parents with small children. Like I said before, this is not just another cool superhero movie. X-Men: First Class features elements which are quite dark and graphic, and especially the scenes portraying Nazi brutality are not intended for a young audience. Personally, I would say 14 is the appropriate minimum age.With all that said, I would recommend this film to anyone, even to those of you who aren't X-Men fans. It doesn't happen very often that I can't find a single flaw in a film, but I guess this is just one of those rare cases. Great directing, great acting, great everything.

This movie is horrible,"OK, where do I start? It's hard to imagine that there is an X-Men movie out there that is actually worse than Wolverine Origins, but it exists. Guess which one it is! X-Men: First Class starts off with some promise and then fails so miserably to deliver that I tried to get refunded on my snacks that I bought since they were ingested while I was watching this terrible excuse for a movie. I soon remembered that they were purchased at Stop and Shop, however, and was not able to do so. I don't know what the hell is going on, but for some reason critics are calling this an entertaining summer movie. I think these ""critics"" are either hammered, payed off, or inept.To me, an entertaining movie is one that leaves the viewer with some form of contentment after it ends; characters develop, plots and subplots merge, and there is a cohesive quality to the thing that makes it one whole film and not just a bunch of scenes thrown together in a somewhat logical manner. X-Men: First Class felt like the latter. The acting is sub-par, and the emotions are forced and laughable. Beast looks dumb as hell, and none of the new mutants have any pizazz.The biggest problem this movie has is its severe lack of faith in its audience. For example: when Professor X does telekinetic shenanigans, the camera shoots from his head into another person's head just so that the viewer knows that he is now in that person's head. I mean, that's movie magic people. Come on, you don't have to make a POV mind bullet to let us know what's going on, and you don't need to do a slow zoom in on a character for 3 full seconds to hint at a possible love interest (Mystique).I'm rambling here, but I don't feel like planning out an essay for this review because this movie doesn't deserve it. I'm not sure what's going on in the world because people seem to be mutually accepting of this horrible movie, but please, for the love of God, don't waste your money on this wanna be reboot; it is not worth it. However, if you want to see a bunch of semi-talented actors talk way too much, fight way too little, and clumsily make their way through a terrible re-imagining of the Cuban Missile crisis, be my guest.

First class story not dominated by special effects,"X Men First Class is the latest offering in the x-men franchise. This film goes back to before the previous films and shows us how the x-men were discovered and how Professor X's academy is formed.I thoroughly enjoyed this film as it took a deviation from the traditional style of flashy CGI and special effects and, instead, has focused on an interesting and engaging story which uses the Cuban missile crisis as a sensational backdrop. In fact, in places, the film appears of a low, almost dated, quality which only acts to enhance the piece. Michael Vaughn has expertly interwoven the rise of the x-men into this not-so-familiar important aspect of world history in such a way that it is not only inspiring but also informative. The depth of the story going back to the torment of Erik's youth brings with it a dark and, at times, disturbing feel which makes this piece slightly gritty and all the more solid. I was surprised by the 12A certificate, generally feeling that a 15 certificate would have been more appropriate.The performances by the up-and-coming cast are good and for the most part believable. There are certainly no Oscar winners here, but that is more to do with no one cast member standing out due to the shear breadth of story to get through. The casting of James McAvoy as Charles Xavier is truly inspired. He provides a depth to the film which beds in nicely with the story, although a stronger performance would have provided that anchor his character needed to have. This brings me to my main criticism of the film. Taken on its own, this is a perfectly enjoyable piece, however, if watched in the context of the previous films it brings on a new life as there are many subtle links to the wider story which make it engrossing. At over 2 hours long, there is just a little too much meandering of the story to include these links; it doesn't do this a lot, but just enough to detract from an otherwise sensational film. I would have liked to have seen a little more character development from some of the supporting cast as these actors are going to be filling our screens for years to come, and in this film, they were more there as padding.Having said that, as a non-X-men fan boy and someone who hasn't read the comics this is a perfectly good stand alone film and an excellent addition to the x-men franchise. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Definitely a ""one to watch"", with performances from ""ones to watch"".",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"1/2 Great Film, 1/2 Average Film","This film could've been amazing. The characters of Magneto and Xavier bring a new energy to the series. As a fan of the animated cartoon, I never got to see either of these characters fully fleshed out with their backgrounds (there was one episode of a flashback, I believe).While the first half is excellent, the last thirty minutes or so are just okay. This is mainly because the focus is mainly on Magneto, Xavier, and MacTaggert. The last thirty minutes deals with training the students of Xavier and an epic battle. The problem is that none of his students (except for Beast or Mystique) are layered-characters and that they are all b-side characters. There is no reason to care about them.Regarding the final battle, the only entertaining parts involve Magneto and Xavier. The other parts involve the b-side x-men battling the b-side villains. The worst of the latter is the battle between Angel and Banshee. It's just plain cheesy and unnecessarily dull (almost cringe-worthy). In fact, the whole character of Angel, along with her super powers, is lame (along with Havok too, who is just a sub-par version of Cyclops).The film could've worked without the inclusion of any of the b-side x-men. Xavier, in theory, could take out any of the villains, but Singer and Vaughn must have felt that it was necessary to have some more x-men we hadn't seen before. It's just really too bad that there aren't any good ones to really choose from that we haven't seen before.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
the prequel we had to have,"Fans may disagree with me but, this reboot was needed after Wolverine Origins brought down the X-Men universe to a shambling mess, however it is also a step up from the third X-Men film. Seeing the youthful Professor X and Magneto as best friends working together before becoming archenemies is a brilliant concept. The mutants, some familiar, some not so familiar are well represented among the human existence. Settings around the early 1960's is a brilliant move with the era lovingly created, especially the costumes. Frantic and loud as they may be, the action set pieces are nothing short of astonishing. The submarine moment lives up to the excitement of the trailer. January Jones just needs to appear on screen as sultry Emma Frost to captivate me, while Australian Rose Byrne rocks as Doc MacTaggert. Perfect casting of McAvoy and Fassbender as Xavier and Magneto respectively is a constant winner. I know the fans are going to probably hate Kevin Bacon, he's different to his comic character. Lame one liners aside, this is a fine accompaniment to the Marvel film plethora on the horizon. Also watch for a rather vulgar but memorable cameo from a 'hairy' X-Men favorite.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Well acted, well told, but has a cheap feel to it","I enjoyed this X-men very much because of the script and performances by the two leads. But there was something missing I thought, and realized what it was after watching the old X-Men films after coming home from the theater.X-Men First Class had some epic sets, and some very good CGI, but the pacing was off, and at times looked cheap. The direction was OK in some spots when it came to the pure shots, and cinematography, but the story felt choppy. Scenes ended too fast at times and there just was no atmosphere in this film. It was as if cheap cameras were used to film this, with no camera filters. It almost had the quality of a Smallville type television series. Or even Heroes...it felt like it was made for basic TV. The word Epic can't be used to describe this film even though I'd like to call it epic.Anyhows, I'm a big X-men fan, and wasn't let down. The story was pure X-men, basic, and an origins story, and so no surprises in this one. Magneto was written in a way that made him less hated. Xavier's character was played very well, and had some charm to go along with the wisdom. I also thought the score was good at times, and sometimes sounding like Parade music. The Marvel films need better scores in general, and it's as if this movie was influenced somehow by Disney. The best way to sum it up is like this. The old X-men films felt more like the new Batman films, and First Class felt more like the Tim Burton films. I just think it's tough to call this the best X-men film of all time. I don't think it is.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Should go straight to the chokey!,"I should probably start by saying that this is my first X Men movie. They've never interested me before and neither has any superhero movie really. I've never seen Captain America, Thor or even The Avengers which everyone seems to rave about. I just find them a bit silly and geeky. If I was 10 years younger or a fan boy then I might like them, but I'm not. I'm not completely against superhero films though. Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy features two of my favourite films of all time (TDK and TDKR) but they have an element of realism and are just exceptionally made.I decided to give First Class a go because everyone was raving about the latest X Men film, Days of Future Past. Plus, I had heard a lot of great things about First Class and it was directed by Matthew Vaughn who directed the brilliant Kick-Ass (another comic book film I actually really like). However, this film really didn't live up to its hype.I just don't understand all the love for this film. I found it pretty laughable from the moment it started with the terrible child actors and melodrama verging on parody. The moment where Erik's mother gets shot by Nazi Kevin Bacon (no, I'm not making that up) should've been heart-breaking and really emotional, but the scene just ended up being a joke! The bombastic music, the over-acting from the kid and Kevin Bacon and the rushed directing just meant that I couldn't take the film seriously. Unfortunately the rest of the film continues in this manner.First Class is definitely a film only kids or fan boys would appreciate. It's so daft and contrived with flat characters. Kevin Bacon is a complete caricature as the villain and the X men themselves are also very cartoony. James McAvoy's character was particularly obnoxious, although I did enjoy Michael Fassbender's slightly more complex character of Erik, who ends up turning into a caricature villain for little reason.Even though the film is over two hours in length it still feels very rushed and withdrawn. The constant globe-trotting meant that you never knew exactly where you are or what's going on! The screenplay is also terribly contrived and very cheesy. All of the dialogue feels incredibly forced and I couldn't help but curl my toes with the end line where Michael Fassbender says, ""No not Erik... I'm Magneto!"" Some of the imagery was also just downright bizarre! A man puts his head in a fish tank and grows gills whilst a stripper flutters about with fairy wings whilst shooting fire from her mouth! I don't know what the writers were smoking, but I'd try some!I also found the film quite sexist. It seemed compulsory for all the female characters to show as much leg as possible, even those who worked in the FBI. The FBI agent even goes a step further by stripping down to her bra and pants to covertly follow a bunch of prostitutes into a location. Most, if not all the female characters were objectified in some way and I found it a little depressing. Jennifer Lawrence's sexy blue character was even given ageless cells or something, which explains why she doesn't age in the later films, even though the men do because otherwise she wouldn't be sexy anymore.Most of the action relied on CGI and a lot of it looked pretty appalling and I think it will age extremely badly in a few years time. Having said that, I did quite enjoy how off the wall the action scenes were, especially the last half hour where a submarine levitates out of the ocean, an anchor slices a ship in half and fifty missiles are deflected back into the ocean. It's just insane, and so daft that it's actually really fun to watch.I was never bored during First Class because it was very entertaining, but not in a good way. It was kind of so bad it was good and I started to have fun counting all of the contrived and cheesy lines. I find it baffling how seriously well-liked this film is though. Everything about this film is very over-the-top from the acting to the action sequences. It's also very poorly written with dull characters making puzzling decisions. The way Jennifer Lawrence's character suddenly joined the bad side wasn't explained at all! First Class is a complete mess, but it's a pretty entertaining one. I won't be wasting any money on Days of Future Past though.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A prequel that works,"Typically when a film franchise decides to move into prequel territory, it rarely bodes well for the quality of the final product. There are, of course, exceptions to the rule, and X-Men: First Class is one of them. First Class brings the X-Men film franchise back from the land of mediocrity it seemed headed toward with the previous entry, X-Men Origins: Wolverine, and manages to mine some strong character material by revisiting where everything began.X-Men: First Class opens in Poland in 1944 (and actually features footage from the original X-Men movie) in which we see young Erik Lensherr tortured by malevolent Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) where he learns to harness his magnetic powers, but only when put through severe emotional trauma. Meanwhile, in America Charles Xavier comes face to face with another mutant, Raven Darkholme, and his family takes her in as an adopted sister. 20 years later, Charles (James McAvoy) is studying for an advanced degree in genetics, Erik (Michael Fassbender) is on a mission to exact revenge on Shaw, and the world at large is just becoming aware of the existence of mutants. Shaw is hatching a plan to turn humans against one another so he and other mutants can emerge victorious from the carnage if humanity goes to war with itself, and only Charles and Erik, who begin recruiting mutants to help them thwart Shaw's plan, stand between humanity and nuclear war.Many prequels exist simply to fill in the blanks between the known details of a franchise, and X-Men: First Class does tread some of that territory, as to be expected. But, for the most part, First Class works best when delving into the relationships between the characters who would be already established in the future X-Men films. The film focuses a fair amount of screen time on fleshing out Charles and Erik, as well as Charles and Raven, giving their interactions a degree of tragedy and pathos when viewed from the lens of the future. Raven, portrayed by Jennifer Lawrence, gets the majority of the depth that had not even really been hinted at in the other X-Men films, portraying her as someone who views Charles as much more than just an adopted brother, but also having to come to terms with the fact that her natural appearance, covered in blue scales, causes others, even Charles, to flinch, and she begins to realize that her path and Charles' will diverge in the future.One of the strengths of First Class is in the casting of Kevin Bacon as the villainous Shaw. Bacon manages to deliver both a magnetic and threatening performance, someone who is always seemingly one step ahead of the people around him that he views as inferior to his evolved self. While Bacon is hardly restrained, he doesn't take Shaw over the top into the realm of parody or silliness. The other standout is the always engaging Michael Fassbender in the role of Erik. He embodies the rage and desire for revenge in Erik, on a mission to avenge his tragic past while also never trusting the humans surrounding him. When Fassbender is on screen, he commands the scene, and gives Erik a strong, memorable presence.Lest you think X-Men: First Class is all darkness and unhappiness, it actually has a rather light touch at times. Director Mathew Vaughan manages to infuse the proceedings often with, dare I say it, a sense of fun, especially in scenes where the various X-Men are learning to use and harness their powers. There is also a degree of homage in many scenes in the film, both to the era in which it is set, the swinging early '60s, and to films of that era (you can't watch the scenes set in the war room and not think of Dr. Strangelove). There is a bit of tweaking of stereotypes of that era, such as sexism and the intolerance that was beginning to melt off society as the decade progresses.X-Men: First Class is by no means perfect. In an attempt to hit many of the bases of setting up the future films, some elements feel a bit rushed and unexplored, glossed over instead of being given the room to breathe that it sometimes feels like it needs. Also, as with the initial three X-Men films, not all the characters are given the opportunity to be fully drawn, and some of the more peripheral characters are left underdeveloped.That said, X-Men: First Class performs what would almost seem a cinematic miracle: it manages to save a franchise that many had written off. It is unsure what the future holds for the X-Men films, but if a few more like First Class can be served up, then they will be worth watching.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"This really is ""First Class""","Being a fan of the original X-Men films, I was really looking forward to this. I thought it would be interesting to find out a little bit more about the earlier lives of Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr.I really liked how the story developed and the roles of Charles and Erik were portrayed fantastically by James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender respectively. The other (previously unseen) mutants in this movie were also interesting, especially Hank. The cameo from Wolverine was also hilarious.The storyline was great and plenty of action to keep you gripped. Overall this film was brilliant and I am really looking forward to 'X-Men: Days of Future Past' now, especially after this one was left on such a cliffhanger.

First Class in every sense,"X-Men First Class is spectacular in every way. It tells the story of how Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr meet and begin a unique friendship. They form an alliance to attempt to stop a confrontation between the U.S. and the Soviet Union in a world teetering on the brink of nuclear war. The plot is very well written and executed, but it takes a back seat. The true gem of this movie is the character study between these two friends and future enemies. How their personalities and political views interact drive every element of the film. These are some of the most complex and well-written characters you'll ever see in a superhero or any film. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender were excellent in the lead roles. The rest of the cast deserve very high marks as well, especially Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique, and Nicholas Hoult as Beast. The movie never crumbles under the weight of being a prequel and the feeling of inevitability that comes with it. It still manages to surprise and entertain, even though some of the story is known. It also fills in a few blanks as well. It is a film that takes itself and it's audience seriously, which is refreshing. An instant classic for the action genre as well as the superhero film genre.

A Nutshell Review: X-Men: First Class,"Bryan Singer's involvement in this film is a good thing, with his producer credit as well as getting involved in the story together with Sheldon Turner, since he was responsible for the first two critical and commercial hit of the X-Men films being able to show that an ensemble comic book film can work. But since a new direction was called for to wash away the bitter aftertaste of the latter two films of the franchise, in comes director Matthew Vaughn who did a class job in playing this film to its strengths, keeping the pace tight, the action eye popping, and the dramatic elements engaging. It seems like Vaughn is on a roll here in his choice of projects, and I'm hoping this one does well enough to warrant yet another outing with the X-Men, so long as the focus remains on wanting to tell a solid, strong story first like this one did, and not opt for something loud and mindless.There are many elements of this film which made it enjoyable. For starters, having it go back to the good old 60s was an excellent move par none, taking us back to the point of the US- USSR nuclear crisis, where the US had strategically put nukes in Turkey, and the USSR soon to be responding with its own countermove involving Cuba. The historical context makes it a little bit more in line with our reality, though having the audacity to suggest that the evil mutants led by Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Six Degrees Bacon) and his team of Emma Frost (January Jones, playing a character who will probably be a fan favourite after this), Riptide (Alex Gonzalez) and Azazel (Jason Flemying) have starring roles in stirring up the super power rivalry to WWIII proportions.The plan is simple, and in Sebastian Shaw we see the precursor of the mantle that Magneto / Erik Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender) would pick up from, since it's an Us Mutants against Them Humans mindset they adopt, preferring a more vocal outburst of opposition against discrimination, even if it means annihilation of those who are ordinary. Followers of X-Men the comics or the films would find this theme familiar, but in Vaughn's film, ample time is provided to develop the arguments against, and the very sexy arguments for this cause, with lines being deeply divided thus showing why and who decided to join which side of the war.Then of course there's the strong friendship between Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and Magneto which was always hinted at in the earlier films, but this one brings us back to the origins of their friendship which developed so strongly given their unison to battle a common enemy, but their inevitable drift when their ideals and methodology start to differ drastically, one obviously preferring violence and using whatever means necessary to further the cause, and the other opting for a more peaceful approach, preferring to do good to convince us two-timing, fearful humans that those more powerful aren't necessary harbouring intentions to enslave, but just yearning for a peaceful co-existence. Both McAvoy and Fassbender excel in their leading roles as friends who will turn enemies in due course, making it all the more poignant when we see them do battle shoulder to shoulder now, knowing what will happen in the near future.If it was an Origins film that was still mooted, then this one takes the cake indeed, with scenes showing off younger versions of Xavier and Lehnsherr, together with that of the other X-Men such as Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) who forms a tight relationship with Xavier before identity crisis meant a souring of sorts to what the future story would hold, the intelligent Hank McCoy/Beast (Nicholas Hoult), Banshee (Caleb Landry Jones), Havok (Lucas Till) amongst others in the first class fold, tutored and mentored personally by Xavier to harness their powers, before the big bang action sequence that expectedly combined everyone's strength to do battle against those on the opposite side.Art direction was also down to a pat, where computers are large and imposing with plenty of buttons, gauges, valves and humongous tape drives, and who can forget the pristine looking Blackbird jet plane making its debut as the de-facto transport of choice for the X-Men, and that predominantly yellow suits also given a reason for the characters to don them. The ensemble cast of relative unknowns in leading roles also worked wonders, especially those amongst the new recruits since they are predominantly younger and are quite raw in the art of combat, and making mistakes, rather than being all too invulnerable, is the rule of thumb here. Visual effects are flawlessly employed to showcase their various powers.X-Men: First Class brings us back to the time that examines the history of the X-Men before events of the first film kicked in, where Wolverine was still yet to be thrown into the Weapon X project, and before the likes of Jean Grey and Cyclops came into the picture. Keep your eyes and ears peeled for plenty of easter eggs and subtle references made in terms of what we already do know of the characters in the earlier films, and the irony in dialogue, making this X-Men first class indeed. Highly recommended, and a definite favourite of the summer films so far.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
X-Men: Split Personality Disorder,"X-men: First Class is a film that requires patience. The film has an almost laughably bad beginning, with a few giggles spread for the next hour, before a spectacular second half which saves this film and leaves you with many memorable moments. Yes, X-men: First Class is 'that' movie. The one you skip a large portion of it and then tell your friends how amazing it was. The first half all just in the back of your mind.The film has a wonderful story, which is cheesy but shameless, and is all a tale of revenge. Character traits are very heavily held out, so development is a breeze. Unfortunately, none of them felt real. When holding such significant themes in (what is classed as) a mainstream film, this isn't a positive. One can make absurd characters realistic, but X-men hasn't achieved it. If it didn't want too, that'd be great. Unfortunately, the opposite is the truth.Having said that, visually the film ranges from average to fantastic. The CGI work is mostly a work of art, enough to distract you from the occasional bad dialogue, but some of the make-up is looks dated, mostly in the character of Beast (who's awful lip-sync and comical aggression doesn't help).Notably; I haven't seen the other X-men films, though I am aware of certain aspects due to pop-culture. Some of the fan service, such as the cameo's, is well done and enjoyable. The ending, is of course, predictable, however the journey (at least the second half of it) is entertaining enough and has a few twists and turns that it's not a matter of what will happen, just a matter of when, which will keep you on your toes. This is how a prequel should be handled.The films pacing is very out of line, with some very important pieces flashing by, while filler is extensive and overly long. Over all though, filler is used sparingly, and most of the scenes hold significance to the story.Having said all that, X-men first class is not the amazing film everyone was hoping for. It's worth seeing, definitely. A 6/10 is by no means bad, it just isn't ridiculously good. Yes, X-Men First Class is suffering from the unfortunate Split Personality disorder. Half of it's bad, and half of it's good. I, for one, will not be revisiting this film for a second viewing in the near future though. Maybe when it hits the $10 shelf, in a year, but no time prior.Second Opinions (Ratings more tailored for your needs): - For X-men fanatics, an 8/10 - For those who want story, a lesser 5/10.

Matthew Vaughn just stabbed this series in the heart with an adrenaline needle,"The series that started out as MARVELS prize stallion in the film industry, has since been raped in the ass by films such as ""Wolverine"" and ""X-Men: Last Stand"". How can you possibly go forward with a series that has been tarnished twice? Well, you do what they did with Batman.....you start from the beginning. Yes, i know that this is truly NOT a reboot, but the studios are hoping that this leap back to the past will create a jump start on a series that was thought to be all but lost.....let's hope they're right for a change.I can easily say this without feeling any regret.......this is without a doubt the best X-Men movie created. Yes, i know that most of you ""X2"" fans will be throwing your hands up in the air. But let me explain why.....First off, the character development in this movie is amazing. Director Mathew Vaughn does an incredible job of making every single good character likable, and every bad character hateable. Watching a young Professor Xavier get drunk and hit on women. Watching a young Magneto cover the globe killing Nazis......uh, i'll watch that any day of the week. And since we're on the topic of Xavier and Magneto.....my god, if you thought the original combination of Ian McKellan and Patrick Stewart was amazing......wait until you see the combo of James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender. No, i'm not saying that this duo is better, but i'm not saying it's worse either. Never in my wildest dreams did i think anyone could compete, but these two are really something special to watch on screen. Even before they cross paths. Their characters alone could make an entire picture. Especially Michael Fassbender as Magneto. In my opinion, he's the one who stole the show.As far as story lines....it's a bit of the same old stuff, just in a different time period. But this go around seems much fresher. It offers a much more different take and a broader spectrum than the typical 'These are humans, and these are Mutans...now fight'. It delves more into the history aspect, which to any guy, is always cool.However, the only slight problem i had with the film was towards the end, right before the final battle. You have all these characters who just came together, and you're really ready to watch them finally go crazy after watching this amazing montage of Xavier helping them. And right after this happens, they drop some plot points out of nowhere. I get WHY they had to do it, but the placement felt just a bit off to me. I think if they spread them around the movie instead of having it come out of nowhere towards the end, then maybe it would have been okay. But does it take anything away from the film? Absolutely not.Bottom Line.....i said it once, and i'll say it again. This is the best X-Men movie i have seen thus far. Everything from the acting to the storyline......it was amazing. And even thought i think a lot of people will give all the credit to the acting, which in a way they're right.....i however, give it all to Director Matthew Vaughn. He took a story which easily could have been crapped on by producers and studio exec's, and he made it his own, and he made it fresh and fun. Even if you disagree with me and say ""X2"" is still better...you still won't be able to deny the fact that this is certainly the most entertaining of the bunch. Without a doubt the best movie i have seen so far this year. Captain America and Green Lantern.....the bar has been set.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

'peace was never an option',"Narrating the origin story of the many significant characters in the X-Men universe & set in the 1960s during the Cuban missile crisis which put the entire world on the verge of a nuclear Armageddon, X- Men: First Class mainly concerns the close friendship between Charles Xavier & Erik Lehnsherr before they turned into archenemies and adopted the names of Professor X & Magneto, respectively.Director Matthew Vaughn brings an entirely fresh approach & style in almost all filmmaking departments here and succeeds in balancing its quality action with impressive storytelling without ever letting down the entertainment factor. Tightly edited from start to finish, the film looks absolutely fantastic, thanks to its vibrant cinematography, state-of-the-art visual effects & sensational score.Coming to the performances, the entire cast is pretty well-rounded & each member is pretty convincing in their given roles. James McAvoy plays Charles Xavier aka Professor X while Michael Fassbender is in as Erik Lehnsherr aka Magneto, and the performance as well as chemistry between these two is what makes this film work so wonderfully along with the fine input coming from the rest of its supporting cast.On an overall scale, benefiting greatly from its brilliant direction, strong script, magnetic performances from McAvoy & Fassbender, terrific visual effects, tight editing & a marvelous score, X-Men: First Class comes out as a highly potent package that guarantees a cinematic experience which is surely going to entertain & astonish its viewers in more ways than one.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Michael Fassbender is Everything,"Matthew Vaughn has become a personal favorite modern action director. Kick Ass and the Kingsman movies embrace a certain anarchic spirit that matches well Vaughn's visual sensibilities, and all of that is on display here in First Class. He had been attached to direct Last Stand before he pulled out due to personal reasons, going on to make Stardust instead. He came back to the franchise here after the rather dismal pair of Last Stand and X-Men Origins: Wolverine with an energetic, entertaining prequel that intelligently uses a real-world event to provide some distinctive flavor to the affair.The movie begins in the same place as the first X-Men movie directed by Bryan Singer, with the young Magneto being led into the heart of Auschwitz. After using an intricate and clever combination of footage from the first film and newly shot footage of the new actors, we are introduced to the main antagonist of the film, Sebastian Shaw played by Kevin Bacon, speaking German extraordinarily well as he murders Magneto's mother in front of him in order to elicit his powers. Bacon is really good in this, but Michael Fassbender as the adult Magneto is the best casting decision in the X-Men universe, and possibly the entirety of superhero movies. It also helps that post-World War II, the movie makes Magneto a Nazi Hunter. As Fassbender slips between English, French, Spanish, and German as he tortures a Swiss banker and exacts his revenge on some Nazis hiding in Argentina, Fassbender is the exact kind of focused, dedicated, and cruel man for the job. I would watch a whole movie of Magneto, Nazi Hunter, and that has everything to do with Michael Fassbender.Concurrently with Magneto's rise is Charles Xavier, a man with a British accent who lives in New York and attends Oxford University. Played by James McAvoy as an adult, Xavier met the young Mystique/Raven as s child as she pilfered his kitchen for food. He adopted her, and she rode along with him until Oxford, waitressing while he defends his thesis. He's approached by Moira McTaggert, a CIA agent who witnessed some people with weird abilities in Las Vegas, and Xaver's paper about genetic mutation might be the right beginnings for an answer to what she saw. The first third of the film is dominated by these two things, and it moves quickly and nicely.The movie continues to move quickly but not quite as nicely as it enters its second act which becomes a team up film where Magento and Xavier come together to recruit a handful of mutants. This whole section ends up feeling like a distraction. It's meant to be the beginnings of the X-Men (you know, the titular first class), but it all ends up being too thinly drawn. One of them dies within minutes of being introduced. Another one abandons the group to turn bad and join Shaw at the same time. These feel like characters who should have been introduced at the beginning of the film, not all at once at the start of the second act. This ends up feeling like the movie took on too much to fit within the time frame. Either introduce them earlier, giving us more time to get to know them so that if a death or betrayal comes it doesn't fall flat, or cut down on the number recruited at this point, and avoid the supposedly big emotional moments that go unearned. Past that, though, the movie improves again.The deaths happen at a secret CIA base (not so secret, I guess) after Shaw shows up and wrecks havoc. Xavier decides to bring everyone to his manor hour in upstate New York where we get a training montage of the different mutants focusing and using their powers. It's fine, though the moment where Magneto calls Xavier a good friend comes at the beginning and I feel like it would have worked better at the end of the sequence where they worked together to help everyone (I could imagine it being written that way and then editing got it in the beginning). And finally, the third act picks up and the movie becomes the same kind of propulsive action experience that Vaughn delivers in most of his other work.Shaw is using the tensions between the super powers to try and ignite a nuclear war. He is a mutant who can absorb energy (including nuclear power when he holds onto parts of the nuclear power source of his personal submarine), and he will lead all mutants into a new era where they are supreme. He helps create the Cuban Missile Crisis, and the X-Men will go to save the day.Here is where most of the pieces come together to create a fun, big, bright action set piece with a lot of moving parts. What helps is the work put into a set of characters. Xavier and Magneto are the center of it all, their relationship mirroring the conflict of visions between Martin Luther King, Jr. And Malcolm X. Beast and Raven have an interesting dichotomy as she wants to be proud of her natural blue appearance, but he's ashamed of his deformed feet. He uses science (magic? Whatever, comic books) to come up with a cure for the physical mutant leaving the other mutations intact, but it backfires and turns him all blue and hairy. Her desire to be proud of who she is meshes well with Magneto's eventual turn to mutant supremacy (he wanted Shaw for revenge, not ideological reasons) while Beast's desire to fit in more easily meshes well with Xavier's overall approach.The actual action is very fun. From Magneto raising a submarine out of the water while clinging to the wheels of a jet to the fantastic pair of shots as Magneto slowly drives a Nazi coin through Shaw's skull, mirrored by a similar camera move it cuts back and forth from of Xavier's head as he screams, it's pop entertainment on a wonderful scale and done with wonderful skill.As an overall film experience, I think the second act is largely mishandled, but the first and third acts are so well done that it easily overcomes the middle flagging section. It's well cast (especially, again, with Michael Fassbender as Magneto),and told with an almost infectious energy. It's a movie designed to right a flailing ship of a franchise, and I think it does that with style.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Entertaining origin comic book  movie!,"X-Men: First Class (2011) is an Awesome Action superhero flick based on a comic book mythology of X-Men where it all begin. This film is close good as X2 it is my third best favorite X-Men film. I love this film! I love James McAvoy as Charles Xavier aka Profesor X later, I love Jennifer Lawrence as Raven/Mystique, I also love January Jones as Emma Frost and Michael Fassbender as Erik Lensherr alias Magneto. Gosh I love this film I was entertained from beginning till end. I love this movie, It is a great prequel to the X-Men movies James Mcavoy as young Xavier is great choice and everything of this movie is just Great.Jennifer Lawrence is amazing as Raven/Mystique I never saw her like that as been a good person, I always though she was bad. In First Class tells the story how everything was. How Eric and Charles become friends and later becomes enemies. The film is actually set from the first X-Men film when we see that boy in a Nazi camp in Poland it is the same scene from the first X-men Bryan Singer directed. X-men First Class is the best prequel movie that explains the X-men characters and their universe with a good back story. Vaughn struck gold casting McAvoy and Fassbender as Young Professor X and Magneto, these two stole the show, especially Fassbender as Magneto, he was amazing... X-Men First Class also had a great supporting cast with Kevin Bacon, Jennifer Lawrence, Rose Byrne, and January Jones. We are also introduced to a lot of new comers that played their roles perfectly.. The plot is pretty simple; we see how Charles and Erik meet and deal with their powers that they aren't comfortable dealing with because they are afraid society won't accept them, We also get to see how they eventually choose sides between good and evil! Which is very exciting, I know a lot of people (true Comic book readers) had issues with the actual choices of the First Class characters, but the ending of this movie will set up for those wanted characters to be in the sequel I'm sure, so hopefully the fanboys will ease up a little bit once production gets going on that! X-Men First class is up their as a top Comic Book movie adaptation and shouldn't be overlooked by anybody who is uneasy because of the past screw ups in the franchise. Just see this already if you haven't.I love this origin film, the acting in here is superb, the action scenes are awesome. I love that the plot I set in 1962, that you can see Las Vegas in here. I love that Eric and Charles are getting all the mutants together in battle against Sebastian Shaw. There is Beast for the first time in it. We last saw him in X-Men: Last Stand.Showing Magneto's strength and powers what he can do is amazing. Matthew Vaughn did an awesome job as director of X-men he did amazing job directing my all time favorite film Kick-Ass (2010.)X-Men First Class is easily the best of the entire series. The movie is high-tech and well-acted, with lots of action and noise as it portrays the origins of the X-Men, a group of about a dozen mutants (so far). It begins in a Nazi prison camp, where young Erik Lehnsherr is forced to witness a tragedy and finds he can control metals with his mind — but only when he's angry. He grows up to become Magneto and is played by Michael Fassbender, the lean Irish actor who the buzzmeisters say will become a big star from this film. Heaven help him. He was so good in ""Fish Tank,"" ""Inglourious Bastards"" and ""Jane Eyre"" (2011): must he play Magneto to become a star? For that matter, Raven/Mystique is played by Jennifer Lawrence, just nominated for a best actress Oscar. Now she's a blue shape-shifter with scales. The price of stardom.I love the plot on how they blend those characters from the beginning till those moments where you should be like ""whoa its that it for him?"" but its nice. Also I'm into the acting of the characters and damn kudos to Kevin Bacon & Michael Fassbender for just an awesome job on how they deliver the script into those characters. I mean just a big credit to those guys. The special effects are just awesome to the film as expected especially on the climax part. I love X-Men: First Class to death one of the best films ever made!Following the classic Marvel mythology, X-MEN: FIRST CLASS charts the epic beginning of the X-Men saga. Before Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr took the names Professor X and Magneto, they were two young men discovering their powers for the first time. Before they were archenemies, they were closest of friends, working together with other mutants some familiar, some new, to stop the greatest threat the world has ever known.X-Men: First Class is a 2011 American superhero film, based on the X-Men characters appearing in Marvel Comics. It is the fifth installment in the X-Men film series. It serves as a prequel of the franchise.

Best X-Men Movie Yet?,"X-Men: First Class serves as a prequel to the X-Men series that has spawned in the past decade. While not a groundbreaking comic book movie it still managed to be a much more laborious effort than the previous installments. The movie does a better job of bringing out enjoyment for both comic book enthusiasts and film lovers.One of the good things that stood out to me was the excellent chemistry between Professor X and Magneto. It also manages to incorporate some of the historical story of X-men into the movie entertainingly. While the villains feel a bit underdeveloped it provides a sufficient start and fleshes out the important people who they clearly demonstrate who will be the villains in the inevitable sequel. In light of First Class' predecessor movies, First Class provides a few entertaining cameos. It also provides a fairly solid soundtrack. The action scenes are decent, but at times the powers of the X-men could have been more atmospheric to offer a more convincing environment.Some of the major glaring issues were that the movie seemed to be in a big rush and I am not referring to fast action sequence. The plot seems to get overlooked in certain areas and some key plot points seem to be missing rather lazily, but it still manages to hold up for a decent action movie. Also in the rush character development was executed a bit poorly. The characters seem to jump sides or change their minds almost at whim sometimes. It is a good thing however that the steps forward are greater than the steps back in this latest installment of X-men.Overall X-Men: First Class is an enjoyable movie, that I believe will appease its' fans. First Class is a step up from previous X-Men movies, but there is still room to improve. Here Vaughn has made a really good X-Men movie. Hopefully the next installment will be a great one. 7.3/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The best X-Men film,"You're probably thinking that my opinion of this film being the best X-Men film is totally wrong - but hold on. Many people simply dismissed this movie, because there is no Wolverine (not completely) or Ian Mckellen or Patrick Stewart, and it is another origin story we didn't need. they could not have been more wrong.First Class is a stylish, fun and downright emotional film. The actors have been perfectly cast, with the highlight being Michael Fassbender as Magneto/Erik Lensher. As usual, Fassbender makes you connect with him on an emotional level, and we get to see his story arch evolve as he goes from scared child, to revenge seeking bad ass, to a slightly wiser mutant, who resembles the Magneto of the original trilogy.Alongside him is James McCavoy as Professor Xavier, another great piece of casting here, who brings a witty charm and charisma we'd never expect to see from Charles, as well as the serious tone and eloquence that have received from Patrick Stewart. Both younger alterations of Magneto and Xavier are different from the originals, but we see them start on the path towards their older selves. Whilst there was sometime spent on building their friendship, I only wish there had been more, and the impact the end of the movie has on Charles (in Days of Future Past) feels slightly overwhelming, as the relationship between the two could've been stretched out further.The rest of the cast are great, with Jennifer Lawrence as a young mystique/raven, not yet set on her path of wrong doing, as well as Nicolas Hoult as Beast/Hank. The script is bolstered by the backdrop of 1963, and the Cuban missile crisis, which adds a sense of realism to the movie - which can be difficult when there are people with devil tails and others who can catch the explosion of a grenade.The movie also does the comic due respect, finally introducing the classic yellow uniforms, steering away from the Blade style black leather, and the movie has a uniquely retro feel to it.The majority of the emotional scenes revolve around Magneto, as the movie attempts to humanise the yet-to-be villain. The standout involves a scene where Xavier helps Magneto boost his powers - it is truly emotional and makes your hairs stand on edge, further bolstered by the acting talents of McCavoy and Fassbender.Other good points are that the special effects are good, the action if creative and always fun to watch, and the music is a respectable score for such a good film. Whilst there are many references to the previous X-Men films, I don't feel that you need to have watched any of the others to appreciate First Class, although it might help when it comes to a certain hilarious cameo.Nick Paul",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A positive waste of time..,"So I've been holding on this for so long because i just couldn't swallow the fact that they made an x-men with completely new actors and not to mention a new director, looking up the movie's page here today, i found that the director had made a couple of other good movies so i decided ill just watch it streaming as an independent movie with no ties to the other x-men movies. i have also watched reviews so i knew as a movie it was on the good side.Let me start by saying the vision of this movie in an overhead view is great but the execution is what made this movie mediocre, the same type of problem i see in so many potentially great movies like this one which ends up forgotten and uninspiring. I'm starting to get tired of writing movie reviews and basically saying the same thing over and over. i went into this with low expectations and i have to say in hindsight that probably did help a lot; me not getting disappointed. A choppy storyline, incredibly stupid humor (i smiled maybe once in the movie), pacing that forces you to shut your mind off in order to enjoy the movie, pacing that of which only people with ADD would satisfy, come think of it the guy who made this movie probably has ADD. and script that is more pretentious than fake teeth, not to mention shallow and at times, bouncy as if you're watching Gilmore Girls. this movie is FILLED with one-liners so brace yourself for THAT. And having finished it i will probably forget in in T-minus 2 days, but i want to stress that thats a good level relatively for the movies i see coming out in recent years. Id give it a 7 (according to todays standards) , but not one decimal more.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The worst  X Men movie ever made,"Matthew Vaughn started to shine as a new star on Hollywood's dimly lit sky with Kick Ass. So I was keen on watching this new X-Men prequel, but sadly it was everything what Kick Ass was not. The worst casting ever made for a superhero movie. Imagine Mystique as a fat faced youngster, or Toad in a red costume, looking like a B movie action hero.Poorly written dialogues, 15 year old Visual Effects reminding me of a low budget movie, nonexistent action sequences and a meaningless story makes this a painful experience, you never want to experience again in your life.

Great movie,"I've been looking forward to this movie for quite some time. However, I was rather nervous going into as i'd gone to other reboots/prequels and been disappointed. The special effects aren't over the top. They don't need to be because the storyline is quite decent. Michael fassbender and james mcavoy both shine in this movie. Michael fassbender brings a lot of intensity and anfry malevolence to the role and james mcavoy adds some youthful charm to professor xavier. My only complaint would be that January jones is just present as eye candy. I also felt that nicholas hoult struggled a bit when it came to credibility but maybe thats just me.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

'First Class' is to X-Men what 'Casino Royale' was to James Bond - rejuvenation,"'X-Men' has been saved. It never quite reached the painful lows of the 'Batman' franchise under the misdirection of Joel Schumacher, but after the last two distinctly average outings, the franchise faced an uncertain future. Not anymore: X-Men has been restored to its former glory. 'X-Men: First Class' is to X-Men what 'Casino Royale' was to James Bond - rejuvenation.The film occupies the perfect spot between fan service and accessibility. There are things that long-time X-Men fans will recognise and appreciate, and for them these geek snippets will enhance the overall experience. However, these references are never laboured. Blink and you'll miss them. Newcomers never feel as though they are outsiders - this is the perfect jumping-on point.Forget 2009's 'Wolverine' – this should have been called 'X-Men Origins', because that's exactly what it is. It is about a young Charles Xavier and his fascination with human evolution. It is about young Erik Lehnsherr and his desire to avenge the death of his family in the Holocaust. This is the story of how they become Professor X and Magneto.It's not about super powers. There are a lot of them, but that's not the point of the film. The focus is primarily on the characters. They're not superheroes and supervillians just yet, they're just people, trying to deal with mutations – which is far more interesting than explosions and fights.The mutants have differing attitudes towards their 'gifts'. Some are proud while others are ashamed. There is a sense that these mutations really affect the lives of some characters. Mystique, seen in previous films as a sassy and confident shape-shifter, is revealed to be sensitive and highly insecure. The mutants are much less one-dimensional and, as a result, more real.The depth of these characters is complimented by the outstanding acting. Michael Fassbender is sublime. There have been comments about his Bond-like performance and while this is true, it is a gross oversimplification of his character. He perfectly straddles the line between good and evil, between rage and serenity. His performance has such depth that it is easier to empathise with him than to condemn him for his crimes.Look past his bitterness and violence, and it is possible to see a confused, tortured soul simultaneously seeking peace and vengeance. Fassbender's Magneto is an interesting character, so impressively portrayed that it actually makes Ian McKellen seem dull by comparison.James McAvoy does a great job as a naïve, arrogant version of Charles Xavier. His character is not as interesting as Fassbender's, but that has more to do with Matthew Vaughn's decision to focus on Magneto's development. Nonetheless, McAvoy and Fassbender have great chemistry, resulting in a double-act reminiscent of 'Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid'.Their performances are strong enough to cover up the weaker acting, most notably from January Jones, who is wooden and vacant. She relies greatly on her revealing costumes, but they fail to distract from the fact that she blinks more than she acts.With a well-written story and impressive lead acting, 'First Class' is an excellent film in its own right. However, it is praiseworthy that Matthew Vaughn has managed to make a film of this quality that also ties in with the pre-existing films. The X-Men franchise could end here, with this instalment as a perfect background for Bryan Singer's 'future' efforts.Alternatively it could carry on, and, judging by the strength of this one, nobody would complain. Very rarely does a follow-up challenge its predecessors in terms of quality or intrigue, but 'First Class' is such a film. In fact, it may be the best 'X-Men' yet.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Worth the $10 only because of the action packed visual effects!,"Somewhat of a prequel, that included split second cameos, not so hidden conflicting racist and ""love yourself or else"" messages, several montages that helped keep the film under 3 hours, and not so obvious connections to what was already seen in previous movies. The movie presented a great introduction to how the X-Men became X-Men and women. There were some not so likable moments. Like the lukewarm reactions of Zoe Kravitz, or the internal struggle of ""you wanna feel sorry for him but you can't"" Magneto. But there were plenty of likable moments, all encompassed in the action packed visual effects. With all these imperfections you cant help but feel for the mutants, walk out the movie and hope that maybe tomorrow you'll wake up with some weird mutation. You also could walk out knowing more than you wanted to know about the Cuban Missile crises, and the CIA's ""No place for a woman and/ or mutant attitude.""",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Mutants Begin,"Mathew Vaughn directed this second prequel(though fifth entry) in the franchise, set mostly in 1962, where young mutants Charles Xavier(played by James McAvoy) and Erik Lansherr(played by Michael Fassbender) are enlisted by the U.S. government to organize fellow mutants they locate through the use of the Cerebro, through which Charles uses his telepathic powers. Once together, they are attacked by evil mutant leader Sebastian Shaw(played by Kevin Bacon) who has a past with Erik(from WWII) that puts them on a collision course that will determine the future events that turn Erik into Magneto and lead his anti-human brotherhood of mutants. Surprisingly good film does a fine job filling in the back stories of key X-Men characters, who are well cast with younger actors. Lots of big-scale action scenes helped by a thoughtful script, and authentic recreation of the early 1960's.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Mutant and proud.,"Channelling the old-school Bondian spy thriller into something so audacious, confident and fueled by youthful energy, X-Men: First Class offers renewed vigour thanks to its sparkling script and sleek direction. Orchestrating the mayhem with swiftness and a laudable coherence, Matthew Vaughn maintains a strong focus dedicated to clarity and dramatic power never losing sight of its ultimate story, and makes each emotional motivation interlock tackling the importance of self-love, family bonding and friendship. Lying somewhere between Mad Men and Thunderbirds the film combines retro pleasures with colourful action, a task made all the easier by a charging, churning and deeply evocative score by Henry Jackman. Once again, the cast is superb, with McAvoy and Fassbender carrying real magnetism both individually and together. Offering two unique perspectives from two wildly different individuals, they are both cool and intense, soft and unaffected, playful and deadly serious; Fassbender especially. With spectacular effects done by the legendary John Dykstra and an emotionally engaging story, X-Men: First Class is a standout period adventure film that just happens to have a loveable group of superheroes at its core.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
When Xavier and Erik were friends,"Released in 2011 and directed by Matthew Vaughn, ""X-Men: First Class"" chronicles the origins of the mutant superheroes and super-villains in 1962 when the US government decides to enlist the talents of people with superhuman abilities. This is before Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and Erik Lensherr (Michael Fassbender) took the names Professor X and Magneto and were friends rather than arch-nemeses. They and their teen team must stop the diabolical Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) from using the Cuban Missile Crisis to start a nuclear war to increase his power. Jennifer Lawrence appears as Mystique and Rose Byrne as Moira MacTaggert. Nicholas Hoult is on hand as Hank McCoy/Beast.It's interesting to go back to the early 60s when Xavier and Erik were friends and observe how the team got started, not to mention the eventual rift (the story deviates from the comic, of course, although there are some similarities). McAvoy easily carries the movie as Xavier; and Fassbender is effective as Magneto (and more fitting than Ian McKellen). I prefer Lawrence to Rebecca Romijn simply because she's curvier and cuter. There's a cameo with Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and it's hilarious.Most of the movie is decent espionage akin to James Bond, albeit with super-powers. Where the film shines is the entire last act and epilogue. The sequences on the island shore are very well done. Just remember: The brother always dies first.ADDITIONAL CAST: Oliver Platt appears as a Fed who organizes the team; January Jones as Emma Frost; Caleb Landry Jones as Banshee; Zoë Kravitz as Angel; Jason Flemyng as Azazel; Álex González as Riptide; Lucas Till as Havok; and Edi Gathegi as Darwin.The film runs 132 minutes and was shot in Englefield House, Berkshire, England (Xavier's school); London (Swiss bank); other parts of England; Hatley Castle, Colwood, British Columbia; Los Angeles (dock scenes); Villa La Angostura, Neuquén, Argentina; and Jekyll Island, Georgia (climatic island scenes).GRADE: B",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
X-Men: First Class 2011 Review,"I guess i'm on the opposition here. I found this film pretty boring and tonally inconsistent.
It seemed like it wanted to be fun and exciting, and then it would switch and want to be serious and dive into specific characters and their psyche, it just didn't work. The story as a whole was boring, only really there to confirm what we know from the previous films so none of this comes off as new.
Most of the mutants like Havok and Angel feel like they're only introduced to serve one part in the final battle and then that's it. And good god, Beast looks awful.
Speaking of the final battle though, it was entertaining and actually gripped me which goes against the previous hour and a half of the film which was a total bore.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Very Entertaining Movie that Adds Depth,"I love this movie! I found this to be very entertaining, but also very heartwarming. At least in my opinion. It doesn't have the emotional value that I love to look for, but it adds a lot of depth. It adds depth to the characters (Xavier and Erik), as well as the overall X-Men story. I don't only appreciate this movie for what it's done, but I was entertained. It held my attention all the way through. I can't forget to talk about Professor X and Magneto. The relationship that these guys have, I found to be profound and compelling. The casting of Patrick Stewart and Ian Mckellen as those two is certainly iconic, but I think James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender are the better pair. Both pairs are awesome, but I think the depth that Fassbender put behind Magento was amazing. That goes for McAvoy as well. It was an overall entertaining film, but also one that adds depth to the universe and story.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A return to form for Fox's X-Men,"After the complete letdown that was ""The Last Stand"" and the equally subpar Wolverine movie, Matthew Vaughn brings some much needed rejuvenation to the ""X-Men"", all while throwing the mutant team back in time to the midst of the Cold War. While the backdrop of the Cuba Missile Crisis doesn't bring much of an interesting narrative to the film, and Vaughn's take on the question of human evolution through the mutants are lesser than that of Bryan Singer, "" X-Men: First Class"" is a fast-paced buzzing adventure. With stellar special effects, and a charismatic cast of characters, this is a first class blockbuster in terms of entertainment value.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good but not great,"I liked X2, X3 and Wolverine but hated the first Xmen movie so maybe this is the case here. I'm not a Marvel fan boy but that is not why I'm not crazy about this movie. I loved the storyline but wasn't crazy about acting in this movie. The almost emotionless acting makes this movie fall flat before it can be considered epic and that is the problem here. Michael Fassbender looks the part of Magneto but simply isn't badass enough. I mean you see him going around and killing people but he just gives off the impression that a 90 year old lady could kick his ass. He just doesn't play a strong soon to be bad guy and that's the problem. January Jones is hot but her cold acting is very distracting and pulls you out of the movie. James McAvoy plays a prefect soon-to-be professor X and Kevin Bacon does a masterful job in his role but both of these actors shouldn't have to carry the movie. Fact is that Michael Fassbender has a lot of camera time and that works to bring the movie down. Another thing that costs the movie is Kevin Bacon's henchmen.

First I will like to say the posters don't do justice to this film.,"First I will like to say the posters don't do justice to this film.This movie is a movie you will like to see again, the plot is almost nearing excellence, and the action scenes are well choreographed. The effects are a grade A, and the dialogue is interesting. The movie is well directed by Vaughn, who keeps the movie dramatic, and thrilling.The movie starts is a NAZI concentration camp in 1944, where we see Erik Lehnsherr who is being forced to display his mutant power, when he's separated from his mother. This act of force was carried out by a doctor Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) who wants to study and harness Erik's abilities.In New York, a wealthy boy, Charles Xavier, who can read minds, meets a girl named Raven who can shape-shift but whose natural physical state is blue and scaly.In 1962, Charles has grown and has become a compassionate genetic scientist (now played by James McAvoy) studying genetic abnormalities. Erik on the other hand has grown (now played by Michael Fassbender) was obsessed with revenge and tracking down the doctor who tortured him. Raven (Jennifer Lawrence) to have grown to be a frustrated mutant as she longed envision life without her mutation.We get to see how Hank (Beast) developed a serum to hide their differences from the human world go bad, and they added a relationship though quite small between Hank and Raven.The movie's chief focus was on the beginning of it all, we get to see how close Charles Xavier and Magneto was and how their differences drove both party apart. As we get to see this two heroes be for each other and then at the very end when the choice of either be for the humans or for the mutants started the now called X-MEN.Casting, in this movie is just the thing that gives this movie the edge it needed, as Kevin Beacon (long time no see) was just wonderful, giving us a memorable performance. The other teens in the movie, Havoc, Darwin etc also did their part as we see them struggle with their mastery of their powers.So in the end of this review, marvel did something a lot better than what the last 2 films had done. It not a movie you will regret but one you will love.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
At its best is was OK,"A rebooting of the X-Men. It gives us the origin of Dr. X (James McAvoy) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender). They are no longer brothers--Dr. X is a brilliant scientist and Magneto saw his mother brutally killed in a German concentration camp. Most of this takes place in 1962 during the Cuban Missile Crisis (so we can have a younger--and hotter--cast). Sebastian Stan (Kevin Bacon) is an evil mutant who (with some followers) wants to start a world wide apocalypse. Dr. X and his band of good mutants set out to stop him.The special effects are top notch and this movie clearly was made on a BIG budget with incredible locations and such...but I was bored. The script is VERY slow and the constant ""winks"" at the audience (dialogue that clearly shows future events) gets tiresome. The evil mutants are never introduced by name (except for Emma Frost) and their powers are never explained leading to confusion (in the audience). Add to that is the totally unnecessary length (this film could have wrapped up in less than 2 hours), plot holes all over the place and historical inaccuracies galore. Even worse some of the acting is terrible--Lucas Till is dreadful as Havoc and McAvoy is bad too. Even worse is Bacon! To top it all off the one black mutant is killed off early on! I thought that kind of scripting went out in the 1960s! It struck me as ridiculously racist. On the good side--Fassbender is GREAT as Magneto and January Jones is terrific as Emma Frost (although she is captured far too easily--and never even attempts to escape). A cameo by Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) is hysterical and easily the best part of the movie! The use of multiple screens during the training sessions were nice too. But, all in all, I found this boring and pointless. I was looking at my watch more than the screen! A 4 all the way.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Solid effects-driven blockbuster, but that's about it","Having paid more than my fair share of inflated cinema tickets to see hyped blockbuster movies based on special effects, I'm more and more happy to wait rather than go sit in a crowded noisy room to see the latest one, which is why I decided to watch the recent X-Men reboot/prequel on DVD rather than in the cinema. I had heard reasonable things though, so I was quite looking forward to it and hoping that the franchise reboot would do more than simply move earlier in the story. I may have hoped this but of course this is not really what it does – the step back in time simply presses the reset button on the characters so the writers no longer need to worry about the back-story of the previous films. This may sound cynical but this is what the film is doing – not adding anything by the shift in time, just getting rid of expensive actors, messy plots and also getting viewers back into the cinema after the third film started to put them off.How much of a problem is this lack of innovation? Well, to be honest, not much if you are coming to the film knowing what you're getting into. What this means is that this is not a film that is exploring characters because it wants to – it is building characters because it wants to sell tickets and that is clear from the start since everything is pretty basic on the character side – indeed it never feels more relaxed than when it is able to go into a montage and develop characters that way. The good side of this is that it does want to spend lots of money on special effects and mostly these are up on the screen in rather silly and overblown effects shots. The various powers of the characters are where these effects come into play and they are as variable as the powers; so in some cases the effects are impressive and add to the action of the scene – in other cases no amount of effects can make the powers be good (a stripper with wings isn't a ""power"", it simply means she might get more tips). The plot does allow for plenty of good action even though the plot is pretty much the same one all the films have at their core – it really doesn't do much more than provide a frame.The new cast never quite get to the level of the adult equivalents, even though there is some real talent here. McAvoy and Fassbender both do solid work in their roles but they fall awkwardly between being younger as characters while also trying to have the gravitas of their previous versions. Bacon is OK but never as much of a threat as he needed to be while January Jones just strides round in her pants, presumably wondering how many years of really good turns she has to give in Mad Men before someone else will give her a good role. Lawrence, Bryne, Hoult and others are all OK in their roles but the downside of all these younger actors is that this doesn't feel like a big franchise sequel/prequel so much as it feels like a cheaper version of the proper films.That said it still delivers what it needs to do – which is special effects that provide value for money. The plot and characters don't offer much more than a frame for these, but they are not awful, just obvious. A solid big-budget superhero movie then, but not one that does much more than the minimum in regards plot, characters and tone.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Charismagnetic,"In comparison to all of its predecessors (successors is more relevant), X-Men First Class is the first film in this mutant saga with the power not to bore me. One of the two main reasons for this prowess is probably the absence of pretense and pure demonstration of primal machismo and showing off: that is to say the absence of Wolverine (he appears in a cameo actually). But the first of those reasons is obviously the presence of wits, class, a sense of drama credibility: German performer Michael Fassbender, already seen in Inglourious Basterds, is the great provider for all that as Magneto, real profundity, sheer rage, multilinguality This prequel purposely almost looks like a (good) James Bond film on the bases of revenge, Cold War, female manipulations and colorful credits at the end. Clichés on solidarity and the value of differences are not too heavy to swallow. Eine Schöne Überaschung.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"It's the best, most faithful, and ambitious X-Men movie of the lot.","I'd argue that the success of First Class was as consequential to the X-Men franchise in 2011 as the success of Batman Begins was to the Batman franchise in 2005. At the time, with the MCU in full swing and The Dark Knight revolutionizing the genre a couple years before, X-Men definitely needed a refresh. The franchise was still tarnished by the travesty of the Brett Ratner's X-Men: The Last Stand.First Class was exactly what the doctor ordered. It's a film that feels different from the rest of the franchise in a lot of ways, yet makes sense regarding its continuity and relationship with the old trilogy. It helps that James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, and Jennifer Lawrence seem to perfectly capture the essence of the older versions of their characters (Professor X, Magneto, and Mystique respectively). The casting department really knocked it out of the park here; even if they ""deviated"" from the depictions with the original trilogy, honestly, these people are so good for these roles that it almost feels like a fitting ""passing of the torch"" for these characters than anything else.As for characters we haven't seen before - a staple of any X-Men movie - most of them are really great. Kevin Bacon's Sebastian Shaw is a fantastic villain with amazing screen presence and a fascinating relationship with Fassbender's Erik Lenscherr. We have two (!) teams of mutants here, the not-quite X-Men and the Hellfire Club, and it's a testament to the excellent script, performances, and editing that it never feels like these people are underdeveloped. We know enough about them through key character moments and despite have so many people at play, the film balances everyone so well.Another thing I really love about this movie is the look and feel. Maybe it's the deliberate 1960s setting, allowing the set and costume designers to have a bit more fun than the - let's be honest - visually drab original trilogy, but this movie just POPS off the screen. Bright colours, gorgeous sets and vistas, amazing and visually distinct costumes...it's truly a beautiful film that captures 60s era spy action films with comic books from the era as well. This, despite not being overly stylized either.There's also a pervasive youthfulness and sexiness to this movie that I feel a lot of similar films miss nowadays. Again, the swinging '60s definitely provide some inspiration, and as sad as it is to say, permission, to have these aspects of the human experience depicted. The era also allows the film to have fun with history; Nazi escapees, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and the Cold War ground this film in reality and gives us a far easier understanding of the stakes and the emotional resonance of what's happening on screen. None of it is incredulous either; I feel like Matthew Vaughn and co. Had a pretty solid understanding of the era, a staple of any good historical fiction.On top of all, the film excels with its action. The final battle is truly one of the best action sequences that this franchise has ever produced, and there's just so much fun to be had with all of these mutants and their powers. I almost forgot about the music. Henry Jackman (surely no relation, right?) produced an unbelievably good score that fits the movie absolutely perfectly. Easily the best music in the series.Really, the only drawback I can think of is Jennifer Jones' performance as Emma Frost. To the uninitiated, she probably doesn't matter all that much, but X-heads rightfully felt she's too important of a character to have such a limited role and be depicted by...let's just say, an actress of...limited acting talent. At least she's gorgeous, I mean, Emma Frost is at least supposed to be a blonde bombshell, and apparently Vaughn and Jones were dating at the time so...I can't blame the man.The more I think about the movie, honestly the more I feel like it's the best X-Men film yet. I'm serious. It didn't need to be this good, but there's not a single aspect that drags the film for me. Matthew Vaughn, the actors, the creative and technical team behind the scenes, and even the studio deserve a lot of credit for this film. It finally feels like an X-Men movie that isn't afraid to get a little goofy and have some fun with the source material.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not a First Class Film,"I sat through it. I ate my popcorn, but I wasn't really thrilled. The direction/cinematography were both a bit on the sloppy side; some shots were unintentionally blurry. The Wolverine prequel actually had more soul.I also thought that Xaviar and Mystique were terribly miscast; not that there performances were off; I just didn't see in them young Patrick Stewart or Rebecca Romijn. But film companies are so reluctant against going with unknowns.Then there are the discrepancies: in X-Men 1 and 2, Xaviar describes Magneto as an old friend, but in this prequel, they barely knew each other. Nor in those first two films did Mystique even seem to know Xaviar, when here she apparently spent two decades with him growing up. And while plot holes abound, a decent rewrite of the script could have solved most of them. But apparently, the script went through three rewrites, which is in and of itself a bad sign.Worst line in the film: towards the end, Xaviar says something like, ""What worse can happen? I'll probably become bald."" The writers probably could have gotten more laughs from him saying ""Beam me up,"" but the film takes place two years prior to Star Trek being aired.As far as comic books to films go, it was all right. It just wasn't X-cellent.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"""Peace was never an option""","After two disappointing instalments, X-Men fans needed some heroes themselves, people who could revitalise the series and luckily, we got that with the director of the first two films and the man who was originally picked to direct X-Men: The Last Stand. The Bryan Singer/Matthew Vaughn combo was able to give the series the kick it needed, making a fun and action-packed film.In 1962, the privileged Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) has graduated from Oxford University with a PhD in Genetics and has a very close relationship with his adopted sister, Raven (Jennifer Lawrence). On the other side of the coin is Erik Lehnsherr (the always awesome Michael Fassbender), a Holocaust surviving, hunting Nazis around the world, overall badass. Both are recruited by CIA agent Moira MacTarget (Rose Byrne) to help stop the Hellfire Club, lead by Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) and his group of powerful mutants; Emma Frost (January Jones), Azazel (Jason Flemyng), and Riptide (Alex Gonzalez). As the Hellfire Club manipulates the United States and the Soviet Union towards nuclear war, Charles and Erik go on their own recruiting drive to train mutants for their team, including Hank McCoy (Nicholas Hoult), Alex Summers (Lucas Till), and Angel Salvadore (Zoe Kravitz).From what should have been a disaster of a film, Vaughn pulled it out of the bag and made a really fun summer blockbuster. Compared to Singer's whose X-Men movies were dark, in both story and style, Vaughn made his X-Men film a lighter and more colourful film, with a strong mix of drama and comedy, very much like Spider-man and Iron Man. Because of the quick production time some of the CGI is a bit ropey, but Vaughn proves himself a talented director with a great visual style, from his montages that interject comic book visuals to his action scenes. Vaughn ensures that there is plenty of mutant versus mutant action and just like in the Singer films, mutants use their powers logically. Some of the comedy is predictable, but still funny and the action scenes were tense, unlike Brett Ratner's approach in X-Men: The Last Stand who broke up action sequences with humour.The plot itself is very similar to the James Bond film Tomorrow Never Dies, since it comes down to an outside force trying to start a war for their own ends. Continuing with the Bond film there is a certain feel in the early part of the film with Erik's global travelling and the scene with Moira in bra and panties, which was very much like something from a Bond or even Austin Powers movie.X-Men: First Class is a film that focuses on characters and relationships, a strength of any good action film, or as I see it, an X-Men film with action in it. There are strong ideologies being formed with Shaw taking the place of Magneto in this world. There are also ideas about how government circles and intelligence agencies would react to the discovery of a new breed of humanity. The Nazi Scientist was very much like the Emperor in Star Wars, pretty much saying ""let the anger consume you"".What X-Men: First Class needed in order to be successful was a strong chemistry between McAvoy and Fassbender, which we got. They have a yin and yang relationship as they share a goal but have two different ways about how to achieve it, yet you can still believe they are friends. Many of the supporting cast members were strong, Bacon is of course, intelligent and powerful with a sinister Southern accent and capably assisted by the beautiful January Jones. Some of the characters were sidelined, but I am sure they will be developed in the sequel.As a fanboy, I could make a list of things the filmmakers got wrong from the comics and continuity with the first three films, but it was so well made as a stand-alone movie it doesn't really matter. Really, it's just as much a reboot as it is a prequel. There are also plenty of cameos that will keep fans happy. X-Men: First Class is the best X-Men film since X2: X-Men United.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Between rage and serenity...,"Passionate James McAvoy as Charles Xavier implores his dear friend Erik Lehnsherr (sullenly charismatic Michael Fassbender) to let go and harness his innate power, ""True focus lies somewhere between rage and serenity."" ""X-Men: First Class"" is about rediscovering one's power and choosing one's life path. In ""First Class"" the difference between the hero and the villain may be choice. Director and Writer Matthew Vaughn's ""X-Men: First Class"" has unexpected pathos. Set in 1962 ""X-Men: First Class"" compellingly tells the origins of the X-Men mythology. This is surprising given the numerous writers involved: Ashely Edward Miller, Zack Stentz, Jane Goldman, Sheldon Turner, and Bryan Singer (writer and director of the first two X-Men movies). Singer's signature narrative strands resonate here. Charles rescues Erik, who almost forfeits his life all for vengeance, reminding him, ""You are not alone!""For Singer, ""X-Men"" has always been his allegory of courage in the face of prejudice and fear. In ""X-Men"" Mutants, ""Children of the Atom"", are born with special powers. Consequently, neither Human, Mutants are feared and forced to conceal, who they are. Like all discriminated, Mutants have lost the freedom to be. Although with some whimsical patches, ""X-Men: First Class"" is amazingly somber. Its gravitas sources the period, 1962 during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Vaughn authentically recreates 1962. ""X-Men: First Class"" has a retro James Bond look and feel. The art deco lines are elegantly clean. The wardrobe has slender lines and muted tones. Unlike other X-Men movies, this one is sexy. Vaughn has January Jones and Rose Byrne in cool 60's lingerie, in context of course. He even inserts the benign homage to ""Basic Instincts"" with stunning Jones. ""First Class"" is visually stunning. At the spectacular story arc Erik (Fassbender), harnessing his power, lifts a submerged submarine into the sky.On the downside ""X-Men: First Class"" has at least two too many mutants and subplots. They are distracting. The power of ""First Class"" lies in the relationship and transformation of Charles and Erik. McAvoy and Fassbender embody a formidable force. We are invested in their chosen fate. James McAvoy at first occurs as Harry Potter playing Xavier. He is deceptive in his compassion and strength. Unintentionally, he is the critical foil of the dominant dark presence of Erik. Through McAvoy's undying belief in the vestiges of nobility in Erik, we witness the tragic fall. Charles pleads with Erik, ""Killing will not bring you peace."" Erik reminds, ""Peace was never an option."" Fassbender is powerful. He is going to be a big star. As Erik, he compassionately leverages his pain and rage. Fassbender brilliantly hints at Erik's innate nobility and the cost of his forfeited humanity. Ultimately, Erik's fall from grace occurs when he succumbs to vengeance. To that end, Kevin Bacon is amazing as Sebastian Shaw, the man who created and cursed Erik. Bacon is awesome and convincing in his malevolent presence.""X-Men: First Class"" recreates the opening of ""X-Men"". It is Poland 1944, young Erik is separated from his family as they are taken to the Nazi gas chambers. Immersed in fear and rage, Erik discovers his Mutant power over metal as he effortlessly twists the steel fence. Nazi scientist Shaw (Bacon) recognizes Erik's gift. In unspeakably ruthless act, Shaw coerces Erik to summon his power. Erik's life becomes ruled by vengeance. Back in wealthy English estate, we learn that young Charles is a telepath of uncharted ability. Not only can he read minds, he can also manipulate them. He befriends a fellow Mutant in Raven, a blue skinned shape shifter. Charles takes her in as his sister. Beautiful Jennifer Lawrence plays Raven as the young woman she becomes.Charles and Erik's lives follow apparently divergent paths. Now 18 years later, Erik searches for Shaw in Argentina. Charles is at Oxford University with Raven. He is finishing his doctorate on human mutation. However one move ahead, Shaw is in Las Vegas generating his master plan to ignite World War III. CIA operative Moira MacTaggert (spunky Rose Byrne) witnesses Shaw in surveillance of Hell Fire Club. Byrne provides great spirit as Moira. Requiring expertise on Mutants, Moira seeks out Charles. Charles knowingly aligns forces with the CIA to bring Shaw to justice. This leads to the inevitable collision with Erik's path of vengeance. Vaughn masterfully orchestrates the tragic hero story and world brinkmanship.There are so many Mutants on both sides of the fight. January Jones makes a seductive turn as Emma Frost, a telepath who can transform to diamond. Nicholas Hoult is strong as the angst ridden and innocent scientist Hank McCoy. The other X-Men classmates are cool, but get lost in the noise. Jennifer Lawrence brilliantly fleshes out Raven, who comes to terms with her own identity and leverages the plot tipping point.""X-Men: First Class"" lives and dies in the brotherhood of Charles and Erik in the battle of good and evil. Through the performances of McAvoy and Fassbender, the lines are poignantly blurred. Triumph is solemn, and the fall from grace is tragic. ""X-Men: First Class"" may be the best X-Men movie. And it is just a great movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Class Action,"Prep for ""Dark Phoenix"" begins with the first of the prequel films for the main X-men series.Erik Lensherr (Michael Fassbender) discovered his magnetic mutant powers under extreme duress as Sebastian Schmidt (Kevin Bacon) exploits the Nazi's reign of terror to instigate his own experiments. 12 years later, the now renamed Sebastian Shaw is interfering in both the Military and political landscapes in the US and the USSR, which brings him to the attention of the CIA, who contact Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) an expert on genetic mutations to assist them. But Lensherr has not forgotten the terrors of his youth, and is looking for revenge.It was interesting to watch ""First Class"" again after all these years. In a few aspects, particularly from a visual standpoint, CGI has moved on quite a lot in just the 8 years since and a few of the effects don't stand up that well. There's no ""weight"" to a lot of them and a few specific examples, Beast running with Xavier as one, just look awful. Away from those concerns though, the film is pretty solid. It has one of the most straightforward and logical plotlines of film in this series, I understood the motivations for each of character and only really found that Mystique's ""accepting who she really is"" turnaround came without sufficient motivation. It's got quite a lot of humorous moments and a few references to the wider series, McAvoy talking about losing his fair, the Stryker family making their first appearance, what looks like a young Storm, Cameos from Rebecca Romjin and, of course, Hugh Jackman.There are issues beyond the CGI. Michael Fassbender's accent wavers throughout and he's very Irish in the scenes towards the end. It's a little odd to see Mystique throw herself at both Beast and Magneto at a couple of points, you feel like they wouldn't make those choices were the film being made today. Minor quibbles in a very entertaining additional to the franchise.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A fun movie,"By itself, this movie does it's job. However, if you start considering the other x-men movies, this movie starts to fall short. There are several scenes and events in this movie that do not match up to suggested or explicitly mentioned in the other movies. To be fair, some of these events could be temporary, and further x-men origins style movies could resolve many of these inconsistencies. But.. the movie does well on it's own and doesn't really need the others to explain it. Which makes sense since it is a prequel of sorts.In the x-men mythology, professor X and magneto were supposed to originally be friends. But this really is not explored well in the movie at all. The bulk of the movie takes place in such a short time frame, the characters just don't seem to build that connection or friendship. They seem friendly, but not close friends as suggested by the mythology. Towards the end there are a few events that are supposed to build off of the strong bond implied by the movie, but again, it just doesn't work because the movie didn't build that strong friendship. If you are familiar with the general story, there are expected reactions, but anyone unfamiliar is likely to wonder why they are acting so out of character.Magneto's and Professor X's personalities are explored a little bit and generally do a good job. Not as well I think with Magneto. You sort of see him switch his a couple of times in the movie and it does leave you with this weird out of place feeling. I think that is a big part of the reason why the movie fails at building the friendship between the two characters.If you are a hardcore x-men fan, I think you will be left with some disappointment. But if you go with an open mind and don't look at it so seriously, it is a fun and entertaining film worth watching. There are many x-men classic characters that have appearances, which are always fun to see. One of X-Mens' themes is diversity, and this movie is no exception.

The best xmen movie to date,"An x-men movie without Scott(cyclops) and Jean Grey?, man , its gonna be boring !!!, that was my initial reaction, but this movie definitely takes the x-men series to an altogether new high.Story : In short , the story revolves around the origin of the initial x-men characters, professor x, magneto, and mystique. also joined by a few others as well, in the Cuban missile crisis backdrop. the story is very well written , and actually has a lot more depth to it than the other x-men films.Characters & Acting : It was amazing to see the characters of Magneto and Professor x, with powers toned to close perfection to fit into a brilliant movie, the balance created was the key to the movie, a special mention to James Mc Avoy , he had nailed the character completely, in fact the performances were equally strong throughout the movie but rather a little weak when the younger breed steps in, but thats cos they dint have enough of screen time and development time.Special Effects : The films C.g.i was at the best above average, it almost looks pre-production level near the climax sequences, but apart from that, the , they work, they work because of the background score complementing it so beautifully, some very beautifully choreographed sequences to look out for here !!.Sound track : the sound track by Henry Jackson was simply put ""Awesome"". It adds a whole new level of involvement and intensity to the movie, very interesting cues and strong sounds, though a drawback could be that the viewer gets a little fatigued around the middle. else we can say it adds brilliantly !!Directing : Admittedly, i loved kick ass, but X-men is a wholly different kind of a story, but, Vaughn , pulled it off with utmost style.Conclusion : There really isn't anything to point out in this movie, and it is rare to see a movie getting so many things right , just go and watch it !!p.s : i would be extremely cool to see what Mathew Vaughn would do once all the characters step in !!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
good but at the same time a let down,"i'm not a hardcore marvel buff that nows their s*** when it comes to comic book characters. just a regular fan of fantasy fiction when it comes to this genre. yes there's action, great scores and interesting characters.but it felt so forced to me throughout, whether it was a supporting cast of actors that had bad reaction time to green screen special effect scenes or having to cram everything ""prequel"" to get defined answers to questions across. i think the main reason why i didn't enjoy this as much was down to it being so damn political. i don't care for all that nonsense, especially when the cgi seemed a little flawed on close up shots.i know this comes across as mindless ranting but there is a point to my method of madness. the underline themes still make it a great film. our possibility of a similar future, friendships drown over ulterior motives, bloodshed over blood relations. if anything positive can come out of my review it's that i'd like to see how the individual actors careers spark in the next few years through this film.when you get right down to it - i'm sure it's great for the obsessed comic book geek that has nothing else better to do with life. but i'd rather flick on something with an R rating than this.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best prequel of all time... seriously deserves attention,"I never was much interested in comic book action movies. But Chris Nolan got my attention in the Batman series. Then Mathew Vaughn's Kick-ass became one of my favorites. Then when I heard he was making a x-men prequel, I decided to see the trilogy.And thank god I did... This movie was one of the most stylish, brilliant and cool movie in years. But otherwise, the experience of it was remarkable. Charles Xavier and Erik's character were very well performed(they are my favorite in the entire series). The movie surprisingly is less in action and more in drama and that makes it more powerful. Bryan Singer did a good job on the story. But it somehow doesn't do justice to the original trilogy. But then, who cares? This movie begs to be enjoyed in the highest quality.The music is rocking and has a great feeling about it. The cinematography makes it more clean and sharp. The whole Production is good.Action movies on comics have always been fair. But I think the era is changing now.... X-men is the best comic according to me because it is metaphorically similar to the ""special ones"" in our own human society. And battles did take place for the same reason in reality. X-men First Class depicts this beautifully through the friendship of two mutants who eventually end up as foes.Truly First Class... 9/10 (I took off one star point just because the story has some loop-holes. No spoiler!)",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Puts the X in excellent.,"Like Star Wars and Star Trek, now it's the X-Men turn to get a back story.The story takes in place in 1962, a young college student named Charles Xavier(James McAvoy), before he was known has Professor Xavier, is asked by Morina MacTaggert(Rose Byrne) to help figure out an evil mutant named Sebastian Shaw(Kevin Bacon) and his crews plan. Charles befriends a troubled mutant named Erik Lennsher(Michael Fassbender), before he became known has Magneto, He and Charles recruits other mutants, but will they all be able to be a step ahead of Shaw?An improvement over X-Men:Origins Wolverine. The effects are incredible, so are two surprised cameos, by whom I won't say. McAvoy and Fassbender give descent performances. So does Kevin Bacon as the villain, he just really gets under your skin. I liked the back story, and the 60's setting. A true delight for X-Men fans.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Stands out from standard comic screen adaptations.,"The filming style is mainly in short sequences. This makes it varied and reduces the boring factor, which is deadly for every kind of movie.Some fabulous actors make it also an enjoyment to watch it: Kevin Bacon (Death Sentence), Rose Byrne (28 Weeks Later). Written in ( ) you see the most suitable movie of the actor. And a new discovery (for me): Michael Fassbender (very cold acting, which I love, and also very language skilled).The story makes sense and shows how everything began (Once more this has become a standard in the filming business. I think Star Wars Episode I, 1999, started this mania.)Normally comic adaptations are boring, childish and for fans only. This one, like others mentioned afterwards, are succeeded: Sin City, V for Vendetta, Watchmen and Batman Begins.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Fanaticalaboutfilms Review: X-Men: First Class,"One problem that every prequel has to overcome it the ability to keep interest despite us knowing the eventual outcome of the movie. If you have seen any of the previous four films then it's quite probable you can piece together how this movie is going to end and how the characters are going to turn out. This therefore needs to be compensated for and is done so successfully by the introduction of plenty of new characters to keep our interest and the actual discovery of how two men who used to be friends come to be enemies.X-Men: First Class follows the exploits of the first mutants to be discovered, primarily that of Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and Erik Lehnsherr aka Magneto (Michael Fassbender). It begins with a 12 year old Charles meeting Raven (Jennifer Lawrence) and their friendship as they grow up and a young Erik undergoing the hardship of Nazi Germany and the anger that this instils in him. Moving forward, Charles graduates from Oxford with his PhD in genetic mutation and is brought into the US government to help with a mission to locate someone whereas Erik is hunting down the man responsible for separating him from his mother during the regime twenty years earlier.Both of their paths then cross when we discover they are after the same man, Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) and the mutant henchmen that he has surrounded himself with. Erik and Charles team up to recruit new mutants to teach them to use their mutations in order to prevent the Cuban missile crisis from unleashing the next World War and bring Shaw to justice.The two main plots of this movie are based on finding out about the relationship between Charles and Erik and the actual storyline tied into the Cuban missile crisis and an impending world war. The trailers emphasised that this was the film where we could witness the beginning of the X-men and it doesn't fail to deliver with a good script not only providing the answers but achieving them with a well crafted dialogue.As with most of the action movies nowadays, the action sequences are both impressive and well shot using a multitude of CGI effects especially during the final scene which was a particular highlight. The acting was also first class (poor pun intended) with McAvoy and Fassbender leading the way, their characters playing off each other perfectly but by no means outshining the rest of the cast.Placing the whole film during that of the Cold War was a great choice by director Matthew Vaughn and co as it provided not only an impressive backdrop but used these historical events to enforce its points. In fact Vaughn impresses once more leading to a film that makes you invest in the characters before building to a action packed end.In comparison to it's Summer sequel/prequel compatriots it has certainly taken the lead as the best so far and in terms of where it sits with the other 4 X-Men movies, well I'd put it in the top 2. Worth a trip to the cinema? Definitely, especially if you were already a fan of the franchise.For further reviews feel free to check out: http://www.fanaticalaboutfilms.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best X-Men flick yet...,"Don't get me wrong I love the first three X-Men movies, and have read the comic books since forever.However, this film was technically brilliant, character driven and restrained. The action was perfectly paced and scaled, and totally believable; which given what some of the characters can do is hard to achieve.Plenty of nods to the likes of James Bond. A perfectly observed period piece that just works on every level.

The hardcore nerds of course will never be pleased but most fans should be thrilled!,"'X-MEN: FIRST CLASS': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Prequel to the other four 'X-MEN' films detailing the origins of the first 'X-Men' team (in 1962) and focusing primarily on the friendship, that later turned to rivalry, between Charles Xavier and Erik Lehnsherr (who later became known as Professor X and Magneto).  The film was directed and co-written by Matthew Vaughn (also well known for adapting another popular comic book to film, 'KICK-ASS').  The script was also worked on by five other writers including Bryan Singer (the filmmaker behind the first two, much more loved, 'X-MEN' films), who was also set to direct this film before taking a producing seat instead in order to helm another project.  The movie stars James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence, Kevin Bacon, Rose Byrne, January Jones and Nicholas Hoult.  It's not quite as good as the first two installments but it is far superior to the last two.  Despite a somewhat rocky start it's an extremely satisfying and entertaining thrill ride that is sure to please most die-hard fans of the comics and movie series.The film opens with a scene from the first 'X-MEN' movie in which Erik is a child in a German concentration camp in 1944 and bends a metal gate, using his mutant ability to control metals, in an attempt to free his parents.  A scientist named Sebastian Shaw (Bacon) witnesses this and while trying to provoke the boy's power murders his mother.  Several years later Erik (Fassbender) is now obsessed with revenge.  While trying to murder Shaw he teams up with Xavier (McAvoy), the worlds most powerful telepath, who teaches him to harness his inner rage and better control his powers.  The two lead a team of young gifted mutants such as themselves in conjunction with the CIA.  Their ideas on what's best for their kind of course clashes and eventually challenges their friendship.The film is not as fun as the other installments, it's slower paced and extremely moody, but it is more serious and in many ways more faithful to it's source material. There are several inconsistency flaws with the other film chapters (if you thought the 'STAR WARS' prequels were bad, they're nothing compared to this) which is why many fans thought the filmmakers should have done a completely new reboot rather than a prequel. The inconsistencies don't really effect the overall quality of the film though. Once again they tried to pack too many characters and too many major events into one film and it's far too convoluted at times, early on, but it does pick up and get better as the film goes along.  The major characters are well thought out and relatable. The film, as with the entire series, grapples with the difficult society challenges faced with being an individual and different than the norm. This is where the movie is the strongest in many ways (as with the early two films), battling discrimination is a very emotional and serious topic for many and this chapter once again does an admirable job relating the issue. The action is of course stellar as well and Vaughn is once again in top form behind the camera. The performances are impressive all around once again as well, especially Fassbender, who's a star to watch out for. I'm becoming a big fan of Lawrence and she's good in this movie but it's hardly comparable to her Oscar nominated work from last year (in 'WINTER'S BONE'). Still it's nice to see her giving any of her talents to a comic book fanboy film like this. There's some nice surprise cameos as well. The film is pretty much grade A material all around. The hardcore nerds of course will never be pleased with anything that isn't the page reincarnated panel by panel on the big screen but most fans should be thrilled.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1S3pjephF8",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Cold War-era Marvel flick hits right on target,"I was always a bit lukewarm about the original X-Men trilogy, and was really underwhelmed by the Wolverine back story prequels, so I've come out the other side of this film concluding it's the best one yet (still to see Days of Future Past).The one feature I did always look forward to in the originals was the confrontation between Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen as the respective goodie and villain, and James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender's channeling of their older counterparts is probably the highlight of this picture. In terms of the film itself, it's a fairly well crafted plot, nicely paced, and well acted - nothing too special, but a solid watch.I think the element of this movie that elevates it above its predecessors most, however, is the thought that has gone into the development of the characters, and background of the story. With the originals, CGI was still growing in popularity, and quite large sections of those films were spent oohing and ahing at the various mutations and asking 'what can this one do?' and there is a bit of this in that (the girl with the bug wings stands out), but it doesn't take centre stage as with those previous efforts, to the benefit of the film overall. Being set amidst the backdrop of the Cuban Missile Crisis, there's a nice political subtext when unraveling the motivations and backgrounds of the two leads, and that context gives a lot more weight to the story than with the first three films and the Wolverine origins stories, which seemed to exist in bubble-like isolation from the real world at times.So a strong 7, I look forward to seeing the next installment if it's anything like this one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Excellent, good writing, acting and visuals","Was waiting to see this movie, and it turned out to be good.The story was nicely connected the true events of the Cuban missile crisis with the X-Men characters.Michael Fassbender played Magneto very well, James McAvoy also performed the character of Charles Xavier exactly as I expected him to be.The other actors also all did a good job, the action scenes were good.My only little complaint is Jennifer Lawrence who is a good actor and a good looking woman but in my opinion was not the right actor to portray Mystique.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Superpowers of the Literal Kind In Strangelove's War Room,"The most persuasive acting in Bryan Singer's classy revenge on Fox is by JFK, who in his 1962 message to the nation conveys thanks for the triumphant end of the Cuban Missile Crisis while stifling what he certainly must know, that American and Soviet missiles spent a lot of time soaring back and forth while telepathically manipulated by the remarkable powers of mutants. The movie's use of the missile crisis definitely performs the function of founding this prequel in the early 1960s and fulfills the doubt of whether or not reality intersects with the chronicles of superheroes.Mainly owing to the manner of young-at-heart, Brit-grit oomph director Matthew Vaughn sopped up from his roots in Guy Ritchie's super-slick capers, the movie is state-of-the-art and features a few good performances from a few actors whose abilities could've elevated this overreaching artistic cross-promotion, with plenty of action and racket as it renders the genesis of the X-Men, a troupe of roughly a dozen mutants, hitherto. It opens in a Nazi concentration camp, where young Erik Lehnsherr is made to behold a heartbreaking act of cruelty and discovers he can manipulate metals with his mind, but just when he's enraged. He grows up to be Magneto and is played by Michael Fassbender, the sinewy Irish actor who the rumor mill says will become a big star after this movie. For god's sake. He is already truly first-class. But he only becomes well-known after playing Magneto? Moreover, Raven is played by Jennifer Lawrence, recently nominated for a Best Actress Oscar. Now she's a blue shape-shifter with scales. The cost of prominence. Why is she great in Winter's Bone and yet so boring here? At Oxford, we meet James McAvoy's telepath Charles Xavier as a young man, not yet a paraplegic. He'll ultimately oversee a school to protect and educate mutants, and he dreams they can relieve the world. His nemesis is Kevin Bacon's Sebastian Shaw, Magneto's merciless oppressor in the Nazi camp.Other mutants are assembled into one fold or the other. Each one has a specialty. There's your shape-shifter, a hurricane-hurler, a screamer, a fire-shooter, a swift acclimatizer, named Darwin, sure enough, etc. That each would cultivate a distinctive capability through concurrent transformation is a toll of the intelligent design of Stan Lee and his Marvel Comics gang. Nevertheless, it must be limiting to just have one stunt. You need to move with a clique to deal with all given aspects of a given situation.The plot entails efforts by Rose Byrne's CIA agent Moira McTaggert to exploit Xavier to fight Shaw, who poses a menace to world peace. Precisely how the CIA came across the mutants is a bit vague. Certainly the agency exists basically as an expediency for the script, and the basis for Moira, who appears to really like Xavier, and as a telepath, he should know.In any case, the fate of the good and evil mutants cross with the Missile Crisis, which was not entirely as we generally understand it. The scene where the mutants stand on a beach and telepathically spar by causing both American and Soviet missiles to ferry back and forth in the sky is, well, amusing, I was going to say, but no, I should view this scene more seriously.X-Men: First Class is fit weekend distraction that will soon be outdone in the collective fan conscious by the next one and the one after that. It's not a great comic book picture, like The Dark Knight, or a bad one, like RED. It's not in 3-D, which is a clemency. The cast all represents their roles credibly, if not very enthusiastically, and the effects worthily handle those rockets switching directions like characters in Scooby-Do being chased through one door and out another. The combat sequences feature people having awful things happen to them in rather unintelligible ways, but they also make an interesting consistency for Raven the boring shape-shifter.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Surprisingly 2 Dimensional for Live Action Film,"The movie follows the development of a not so unlikely friendship between a young Charles Xavier (soon to be Professor X) and Eric Lensherr (Magneto). Though the story successfully ties in critical world events of the past, which serve to date the piece and connect with audiences, I found the film lacked a certain depth expected of a Hollywood production. Certain still camera shots, the noticeable lack of extra's and dialogue that seemed far too convenient at times made this installment of the X-Men franchise appear more like the traditional 2-D cartoon than a live action film. This from a Marvel super-hero fan: I grew up reading the books. Hollywood's cutting corners yet ticket prices are going up. Decent film. Wait for Digital Download / Blu-Ray / DVD.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Vaughn's got the formula,"I'll preface this by being completely blunt. After watching the last X- Men, Rattner's bastard child, I was skeptic about another potential waste of my time.However, what made X-Men: The Last Stand mediocre made First Class splendid. First we have the cast. Halle Berry and Hugh Jackman are both questionable actors. Add Famke Jansen and Ana Paquin and you're heading for disaster. Which is what The Last Stand was. Even Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart couldn't save it, surrounded as they were.Fast forward to First Class and the quality already begins with the choice of director. It was inevitable that the man that brought us Layer Cake (and then showed his hand in the super-hero milieu with Kick-Ass) could somehow pull a decent X-Men movie off. No easy feat considering our expectations after what we'd seen before.The fresh set of actors selected for First Class was its crowning achievement. Fassbender and McAvoy are sublime together. Bacon's chemistry with Magneto is dynamite. Another phenomenon was present: even seemingly redundant (in their secondariness) roles were played by solid actors (such as the American and Russian ship commanders, and their politician counterparts).January Jones' good looks were put to their proper use, even if there was no palpable difference between her character Emma Frost and Cadence Flaherty, and Byrne showed heretofore unseen ability, if a little tame in comparison with the others present. Nicholas Hoult, after playing such a different person in Skins, was a pleasant surprise.First Class is another of Vaughn's marvelous brand of superhero movies. What we'd already seen in Kick-Ass we see here: the acting is so believable, and the story so carefully and craftily woven, that the end- result is more than just popcorn entertainment.You can usually tell how good a movie is when its length imposes no boundaries on your viewing of it. Well, First Class's 2 hours passed by in 5 minutes. There wasn't a single frame too many of cheese, the strings played in the right moments, and it seamlessly integrated first- rate action with an engaging plot.This is what movie-making is all about. Other directors should learn from Mr. Vaughn. He is an exquisite picture-maker. Hats off to you sir! 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A great production with some rough corners.,"Before I went into cinema for X-Men:First Class, a few media reviews really had cranked up my expectations. So, let's be honest, and say that this movie was so close to meet my expectations.The filmmakers did a fantastic job knitting up everything in the first act, made it very character-driven. Nothing in the first 40 minutes makes you feel half-cooked because neither Charles' nerd personality nor Eric's washed-up revenger aura ever feels old. The whole movie basically feeds you with a great sense of retrospective spy movie. The same approach was at its peak in another superhero marvel--The Incredibles. It works fantastic if you factor in the fact that X-men:First Class is not a cartoon. There are action sequences set throughout the movie deliberately minimizing the use of CGI, which added significant believability to the film.The 2nd act, which to my surprise, didn't really slow down for character-building. The movie is fantastic in bringing actions and characters to a balance, which worked just like the first two X-men films.I was ready to be bombarded by the massive amount of CGI in the climax of the film, which if not for the restraining, smart usage of special effects during the first half, would not be so obviously artificial. That issue, along with my hectic expectations for the drama between Charles and Eric did make the climax of the film a bit, uh, unsatisfying. I was really thinking about if they can wrap up everything until Charles said half-mockingly, ""I'd soon be bald.""The new Mystique, played by beautiful Jennifer Lawrence, was at the heart of the whole drama side of this action film. Mystique's character building was maybe the best compared to the main guys, Charles and Eric. Mystique's struggles of identity crisis, despite its cartooned roots in X-Men universe, is heartfelt. It's especially true to those living in a multi-ethnic environment. Mystique was so outstanding that both Charles and Eric had left something to be desired, in my opinion. Charles and Eric on the other hand, felt like they were already in their full-blown form. It's kind of hard not to factor in my own interpretations and assumptions when I tried to appreciate their development.At last, the movie is complemented with a great score. 8/10. Way to go, X-Men. If you like to hear about my interpretation about Charles, please feel free to read on.So, here's my interpretation about Charles's development in First Class. Charles was born in the upper class of his world, which formed his view of the world and mindset in a mainstream way. His mind-reading abilities allowed him to walk in the rains of social life without getting wet, which formed his illusion of being the mighty leader/father figure of mutants. If not for Magneto, he'd probably never feel the pain of belittled, incompetent, and incomplete. His disability to walk, along with the loss of his sister, aka Mystique, humbled him and sent him on the way to be closer to the a father figure/authentic peacemaker. Alas for Charles, no matter how many times he had read Mystique's mind, there were actually more delicate matters than he could fathom that was going on in her. Don't we, the self-respected intellectuals often do the same with our families? We sometimes feel like what's truly important is only arm's length away, yet in our frustration we turn to pervert or twist it. If that's the case for you, then may God help us as he helped Professor X.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A First Class Movie,"Despite the success of the original X-Men movie trilogy (2000-2006), based on the failure of X-Men Origins: Wolverine, the new X-Men movie, X-Men: First Class, which arrived in theaters Friday, had most comic book-turned-movie fans uneasy. Furthermore, the mediocrity of the first Fantastic Four movie, Thor, and Superman Returns, make the creation of a successful superhero coming-of-age/beginnings film seem impossible.However, the 132 minute X-Men: First Class proves that super hero movies are far from finished. Boasting spectacular acting performances by James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender and Jennifer Lawrence, an incredible script, and stunning visuals, this movie is one of the first must-see movies of the 2011 summer.X-Men: First Class also manages to succeed where the other aforementioned comic book movies failed – it is action-packed and thrilling. The movie is reminiscent of the sensational 2008 superhero movie, The Dark Knight in its fast-paced yet digestible storyline – X- Men: First Class brilliantly traces each characters physical, emotional, and mental development in the movie, while simultaneously showing the viewer each characters motivation, past, and, to an extent, future. These moments of development play pivotal roles in the film, but they are integrated into the main action of the plot, so the movie doesn't have the now common feelings of slowness and transition associated with character development.Moreover, the movie is strong enough to stand alone – meaning that the viewer doesn't need to have seen the previous X-Men movies to understand and enjoy this one. However, the director, Matthew Vaughn, makes sure to drop plenty of subtle jokes (including a brilliant cameo from one of the actors in the earlier movies) to keep the more intimate fans satisfied. The movie doesn't stay as true to the comic books as many of the more obsessed fans would like to see, and to that, I simply say, stop going to the movies to watch books. If you want to see something that closely follows the original plot line, curl up at home, alone, in bed, with your snuggie and apple juice, and read your precious comic books.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
X-Men: First Class absorbs the heroic energy of its predecessors and outputs much needed youthful power.,"The Cuban Missile Crisis. A sociopolitical confrontation between the United States and Soviet Union having uncovered the latter's strategic tactic to deploy ballistic missiles in Cuba. What was supposedly an act of war between the biggest power nations on the globe, had in fact been initiated by genetically mutated individuals. Specifically Sebastian Shaw and his Hellfire Club, possessing the ability to absorb energy and transform its kinetic flow into raw strength. Humanity fear the mutants for their range of inexplicable abilities, outcasted by society. And thus, decimating the already existing stage of evolution through potential World War III will soon make room for a superior race of mutants and propel Shaw's exclusivist perspective.A decade had swiftly passed since the initial release of X-Men, its fanbase and quality diminishing upon the release of latter sequels and spin-offs (poor Deadpool...). Franchise producer Kinberg suggested a loose adaptation of X-Men: First Class, and so Vaughn was employed to resurrect a rapidly declining series. How? By starting afresh. A prequel to the X-Men film universe. Establishing the discovery of mutants, the origins of both Professor X and Magneto, the conception of cringeworthy team names and, most importantly, how the X-Men themselves formed. From its promisingly dramatic introduction of Erik, as he becomes embroiled in grief and rage in the confinement of a Nazi concentration camp, to the altruistic intervention of the October Crisis of '62. Vaughn, alongside three other screenplay writers, managed to balance the general entertainment of superhero shenanigans with personable origins stories that held narrative gravitas, not seen since the exquisite sequel 'X2'.The sole reason why First Class works as a prequel, is due to its foreshadowed acknowledgement of future relationships within the mutant community. Commencing the feature with Charles and Raven suddenly befriending each other, although unexplained, serves as lucid breadcrumbs for their eventual disintegration, as shown in prior entries, allowing viewers to become invested in each origin tale. Same with Erik's tantalising partnership with Charles. Everyone and their dog knows of their morally differing rivalry, however divulging into the events that initiated that contention allows audiences to experience complete different characters and how they developed over time. Charles in particular, a polite yet ego-fuelled telepathic, soon adopts the patriarchal figure for all things mutant that fans have known since the first film release. And that's exactly why First Class works. It's not just the extravagance of young mutants learning to harness their powers, from Havok's energy blasts to Banshee's ultrasonic screams. It's the tantalising origins of Magneto and Professor X. They singlehandedly give this prequel life, whilst never losing vision of the multilayered story that is to follow. Every notion, motive and emotional complexity interlock with each other to create a precious seed that has the opportunity to grow with its characters. McAvoy and Fassbender, undoubtedly, slaughter the entire competition. Their dynamic chemistry, ambitious acting abilities and sensational emotional connection truly rejuvenated the franchise. Bacon a close third, portraying a suave morally righteous antagonist with ornate bravura.Unfortunately the female characters were somewhat lacking in intensity, turning First Class into a masculine showdown. Byrne's MacTaggart emphasising that notion by portraying the ""woman in a man's world"" archetype. Her, much like Mystique, Frost and Angel, seemed to have utilised their sex appeal far too often in the attire and abilities they reside in. Mystique especially, whom is a complex character, underplayed by Lawrence who was swallowed up by her male counterparts. A shame really. Various mutants, and there are plenty, were presented as tools instead of legitimate characters. Banshee, Riptide and Azazel in particular. A chance to showcase the visual effects that had been succinctly integrated. Darwin was adapted incorrectly, considering his theoretical invulnerability in ""adapting to survive"", and regrettably a wasted mutant within the film franchise.Still, accompanied by Jackman's charged score and instantly epic theme tune, Vaughn's First Class manages to resurrect the X-Men that had since been buried on more than one occasion. Its broad scope and blockbusting visuals, condensed into an origin tale of two opposing ideologies that would exquisitely mould the themes of mutant supremacy and equality for future instalments. Despite the occasional clumsy plotting, it manages to be both entertaining and narratively complex, which is substantial enough to reinvigorate everyone's thirst for mutant heroics once more.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The x-men spy movie I needed,"We´ve been watching a lot of X-men here in the household lately and I am a huge X-men fan no doubt. A team I find so great and fascinating with nearly endless potential. New Mutants (2020) was a blast and I can only say the show X-men 97 (2024) is an absolute blast you should go watch right now. As of writing I am going to watch Deadpool & Wolverine (2024) so a lot of X-men. We agreed to watch First Class again and man is this movie just straight good.The movie has never spoken to me more than that though, it's a straight good movie that never overstays it´s welcome and just feel like a straight edge movie, nothing more nothing less. You will be treated to a just fun comic book movie with a great acting, cinematherapy and a fun cast in a spy thriller, what´s not to like.In a world where mutants, people with superpowers, are not yet fully known, Charles Xavier and Erik Lehnsherr both has to help the American government against a plot set up by an evil mutant to start world war 3.First thing my fiancé made me realise is the great score this movie has. It has some really great moments and using an electric guitar is not really the instrument you often associate with high movie score art, but this movie handles it very well.While this is of course a superhero movie first and foremost with a really golden age plot to save the world from war involving Russians and such, this is just also a good war and spy thriller movie with the occasional drama. The movie balances the different genres and elements so well and it seems seamless in the way it´s portraited. It´s clearly a competent writing team knowing exactly what to do with a plot like this.This is also defiantly seen via the characters. This movie understands the moral dilemmas of Erik and Charles so well and understands why they can never really unite later but always will try to. They are both sides of the same coin (this makes sense in the movie context too) and choosing where to stand on mutant issues are handled and disused well here by both characters. This is also done to absolute perfection by James McAvoy as Charles and Micheal Fassbender as Erik giving both absolute powerhouse performances in this movie. Same with Kevin Bacon as a villain role really given it his all as always. I think even the mutant powers and the wish to control them and evolve is portrayed perfectly. This is clearly a writing and directing team really understanding the characters and their powers, making them so well utilized. While some of the characters decently needed more time to shine, they are still here in a good way. Not all acting is perfect though, and there is some dialogue here, reminding us we are watching X-men that was just so cringe to me. It didn't work for me and this movie should take itself more seriously as its own identity than making dumb references we all already know if we know two scents about X-men.All this leads to a quick and easy watch that never overstays it´s welcome, it knows what it wants to do and tell and that's it. While I wished the movie lasted a bit longer to give all the characters just that little more so we can push the emotions a bit more, it´s still highly enjoyable. The Erik and Charles scene is a highlight and I wished more characters had these moments. Even the Hank Raven storyline is good and the overall idea of physical mutation vs hidden mutations creates a great dilemma for some of these characters. Now some of the Charles behaviour doesn't quite fit the character I have in my head a 100%, but I think this can be explained away by saying this is a younger less experienced Charles, working with his first batch of X-men, baby steps.The effects are swinging all over the place here. Some are good and works in the context, other are really bad and distracting. I was never taken completely out of the movie because it engaged me so much, but things like the submarine, Beasts make-up and Shwas powers contra Ravens make-up makes this movie so swinging in its effects quality.Can I praise a movie for not being afraid to use the language characters are supposed to? German, French, Russian all here and of course characters should speak the language that finds them natural and just have a heavy accent. Although I wished the final scene was in German in other to make it hit more poetic but that´s a minor nitpick.There is also some weird editing in the middle of this movie during a montage. This movie is gloriously shot and masterful in its cinematography and that´s why I was so confused this, to me, poor editing all of a sudden was here. But this is a powerhouse performance in camera use. So many well-made frames and reveals, again , really understanding characters and spacing. I expected nothing less from Matthew Vaugn, a man that has proven his mastery if action, cinematography and special awareness and a huge applause to John Matieson, the cinematographer for making this movie look great. From the bar scene, to the reveal in the office, these are so affective scenes in this movie and there are a lot of thoseI thought I would have less to say about this movie because I find it so find, but this movie I doing a lot of things right and just creates this enjoyable movie from start to finish with a lot of standout moments and elements to really shout out. While I still don´t think this movie wows me, it´s still this great movie that you can always watch because of how compact and competent it is.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
They don't call it first class for nothing!!!!,"Another good X-men film, guys! I have to tell you, I saw this almost a week after its release and I thought ''the theater will be empty''. I was freaking wrong. Every one was there for this film, turns out X-men are pretty popular in my country too.When I first learned that this movie was in the works, I felt somehow disappointed. I hated ''X-men Origins: Wolverine'' and I always used to say ''why can't they just leave us with the original trilogy?''. I really liked the first three (X-3 was a bit of a let-down). But when I saw the movie I changed my mind. It was one of the best comic book movies I've ever seen!The casting was very good and the script is well written and it gives us a chance to see our beloved characters (Professor X & Magneto) back when they were young, friends and how/why they became adversaries. The CGI is incredible -might I say it's better than Thor's a bit- and the music very intense. But the best thing was the direction. Matheww Vaughn was better than I would have hoped, with incredible shots, characters' depth and a perfect tone for the film. It's not as dark as ''The Dark Knight'' but it wasn't as comedic as ''Fantastic Four''.The thing I enjoyed more was the characters they chose for the story. Every single mutant plays a pivotal role in the film. There is only a few things I didn't like. Magneto's uniform when he departs the team ( Ian McKellen's was better by far) and I expected Magneto and Professor X to be friends since 17-18 years old. This doesn't happen in this film. They meet each other far later. But their relationship is explored in very good way.To sum it up, either you are a comic book fan or not, you must go and see this movie. It's clever, it's entertaining and with a nice climax. It's worth it. You 're even gonna enjoy the little cameos they've put in there for comic geeks.....Go see it my friends...",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Excellent script!! good movie which brings about the origins really well!!!,"There was no better way to bring about the evolution of each character in X Men.. Credit goes to James and Michael (aka Charles/Erik).. these two are really a driving force for the entire movie. Besides this Kevin as Shaw, Rose as the Cia agent and Raven as Mystique were splendid.. one thing that stands out in this movie is the way they actually brought about the birth of each character and you can then relate it to the X men sequels seen in the past.. the first half of the movie is character heavy and focuses more on the script. You are then geared up for the action in the second half...yes i was hoping for a lot more action and fight sequences but that nevertheless it did not change my views about the film. Overall i feel the film deserves a 7 or 7.5.. but please don't walk in the cinema expecting the film to be a classic or a blockbuster and you will enjoy the film better!!!!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An Excellent Must-Watch Prequel to the X-Men Saga,"Another Marvel X-Men film, another excellent summer blockbuster! Of all the characters in the Marvel universe, I find the X-Men to be the most interesting of all. This story which explores the beginnings of not just one, but the two most powerful senior X-Men can certainly do no wrong.At first, I was worried about this film being a teenage movie with a lot of teenage angst going on. Wrong. This film is a very mature treatment of the close friendship that developed between the brainy privileged Charles Xavier and the troubled angry Erik Lensherr, and how they forged the beginning of the mutant organization on Earth. We are brought into the Cold War and the Cuban missile crisis as the historical backdrop of this story. The main antagonist is the mad and greedy Dr. Sebastian Shaw who also has his own army of mutants.The acting of the cast was also faultless, led by James McAvoy (as Charles) and Michael Fassbender (as Erik). As can be predicted, the turn of Erik to the Dark Side was the more intense character arc, but the Charles angle was not left weak. There was a touching subplot featuring Raven (Mystique) and Hank (Beast) about mutant appearances, which actors Jennifer Lawrence and Nicholas Hoult also portrayed very well. Veteran Kevin Bacon does his slimy best as maniacal Dr. Shaw, with the help of the sexy January Jones as the icy Emma Frost.This type of movie, being a prequel, is the type where the beginning and middle are more interesting than the end, which we already know what happens beforehand. I loved how they tied everything up very neatly in the details about each character we all know very well. Director Matthew Vaughn navigates the main story and its subplots into one coherent, entertaining and exciting whole. Bryan Singer, director of the first two (and best two) X-Men movies, is also on board here as one of the writing team. Awesome special effects complete this overall excellent package. A must watch, most certainly!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A passable comic book flick,"As comic book reboot movies go, this is pretty good. It's got a really good cast, particularly Fassbender and McAvoy, and a nice sleek retro look. Kevin Bacon makes a great villain. But ... we're really looking at a movie that's about 75% uninteresting filler characters and keeps revisiting themes that the previous trilogy kinda drove into the ground. It does it's job, but it really isn't memorable.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Good Prequel,"We see a general trend that all sequels or prequels keeps going down in quality as their number increases. But, a very few come out with flying colors such as this one. Considering the fact that, 4 X-Men movies have been made before it this was a gem. It had a good story, great character development, some old characters to relate to, good visual effects and a nice ending. And yes, it also answered some questions which fans had in the other films like the story behind the friendship between Prof. X and Magneto. Some people might complain about some continuity errors with the next films (as the character Emma Frost). But, those can be ignored to enjoy the movie to the fullest.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good.  Well worth seeing,"Good. Well worth seeing.It's a reboot, so some of the character back stories may not make complete sense to anyone who knows the original history. Set in 1963 the film centres around the meeting of Charles Xavier (Professor X) and Eric Lensherr (Magneto) and the founding of Xavier's school for the gifted.Eric's personal back story is given as flashback, and will seem remarkably familiar to anyone who's seen the previous X-films. Charles's story is somewhat different to what we've seen previously.XM:FC explores the usual territory of difference and prejudice, but this time devotes a good proportion of the first third of the film to some good old fashioned, bond-like action.The middle portion, as would be expected develops some of the other characters - this part drags a bit, but then again I'm probably not the target audience, not being a teenager.The final third ratchets up the action and dramatic tension, if not quite as convincingly as the beginning.I had some concerns about slight overplaying by the three main stars - Magneto twisting the air as if he had a Nazi's throat in his hands, and Prof-X touching his temple as if he was a circus mind reader. But I'll forgive them both some slight overacting, they didn't take it too far. Kevin Bacon on the other hand, took the 'big acting' a couple of steps further, but it seemed to suit his style and the evil ego-maniac character he played.The kids all played their parts moderately well.Overall, quite well done. As good as, may be better, than the first two X-films, and definitely better than the poor third on. The main praise should go to Matthew Vaughn, Jane Goldman and Bryan singer for a good action film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The young X-Men crew,"I didn't get much out of it first time, but it did have a fairly decent backstory with Xavier and Erik. The other mutants and their younger versions of themselves did give a pretty good kick to this film. It's swell ending stole much of the show. I found one or two of the mutant's powers a bit underrated and cheesy, like Bashee's scream ability. While I may have first thought that the actor choice for each of the main characters were a bit off, their talent and their character personality acts were more well done if anything. Pretty decent installment overall involving how the X-men name came to be.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
WHAT is with all these good reviews???,"Seriously. Where are all the good reviews coming from? Yeah it was cool to see Xavier and Magneto as young people. Yeah the Cold War storyline was interesting and had a ton of potential. Unfortunately, that potential was utterly squandered in an absolute mess of sloppy filmmaking.Rather than write a long-winded, critical essay, I'll just make a list of the awfulness:1. Plot holes big enough to drive an aircraft carrier though. So Xavier has equipment that allows him to find mutants all over the country. And he finds a group of dumb, undisciplined kids with powers of varying uselessness. Dragonfly-stripper-girl? Really?2. Absolutely useless and insulting cameo by Wolverine. In the horrible montage in which Xavier and Magneto go out searching for the useless mutants, they come across Wolverine sitting at a bar, who tells them to 'f*ck off' before they can get two words out, at which point they just turn right around and walk out. You'd think that they'd at least TRY to convince the one mutant on their list who has extensive military training and sharply-honed instincts to join them. And since Xavier has these telepathic abilities, he'd know that Wolverine is also involved with another secret military operation, a fact which juuuuuust might be of some use to him as he builds his team and looks for resources.3. They fly around in a modified SR-71 with a big internal passenger bay and the ability to hover. Really? I know they're going for a period vibe, but they couldn't come up with something original instead of insulting our intelligence by using a famous aircraft design and bastardizing it in the most ridiculous way possible?4. Horrible CGI effects. Seriously, were the CGI guys from Babylon 5 the only ones available?5. Kevin Bacon. As a Nazi war doctor. Need I say more?6. Completely implausible and insulting reasons for Magneto and Mystique to flip on Xavier. Especially Mystique.7. The fight between the mutants is probably the worst combat scene ever put on film. Literally.8. Did I mention Kevin Bacon? Yeah, because he and January Jones also start the Cuban Missile Crisis.9. 1950's period setting is completely phony and feels totally tacked on.There's probably a lot more, but this is just what leaps to mind immediately. It was really THAT bad. I'm giving it four stars because the director managed to keep the boom microphones out of all the shots, and the camera upright. Also January Jones has a spectacular rack and the chick that played Mystique was cute as well.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"""Best of all x-men films.""","Why I have considered this one as the best of all the X-men films, is that the story was the best among all. Other films were concentrated on the conflicts between, the two gangs but this one developed emotions and friendship properly. The franchise has rebooted the series with a prequel. The story is about the early lives of Professor X and Magneto. I must say that Michael fassbender as magneto has looked very authentic. In fact the entire cast has done a wonderful job as far as the acting is considered. The feeling to see magneto and professor X working together was awesome. They would have made an awesome team. The differences were genuine and to me both looked right in their own places. It is full of action.PROS:Raising some thought provoking questions; the film is a piece to watch at least once. If the human race is going to meet some of these mutants in reality than obviously, normal people would fear from them. They have powers with which they are lifting submarines from the sea. How could humans feel safe living with them? This is an important question because humans cannot consider them equal to them and live peacefully. It is imperative that man is an animal in all ways and these mutated people will someday lose sanity and start doing weird things. There is no way of convincing humans that we will be safe forever. On the other sides if we see it from the point of mutants, they are also not wrong in thinking that humans will try to destroy them someday. Professor X plays the role of a saint in this. But it is nearly impossible for him to control everything. I am with Humans on the subject.The visuals are satisfactory and the film is not crowded with them unnecessarily. The story is the backbone of the film. You'll eventually want for more. The cinematography is good especially in the end and all fights. The new characters had proper time based on their capabilities. The film has done true justice to its purpose of introducing the two major characters of the franchise.CONS:The film in the second half seemed to rush a lot. The training and everything was going so fast that it looked to be a race to complete the film. 20 more minutes wouldn't have been a bad idea.MESSAGE: ""Everyone needs friends.""VERDICT: ""A recommended watch.""",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Can January Jones act?  Not judging by her performance in THIS movie.,"The movie was good fun and obviously aimed at X-Men fans. BUT. January Jones is absolutely dreadful. It isn't a difficult role. Any BAYWATCH actress could have done a better job. Yes, she is THAT bad. Dull, flat, without any nuance or charm. Really distractingly awful. Is she any good on Mad Men?Kevin Bacon is wonderful as always and James McAvoy steals every scene he is in. He is the real deal. But I guess there wasn't enough money in the budget for the CGI and to hire good actors for the supporting roles, because most of the rest of the cast was not quite Gossip Girl quality. Compared to Halle Berry, Ellen Page, Danny Huston and others from the previous installments, the cast was very low caliber and it showed.One other complaint. If you want to make multiple movies with one mythology/story, be consistent with your events. Things happen in this movie that belie events in the other X-Men movies.

First Class is right,"I will be honest and say that I haven't fully watched the X-Men trilogy, but this prequel made me want to watch all the movies. I guess I know what I'm going to be doing in the next couple of weeks.I know that this movie is part of a bigger franchise, but this was a GREAT film on its own. Although, it will leave you wanting more. I know I'm dying for another movie. In ""X-Men: First Class"", I don't think there was ever a dull scene. I remember being interested in it all the way. I never felt my attention waver or feel a yawn coming up.Aside from the kick-ass action, this movie had its own share of good humor that doesn't fail. The audience must have laughed out loud together, at least three times. I also especially liked the emotions that were being portrayed to the audience. I could care less about Raven's love life, but I really did love the bromance that Charles and Erik shared.I don't have any other X-Men movies to compare this one to (aside from the spin-off ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine""), so this may either be a hit or miss with die-hard X-Men fans.

It's hard to say who stole the show (Michael Fassbender) because all of the major performances were so well done.The relationship between Magneto & Charles is the reason I enjoyed the first X-Men so much, and I loved seeing this from the beginning.

Simply awesome. The best in series or a fantastic reboot?!,"""X2"" was up until this one the greatest. I am not sure if ""The First Class"" is a reboot or not, but it sure better be. James McAvoy as Xavier and Michael Fassbender as Magneto are both a delight to see. Also their scope is far above that of the ones in the previous X movies. Yes, Ian McKellen was magnificent as Magneto as well, very intimidating too. Yet Patrick Stewart as Charles Xavier were actually pretty weak (because he's more of a TV actor mostly and it shows), not to mention every bit of his acting was screaming ""Picard!"" at you. As the rivaling duo they just didn't work well, because of Jean-Luc, I mean Patrick... McAvoy- Fassbender interplay is far better, thusly.There were significantly less characters this time around, but all of them were a lot better developed and used appropriately, as much in action scenes as in social ones. When will Hollywood learn that less is actually more when it comes to most things, especially movies where every minute counts for something? Take notes, you amateurs of Hollywood, praised or otherwise, this is how you do it right. Matthew Vaughn (first ""Kick-Ass"", now this) is from now on in my top three favorite directors, alongside Edgar Wright (I know I riffed on ""Scott Pilgrim"", but it was due to a bad company I had whilst watching it, loved it after rewatching, still think the Zelda references were stupid though) and Chris Nolan (""Memento"", ""Dark Knight"", ""Inception"", need I say more?).I have a minor critique though. I spotted a tiny hole in a dialogue script: Erik said he thought he was alone in his powers, yet he witnessed Emma Frost in her full glory a few scenes before. I might spot some more if I watch one more time, but surely it's just a tiny remark, not even worth mentioning that much. The biggest complaint I have is that the final battle with Sebastian Shaw, which was a pretty cool and devious villain in my opinion (played by the terrific Kevin Bacon), was very anticlimactic (but not the ending to the whole movie). Surely a great mutant villain with such a cool power as Shaw should have been entitled for more.As for the rest of this film. Watch it, watch it in a theater. With all the garbage Hollywood is spewing lately this one definitely stands out.

"Yeah, pretty good actually","I'm not the biggest X-men fan. I never read the comics, so my knowledge of the story only comes from the films. If you look online you'll see plenty of fanboys crying because some of the dates in this prequel don't add up in the original trilogy.That's probably true, but I didn't notice. I thought, for a prequel - which, let's face it, is just an excuse to milk a few extra quid out of the franchise's audience - it was actually okay. It did a good job of showing us a backstory that we didn't know, i.e. how Professor X and Magneto went from friends to enemies (George Lucas could take note as to how to write prequels!). Everything seemed to fit together well and tie up all the loose ends. Plus there wasn't too much pointless action and the special effects seemed just right (although I just watched Transformers 3, so I'm all CGIed out right now!). It felt more like a spy film with super powers.All in all, good fun.

First Class Indeed !!,"This fifth installment of the X Men series is by far the best of the bunch. Building on the saga that director Bryan Singer started, this is made on a much bigger budget of $160M compared to that of $70M for the first X Men movie.The story picks up where the first X Men saga started, in the Polish concentration camp run by the Nazis where young Magnito (Bill Milner) started to show his unusual power. A mutant version of Dr. Mengele, Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) wants to pick on young Magnito's talent, and in the process murders his mother. Some years later in the early '60s, Eric/Magnito (Michael Fassbender), now a grown young man, wants his revenge on Shaw, and is on his trail. In the mean time, young Charles Xavier (Laurence Belcher), finds kindred spirit with also very young Mystique (Morgan Lily). They grow up together in Xavier's home all the way up 'till Xavier graduates from Oxford with a doctorate degree. They team up with mutant genius Hank McCoy/Beast (Nicholas Hoult) who invents Celebro to locate other mutants. Soon the first batch of X Men is formed (Not the same crew the first X Men were in the comic book series) which includes Magnito, and Banshee who will later become their enemies. By this time, CIA has been introduced to the existence of the mutants, and starts to show their interest. One of the interested party is colonel Stryker. Magnito, still out for his revenge, involves Xavier and other X Men on the battle against Shaw.This is the most polished in terms of production out of all X Men movie series. The screen writers did an excellent job of integrating the origins of X Men saga without hiring back the original actors of the series. Although it's a prequel to the first X Men movie, the movie has freshness that makes it stand alone as an original chapter in the X Men's saga. While other producers continue to trash the Marvel franchise, this series is amazingly consistent in their quality with producer Bryan Singer, and other talented writers, and directors holding the quality together.I loved the plot, and the character development of each of the X Men the way it was shown on this movie. It's an original story, but one that I'm sure will make Stan Lee, and Jack Kirby proud.There were some period piece screw ups in the props like seeing Revox A77 recorder which is a product of the early '70s, and Bose 901 series III speakers which are the product of the early '80s. Fashion, and the buildings were of much more modern vintage than the early '60s when this story is supposed to be taking place. But overall, they didn't mess up the mood of the story too badly.This was a first class production, and even if it wasn't a spectacular hit at the box office, merits a sequel done by the same team of creators.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Glad I gave it a chance.,"I just watched this movie, quite a while after it's release. A friend who I thought was fairly intelligent told me not to bother. He said it was the worst X-Men film yet. I didn't bother, I didn't watch it. But recently my curiosity got the best of me. This was a really solid prequel-reboot of a series that was on a serious 2 movie skid. I'm glad to see all of the positive reviews. And the naysayers ALL seem to have problems with this movie's ""continuity"" with the rest of the franchise and the comic books in general. It's the same problem that my friend had with it. About halfway thru this fantastic movie it occurred to me... ""that argument doesn't have a freakin leg to stand on."" Hey comic book fanboy... yes, they take liberties with the established characters. You know who else does that with Marvel characters? Every freaking writer working for Marvel comics, that's who. House of M, Age of Apocalypse, The End, Ultimates; these titles sound familiar? Oh right, reboots and alternate versions, most made decades before any of the X-Men movies, and there are about a dozen others just like them. I think re-booting X-Men is the most authentic tribute to the comics made so far in the franchise. If that's the best criticism the naysayers can come up with... this movie didn't have much wrong with it. Now I'm off to punch a friend in the kidneys, not too hard, for making me miss this in theaters.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"well done, but really shows the limits of a 50 years old storyline","This film is the fourth movie based on Marvel's comics X-Men, and it is certainly the best episode.'First Class' is a prequel to the other 3 films, and it feels like a reboot of the storyline to clear the previous shortcomings. The obvious benefit is that this is the first X-men film which is self-contained and can be evaluated like a movie rather than the live adaptation for the comics readers. Unfortunately, this film also illustrates how thin and old the plot of the X-Men is : a basic metaphor of a world divided by the cold war, obsoleted by the complexity of more recent series like the Watchmen.The cinematography of 'First Class' looks like the typical superhero movie from Hollywood's factory lines. Surprisingly, the special effects are lagging behind, they are jumping to the eyes (the castle 3d model, the missiles, the blues skin and fur effects). The split-screen scene during the X-Men training is one of the strange cinematographic choices which really fall flat, and cut the film in a patchwork of disarticulated pieces. The film introduction is astonishingly good, but the acting is then getting immediately awful, until the end credits. Except Magneto, the characters have no sign of personality, and the 'actor studio' method seems to be unknown to the whole casting.As a conclusion, this film is one of the fist fine superhero movie ever, but it will only be reminded as a film de genre.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of the best movies this year! Much more than I expected!!,"Just watched this movie last Tuesday.I know I was sorta late as it has been on for about a month already. But i was waiting for my friend who just finished exams. Anyway, back the the point. This movie gave me so much more than i expected! I am so excited and grateful that I got the chance to see this movie in the cinema!!! To be honest, I didn't feel like to watch it straight away when I saw the trailer in the first place. Maybe its because of the actor who plays Charles. (Im not saying he is not good at all.In fact, he is AMAZING!). According to all the XMen movies i've seen so far, the main character (Wolverine) is always strong and powerful with those muscles. That brings me this impression：when we talk about XMen movies, it has to be manful with those actions in it. but apparently, the main actor in this movie is totally different, well at least James doesn't look like as that strong as Hugh Jackman. so when i saw the trailer, i was like: what? this the main the character? hmm, seems not much like what I have in my mind as usual. But James didn't disappoint me at all! He gave me another concept of XMen series. In this movie, Charles is such a gentleman and he is kind to everyone, even to the bad guys, He accepts all the mutants and has always tried to lead them to the right way. However, he is also strong inside.when he faced the coin crossing through his head (physically its Shaw's head but its Charles's mind), he didn't give away, he still held it until the very last minute. we can imagine how much pain he had to suffer at that time(both physically and emotionally),he was seeing it happening and sorta let it happen right in front of his face, and all the reason is Erik! his best friend. I think at that time, he felt not only the pain on the body, but also the pain that Erik betrayed his trust.Thanks to James, he really did a fantastic job there. Michael and James had a couple of fabulous scenes together for sure. The end of the movie is so touching and powerful. I nearly cried when i saw Charles telling Erik they do not want the same thing in tears. I was simply moved by him. Overall, I would definitely recommond this movie to anyone who likes to enjoy the real good movies (Not those only rely on 3D or technical stuff). This movie has the great story line which makes a lot of sense and both of the main actors(James and Michael) really have brought their characters alive. Love Love this movie!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Quite boring,"I am really surprised that so many people liked this movie. I found it quite boring. Maybe they thought it was a good idea to cast Kevin Bacon as a psycho ex Nazi mutant scientist but I think it was really, really a bad idea. The two leads were okay but for the most part the story was just so, so and really didn't help define the characters at all. In fact some of Erik (ultimately Magneto's) actions are inconsistent to what he should have done with all of his power. Again the character of Charles Xavier is a weakling who is way too emotional about his friends to be effective as a leader. The comic book Xavier has always been better than anything they have put on screen, small or large.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Blistering Barnacles This Movie Is Good,"It was great to watch the origin story of Professor X and Magneto. It took turns in unexpected ways. First of all, The characters and the performances are so good. It was fun to watch these mutants get together and save the world. X-Men First Class is the the type of movie you could again and again without getting bored. It is my favorite X-Men movie and I'm super excited for X-Men Days Of Future Past.

X-Men: First Class Review,"X First Class was incredible, the plot was amazing and you really understood a lot that you didn't in the original 3 X-Men movies. I admit I was both excited and very nervous about watching this film, because I had so much expectations for this movie and they want above them. James McAvoy is perfect for the role of a young Charles Xavier. I was actually impressed with every actor/actress chosen for their roles. I saw all of them as who they were supposed to be. Jennifer Lawrence also blew me away as the role of Mystique. I had never seen her act before this movie, but was glad they picked her. Words can not explain how well Michael Fassbender makes us relate to Magneto in a way that we can understand all of his actions and even want to be on his side. I just think this movie was everything good. To any X-Men fan, you must see this movie. You will thoroughly enjoy it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
10 is maximum? I'll give this one 11!!!!,"My number 1 movie this year. Nuff said.After The Dark Knight (TDK), I wonder if future superhero movies will be as good. Although not as superb as TDK, X-Men First Class is almost there.I grew up reading X-Men comics, but previous movies didn't really make me wanna buy DVDs and re-watch them again and again. Xmen and X2 were OK, but with the third movie, everything just went downhill, and I lost my hope in superhero..... until TDK appeared in 2008. Phew!The casting of Fassbender was the best decision for this movie. Although Ian McKellen did a good job in previous movies, I didn't felt much pain or agony in THAT Magneto. But in Fassbender's hands, now THIS IS MAGNETO. ""Perfection"".The rest of the casts also were good. Too bad not much screen time for Rose Byrne, I like her very much. This is HER year (Xmen First Class, Insidious & Bridesmaids).Many people felt disappointed when the adamantium claws won't appear in this movie. But trust me, Fassbender's Magneto alone is damn worth the ticket price. Errrr.... Wolverine who?My number 1 movie this year. Sorry, I had to say it again.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Great Movie....Best of the entire X-men Series (Flims),"If your not an x-men fan or haven't watched the other x-men movies then you might be a bit lost but you'll get an idea by the first 5 minuets or so.I however, watched all the x-men movies but never read any of the comics.So I'm not going to upset if it didn't follow the comics.Everything in this movie was great.Loved all of it.

Before They Were X-Men...a Welcome Focus on Character and an Arresting Turn by Fassbender,"For someone who is not an avid fan of the comic book movie genre, I think this prequel to the ""X-Men"" series is well done and doesn't require as much of a crash course as I was expecting to understand the set-up. That's because director Matthew Vaughn has chosen to focus heavily on character development rather than just elaborate special effects to make this historical 2011 fantasy adventure truly arresting. He and producer Bryan Singer were also smart to gather a first-rate cast of young actors who lend atypical gravity to the proceedings and cumulatively, they provide the narrative throughput necessary to show how the characters evolve into their more familiar older personas. Having only seen the ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" entry, I am no ""X-Men"" follower, so it was helpful to get the back stories for Magneto and Xavier in dramatically economic order.The story begins chronologically in 1944 when a young German boy named Erik Lensherr watches his parents being hauled off to Auschwitz. In a fit of fear and rage, he bends the metal gate separating him from his family, commanding the attention of scientist Dr. Klaus Schmidt, who is eager to harness young Erik's telekinetic powers. Meanwhile, at a mansion in Westchester County, New York, young telepath Charles Xavier meets homeless young shape-shifter Raven. They bond over their unique powers. Flash forward to 1962, and the grown Erik contemplates his revenge against the man who went on to ruin his life. Schmidt has since changed his name to Sebastian Shaw and heads up a secret society out to take over the world. Xavier and Raven are still together as foster siblings as he earns his doctorate in genetic research at Oxford. Ultimately, Xavier's and Lensherr's destinies become intertwined with the Cuban Missile Crisis, a pivotal opportunity for Shaw to use the full scope of his energy-absorbing mutant powers. Xavier is recruited by CIA agent Moira MacTaggert to help her agency stop Shaw. Xavier brings Lensherr to the CIA's secret ""Division X"" facility where they find and recruit mutants for training to stop Shaw.The young mutants end up dividing their loyalties, and the nonstop action ultimately culminates into Shaw's Machiavellian attempts to trigger World War III in the midst of the Soviet movement to arm Cuba with nuclear missiles. The military showdown provides the context for the separate fates of Xavier and Lensherr, which obviously leads to the formation of the X-Men as they are known in the original series. While James McAvoy (""Atonement"") is effective as Xavier, even evoking some of Patrick Stewart's erudite manner at times, the film is dominated by Michael Fassbender's (""Inglourious Basterds"") laser-sharp intensity as Xavier. A cast-against-type Kevin Bacon has a field day as Schmidt/Shaw to the point where he approaches self-parody. In a nice twist from her role as the spoiled socialite wife in ""Bridesmaids"", Rose Byrne brings a nice, no-nonsense proto-feminist sense to MacTaggert. The others, including Jennifer Lawrence (""Winter's Bone"") as Raven, acquit themselves nicely in their roles. Even if you are not a fan of the series, the movie works as matinée-level entertainment for the rest of us. The 2011 Blu-Ray contains a hefty number of extras although surprisingly no commentary track. There are twenty minutes of behind-the-scenes clips, fifteen minutes of extended and deleted scenes, an hour-plus making-of documentary, and various interactive features.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An Amateur Review of X-Men: First Class.,"First things first, this movie was stunning.Though this movie was plagued with the worst marketing ideas by FOX I have ever seen, thankfully, X-Men: First Class did not suffer the same fate of it's marketing plan. X-Men: First Class was a superhero film that didn't feel like a superhero film. With that said, it was definitely different than what one might might suspect from a ""superhero movie."" The best way I can describe how this movie was put together would be to say that this was like a spy film set in the 1960s with people whom happened to have superpowers.The acting. Honestly, in my opinion, the acting was pretty solid. I believe that the actors did a wonderful job with trying to bring the characters to life, not mention the great characterizations that flowed through the movie as the film progressed. X-Men First Class provided so many powerful scenes on various levels of emotions, the acting for this movie as a whole was exceptional and well executed, in my opinion. If you were already a fan of the X-Men, you know how easy it is to take a liking to the characters, and I feel that the film does this well.As far as the story goes, it's told wonderfully. It contains the right amount of action, intelligence, and plot development one should have expected from story writer Bryan Singer, whom directed ""X-Men"" and ""X2"" and director Matthew Vaughn whom directed ""Kick-Ass."" Another note to point out to the ""fans"" of X-Men that are sure to put this film aside is simply because of their issue with continuity in relation to the comic books. The films are respectably canon in it's own stand alone franchise, not meant to be compared to the books. The X-Men universe is a large and vast mythos consisting of over 72+ different books/series carrying the X-Men name. What I like about what Bryan Singer does with the X-Men movies, is that he transfers the characters, themes, ideas, and their purpose successfully from the X-Men universe as any adaption should be.I'd like to take a minute to think of something negative to say about this movie, but in all honestly there isn't much to complain about. If I had to pull up something to complain about, it would probably be the slight need for me to want to have seen more development for the minor characters that didn't have much focus in the film. Another thing that came to mind would be the brief training montage only because the sequence brought back memories from Ang Lee's ""Hulk."" (which is not even on the same level as ""The Incredible Hulk"" starring Edward Norton). I believe X-Men: First Class was a respectable adaption.All in all this was not only a good X-Men film but also a great film based on a comic book. It's not your typical movie, but it definitely competes with some of the other well known comic book movies such as Spider-Man 2, The Dark Night, Iron Man, and the new Thor movie. In my opinion, First Class exceeds previous comic book movies I've seen. I'd hate to spoil the movie from anyone, but X-Men First class was pretty groovy.(tl;dr movie was ballin; go see it)",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
This movie is beyond my imagination,"This is the first X-Men movie I have ever seen and to be honest, I didn't have much expectation. Additionally, I sat in row B, which was unbelievably close to the screen. In spite of the fact that my neck hurt so much after walking out of the cinema, I have had a marvellous experience with X-Men: First Class.It is amazing. Just genius. I feel so thankful that human is given the ability to imagine. And what I have seen is far beyond anything I can ever imagine in my head. I admit that apart from the Harry Potter series and Avatar, I hardly ever take any fiction movie (the kind of movie where people have super power, they come from future, they have super weapon, they come from another planet blah blah blah...) in a serious way. And this completely changed my mind.The plot, well, maybe still has some holes. But the acting is wonderful, especially the 2 lead actors. Kevin Bacon is a great great great villain. Michael Fassbender plays the role of Erik very believable. And James McAvoy (professor X)? he is simply so wonderful in every aspects. The effect is superb and the music is just incredible. This movie will surely make you WOW with its coolness.Really, the best movie of this year until now : )",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A slick origin story. Stylish and gripping.,"I guess the way to start this review is to tell you what I thought of the other films. I thought the first two films were great. Then came the dreaded downgrade in quality that was The Last Stand. I thought the Wolverine film was enjoyable, but flawed overall. This new entry is now a pleasant return to form.Rebooting the time line of the series to the days of the Cold War, the film follows the early days of the founding X-Men, Charles Xavier (Played by James McAvoy), a highly intelligent telepath, and Erik Lensherr (Played by Michael Fassbender), a man with the powerful ability to control metal. Once they meet, they form a team of others like them, those with extraordinary abilities (otherwise known as mutants). But danger starts to arise when an enemy team of mutants, led by the powerful Sebastian Shaw (Played by Kevin Bacon), begins to initiate a chain of events that would begin World War 3 unless the X-Men can stop them.First Class not only excels as an action movie, but also manages to feel fleshed out, and three dimensional, instead of feeling like a monotonous back to back action set piece. Director Matthew Vaughn and the film's powerful cast give the film an unusual heart, specifically between the complicated friendship between Xavier and Lensherr (McAvoy and Fassbender are a perfectly matched duo). But let's not forget the film's attention to other themes, such as prejudice and conformity. The narrative is not always perfect, and Fassbender has brief habits of slipping in and out of accent, but everything manages to be solid.As far as action goes, this a fun ride to sit through. Each action sequence is impeccably paced by Lee Smith (The marvelous editor of Inception), including the film's epic and enrapturing third act. There's also a stylistic attention to visual detail, whether it be the elegant production design, the well done visual effects, and fantastic makeup and sound design. Oh, and I also got a kick out of a brief cameo by Hugh Jackman.First Class is the best of the comic book summer, and I give it *** out of ****",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
At the time the best movie of the summer,"A long-time collector of comic books, my expectations were high when Bryan Singer's 'X-Men' came out. Happily, my expectations were met and I enjoyed the movie. Singer's 'X2: X-Men United' blew me away, taking superhero films to a new level. Singer then left to make the disappointing 'Superman Returns"", leaving Brett Ratner ('Rush Hour"" trilogy) to direct the extremely disappointing 'X-Men: The Last Stand', which was followed by Gavin Hood's ('Rendition') 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine'; which was also a letdown. After 10 years and 4 movies, the X-Men franchise had run its course. To usher in a new era, Bryan Singer was brought in as a producer and Matthew Vaughn ('Kick-Ass') as director of 'X-Men: First Class'. There was belief that a prequel movie was the way to go; and the script put together was first class, like it's title.'X-Men: First Class"" is the story of two boys, who become men, and the moments in their lives that defined them. Erik Lensherr (Bill Milner, Michael Fassbender), grows up in war torn, Nazi occupied Poland. Torn from his parents and then being used as a test subject due to his ability to control metal, by the diabolical Dr. Schmidt (Kevin Bacon), Erik spends much of his young adult life trying to find and get revenge on the evil Doctor. Simultaneously in Westchester, NY, Charles Xavier (Laurence Belcher/James McAvoy) discovers a girl, a shape-shifter disguised as his mother, in his kitchen searching for food. As Charles grows, along with his adopted sister, the shape-shifter named Raven, he graduates from Oxford University as an expert in Genetic Studies. The CIA, thanks to Moira Mactaggert (Rose Byrne) recruits Charles to help in capturing the terrorist organization known as the Hellfire Club; Emma Frost (January Jones), Riptide (Álex González), and Azazel (Jason Flemyng), led by Sebastian Shawn formerly Dr. Schmidt (Kevin Bacon). As the CIA and Erik converge on Shaw/Schmidt, Charles saves Erik. As their friendship grows, they are organized with putting together a team to track down the Hellfire Club. Along with scientist, and fellow mutant Hank McCoy's (Nicholas Hoult) creation Cerebro, Charles is able to locate and enlist a team of young mutants, along with Raven to help their cause. Joining them in the fight is: Angel (Zoë Kravitz), Banshee (Caleb Landry Jones), Darwin (Edi Gathegi) and Havoc (Lucas Till). Things escalate as the team must work together to not only stop Shaw and the Hellfire Club and save the world from a nuclear war but show that although they are different, they are still human.'X-Men: First Class' is about revenge, war, and prejudice. Although the movie is about super powered individuals, it's predominantly story driven. There's action, but not loud, intolerable explosions or gunshots we've grown accustomed to in summer movies. There's CGI, but it's done within the story and doesn't feel like it's overwhelming. The ensemble cast wasn't full of A-list actors, but the casting was solid and each performance was memorable. Kevin Bacon's Dr. Schmidt/Sebastian Shaw was campy, but not overdone and January Jones' Emma Frost is absolutely stunning. The relationship between Xavier and Raven was convincingly genuine. Michael Fassbender made Erik/Magneto a very conflicted character, and made the role his own. Overall, 'X-Men: First Class' graduates with the highest of honors, and a Masters degree in entertainment.Summer movie Grade: A+ (My favorite movie of the summer so far!)

The best of the X-Men Franchise,"I was very sceptical about this film, I thought all the prior X-Men movies were a bit too grounded and never quite hit the heights of an epic summer action blockbuster e.g. the Dark Knight, Spider-man 2 etc so when I first viewed the trailer for this film I thought oh great more of the same. But after seeing the second trailer I was a little more open to it, the positive reviews helped as well then I saw it and I was blown away. While not perfect it does something better than all the prior X-Men movies it delivers on every level. Whilst not as good as the Dark Knight or Richard Donner's Superman it comes darn close, I'd put it alongside Batman Begins as it has potential to be even bigger in a sequel. It has it all epic action scenes, fantastic performances and a story that flows superbly. I absolutely loved this film and cannot wait for a sequel; 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The best X-Men movie so far...,"Now, I am writing this review as a person who is not overly fan over superheroes in general and not a fan of the x-men movies as per se. Sure the first four x-men movies were entertain, even for a casual non-fan as myself, but this ""X-Men: First Class"" was a step up from the previous movies.Not being super familiar with the story and origins of the characters portrayed in ""X-Men: First Class"", then I am not sure how accurate the movie is to the comic books. But for someone who have read only a handful of the comics, then this movie proved to be rather interesting and exciting. And I do believe that you were given a fair and meaningful enough background story as to whom these mutants are and what drives them.The effects in the movie were quite cool and nice to look at. And the movie is carried by a good solid story and lots of action. Plus you have a bunch of character building going on as well, so this really worked well for the movie. But of course a movie is nothing without a good ensemble of cast. And they had managed to put together quite a good selection of people for ""X-Men: First Class"". Kevin Bacon really did a good job in portraying Sebastian Shaw, the villain of the movie. But he was not alone to carry the movie, actually I think that James McAvoy (playing Charles Xavier), Michael Fassbender (playing Magneto), Nicholas Hoult (playing Beast) and Jason Flemyng (playing Azazel) also helped the movie along quite nicely.""X-Men: First Class"" is, in my opinion, a good supplement to the X-Men movies series. And it is filled with action from start till end. And for a non-fan of X-Men, the movie provides good entertainment and also provides you with lots of background story for the X-Men universe. Which, in my case, really made me want to sit down and watch the previous X-Men movies again, just for the sheer fun of it.One thing did puzzle me though, the advanced level of technology that was available in the 1960s. Come on. It was a bit too much. That was the only thing about the movie the was a downer.Thumbs up, way up, for ""X-Men: First Class"".",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Forget Wolverine, THIS is the X-men prequel done right.","X-citing, X-travagent and X-tremely entertaining, X-men First Class explodes into theaters with a coming of age tale that digs deeper than your usual special effects laden blockbuster. Here is a rare creature, a prequel that may easily be one of the few that can hold their own against their original films. If the insipid X-men Origins Wolverine left a bad taste in the mouth, X-men First Class returns to the roots of what made the original X-men such a hit in the comic book world. Roaring adventure tales with lovable characters; epic in scope yet filled with heart and spirit.One complaint against the otherwise excellent X-Men films by Bryan Singer was that it was less of an ""X-men"" film and more like a Wolverine film guest starring the X-men. First Class corrects that mistake and delivers a true ensemble film that gives ample development to all its main characters. Ironic that for the film which perfectly captures the team dynamic and chemistry of ""X-men"", it is not based on any one particular X-men comic title, not even the similarly named series ""X-men: First Class""(the comic).The movie works purely as a prequel set largely during the 1960s Cuban missile crisis. Before becoming Magneto the master of magnetism, Erik Lensherr was a bitter mutant seeking vengeance against the Nazi officer, Sebastian Shaw, who tortured him and killed his mother. Before he was professor X, telepathic Charles Xavier was a suave, wavy haired University graduate who, along with his adopted shape shifting sister, Raven, are put to work by the CIA to track down the infamous leader of the Hellfire club who so happens to be the Sebastian Shaw Erik is seeking. A fateful turn of events brings these unlikely individuals together and the discovery of Shaw's plans of nuclear war inspires the establishment of a team of mutant agents to end this crisis. Together, Xavier, Erik and Raven recruit a team of young adult mutants, each with their own powers, quirks and insecurities about their place in the world.As the film moves along its brisk pace, the motivations, perspectives and unique personalities of each character are adequately fleshed out within a limited period of time. Themes of racism, alienation, extremist idealism and discovering one's calling in life, all themes inherent in the X-men comics and past movies, are explored. Tragic turn of events inevitably lead to questioning of one's allegiance and most courses of action that the characters take come very naturally, their reasons implied through dialogue and subtle cues . Audiences more used to explicit exposition and explanation for characters' motivations might feel that some of the characters' actions made little sense. Rest assured, it is all implied within the narrative but never feel at the forefront due to the film's pace.Already at a whopping 131 minutes, X-men First Class does feel rushed only because it tries too hard to develop all the main characters. While each of them do undergo significant changes and growth by the end, this comes at the price of underdeveloped villains and a story that hops all over the world with no sense of a time frame; one moment, This leads to some avoidable plot holes especially in the middle and later parts of the film. And on the subject of time, this movie is meant to be set in the 1960s. However, aside from some old computers and archival footage of President Kennedy, nothing else feels like it fit in that era. The look of the various locales, the way the characters speak, even the clothing have an obvious 2000s feel.Not that there is anything wrong with how the characters speak. The writers bring a snappy rhythm and youthful beat to the dialogue, enhanced many fold by the excellent performances and impeccable chemistry of the actors. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender who play Charles and Erik respectively manage to channel the nuances of the roles previously played Patrick Stewart and Ian Mckellen. As a result, their characters feel familiar for the long time fans yet fresh to newcomers to the franchise. The only black mark on the script is the mandatory romantic subplot involving Raven, Hank and Erik which felt like it was put in there as an afterthought.After two disappointing X-men movies, ""evolution leaps forward"". Compared to the other X-men films, X-men First Class out shines both X-men 3 and X-men Origins: Wolverine. One could regard this movie as almost on par with the first, delivering pure entertainment in the action but never forgetting its heart in the characters. It is easily accessible to new audiences while those who have watched the previous X-men movies will thrill at the many connections and references made. With a sequel already being planned, the X-men movie franchise is finally getting the jump start it needs.http://thexamtaroshowvault.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Way better than the  previous X-men installments,"So I just returned from the cinema, and well,I'm really pleased. The 1st thing you may notice is that this movie differs from..well..all other previous marvel movies! While these movies mostly focused on effects and action sequences and (unfortunately) less on the storyline,X men 1st class stands out both in action and storyline! There's character development, great action scenes, outstanding acting with a great supportive cast, what more can you ask!!!!!Sure when looked at things like continuity,there are many things that will bother you, but just enjoy the ride for what it is!!! Not everyone may like this movie,cause it's different and maybe quite lengthy,but overall it's definitely worth a try!For me 'X-men 1st Class' is better than the recently released THOR and as good as DC's 'The Dark Knight'.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A really great REBOOT,"First of all, this movie is a reboot, NOT a prequel, of the X-Men franchise. This means that, according to movie law, it doesn't have to be awful! Yipee!X-Men: First Class is the story of the start of X-Men. It is set during the cold war, when Charles Xavier and Eric (aka professor X and Magneto) meet.It is important to mention that this movie does not have Wolverine in. Yes, I hear you say, how can you have an X-Men film with no Wolverine? That's like cereal with no milk! (and if you eat cereal without milk, you're weird) But there is no gaping hole in the movie, as it is like no other in the franchise.The beginning is actually set during the holocaust, when Eric's powers are being discovered. Throughout the movie his anger and pain from his experiences come through in the form of a thirst for his tormentor's blood.However, Charles Xavier's pretty care free youth seems to reflect his calm attitude. It is actually a surprisingly impressive performance, as his interaction with the other characters (especially Eric) is really very convincing. His mentoring makes him seem like that really good teacher you had in school.The dialogue, I admit, is sometimes quite weak, but on the whole the script is solid. The direction is also solid, with some very tense parts (usually involving a rather angry Eric) are pretty edge-of-your-seat.On the whole, this movie is very enjoyable. It's not flawless, it's not jump-up-and- celebrate good, but I would definitely recommend it, as I really liked it.

The action was great the effects were 90% good. The comedy and tragedy were both there and delivered well.Cons The thing that lets this down is the sounds most importantly the voices in relation to their characters.

Can achieve better results (tv),"So, i have watched « XMEN: DOFP » the morning in theater and i was lucky to watch this one on TV the evening after.For me, none of them is better as the two aren't truly « comics adaptation » but rather pale inspirations.Both used name of characters, certain famous moments of X-men history (especially uncanny #150) and then, they cook their own soup. Here, the Hellfire Club becomes a sort of Specter or fit for for « Austin Powers » and the X-Men get tangled in international crisis. This first class has rather boring teammates (Havok, Banshee, Mystique, ""angel Salvadore""?,""Darwin""?, ""Riptide""?).If the sets are however visually stunning, the power of this movie is to have found an incredible young Magnus with Fassbender. As Ridely Scott has noticed in « Prometheus », this actor is just great as he really acts old school!",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"I went in thinking ""whatever"" and came out thinking ""wow""","I went in thinking I was going to be bombarded with effects, actors who have mastered posing, the dare-devil swagger and flat catchphrases and ""attitude"".I was blown away by the movie. In fact, I liked it more than Pirates of the Caribbean on Stranger Tides. I gave it 8 out of 10 because there were few issues with the movie (particularly in the writing of the characters of Beast and Raven/Mystique, and the cartoonish silly performance of Kevin Bacon -- what's with that tin helmet? LOL) But I can see where Bacon is coming from. Most superhero movies (if not all of them) are cartoonish anyway (apart from Iron Man 1 :o)). He could not see what this movie was on paper. And indeed, maybe was it not for McAvoy (Young Professor X) and Michael Fassbender (Young Magneto), and their incredible down-to-earth and real performances, the whole movie would have been plunged in a downward spiral. Thanks to them, the movie has all the depth of a drama, while it still has all the fun of action. If more sense was given to the writing of other botched characters, this movie would have been just 10/10.The movie is a magnificent plethora beautiful music, credible moving stories of personal trauma and struggle, the effects are not only masterful but also awe-inspiring.. with that music.. again.. wow! The British actor (McAvoy) was perhaps my most favorite thing in the whole movie. Although again with the writing, some bits here and there were self-contradictory but nothing too noticeable.As usual in this genre, the women in the movie were ""for the guys"". Needless accessories and eye candies. Although, it seems Raven (in later versions) has lost a lot of ""baby fat"". I didn't have any special moments from her to be honest, even though her character was laden with moments that were wasted.Watch out for Lucas Till (Havoc, the mutant wielding his fire rings), he didn't say much in this movie but in the few seconds that meant a lot, he just nailed it. Which is more than I can say for Nicholas Hoult (Beast) who serenaded the audience with an unbelievable and rather creepy performance.Lucas Till has this jittering-demon-nice-guy mix that Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, and Collin Ferrel play with very well. Let's hope he will not be lost in a long series of pretty boy movies. Pretty boys never grow up into mature men in this career.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Cold War according to Marvel,"This is creative movie making at its most extreme. By transplanting the X-men mythology into an actual historical event, ie, the Cuban Missile Crisis, you have to suspend disbelief entirely for the duration of the movie.That being said, on its own, this movie does sufficient justice as a background piece to the X-men series for non-followers. We now realise just how deep and how broad the affection is between the Professor and Magneto. We also we understand the extremist behaviour of Magneto, the misunderstood villain. I mean, it's not easy to forgive when someone pumps hundreds of missiles at you to ensure your demise! Overall, it's an OK movie to spend your money on.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A great beginning with lots of fun and poignant moments,"The direction, story and acting in this movie is near perfect. Matthew Vaughn has sealed his credibility as a solid storyteller who weaves poignant character developments with fun action sequences. The set pieces, balance, pacing and cameos are well crafted.I had reservation about the choices of mutants before watching the movie but now I understand that they were selected for the right reasons. And that is to present the audience with a prequel that not only raises the bar for the franchise but also revives my faith in the series. X-Men 3 and Wolverine were short of disasters, but here the cast and crews have managed to breath a new life into a series that was getting near to downright embarrassment.Even though the movie is set as a prequel it never failed to deliver a mature performance unmarred by asinine silliness that often haunts action/superheroes genre when majority of the cast involves adolescents.The movie is largely based on the New X-Men saga by Grant Morrison, but it's not considered canon because it sits between the main and the Ultimate timelines.The stage is set, the quality is astounding so let's bring on the rest of the sequels.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Before he was Professor X, he was Charles. Before he was Magneto, he was Erik.","X-Men: First Class, following the classic Marvel mythology, charts the epic beginning of the X-Men saga. Before Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr took the names Professor X and Magneto, they were two young men discovering their powers for the first time. Before they were archenemies, they were closest of friends, working together, with other Mutants (some familiar, some new), to stop the greatest threat the world has ever known. In the process, a rift between them opened, which began the eternal war between Magneto's Brotherhood and Professor X's X-Men. (20th Century Fox)FIRST CLASS is a bit of a disappointing film. The end result is that of a ""meh"" because it's a step up from WOLVERINE and THE LAST STAND, which isn't saying much, but it's nowhere near as great as X2. With its potential, FIRST CLASS could have been so much better than it turned out to be. The main flaw of the film is that it tells an origin story which in itself makes the film less interesting to watch because we're only waiting to see inevitable consequences resulting in what we already saw in the first X-Men film. It's like STAR WARS 3. Sure, it's cool to see things connect to the trilogy, but we expected that in the first place.Being an origin story also means we have to go through the process of learning each character all over again which means a huge chunk of the film would be devoted to exposition. This could be interesting, and parts of it are, including a touching romance that develops between Raven (Mystique) and Hank (Beast). The addition of newer characters should also make this less tedious than it should be, but, like the previous X-Men films, there are just too many characters to fully develop each of them. Even with a long running time of over two hours, most of them are left in the dust, including the villains and professor Xavier himself. Still, director Matthew Vaughn tries his best to balance the many characters in this film, although not fully succeeding.Many people will argue that the other characters don't matter since it focuses more on the relationship between Charles (Professor X) and Erik (Magneto). Unfortunately, even that isn't as fully developed as we want it to be. The problem is that the relationship is portrayed so much better by the two older actors in the trilogy, played by Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart, that we yearn for them to appear on screen together again. There is, however, one scene in which I felt the emotional connection between these two characters, which involves a satellite, and it's a sweet but short scene. The film also hints on the themes that were explored in the trilogy, but that doesn't do much good because they are only touched upon and are more interesting when we see them play out in the trilogy.Another thing they could have made more interesting or changed altogether was the story dealing with the missile crisis. It's simply not interesting or compelling to watch. Even the climax in which the story really comes into play is as exciting as watching a kids race. It had little to do with the mutants themselves and more to do with stopping a nuclear war and, because of that, I didn't find myself caring much. The main villain, played by Kevin Bacon, isn't all that memorable either. He's very 2 dimensional with a bland super power. Again, we yearn a time in which the villain was McKellen's Magneto, who's more complex and interesting than Bacon's character will ever be.I must say that James McAvoy is miscasted as Charles Xavier. As stated earlier, he's not developed well in here and his role is mainly to help and find more mutants. There's not much for him to do than his character truly deserves. Michael Fassbender, on the other hand, plays a fierce and compelling Magneto, saying his lines with conviction and bringing great emotional weight to his character. Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique is another noteworthy name among the cast who brings a soft and sweet side to her character. I also liked Nicholas Hoult as Beast. Everyone else, including January Jones and Jason Flemyng (who's like a Nightcrawler 2.0), are pretty forgettable. Saying all of that, the film does include some great action scenes, for the few that are in here, with terrific special effects. The soundtrack by Henry Jackman should have been toned down quite a bit though.With all the problems listed above, FIRST CLASS is not a bad film. It's just an incredibly flawed one with nostalgia that only reminds us of the better, older actors in the trilogy. However, there are some intelligent aspects from the script, and the film does offer a few shining and emotional moments that go far and beyond many superhero films before, including the lackluster THOR and the dumb INCREDIBLE HULK. Even if I sounded like I'm being hard on this film, I'm doing so on purpose because I can see the great that can come out of it. Overall, FIRST CLASS ends up being my second favorite in the series, even ahead the first film (which I thought was only decent) but behind X2. With all the set up in this prequel (much like X-MEN is to X2), I do believe that a FIRST CLASS PART II could make this prequel series reach its potential and hopefully not disappoint us with a FIRST CLASS PART III like THE LAST STAND did. 6.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Best Xmen Adaption to date!,"Just like any other X-Men fan learning of a new movie was a bittersweet feeling. I was excited to see another story of my childhood pleasure come to life but was also inhibited of how Bryan Singer and Matthew Vaughn would translate the entire plot into an enjoyable two hour movie. For lack of a better word, I think the most appropriate word in my vocabulary is pure and utter awesomeness. I enjoyed the tact Bryan Singer implemented from the previous movies and how they tied into this one. I also enjoyed the surprising cameos.It's no question that the makers of the previous of X-Men films were obvious Wolverine fanatics, so part of my disappointment with the first three films was that the plot glorified his character and back story. Wolverine was always the most important, had the most emotional depth and somehow saved the day. It was disappointing because every character's personal story is captivating in its own right. This time it was different. This time they got it right. the unveiling of each character's backstory was beautifully done and I found myself emotionally invested in the plot.I found it brilliant that the plot connected itself to a true event, the Cuban Missile Crisis. I'm also a lover of villains and Kevin Bacon and January Jones did an amazing job. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender are definitely Oscar potentials because they're acting sold me from beginning to end. In the previous movies, Professor X and Magneto were just men too old to change and you accepted them that way. But it was definitely an enjoyable tale to see their friendship grow, blossom and ultimately how they became enemies.I think every movie goer should know by now, that after many adaptions from novels, comics, cartoons, etc. that the film version is never going to be 100% accurate. How can a film-maker be creative if all they're doing is recycling someone else's idea??? Where's the fun in that? So if you're going to the film hoping that will be exactly like the cartoon or the comic, you will be really disappointed. My advice is to go in the theater blind, if so, you will appreciate the evidence of obvious hard work, detail and genius all the more.The score was great and suitable, the costumes paid homage to the original comic and looked great. The plot and script were nicely done. Kudos to the screenwriters who captures the essence of each character without pounding us with thousands of words. The story was about Professor X and Magneto but each character definitely made their mark on the screen when it was time; from Mystique, to Beast, Emma Frost, Azazel, Pixie, Havok, Banshee, Sebastian Shaw, Riptide, Darwin, etc.As I stated before they finally got it right. Just think of X-Men 1, 2 & 3 and even the Wolverine: Origins movie as practice for the product that came out June 3rd. Enjoy!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Fassbender and McAvoy create fireworks.,"The X-Men have always been among my favorite comic heroes, as their story has always had a more intelligent and political scope compared to most others. Whether it was McCarthyism, issues of race or homosexuality, their battle for acceptance in a world where the unknown is shunned has always been a fantastic metaphor that has followed American culture through decades. This stays just as true here, with the neverending debate between Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr getting it's beginning at the Cuban Missile Crisis. Initially I was worried that putting this superhero story into the historical context was going to come off awkward, but Matthew Vaughn hit the perfect tone for these characters to be implanted, mixing a '60s Bond style with that dense mutant struggle. The driving narrative is a little thin, but the sparks that fly between Michael Fassbender and James McAvoy are more than enough to place the film in the top tier of comic book adaptations.In casting the film, they really made the perfect choices with Fassbender and McAvoy. The former perfectly captures all of the tortured history and desperate need for vengeance of the man that would become Magneto and the latter makes an expert transition from a charismatic boy into an intelligent adult who finally has a real purpose. The film is undoubtedly at it's best when these two superb talents are sharing the screen, battling the contrasting ideas of each man; Lehnsherr's war for dominance placed against Xavier's plea for understanding. That struggle has always been the heart of the X-Men story and here they finally bring it to the forefront, something that was missing from the other films in the franchise. And they could not have picked better actors than these two to tackle that lofty mission. The other actors do relatively fine jobs, no one else really standing out and the only dent in the cast being Jennifer Lawrence, who felt very awkward and self-aware throughout. I'll also never miss an opportunity to praise the beautiful Rose Byrne and I admittedly got a grand kick out of seeing her in lingerie early in the story. In a film loaded with the breathtaking eye candy that is Fassbender and McAvoy (who are both ""woa man"" sexy here), Byrne definitely stole my eye for part of it as well.As I said earlier, the one big flaw with the film is that the driving narrative is kind of thin. Everything with Magneto and Xavier is superb, I could watch an entire film of them having a chess match and the action is honestly some of the best I've seen in a comic book film; every scene with Lehnsherr being an absolute badass had me on the edge of my seat. However I feel like they dropped the ball on the Hellfire aspect of the plot, everything with Sebastian Shaw felt very typical of a film in this genre and nothing new was really done on that side of things. The placement of the story in the historical context was interesting and unique at first but by the end it was just another setting for a typical villain story. My one other complaint would be a complaint I have with pretty much all superhero stories that are adapted to the screen. In creating something like this they create it for franchise purposes and thus it never feels like there are any real stakes to anything going on. You know how it's all going to end before you even start the film. However this is one of the rare cases where my concern with that doesn't infringe on my ability to enjoy the story the way it is. Because for a nice change the film isn't about the action; the action is superb but it's about much more than that. It's a film about the struggle for those who are different and the intellectual debate between Lehnsherr and Xavier, and Fassbender and McAvoy absolutely deliver on all of the promises of that.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Strong enough to stand alone,"The concept of this film might be somewhat mundane to some since we already know what happens in the future, but this shouldn't stop you from experiencing the best X-Men film of the franchise.James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, and Kevin Bacon act so well that I'm still astonished as I write this review. The rest of the cast members were solid, but these three stood out far beyond my expectations, which were high to begin with.Although there might be some mythological errors in terms of the comics being adapted to the big screen, it's definitely something that can easily be over-looked.The CGI, dialogue, action, acting, and script were in perfect unison.There really isn't much more you could ask for from this film, except another one just like it to keep the X-Men franchise as strong as it can and should be.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
There are good prequels.,"Prequels can be good as First Class shows us. Michael Fassbender is Magneto or basically Erik Lehnsherr who calls himself Frankensteins Monster. Also we get Hank McCoys transformation into Beast what looks like a Dr. Jekyll / Mr. Hyde moment. So this could also be called a classic monster movie. But that's the problem. Mutants don't wanna be seen as those monsters. Especially Mystique, here played by Jennifer Lawrence who never fits into that role as good as Rebecca Romijn. The best moments of the film are between Fassbender and James McAvoy as Charles Xavier. Director Matthew Vaughn understands perfectly that these two are friends who are stronger and better together but are divided by their different worldviews. Sebastian Shaw, the leader of the Hellfire Club, is a nice villain for this origin story. He works way better than anything that X-Men: The Last Stand threw at us. There is a little love story - i guess? - between Mystique and Beast that really doesn't work. X-Men: First Class is nevertheless one hell of a good X-Men movie with a formidable cast.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Trivial superhero movie that aged badly.,"Last year I watched all the 20+ Avengers movies, so I decided to add the X-MEN franchise to my watchlist, to have a complete picture of the main Marvel narrative universe. ""First Class"" narrates the origin of Professor X and his beloved mutant students. I liked the character progression. I enjoyed the message that this film wants to convey: being able to accept ourselves completely, despite our differences, trying to fit in a society that tends to isolate those who have physical deformities or other peculiarities. The screenwriters literally throw this to the audience, multiple times along the film. I get it, there is no need to repeat the same thing over and over again. They could have found a less obnoxious way to express the moral. The plot is the usual stuff that you get from a superhero movie. There are the bad guys and the good guys, the last ones win, but this time there is not a complete happy ending.Special effects are really bad and have aged even worse. How with a budget of 160 million dollars they flunked in this department is a complete mystery to me. Emma Frost, when she has her mutant form, seems like a polygonal character from the first 2000s video games, with unrealistic movements and textures all over the place. A lot of animation looked so unrealistic and awful. CGI looks unpolished and unfinished.Michael Fassbender and James McAvoy basically carried this movie on their shoulders. Jennifer Lawrence was absolutely insufferable and completely flat, the rest of the cast was simply unmemorable. Not a good start for this franchise. I will try to watch the rest of the series, hoping that it will eventually get better, but this motion picture was extremely disappointing and underwhelming.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
X Men :First Class ushers in the 2011 summer action mania.,"Every year, a highly anticipated movie officially launches the summer action fiesta. For 2011, this is it! Look no further, X-men: First Class has thrown the gates openwide open.In almost unaltered history, the film dates back to the early 1960s era of suspense and dread. John F Kennedy is the president of the United States of America and the whole world braces for what is sure to be nuclear Armageddon. If you are thinking 'Cuban Missile Crisis', then I have your attention. However, before the world got to this predicament, we need to go back to the European theatre of World War II. In a concentration camp at Auschwitz, Occupied Poland, young Erik Lehnsherr witnesses his mother's brutal murder. During this traumatic event and fuelled by anger, Erik unleashes his secret power-much to the amazement of the perpetrator, Doctor Sebastian Shaw. Across the Atlantic, a young Charles Xavier discovers powers of his own. Before long, Xavier is a distinguished academic living with the shape-shifting Raven (who would later renegade and be called Mystique). Dedicating his life to avenging his mother's death, Erik Lehnsherr bumps into Charles Xavier, spawning an instant friendship and powerful bond. Together, and with their mutant friends, they are the CIA's last hope in averting a nuclear crisis that culminates into a spectacular face-off between American and Soviet naval forces.With all due respect, Mathew Vaughn does a phenomenal job as the director of this prequel. But fans of the Marvel comic book and the X-Men franchise will always look back to Bryan Singer for giving us the first two titles: X-Men (2000) and X2: X-Men United (2003). In fact, this installment is almost entirely the handy work of Singer, who not only co-wrote the script, but also produced the film. What he did not do was direct the movie, and that was a last moment decision due to pre-committed schedules for filming Jack the Giant Killer. So, having received the raw materials on a silver platter, all Vaughn had to do was execute it, take for take. In doing so, Vaughn has successfully re-vamped the X-Men franchise with such grandeur, a spin-off trilogy has already found its way to the drawing boards. On the whole, everything works here; from a captivating and intelligent screenplay to exceptional character development to fantastic action sequences. Whether you are a Marvel comic-book fan, X-Men movie fan or an action movie junkie, right from the start, through the 130 minutes to the end, you are sure to be entertained. Visuals are top notch, oozing CGI in many scenes. And to think, Vaughn has pulled this off without the need of those cumbersome 3D Spectacles.As a prequel, the script is pure ingenuity and takes us back to a time before Erik and Charles became the archenemies we know them to be. It is also a time when mutants are discovering and practicing their powers in secret. Aside from the mutant origins, embedded in the script is a parallel history relating to the Cuban Missile Crisis and birth of the Civil Rights Movement. The ingenuity of this is grafting history with fiction and having the audience accept its plausibility without having to state it as based on actual events. Forrest Gump was the first film to have pulled that off. First Class builds on this concept in such a clever way, that the script is studded with historical events. Another aspect of the screenplay also brings to mind a distinct James Bond theme. Maybe it is just the opinion of this reviewer, but chronologically, Bond's cinematic debut (1960s) is around the same time frame scripted for this movie. It is left to be seen if Vaughn intended for this as a mild undertone.Onto star performance, and most notable for his role as the young doctor in The last King of Scotland, James McAvoy is nothing like the Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) we have seen before. McAvoy's Xavier is drastically different, egotistical, brash, and a flirt on the loose. On the other hand, Michael Fassbender dons Sir Ian McKellan's suit as Erik Lehnsherr. Like McAvoy, he too ""paints a fresh canvas"" for the character who would go on to become the ruthless 'Magneto'. Although McAvoy and Fassbender are perfectly cast, I have to say the latter has the edge in terms of drawing you in. In doing so, he never steps on McKellan's toes, but brings out an unseen side of Erik Lehnsherr. When I mentioned James Bond earlier, I was referring to Fassbender; for some reason, his character carries a distinctive MI-6 persona. Another worthy mention should go to Kevin Bacon as the villainous Shaw. I don't want to spoil the surprise, but Bacon's Shaw plays a key role in bringing the world to the brink of war. For the time period portrayed, Kevin Bacon is the only actor whose character dons an accent. In doing so, he almost gets his German and Russian accents to a believable level. Perhaps, Vaughn did not feel the actors needed to work on their accent and that could be why none of the other actors actually bothered with an accent suiting the setting. Aside from McAvoy, Fassbender and Bacon, watch out for a plethora of good contributions from January Jones, Jennifer Lawrence, Zoë kravitz and loads more as newly discovered mutants along with cameos from Oliver Plat, Michael Ironside and you guessed it, Hugh Jackman.For a summer opener, X-Men: First Class does not disappoint. As a prequel, it pushes boundaries, raises the bar and broadens the scope of expanding this franchise. At a time when all we see are sequels and 3D gimmicks, this film is a surefire summer winner. If you have been following the series, you will love First Class. If you haven't, don't worry, Vaughn and Singer have successfully re-booted a dying franchise; there will be more to come.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

X-Men: First Class - 3 Stars,"Remember the X-Men movie right before this one? You know, the one about the origins of Wolverine? I don't. My guess is that Hugh Jackman doesn't either. If he does, I can almost be sure that he's at least trying. ""X- Men: First Class"", directed by Matthew Vaughn, is a prequel that shows us how the presence of mutants became known to humans, and how they responded to each other's impressions. This can also be identified as a 130-minute apology to ""Wolverine.""The film's first minutes are located in a nasty Nazi prison camp. The mother of young Eric is separated from him. He gets angry, and the steel gate between him and his mother seem to respond. (It's moving by itself!) This odd occurrence is immediately noticed by Sebastian Shaw, who later succeeds in forcing the power out of Eric by killing his mother. Once again in anger, Eric causes all sorts of metals to hurl through the air. The wooden chairs sigh in relief.The sequence described above features the finest moments of ""X-Men: First Class."" It is there where we are introduced to the young man who will one day be famously recognzied as Magneto. Shortly, we recall familiar names such as Charles (Professor X) and Raven (Mystique), but not at first sight. There is a curious connection between the two. They seem to be really close to one another. So close, in fact, that we wonder about the lack of communication between them in the ""previous"" X- Men movies.Read more here: http://localmoviereview.com/xmen-class/",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Very Well done,"This is fresh, the X-men are forming. It's the back story that's more exciting and fun than the later stuff. The actors are all stars in the making making them believable as their characters. I mean the last movies you really expected Professor X to say ""make it so"" at any moment. The back story of the Cuban missile crisis is fantastic nuclear war threat that the villain organizes reminds me of the villain plots of the 60s Bond movies. The 60s music and sexy outfits if a fun setting for the backdrop of the movie.

Could have been better.,"Now i know everyone is very excited and mostly happy with the new prequel of the x-men franchise. But i guess i will have to disagree with the general audience. I've just watched this most anticipated prequel of this summer and i've to say while the movie was not bad, it did not live up to the hype.Before going into the negatives i should say X-Men: First Class had an amazing story and equally well crafted dialog so Kudos to Bryan Singer. Actores are well casted and they all delivered. Especially Michael Fassbender as Magneto was unbelievable. This time we get to see Magneto not as a homicidal sociopath but a vulnerable and emotional human being. So even when he turns on the human race and goes on a killing fringe, still we feel sorry for him. Michael Fassbender took this daunting task and pulled it off with near perfection. James McAvoy as Professor X was incredible as well. Since it got to be hard for the audience to relate with someone who has every thing handed to him, McAvoy have done a wonderful job making the audience fall in love with him. Other actors did not get much screen time and had so little to work with so its not their fault that we don't feel much for them. but among them Jennifer Lawrence was the exception. Her portration of Mystique will change your whole perception of that character. The visual effects and cinematography were state of art. Especially that awesome scene that was seen in the trailer where Magneto lifts that submarine into the air or when he stops hundreds missile with a flick of hand was just breath taking to watch in the big screen.So, why do i think this movie is not worthy of all these praise? The problem is with direction i guess. when you see the movie you will feel like it is skipping some parts and abruptly jumping from one scene to another. The storytelling was not smooth at all. There was virtually no character development. It was like they assumed everyone knows Professor X is a huge humanitarian and Magneto is a victim of his inner demon so we don't have to waste time to build this characters. And while it was a delight to see the bromance between Eric and Charls, it was also done poorly. It was like one moment Charls and Eric just met in the middle of the sea and in the next scene they are BFF. the gradual development of a strong friendship despite mammoth difference in their perception and end-goal was absent. the film felt rushed and bumpy. The makers were in such a hurry to reach to the final climax that they lost sight of the little things that actually makes a film unforgettable.So, in the end X-Men: First Class is not as good as X-Men or X2 United was and it had so much possibility and room for being a great film which it was not. But it is still so much better that X-Men: Last Stand and Wolverine and still worth your money and time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Hmmmn................I don't think so.,"Well, where to begin. Unfortunately I read the X-Men comics in the 1960's, and this doesn't reflect the style of those stories.Why is that Hollywood film makers, think that they can change everything into what they want it to be. What was so bad about the original comic stories that they have to be re-written into something that changes the essence of the whole experience.Where were the original X-Men, Cyclops, Iceman, Angel etc and do we really need the relationships changing this radically. This type of alteration is unforgivable. Go and see Kenneth Branagh, and get him to make the thing properly.I haven't really any complaints about the acting, as everyone did a good job. As a film for anyone unfamiliar with the early X-men comics I suppose it could pass for a reasonable superhero film. It's just really sad that this chance to make an excellent origin film has now probably gone for good.I won't be rushing to watch the next one. Poor job, must try harder !",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Love It  ;-),"I saw this movie on Friday the 5th and I was expecting no to enjoy it very much since the original 5 x-men were not in it but it ended up being my favourite movie of the year so far. It's got a great story line but can be a little tricky to understand at some points but is still great.If you didn't understand things from the x-men trilogy or x-men origins: Wolverine I highly recommend going to see it. It cleared up allot of questions I had :-)If you're debating if you want to see it or not just go. When I went to the cinema there were girls, boys, teens, adults and elderly people and they all loved it - it just proves that anyone will enjoy it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Best So Far,"It was a toss up tonight - Hangover 2, Pirates 4 or X-Men Pre-Prequel.I wasn't particularly drawn to one over the other.I loved Hangover, but beauty of the original was that it was so unexpected. Not sure the second can deliver on that. And as for pirates, well who doesn't love to escape to the beauty of a tropical locale every once in a while. X-men I wasn't sure about. The previews seemed to just show Charles X and Magneto chatting, which isn't too bad considering how lovely McAvoy and Fassbender are, but beyond that it did not seem very exciting.Leave it to my husband to settle the matter. Strolling in from golf he glanced at the paper and said, ""X-Men First Class is out? Let's go!""I was hooked from the opening scene. This is the best X-Men so far. I absolutely loved every minute of it!The movie has all the great points of the other X-Men films, excitement, action, tension of one side against the other, fascinating mutant characters, excellent fx and great story/back-story and tie-ins; but it is the interaction and dialog between McAvoy and Fassbender and acting of Kevin Bacon that seal the deal. They are simply a pleasure to watch. At 2 hours, the length is perfect. It gives you all you want from the movie and stops at the precise moment it might begin to drag.It is not often that at the end of a movie my husband and I simultaneously turn to one another, smile, hold hands and say, I really liked that. X-Men FC was an unexpected treat, one I highly recommend.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"A Prequel. A Reboot. An Origin Story. No Matter How You See It, X-Men: First Class Just Works.","Narrating the origin story of the many significant characters in X-Men universe & set in the 1960s during the Cuban missile crisis which put the entire world on the verge of a nuclear Armageddon, X-Men: First Class mainly concerns the close friendship between Charles Xavier & Eric Lensherr before they turned into archenemies and adopted the names of Professor X & Magneto, respectively.Director Matthew Vaughn brings an entirely fresh approach & style in almost all filmmaking departments here and succeeds in balancing its quality action with impressive storytelling without ever letting down the entertainment factor. Tightly edited from start to finish, the film looks absolutely fantastic, thanks to its vibrant cinematography & state-of-the-art visual effects & sensational music.Coming to the performances, the entire cast is pretty well-rounded & each member is very convincing in their given roles. James McAvoy plays Charles Xavier aka Professor X while Michael Fassbender is in as Eric Lensherr aka Magneto, and the performance as well as chemistry between these two men is what makes this film work so well along with fine support from the rest of its cast.On an overall scale, benefiting greatly from its brilliant direction, strong script, magnetic performances from McAvoy & Fassbender, terrific visual effects, tight editing & a wonderful score, X-Men: First Class comes out as a highly potent package that guarantees a cinematic experience which is surely going to entertain & astonish its viewers in more ways than one.

Decent prequel.,"A decent prequel. No Wolverine, instead we see the back story of Professor X & Magneto set against a Cold War backdrop. Jennifer Lawrence and Nick Holt are introduced I suspect to give the cast some extra star appeal. James Mcavoy does an good job of filling the shoes of Patrick Stewart as Professor X begins to train up his first mutants as well as devolving his philosophy as he even comes close to winning Magneto over. My favorite part personally was the training scenes. There's quite a lot of CGI as you'd expect with mutant powers and a fleet of ships at the end. The CGI stuff looked ok, not the most convincing. The Dvd version I watched had good sound and picture plus widescreen. As with the other films the social commentary behind the film is pretty clear and direct.

Disappointment,"Totally agree with the review by wally_greeneyes_dee (posted in June). This movie did not stay true to any of the characters of X-Men at all, in any fashion.If you go into the movie knowing anything about the X-Men and their relationships going forward, nothing in this movie parallels. Professor Xavier is not as controlled and stoic, but more of a loose cannon. None of the characters act in any resemblance to their comic-book persona.The dialogue is cheesy (although we can allow for some of that, being based on comic characters). It is hard to explain in detail everything that is exactly off about this movie, but overall it is just wrong in so many ways that at the end you feel very let down.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
X-men First Class is definitely a first pick,"I saw this movie last weekend and i am still thinking about. The acting was great they all played their parts to the very best. The whole storyline was very clever and well put together. We get to see the great and mysterious past between Charles Xavier aka Professor X (James McAvoy) and Erik Lehnsherr aka Magneto (Michael Fassbender). It also zoomed in on the lives of Raven Darkholme aka Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) and Hank McCoy aka Beast (Nicholas Hoult). It was great from the beginning, to the climax, right down to the final scene. This movie in my opinion is a 10 out of 10, all the way.

X-Men First Class review,"X-Men First Class Directed By: Matthew Vaughn Written By: Ashley Edward Miller, Zack Stentz, Jane Goldman, Matthew Vaughn, and Sheldon TurnerThis is your chance to get in your time machine and go back to where it all started. The fifth film in the X-men collection is a prequel, set forty years before X-men, as we know it. It introduces Professor Charles/Xavier and Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto past life, as their two main key characters. X-men First Class Explains how they developed their individual statuses and nicknames. Matthew Vaughn gives X-men fans the inside scoop, while creating opportunity for potential fans to get involved, as the audience and characters simultaneously discover new and existing mutant behaviour. X-men first class breaks down different forms of evolution and the repercussions their powers have on characters personal life. Nevertheless I feel Vaughn could of focused on three or four main characters, rather then introducing many new mutants who have no relevance to the other films. This could possibly confuse audiences and also make them lose interest while watching as they wait for their favourite X-men to pop up, such as Hank McCoy/Beast and Raven Darkholme/Mystique. Vaughn is successful in explaining Xavier and Magneto's ongoing rivalry, and how they become enemies, considering they started as a team. It begins in 1944, Poland, Erik Lehnsherr is only a young boy when he has to witness his mother being murdered at concentration camp, by the wicked Dr. Sebastian Shaw. Unfortunately Dr. Shaw's control is short lived, as the anger he causes Magneto increases his ability, and to Dr. Shaw's dismay he becomes uncontrollable. Vaughn also highlights Magneto's venerable side, giving audiences the chance to empathise and reason with why he is rebellious. Meanwhile in New York, fortunate Charles Xavier is living a plush, educated lifestyle when he stumbles across the mutant Raven hustling for a meal, he sympathises with her and takes her in, as she is homeless, showing from the jump off his caring and neutering character. 18 Years later, 1962, the CIA agent Moira MacTaggert discovers the existence of mutants and works alongside Dr. Shaw to try and eradicate them all. They then hire Professor Xavier to gather mutants to work for the USA government. However Xavier soon realises the evil Dr. Shaw is planning to begin a nuclear war to destroy the world and increase his power. Resulting in the beginnings of the war of Mutants versus Humans. The film ends quite abruptly and I fell Vaughn could of paid more attention to detail when directing the final scenes that essentially set the whole X-men story. X-men first class fits the form of previous films in what a viewer could expect, from usual youthful behaviour to battling the world. So if you are a X-men fan and want to catch up with some of your favourite characters or you just want to experience a young, action packed, sci-fi film, check out the latest of the X-men films, as Vaughn depicts key unanswered questions.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Best X-Men movie yet!,"I have always been a massive fan of marvel. Ever since I was a kid, I've loved the entire world I was able to escape to. I was never a massive fan of the spider-man movies as a kid (except spider-man 2), because they felt untrue to the comics. However, X-men has always had exactly the same feel as the comic books did. The order the films were made in was the order of my favourites (1,2, last stand, wolverine.) But my favourite part of the entire X-men universe was Magneto and Professor X's rivalry. So naturally I was very excited but slightly anxious, hoping it wouldn't fallow the deterioration of the rest of the franchise. Well, luckily it didn't.First of all, Michael Fassbender and James McAvoy are absolutely brilliant. Their scenes together were almost as exciting as Robert De Niro and Al Pacino in HEAT. I've always loved the idea that arch-enemies can be trying to destroy each other, and then the next minute be sat civilised over a dinner. Like political leaders.I loved Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen performances, but who's was better. That is debatable. The rest of the cast give a fairly good to very good range of performances, but the film does really centre around Charles and Erik, so that doesn't effect it too much.The opening plays out like an Oscar winning film. There is so much Drama, emotion, and contrast. I'm not sure if Kevin Baker played the younger Shaw at the beginning, but if he did, he was excellent. It would also be the highlight of the movie for him if he did. It reminded me a lot of Christoph Waltz in Inglourious Basterds. His performance did get slightly weaker as the film progressed though.The script is amazing. Very funny, witty and not afraid to laugh at itself. There are lots of 'Tips of the hat' to the earlier films, referencing characters and specific situations. It reminded me slightly of how Red Dragon 'tipped it's hat' to Silence Of The Lambs at the end.My only picky moans are that every so often, you hear the slightest hint of Fassbender's Irish accent, which does sometimes draw away from the realism of the film. Also, I really did have to say 'Yeah, okay.' about Kevin Baker's character coming back and secretly being a mutant all along.But, all in all very good. 7.5 (imdb wouldn't let me put that half.)Favourite scene: Hugh Jackman's cameo.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A great variety of mutants in this movie...,"There's quite a few plot-holes in the movie and several scenes where the characters in the movie act unrealistically or illogically. It's honestly not so difficult to make a movie without plot-holes so I don't know why so freeking many of these movies have so many plot-holes.Anyway, the movie is overall a good superhero movie, but the CGI isn't top-notch and leaves quite a bit to be desired though it's not nearly as bad as it was in 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009)'. Overall it's a 7/10 movie that could have been 8/10 if they didn't include the plot-holes.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Super Entertaining!,"The pacing of the first half of the movie is so fast that it's the responsible for all the movie's flaws; the motivations for joining the team aren't convincing or rather they made all the mutants aren't different from each others (actually it is one motivation that you should understand yourself), the humor didn't work for me (despite the fact that the jokes aren't bad at all) and the dull dialogue between the villain and the heroes revealed all the evil plans. But actually this very pacing made this movie one of the most entertaining superhero movies I've ever seen. Also, all these flaws are only in the first half of the movie as I said and they are nothing if we compared them to the many positives of this movie; the visuals are stunning, all the performances are great (specially from McAvoy and Fassbender as well as their characters), Magneto's dramatic scenes in this movie maybe are the best in the entire franchise, the cheesiness in this movie is amiable and amusing, even the humor gets much more better in the second half of the movie. the action sequences are stylish and the plot is simple but strong. without a doubt it's one of my favorite X-Men movies.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Nicholas Hoult who was in 'About a boy ' is a someone to watch out for in future.All in all, a great film and one to see again.

Best of the X-men Movies Hands Down!!,"I just watched it like two hours ago, and I want to go back to the cinema to watch it again!!! It was incredible! It fills in gaps in the story, and shows you everything. The director did an amazing job of showing to the audience why characters were the way they were, and the audience feels intrigued as they watch the people they have grown to love over the last few movies.Mystique in particular just takes on a whole new light. She's not just the bad-ass blue girl anymore. She is now a real person, with real feelings, real fears, and real love.Of course, there are still problems with the story lines that don't line up over the course of all the movies, but maybe they don't even line up in the comic books. Perhaps there will always be gaps that don't make sense.But overall, 10 out of 10 does not give this movie justice. Maybe a 21.

"Part sequel. part reboot, full-on entertainment","Having seen the previous four X-Men movies and in varying degrees enjoyed them all, I wasn't going to miss this fifth outing and by and large I was not disappointed. Like the last three episodes of ""Star Wars"" and the J J Abrams version of ""Star Trek"", this is prequel (as well as something of a reboot) which explains how familiar characters became the ones we know so well. Above all, we meet young versions of Charles Xaxier/Professor X (James McAvoy) and Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto (Michael Fassbender) and learn how the former finished up in a wheelchair, how the latter acquired his helmet, and how the two became mortal enemies.British director and co-writer Matthew Vaughn - who first burst on the scene with ""Layer Cake"" - sets most of the narrative in the early 1960s at the height of the Cold War (although I don't remember skirts being that short then), so we are presented with an alternative vision of the causation and conclusion of the Cuban missile crisis. Lots of mutant powers and special effects are on display which keeps the action moving and the entertainment levels high. Call me weird, but I'm a sucker for a blue-skinned, shape-shifting woman and Jennifer Lawrence is especially appealing as Raven/Mystique.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Conceptual Review,"The story begins with the mid of nineteen forties where the heat of second world war was in the end. The people are in the heat of survival from the German Monarchy. The story opens with the prisoner in such a camp who is non other than the young, kid Magnito. The death of his mother forces him to develop more fierce and agony in his mind set. After the years passes by, he meets his good friend Mutant with intelligence, Professor Charles Xevier. The Story also gives a good insight about the Development of Mutants from the child hood of professor and Eric(Magnito).Coming to the conceptual points, it seems that the director Mathew Vaughn wants to convey the messages of any modifications or changes to any physicality(Proud of being Mutant), other than what nature has provided to us brings harm and not charm. Professor X tries to elevate the people(Non mutants or humans) as they are in the advanced state of the life stack structure. Professor X also tries to convince Magnito that sweet memories are more powerful than agony. Magnito when asks Charles to shoot him, he denies it indicating that Goodness always persists and cannot be changed by agony(Symbolized by Magnito) while the reverse is only possible. When the Humans when starts reverting against the mutants (after the understanding between the USSR and America), its Professor who stops the process of attack and follows ""Ahimsa"" rather than killing the humans. The story begins with young Eric being drowned with agony and ends with he himself being the owner of agony and pain. Magnito also breaks the unity among the mutants in the process of achieving that dominance over others by fierce.The power of mutants is been overwhelmingly showed in the movie. The camera work and the editing is simply superb!. Satya Meva Jayate-Truth(Goodness) Always Trumps.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best X-men movie of them all,Loved the ensemble cast and the origin stories. Thought there was too much focus on Raven/Mystique...but Hunger Games was big then.

"Dull, Miscast, Slightly Smug","Well I'm a fan of X-Men - not in a fanboy way - I've read a few comics, grew up watching their cartoons - so generally am quite forgiving even of the more mediocre x-men films. This film however for me just dropped the ball. The guy playing Xavier was simply awful, not only a bad actor but unpleasantly smug too - a smugness that seeped into the tone of the whole film. Also the film felt strangely low budget and well... grey.. lacking panache.Overall I found it baffling how an X-men film could be so dreary and left me wondering why the film was even made as it seemed to lack any passion or creativity.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Story of mutants in the human world,"While the movie will appeal to both Xmen followers and comic books followers, it has something for everyone from popcorn eaters to serious action genre followers. While I have watched Spiderman, Batman and recent Marvel comic movies; it seems all those movies did fine due to a emphasis on plot, character play and fine acting. X-men First does not disappoint in any category. The director has risked the movie by relying heavily on the relationship between Charles (Prof X) and Erik(Magneto) and it pays off handsomely.

It's all about Michael Fassbender and James McAvoy,"¨We have it in us to be the better man.¨ I will be honest with you guys: I didn't think this movie would work without Wolverine, after all he was the heart and soul of the previous X-Men films. Hugh Jackman was the reason why I had enjoyed the other movies so much and I thought this film would suffer without this main character (it would be like a Pirates of the Caribbean movie without Jack Sparrow). I was wrong! X-Men: First Class works really well as a prequel/reboot to the franchise for one main reason: The casting of Michael Fassbender and James McAvoy as the two lead characters: friends turned archenemies Magneto and Professor X. The relationship between these two characters and the two outstanding performances these talented actors give are what make X-Men: First Class the best superhero film since The Dark Knight. I know we have been bombarded with superhero films lately, and they are actually all pretty decent thanks to the strong background and depth these characters have been given in the comics, but this one is really worth your time. I loved the direction that Matthew Vaughn (Kick-Ass, Stardust, and Snatch) took with this film by letting the center of the plot revolve around the relationship between Erik Lehnsherr (Magneto) and Charles Xavier (Professor X). We really come to care for these two friends who we know will become enemies in the future, but can't help but root for them to get along in some way. Fassbender and McAvoy really deliver outstanding leading performances and the scenes between them are the heart of the movie. X-Men fans won't be disappointed.The movie begins during World War II as the Nazis are trying to separate young Erik from his parents. While they are taken away Erik begins to bend the metal fences with his mind until a soldier knocks him out. One of the Nazi officials named Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) questions Erik before killing his mother in front of him since he is unable to move a metal coin. Later Sebastian discovers that Erik's powers only work when he is angry and therefore begins to train his prisoner. The movie then jumps to the present: it is 1962 and the world is at verge of another World War. Tension between the United States and Russia is high; the Cold War is at its boiling point. Sebastian is trying to take advantage of the situation and wants a nuclear war to begin. By his side he has some mutant friends: Emma Frost (January Jones) and Azazel (Jason Flemyng). On the meantime Erik Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender) is after Sebastian and wants revenge. Erik isn't the only one after Shaw, an FBI agent, named Moira (Rose Byrne) discovers that he is trying to start a nuclear war and sees the mutants therefore she decides to investigate and discovers that a young student has done some extensive research on human mutation, his name is Charles Xavier (James McAvoy). Charles knows that there are many mutants with special powers like his in the world. He even adopted one and began to teach her how to deal with her power: Raven (Jennifer Lawrence), alias Mystique. Charles begins working with Moira in order to stop Shaw. He also befriends Erik and together they begin to round up other young mutants with special powers: Angel (Zoe Kravitz), Havok (Lucas Till), Hank McCoy (Nicholas Hoult), Banshee (Caleb Jones), and Darwin (Edi Gathegi).It was very interesting to see how the X-Men story began. The scenes where Erik and Charles teach the young mutants how to deal with their powers and master them remind us that these two guys are in a way very similar to each other. They both have great respect for one another; they are both excellent teachers and want to help their fellow mutants, but Erik never was able to deal with the pain of losing his parents and has grown resentful towards humans. This is what separates the two: one is motivated by hate, the other by grace. The same happens with the young mutants and there is no denying the fact that some will go along Erik's path, while others will follow Charles's. We all know that Magneto's brotherhood will be in constant battle with Professor Xavier's X-Men, but what we didn't know (at least film wise) was how the two groups went their separate ways. It is this friendship between the two main characters that we know will end, what builds the tension for a very satisfying finale. On a side note I really didn't care for the rest of the mutants. They were just that: secondary characters. What made the movie work entirely were these great scenes between McAvoy and Fassbender. The rest was just unremarkable in my opinion. Jennifer Lawrence and Kevin Bacon gave good performances, but the truth is that the movie really revolved around Erick and Charles, and these two actors did a great job to make up for a somewhat mediocre script. I really enjoyed this reboot/prequel and it has taken the franchise to a whole new level.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"X-MEN: FIRST CLASS (Matthew Vaughn, 2011) ***","The X-MEN series is surely among the more consistent superhero franchises out there: despite the blot that was X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE (2009), the film-makers went on and gave us the back-story of Professor X, Magneto and, to a lesser extent, Mystique. Having been impressed with all of director Vaughn's previous efforts and particularly the similar KICK-ASS (2010), I was looking forward to this being, at least, miles ahead of WOLVERINE (another apparently solo effort of whom is being prepped for next year!) – which it certainly proved to be.Since we had already been given glimpses into Magneto's childhood in the very first entry, Vaughn (and producer Bryan Singer, who had directed the original) expands upon it, while also presenting us with the friendship – that would eventually turn into deadly animosity – between the two polar leaders of the future Mutant struggle (Mystique, too, had been 'adopted' by Charles Xavier but eventually changed allegiance to serve his nemesis Magneto). This element here, however, lands the film into problems of logic: of course, you might say that, if one is willing to accept such a fantastic concept to begin with, why bother with the details – but I am sure that, if these had been better thought out, the film would have emerged an even stronger outing. Anyway, here goes: since both Xavier and Mystique are depicted as quite young at this stage, why is it that in the original series, he is seen as a bald and white-haired figure while she can still pass muster as a stunning femme fatale (incidentally, Rebecca Romijn puts in a blink-and-you'll-miss-her cameo when her incarnation here, Jennifer Lawrence, ages to womanhood in the wake of Magneto's mocking of her excessive youth!). In the same breadth, while recruiting mutants, Professor X and Magneto (then still Eric Lehnsherr) happen upon the irascible Logan, Wolverine himself – but, rather than being played by a younger counterpart, Hugh Jackman already essays the part...so, then, why does it take Professor X some 30 years (during which time the former has not aged at all!) to bring him around to his way of thinking?!Typically, with a film concerning numerous superheroes or, to put it more aptly, gifted persons, some are allowed to shine more than others (in both good and evil camps, mind you); it was a mistake, however, to sideline Mystique's character as just one of the teens, since she had been part of the team from the very start (even before Eric!). Most of the others, in fact, come across as mere show-offs (despite Xavier's diligence in harnessing their individual power) – with Beast's complete transformation evoking uneasy parallels to the TEEN WOLF movies from the 1980s! The real villain here, then, is Kevin Bacon who progresses from Nazi associate to big-time industrialist to Mutant megalomaniac (when he is prevented from unleashing World War III, by making judicious use of stock footage pertaining to the Cuban Missile Crisis of the early 1960s, he decides to turn himself into a one-man thermo-nuclear reactor!). Also, while the presence of CIA agent and nominal heroine Rose Byrne does not really come to bear on the central plot, she eventually proves a pivotal pawn in Xavier's crippling accident – which definitely severs his ties with Eric (then again, Mystique ought to have been more considerate towards her mentor at this particularly difficult moment!).In the end, the film's success or failure rests squarely on the shoulders of the two leads and, thankfully, both James McAvoy as Xavier and especially Michael Fassbender (incidentally, both he and Bacon are made to speak in a variety of languages throughout!) as Eric deliver the goods. For the record, the film's most awe-inspiring moment/special effect is the one where Magneto 'compels' Bacon's sub out of the sea (in full view of dumb-founded American and Russian battleship personnel!) and brings it to land on a sandy beach – where the ultimate battle (at least of this 'new' first entry) is raged. By the way, it was also nice to see the likes of Michael Ironside, Ray Wise and Rade Sherbedgia in minor roles.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Successful start of the franchise,"X-Men: First Class is the first film of the X-Men series that we seen start which released few more sequels. This film tells the origin story of how the superheroes became what they were and shows how it all started. The film is fast paced but at times slows down to show the in depth details of each character. Of all the things that went right with this film, was casting of James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender as the young versions Patrick Stewart's Xavier and Ian McKellen's Magneto respectively. Bringing the dramatic polish they honed on such films as Atonement and Hunger, they give soul and believability to what could otherwise have been a tragic, worthless repeat of the empty.

The best X - Men movie ..... Absolutely Brilliant !!!,"This might not be the best movie of 2011 but it sure is the best X- Men movie of all time and surpasses the last four movies.Every scene is crafted with dedication and the end says it all. The screenplay deserves a special mention here which is very tight and there are no loose ends. Most of the scenes are interconnected with some or the other which keeps the watching delicious and joyful. For example, the starting scene where Shaw kills Eric's mother and hands over the coin to him and the ending scene where Shaw is killed using the same coin is great synchronization.Fassbender has done great justice to the role of Magneto and the name suits him better. He is on par with McAvoy in terms of performance and the two share a great chemistry. I loved Fassbender in this film, especially in the ending scenes. All other mutants are passable and good.Overall, this great film should not be missed by people who like well-crafted movies and its a great fun to watch with a bunch of popcorn. Especially with a genre like this, its a must-go !!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
X-Men Unite!,"After the abomination of X-Men Origins: Wolverine (and I love Hugh Jackman and the Wolverine character), I must say I wasn't excited for another X-Men movie. However, the trailers were pretty decent and it was enough to spark my interest in seeing it. Did they make up for the awful Origins movie?Yes. Yes they did. With the absence of Wolverine (with a small cameo, at least) I wasn't sure what to expect. But man, there is so much to like! The film begins with Xavier and Magneto as kids. It only lasts for a good ten minutes, but I would be happy if the whole film centered around these two kids. Magneto was separated from his mother from Nazis, and is confronted by an evil Kevin Bacon with a German accent. Kevin Bacon wants Magneto to move a coin, much like he did with the gate to get to his mother. However, Magneto couldn't so Kevin Bacon shoots his mother. Magneto goes crazy and suddenly the whole room starts moving and crushing and Kevin Bacon just laughs. Meanwhile, Xavier befriends a shape shifting girl in his home named Raven (later changing her name to Mystique), and thus we see the opening title.Then it flash forward to when they are adults. At first, I wanted to film to center around those kids but the adults did their parts well. I think I speak for most people when I say that Xavier and Magneto's relationship is the heart of the story. However, it never really felt as strong to me as I liked it to be. Call me cynical. But I was very impressed with James McAvoy's performance as Xavier. He could hold a candle to Patrick Stewart any day. Seriously, he carried the film well and I grew to like him more and more as the film went on. I particularly liked the relationship between him and Mystique. She's so gorgeous, that I was hoping he would at least kiss her at some point.There are, of course, other mutants in the group, but the only one with meaningful powers belongs to Havok (Lucas Till) who seems to be the only one who has powers that could actually help them. The others can either cling to things, run fast, adapt to environments, or fly and make sonar noises. They just didn't seem like they could be a match for the evil Kevin Bacon and his group of goons. These guys just look like they could rip through this team like tin foil and hardly believable that they could stand a chance. But hey, at least it helps with the suspense factor.I did wish that they chose a different ending and just save that one for a sequel or something. I don't want to give too much away but like Origins, they keep ruining the continuity of the series. If you watch these films in order, it just doesn't link up. However, as a stand alone movie to the franchise, it was done exceptionally well. I have renewed faith in the X-Men franchise, and I can't wait to see what happens in the Second Class.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A valiant effort to a sagging franchise.,"I have been skeptical about XMFC,since I heard they were going to pre- boot it,but yes Bryan Singer raised my eyebrow even more(even though he was in the story department).I can never forgive him for f**king up Superman big time,but somehow he gets XMen.I came to the theater with minimum expectations to say the most.First Class really catches momentum and some surprises really work.But I think what can make an XMen movie work is the momentum and not the story,as the story is always the same(People hate mutants,good mutant wants to prove otherwise,bad mutant is conflicted,both part ways in the end tragically...WTF??) and Vaughn disappoints in this regard.Fassbender & McAvoy really did justice to their parts and I would give this a 5 only for that.If you have nothing to do and are not sick of another XMen flick with the whole Human-Mutant dynamic,then you should go for it.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
fantastic,"This film has all the things that a film should have. Good action scenes and good fighting. The effects that they used in this film are amazing especially with the wings and many more. If i am honest i didn't really expect a a lot from this movie because of the different cast but it was truly amazing and just fantastic. There is probably one face in there that you will recognize at one point in the movie i really didn't think it was who it was but it was. This film is definitely a ten out of ten what i thought made it really really good was the different types of mutants in it and also the younger mutants and how some parts out of x-men 1,2 and 3 is finally out and shows you how it happens and that and it is just truly amazing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Starting from the Top,"Having not followed the various forms of the Marvel Comics X MEN series except for a glance at Wolverine can be beneficial in watching this Prequel. The fantasy is explained rather coherently - mutants have developed and must be undercover for their own safety until leaders emerge, young lads from the year 1944 struggling with their peculiar identity until something pushes them to the point of taking advantage of their supernatural powers and they become committed to gathering all the other mutants together as a positive force by the time they reach adulthood. Or as the PR piece states it 'Before Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr took the names Professor X and Magneto, they were two young men discovering their powers for the first time. Before they were archenemies, they were closest of friends, working together, with other Mutants (some familiar, some new), to stop the greatest threat the world has ever known. In the process, a rift between them opened, which began the eternal war between Magneto's Brotherhood and Professor X's X-MEN.'James McAvoy is Charles Xavier and Michael Fassbender is Erik Lensherr and the mutants the gather around them include Jennifer Lawrence, Lucas Till, Nicholas Hoult, Caleb Landry Jones, Edi Gathegi, Álex González, and even a quick peek at Hugh Jackman. The year switches to 1962 when Russia and the USA were coming close to nuclear war so of course the mutants fight for the end of the attempt while another set of bad mutants under the leadership of Kevin Bacon and January Jones and Jason Flemyng et al face off battling powers of telecommunication and various forms of super human acts an by the end of the film the 'together boys' - Charles and Erik have become Professor X and Magneto. Doting the over two hour long landscape are appearances by Rose Byrne playing the love interest and Oliver Platt simply called the Man in Black. it is a game of subterfuge as well as a gradually coming to terms with being a mutant that keeps the ball rolling to a rather spectacularly staged battle scene as the Russian missiles are making their way toward Cuba and the United States.Matthew Vaughn directs the screenplay written by no fewer than 6 writers ad there are some impressive special effects demonstrated as the characteristics of each of the mutants. Entertaining, yes, and it stands alone well enough so that those of us who have not seen the other installments in the series can enjoy it as a 'beginning'.Grady Harp",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The X Factor,"Well to begin with I am a huge fan of X-Men comic series and i know it is a mammoth task to bring these characters and to put them in a movie which does justice to all the characters.The previous Xmen trilogy was successful in building a story for the series but didn't do justice to a lot of characters apart from the big bosses.The latest installment of the movie is not quite true to the comic book or the original Xmen storyline but it sure does justice to the moviegoers.Matthew Vaughan being the great director he is has done an excellent job of weaving such a great story and bringing together a sterling star cast.James Mcavoy and Micheal Fassbender do justice to Professor X and Magneto' character respectively and Kevin Bacon is diabolical as Sebastian Shaw.

"A great time witnessing the formation of the ""X-Men""","This is a prequel to the X-men saga and fans of the marvel mythology universe will love it. The special effects are awesome, the plot is decent and its just super fun discovering how all the characters came to be. The cast is also like a whose-who of stars, top notch including several fun cameos and an homage to Patrick Stewarts hair that really made me laugh.I loved the bromance between James McAvoy as a young Charles Xavier and (Michael Fassbender) who hasn't yet become Magneto, watching them discover their powers, working together before they became arch enemies. I never fully engaged in the whole cold war/nukes storyline but I did enjoy witnessing the formation of the X-Men and discovering their origins.In all honesty this probably deserves a higher rating but its not my favourite movie genre so I couldn't fully appreciate it for what it is. 09.13",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A few words from the people who know the worth of Hero's.,"I am passing this on from a close friend of mine who does not post on boards his reviews and our discussion with others of our trade, Comic Books, Artists,Producers and Writers.They love this film.For all the right reasons to. Because this film is more about super heroes and good storytelling than it is about scraping a generations wallets with the exploitation of heroes from their youth. It is a film that helps break down the idea that continuity of storyline matters at all in the world of comic heroes. Which it doesn't.I am not speaking of anything that happens in this film but in general when I say. So what if the dead spring back to life under dubious circumstances or people who were young at one point are now in the past as adults. Each story is a universe unto itself and these characters are not bound by the expectations of people who do not have the imagination to see what matters in storytelling. So, if you love a good story, well made and refreshingly honest, go see this one.Even I was skeptical, especially as since I am an editor, I found the original trailer to be one of the most embarrassingly trite representations of a film in this season. All it needed was a Mr Movie Phone Narration and I would have thrown something at the screen.The Comic Artist who I am speaking of is the voice I am listening to on this film. My pal was the youngest artist ever to be hired as a main artist to Justice League of America in 1987. His career is stellar and he consistently produces some of the finest no holds barred comic storytelling to this day. You don't believe me, fine. But if you don't know the title, Go check out, ""The Boys"".The point is that while many of these box office watchers are gauging this film on how it does at the box office. Even more are bashing it for no reason other than, they can.Box Office Mojo should be more responsible for their reviews, as they are in fact not reviews at all. They are business reports, that act as if money is the only factor that makes a film worth viewing. Such a lack of care for what they report itself becomes a factor in how a film does. I would not doubt that the reviewer had not even seen the film reported on by the manner in which it is reported on. The all time worst excuse I have heard so far from BOM, ""Where is Wolverine?""Who cares where wolverine is? He has his own movie, which in many of us who make and love comics opinion, was the worst of all the x-men films hands down.Just because more people went to Wolverine and were disappointed on the opening weekend than this film has had sit down to watch it in no valid way to to gauge this films value.Thank you and enjoy the film!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I did very much like the movie,"I do like the motion picture but it is contradictory and conflicting. If you research both comics and the x-men films in the last motion picture it demonstrates Charles and Eric aka Professor X and Magnito going to home of Jean Grey when she was a girl and Charles aka Professor X was walking, where as in the motion picture they have him in a wheel chair before he had met both Jean and Scott. In the comics and at least shown in one of the films he had met both Jean and Scott prior to his accident. The movie itself was very good, and does explain a few things as to how Raven and Charles met...it is informative but a bit contradictory, it does show however Scott aka cyclops and storm in the movie while he is locating mutants.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
X-Men First Class is an X-Men Film Done Right,"After the original three movies and the Wolverine movie, I just couldn't see the point in yet another bloated, melodramatic feature film that would in almost all likelihood be nothing but following Wolverine around as flat characters milled about him doing things with superpowers to other things with superpowers. The promotional stuff for First Class did little to change my mind. Then I heard it was going to be something of a franchise reboot and my interest was piqued.I went into the film with the expectations of seeing a mediocre movie and I came out blown away and quickly having every reason to consider X-Men First Class my favorite of all the Marvel movies so far.The story is rich and multi-layered, covering an amazing amount of ground in the time they have and never having it negatively impact the flow. Its not a cheesy superhero movie plot, that's for sure. And there's certainly no cases of a supervillain having a master plan of turning a politician into a goo monster for kicks.I can not praise the cast enough though. The range the actors showed was amazing. Hank McCoy being a perfect example of this. Going through a distinct personality change due to circumstances without it being ""hit you over the head with a folding chair"" blatant.The writing, oh the writing, especially the dialogue was delicious. The character interaction were natural and believable and outside of a couple of iffy places, the dialogue was refreshingly free of preachy, over-dramatic speeches about morality and acceptance and clichéd monologuing.Suffice to say, this movie is responsible for me starting to have a wee bit of faith in Hollywood again!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Very entertaining. Fassbender steals the show!!,"So, this is where it all began. This prequel shows us how Professor Xavier (and others) came to be. It's no secret, I'm no superhero movie fan, but I do enjoy the X-Men films and characters. I enjoy the way the characters can be humble, vulnerable and emotional. It sets itself apart from other superhero movies in that respect.Michael Fassbender steals the show as young Erik, who would become Magneto. He simply is sensational in this film. James McAvoy stars as Charles Xavier and does the character justice, as well. The film's visual effects are amazing!The film might not be as action-packed as the original Trilogy, but it is nevertheless entertaining and very exciting. 'First Class' also sends out a very strong message of acceptance in society.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Best of the franchise,"Best X-Men movie I've watched. That's even going in with the high expectations borne from the exceptional reception from critics. I enjoyed it more than Thor, which my wife (not a comic book fan) enjoyed more. The story line could easily have been the planned ""X-Men Origins: Magneto"". Many comic book characters introduced, though much were just background fodder. Make-up effects of the blue Beast still leaves much to be desired. Maybe they should have made him CGI. Now I am certain director Vaughn's Kick-Ass wasn't just a fluke. Both improved over his OK Stardust. X-Men comics time line was compressed for this movie, and it amazingly still works. I did not hate the third movie of the franchise like many did, but at least now they need not continue with that thread and will be busy with this one's. Good thing they didn't think of doing a 3D for this one. No extra after-credits scene here.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
XAULTING! One of the best X-Men scripts ever written.,"In First Class we intimately get to know the heart of Charles Xavier, his relationship with Magneto and his desire to protect the X-Men. Also we see the X-Men struggle with their identities in what comes across as one of the best X-Men scripts ever written (there are a lot of different versions).After watching this movie you can see why The X-Men have been around so long. Women's rights, equality, being oneself, revenge, war and much more take place without getting confusing.From the very first scene there is no blink story telling. This is obviously a trait of a great film but this is matched well with great acting (especially on Mcavoy and Fassbender's parts) and a self conscious wittiness, a rarity for this kind of flick which helps set this film over the top.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
very solid,"For a while, this reminded me of the first Iron Man. Very entertaining story, but not much action (not that that's a bad thing.) But then the final action sequence took this a notch above. The story is very well-written and the acting is very good all around. And the big action set-piece is just long enough and is the perfect climax for all the story lines throughout the movie. Plus the action is actually really cool, unlike Iron Man. The team aspect of the X-Men is capitalized upon during the climax, and it's awesome. The special effects are good enough, but won't blow your mind or anything. It might be a tad too long, but overall it's well-cast and well-paced, and most importantly, it reinvigorates the X-Men film franchise after The Last Stand and Wolverine had almost eliminated any goodwill it had left. Matthew Vaughn and everyone else involved with adapting the story deserve a ton of credit for this hugely entertaining film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An X-Men prequel that lives up to it's future sequels,"Rating-7/10X-Men: First Class is a X-Men prequel that boasts a lot of good acting, action and even some good old back stories to really bring the franchise back into the form it was in back in it's day. Parts can be dull but in any sense it is entertaining and the film really starts to get going and the ending is a fine one, the film is what I felt, a safely good film, and here below this introduction, is why I felt so.The story can be a little long to get started and you may feel by the end that the film is also a little long with what is has, though in the end and specifically the ending really bring this film up and it gives you a good bit of a thrill in only the last few minutes of it. It contains some good action scenes as well and of course with the superpowers we see in the series, it introduces these powers in new people with all sorts of weird and wonderful mutations, just good fun to see them bits but the action bits balance it out well too.James McAvoy does well here although I did feel sometimes he is not at his best and a case could be put forward that McAvoy doesn't do well in blockbuster high budget movies. Michael Fassbender is the true hero of this movie with his portrayal of Magneto, he controls every scene he is in and really beats the other actors in his scenes too. Actors such as Jennifer Lawrence and Nicholas Hoult do well but I didn't fell they were spectacular, great acting isn't expected from films like this but a little effort is needed definitely.It is written pretty well and the script is solid throughout with smart lines but also intense wording that can make the scene even more exciting that it already is with the action. The effects in this are nice, not perfect but they do the job and you will see at the end with the numerous special effects needed that they are really well done, not just visually, but also movement wise. Finally it is also directed well, one that is very good as Matthew Vaughn seems to move them as if they are new but also bring back the good old X-Men we miss from the past.It's main criticisms aren't in the acting side of this, it comes mostly from the story with it's, as previously said, slow start. The reason it harms this is because yes a little drama is always good even in a big action superhero blockbuster, but too much and then to take away the things the viewer wants to see, it just harms it, not very bad but it definitely harms a few key scenes here.X-Men fans should enjoy this as it continues it well as a prequel but I think personally it ups the ante the franchise has and really sticks it to the ones before this and challenges it, well you might think that. I think people will like it if they like a good superhero movie that isn't afraid to hold back on the super big action, and have a little back story and build up, this really is for you indeed. Finally I think this is good drama and for budding actors, this could be one the few rare cases of big budget films, where you can actually learn a lot from the way they act.Overall I give this a 7/10, it is Safely a Good movie, it isn't really near being VERY GOOD, but it is more than just a Kind of Good film. With this you have to watch with maybe a little history with X-Men, fans should love it, but also be a superhero fan, it is aimed very much at them and people from anywhere can enjoy it, but hero fans more. One more thing to say, I felt the budget wasn't used enough, they had a big big budget but seemed to hold back on certain aspects where more finance could have helped.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One Quick Rewrite and This Could Be an X-Spoof,"You know there's a problem when you start making up MST3K-style gags in the middle of a movie. X5 has a good opening sequence and goes steadily downhill from there. There is some solid acting and a couple of exciting scenes, but the plot gets more implausible and the characters more laughable with each passing moment. Eventually you realize you're not going to see anything new, that this is as predictable as the typical prequel, and that your time is best spent making up jokes.It's not good when the most memorable image from the movie is Kevin Bacon wearing Magneto's helmet. This is not something that longtime X-Fans have been dying to see on the big screen as far as I know. Aside from the decidedly unthreatening helmet, Bacon would have been a better villain if he spoke with a German accent the whole time as he did in the introduction. The filmmakers forgot a basic rule of pulp films which is that foreign accents equal villainy.They also forgot another rule of comic book movies, which is that ""comic panel""-style scenes are stupid, as Ang Lee's Hulk demonstrated. Yeah, we get it, this is based on a comic book. We don't need to be hit over the head with it. They also spent too much time focusing on how the characters' names get made up, a now tiresome comic book movie cliché.Other than Xavier, Magneto and Mystique's story lines, which are largely rehashed from the previous films, there's almost nothing that works as drama here. The march to Nuclear War was as contrived as I've ever seen that done. I honestly think Superman IV did a better job by just having Lex sneak up and push the launch button himself. X5 asks us to believe that all you have to do to start nuclear war is threaten/buy off/seduce two generals (or whoever). As if neither countries' presidents nor other officials have any say in the matter, but are just puppets of these two guys. The powers-that-be then do stuff that's so despicable, Professor X looks like a dolt for continuing to have faith in humanity. It brings to mind Dark Helmet's point about evil always triumphing because good is dumb.More rehashing comes when this movie sloppily shoehorns in a redo of the ""cure"" subplot from X3. Beast claims he can normalize his appearance yet retain his powers. But since his powers are a physical ability caused by his body being in the mutated shape that it is, what he says makes absolutely no sense.First Class also suffers from the old ""Submarine Crew"" problem of having a bunch of characters that are necessary to perform functions in the story, but are woefully underdeveloped. Half the characters here serve no purpose other than to be special effects. I think even Professor X realizes his new recruits are disposable, since he almost kills one of them in some reckless training exercises without giving it a second thought. The movie signals that it doesn't consider the new characters important by putting together an extremely slapdash special effects sequence to introduce them.Then there's the ""Batman Begins"" problem of running out of decent new characters to introduce since they're up to the 5th movie already. Hence we end up with a ""G.I. Joe: The Movie (1987)"" Big Lob-esque mutant who has the strangest, most inexplicable and illogical power since Spider-Man's spider sense...at least the version that was so sensitive it could warn Spidey if he wrote a bad check. His power to basically ""do anything he needs to do when he needs to do it"" strains credibility as much as it induces humor. There's usually something off about new characters written into an adaptation that weren't vetted through the normal channels the pre-existing characters were. If you recall, Big Lob's great military specialty in G.I. Joe was that he could dribble grenades like a basketball, or something.Worse yet, every somewhat interesting new character is dispensed with perfunctorily. Instead of having a big psychic face-off between White Queen and Xavier as a change of pace from shooting, kicking and punching, she's all but forgotten about. Much more could have been made of the human allies of the mutants, but the Bill Richardson-esque CIA agent and Moira basically vanish after they perform their duty in the plot, one of them in the most anticlimactic way since what happened to Xavier in X3.Let's also consider X-Stripper, whose power is that she can give you one hell of a ""buzz"" in the champagne room. She makes me question the strategy of rounding up every single mutant to create this elite task force. Let's say there was a mutant who had the power to pass enough gas to stink up an entire aircraft carrier. Would they want him on the team too?There remain lingering questions. How do the X-Men operate their jet without being shot down? How does Beast single-handedly build the thing in the first place? Exactly what happens to all the energy that one character absorbs at one point? I feel like I was cheated out of a big explosion here. How exactly would Xavier pull off eluding the CIA? Shouldn't he set up shop outside a Pakistani military base to be more inconspicuous?This movie is ridiculous enough that with one slight nudge it could become a raucous comedy. One mistake was not deflating some of the hot air by putting more humor in the movie. There's only one funny line and few attempts to create any kind of comic relief. This series needs to lighten up. Or at least do something different. That didn't happen here. People are going to get sick of comic book movies if they keep showing us the same movie they've already shown us twenty times before (no thanks to you, Harry Potter, for popularizing this idea). It also helps when these movies make sense.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I'd say it earns itself a solid B,"During the Cold War, Magneto joins Xavier in an effort to stop Sebastian Shaw. This movie has the same problems as the others in the franchise... too many characters(leading to not enough development, albeit what there is can be great) and superpowers(and in this, not all of them are even used all that interestingly... Angel didn't need to be in this), if there are good introductions to both. Added are the issues of trying to rush through events in a shortened timeframe and without an excessive running time. It does work out(this keeps to a nice pace), but it doesn't establish things(such as the brotherly relationship between Erik and Charles) as well as it could if it had spread the events out over several films. Still, it fares quite well. It's unlike the others in tone, closer to a Bond flick(and not only because of the period), that happens to have mutants for operatives. It's brutal at times, with Lensherr's quest for revenge. This isn't really ""action"" as much as ""thriller"", and build-up and tension is the focus more than battles between people with abilities. The performances are strong, and the actors are well-cast. There are some memorable sequences in this, including the best flight I've seen since the original Iron Man. The humor is hit and miss. There is partial nudity(Mystique) and brief strong language in this. I recommend this to fans of the comic books and the other recent adaptations(except Origins: Wolverine and X-Men 3). 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Best X-men yet, very involving, but unbelievable","Many a reviewer here loves this film and at first watching, so did I. However, being a movie buff, I tended to relive the film in my memory and moments during the film that very briefly had me going ""what the?"" came to the fore. Upon seeing parts of it again, those issues were exaggerated.Acting was mostly great. Xavier, Magneto and Raven are prominent here. Ice girl (or whatever her name was) was nothing more than breasts.Story was mostly great. Where it sucked was the sudden conversion of Magneto and especially Raven from friend to enemy. And, when the Russians fire a missile (controlled by Xavier) this missile magically happened to be pointed at one of their own fleet!!!I get it, they're mutant so they have special powers, but surviving unscathed from crashing in an aircraft or submarine is not one of those special powers! And magneto has powers over non magnetic metals! Come on!Obviously not intended to stand against scientific plausibility.Overall.

A Surprisingly Good Prequel,"While it's not perfect and certainly not the best one in the franchise, X-men: First Class is too good for a film that was doomed to fail.The highest achievement of this film is its existence itself. When it began production, director Matthew Vaughn had only ten months to shoot the film and that too without a proper script. In Spite of that, Vaughn managed to tell a proper story about identity politics set in the backdrop of the Cuba missile crisis while also blowing some stuff up. To add to that, this film was colorful and lighter in both tone and look, unlike the serious tone of the first two X-Men films.The opening scene of the film introduces the two main protagonists of the story - Charles Xavier and Erik Lehnsherr, by bringing out the stark contrasts in their respective childhoods. While Xavier was born into a privileged, wealthy family, Erik on the other hand was separated from his mother in a Nazi death camp before witnessing her death and later being experimented upon by the villainous Dr. Schmidt, later called Sebastian Shaw. Both of these scenes play out incredibly well and set-up the motivations of these characters.Both James McAvoy and Michael Frassbender were perfect for the roles of a young Charles Xavier and a young Erik Lehnsherr respectively. The whole movie revolves around the growing friendship between these two characters and their eventual fallout. However, the friendship between these two characters feels superficial. While it is properly justified on how they grew close over the course of time, all of that happens off-screen so there's a very little reason to buy into their brotherly bond. This also makes their fallout underwhelming. Nevertheless, the charisma brought in by the actors makes it feel less fake.Another problem is that the choices made by some characters feel absurd even though they fit within the dynamics of that character. In one scene, the villain Sebastian Shaw infiltrates the CIA mutant facility and offers a choice to all young mutants to join him. At this moment, Angel, a fairy-like mutant leaves her friends behind and joins a complete stranger who wants to start a nuclear holocaust. While this choice is justifiable, it comes so quick and that too without any self-conflict.Coming to the acting, it was perfect. Like it was mentioned before, both James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender knock it out of the park. Fassbender was so good in his role that he effortlessly outweighs other actors in each and every scene he's in. While he's known for playing the good guys a lot, Kevin Bacon delivers an amazing performance as the film's main antagonist, Sebastian Shaw. The other side actors too, fill their roles perfectly well.In conclusion, X-Men: First Class is a bit better than an average movie and that too because it escaped certain doom. It also needs to be stated that the solo Magneto movie, that was supposed to be made instead of this one, would've been several times better. This conclusion stems from the fact that Magneto was the main character in the film and watching him hunt down Nazis like a gentleman sleuth was way better than watching him gaze at other mutants disinterestedly.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A bit disappointed...,"I really wanted to like the movie, as I very much like the franchise so far, but it just did not do it for me.

Like we were only shown some highlights here and there, before taking us to the final scene with the submarine. I liked what I saw, but I felt like there was a lot missing to make the movie ""complete"", in lack of a better word. It seemed to me that they had the script for a mini series, but had to cut the script to fit a 2 hour movie, so they had to leave out the little things that tied the story together. I could really wish for an extended cut of the movie, clocking 3,5 - 4 hours. That would probably make it more interesting to me.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A fun mix of actual historical events with a comic book storyline,"X-Men: First Class is a fun mix of actual historical events with a comic book storyline. There are some bothersome inconsistencies between this film and the other four, and it was fairly long, but overall it was an entertaining ride with good performances and some fantastic visual effects.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
X-men First Class is a solid reboot.,"X-Men: First Class is arguably the best of the X-Men series which comes as a relief. Part of the reason why First Class is so successful is that it places emphasis over the characters rather than plot. At the heart of the movie is the relationship between Professor Xavier and Erik Lensherr. The movie does an excellent job of crosscutting between Erik and Professor Xavier's childhood to showcase how their unique mutant powers have shaped them. Erik grew up in a Nazi concentration camp in Poland and Charles Xavier grew up in an affluent mansion in upstate New York.Needless to say, when Erik and Charles eventually meet each other as adults, it's clearly obvious that these two have very different ideology's about how to do deal with humans, and the film plays with this idea to some degree. Charles Xavier first meets Erik Lensherr for the first time in Miami, and the rest of the film showcases them recruiting other mutants. Unfortunately, the film has X-Men in the title, so there are other supporting mutant characters integral to the film as well.Alas, most of these characters are underdeveloped, and because of this, you come to know them by their powers instead of their personalities. However, the performances by James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender are good enough to anchor the film. Fassbender, in particular, is a standout he plays Erik Lensherr as a charismatic James Bond type with a real chip on his shoulder.His performance as Erik Lensherr is absolutely magnetic if you forgive the pun. Xavier, however, is a little bland, but this is due to no fault on McAvoy's part. The writers obviously couldn't figure out how to make Xavier a more compelling character. Fortunately, McAvoy's performance is good enough to make up for this oversight. Jennifer Lawrence is good as Mystique/Raven she gives Mystique a certain naive sweetness. Kevin Bacon is also excellent as the megalomaniac mutant Sebastian Shaw.Unfortunately, his character is never really given any real depth, he's simply a one-dimensional villain. The film also would have benefited from exploring the creator/monster dichotomy between Sebastian Shaw and Erik Lensherr a bit further. It was one of the more intriguing ideas in the film that was left unexplored. Overall, X-Men: First Class is an entertaining action film with good performances from its two leads, and it has some pretty kinetic action sequences scattered throughout the film. The film is definitely a must see for those that were disappointed with the last two X-Men films.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Big Budget Blandness,"Hollywood still seems to think that the way to do well at the box office is to throw huge amounts of money at a project and have most of that budget allocated to the special effects. This movie could have been great, James M. still did a good job with the poor script that he had, and the rest of the cast were fine too-Kevin Bacon especially - pulled off the Shaw role really well... Come on though Hollywood! Why take a great story and turn it into this trite waste of money?Oh it has to be ten lines of comprehensive-reviewing-text does it? That seems a little unnecessary - what about the idea of 'short and sweet'? After all - can a haiku not be at least as profound and effective as an epic poem?

Its such a disappointment that you have failed to make this film fit in well with the others. For me personally it has spoilt the rest of the films and should have had more thought put into how the story would fit in with the others. I am aware that everything else fits in but this is such a poor error that should not have been made.

"Much sweetness, not enough bitterness","I guess I have discovered the way to compare emotions to taste. If we consider the beautiful action scenes, romantic relationships, humor with sweetness, this movie brings interesting and enjoyable things. Michael Fassbender in particular makes us want to see more live-action Magneto. Overall, the cast of First Class is talented and they play the important characters very well. But obviously if you want the film to have weight, pay attention to the bitterness, which is what is missing here. There is no emotional sacrifice. The supporting characters, including the mutants, just show up and follow orders. The main villain Sebastian Shaw suddenly gets cosmic-level superpowers out of nowhere. His goal is to destroy humanity blah blah, which is too boring. His death is the same. While the story of First Class is good and smooth, there is not much that stands out. The film does a good job of connecting the X-Men story and real-life events. I like that. But the story would be better if the bitterness was added.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Takes the series back to its roots, both literally and figuratively.","'X-men First Class (2011)' stripped the series back a little, arguably closer to its roots, to focus on character development rather than overt spectacle and is all the better for it. Its new cast is great as the young characters, especially McAvoy and Fassbender who - along with a nuanced and layered script - convincingly portray the origins of their respectful yet tumultuous relationship. It doesn't quite capture the spirit of the original, but has a lot more life in its presentation and provided a successful revitalisation to a franchise that was running out of steam. Like its predecessors, it is at its best when pondering the thematic quandaries at the heart of its core concepts but it also has a few stand-out set-pieces and some nice dark, yet understated, brutality (the concentration camp makes a return). It isn't wholly necessary but the prequel idea wasn't entirely played out at this point and this feature does a lot with the origins of interesting characters, unlike 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009)' before it, and started the series in a new, and initially fresh, direction. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
kudos to the writers of xmen first class,"a very entertaining film. from start to finish, everything just moves smoothly. this is what i call tight writing in a script. every scene just has it's up, down, and perfect transition into the next scene. at no point in the movie will your mind be wandering or your attention wane. the movie grips you from start to finish. yeah, it has its clichés, and tired messages due to the material being used. but really, if you're just out wanting to have a good, rolickin' time, then i suggest you watch this movie in a theatre together with your S.O. or your entire family. after the atrociousness that is Wolverine, the X-men franchise just got saved by James McAvoy and crew. now, if only they can do even better for the upcoming Gambit spin-off. that film can really use Nolan's genius.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Terrible script, nothing mystique about it, very disappointed","I went to see this movie based on the IMDb rating of 8.3! Rarely do we see a title with such a high rating so it must really really good right? Right from the start of the movie the story is completely irrelevant to what the X-Men (and women) are, and I mean completely, it went on and on for about 20 minutes and the topic kept on re-emerging throughout the movie until the end, the guilt and the guilty, the revenge, etc... No spoiler here don't worry. This movie franchise has clearly been hijacked by a group of people that not only don't know how to make movies are terrible at writing scripts and worse at casting. The only person that saved this movie is James McAvoy, everyone else's acting might as well fit out of a teen/pre-teen TV show basically, even Kevinv Bacon was no convincing, I found myself looking around for an exit sign.What happened to the Hugh Jackman and Halle Berry caliber? This movie is so cheap and so disappointing from start to end.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
fan-tastic,"I usually do not write reviews but on this one I just HAD to! I am a great fan of the X-Men, starting to collect the comics when I was a kid. My favorite was always Wolverine and - although the first 3 X-Men movies were okay - he was never as good as in the comics. Hugh Jackmann was just not the right guy for me... Having said that, I was not sure what this movie would be like (no Wolverine - except a short cameo). I must admit, I was more than pleasantly surprised and am tempted to state this is the best X-Men movie of all of them. I did like the first movie but they just got more and more shallow and more about Wolverine than the X-Men. However, the cast was supreme (apart from Hugh Jackman). LOVED THIS MOVIE and will Certainly recommend it to fans of the ""real story"" - although this was never part of it. Job well done",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Beyond EXpectations,"X Men is one of my favourite franchises of all time I've liked most of them but I wasn't entirely sure if this film was going to be my cup of tea but I could not have been more far off and could not have loved it more. The whole plot of this film revolves around the friendship between Xavier and Eric, even though we knew that they were eventually going to fall out the filmmakers could not have done a better job at portraying their friendship. They are very well set up as very different characters and feel as if they can both achieve what they want through each other. The chemistry between James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender was amazing and it helped to make the film much more investing. Jennifer Lawrence was also fantastic in this movie as Mystique she real carried her characters conflicted nature throughout. The villains in this film were also fantastic, ill admit their motivations were a bit conventional but it terms of pure threat level and back story they were done just right and set up as the perfect opposing force to the mutants. Another thing that I loved about this movie is that all the characters contribute something to the plot whether it be through there abilities or opinions it proves that the X Men franchise is much more than just pure superhero entertainment but thought provoking drama that in some ways mirrors real life. We got to see things in this film that we have never seen in any of the other films in this series, for one we see younger more relatable versions of Professor X and Magneto, we see Charles as a young bachelor and his humble beginnings, we see a vulnerable and in some ways reckless Magneto and it not only adds something to this film but to the franchise itself. Another thing we saw in this film that we've never seen in any other X Men films is he actual recruitment and training of the mutants, we get to see just how Xavier did it and lived up to all expectations. When we eventually see the fall out of Magneto and Professor X it's heartbreaking, we see just how similar yet different both of them are and it really helps to give context to the rest of the franchise.This film was not only a gift to all fans of X Men but a very entertaining, thought provoking drama that builds up and gives context to a lot of events that we've heard about in the other films. All the casting was perfect, McAvoy and Fassbender have absolutely amazing chemistry and is easily one of this franchises best instalments.100%/A+",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Spectacular!,"This film is about how the mutants with supernatural powers finding out about each other, group together and then help save the world.""X-Men: First Class"" is truly spectacular, even when my expectations are high for a summer blockbuster! The plot is engaging, understandable and most important of all, makes a lot of sense. Events happen to echo what will happen years later (the previous X-Men films) with great continuity. The special effects are marvellous, I am still in awe by the scene involving a fancy yacht and its anchor. I really like Michael Fassbender's character, he is cold and filled with hatred. When it comes to revenge, he means serious business! ""X-Men: First Class"" have many emotional elements to connect with the sensitive side, making ""X-Men: First Class"" appealing to an even broader audience.

"Pretty good, entertaining, better than I expected, casting quibble","I rarely if ever have added a spoiler to my reviews here, and I shall not now.First I'll say that I've recently been watching the entire X-Men series in chronological order for essentially the first time (I'd seen the first film when it was released but watched it again here), and went in without any influence or expectations (I don't even read the story off the box first), so each film was watched with a thoroughly open mind. Since I'm not going to review each one on IMDb, I'll only say that the only one that I didn't like was ""Wolverine: Origins"". That movie was awful; the rest were good to very good.I expected First Class to be marketing on the X-Men franchise but without adding anything unique or relevant to the story; however, I was pleasantly wrong. In fact, I found it to be quite entertaining, well acted, and slightly significant to the rest of the series.Only minor complaint was, could they have hired actors to play young Magneto and Professor X that look any less like their older counterparts? When the only physical requirement for casting was that they were thin, white, and British, it made the whole connection with the older versions too difficult. Neither styles nor mannerisms presented by Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen were attempted by the younger actors.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
eXcellent,"When I watched this film, I honestly expected it to be a load of codswallop. Seriously, another X-Men movie - and a prequel, no less! I went in with low expectations. But this film was pure awesome. Special effects are top notch, dialogue is intelligent, sequences are engaging, action is awesome, characters are very believable, the soundtrack is brilliant (it kept rolling through my head for months) and the list goes on. Fassbender's Magneto has some really good acting and very quotable quotes, while Xavier is pure coolness. The other mutants are also likable and there isn't really anything to complain about in this film as far as I can see,Very possibly the best X-Men film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Better Than Most Prequels,"Before watching I expected to be watching a prequel with inexperienced , cheesy acting filled with cliches and lines that tried to connect to the original films but didn't work. While some of this was present, for the most part I think Vaughan did a pretty decent job creating a prequel for the original movies. It provided enough backstory to the characters that it added to the originals instead of hurting them, which unfortunately is what many prequels end up doing.Still I think a bit too much time was wasted on the skills and attributes/ mutations than on the characters themselves. They tried to build a backstory with Professor X and Mystique, but it didn't have enough to feel genuine. In general, I felt they left a lot on the table with Mystique. It would have been interesting to see more of the internal struggle she was experiencing. Further, in developing Magneto, it would have been neat to see more flashbacks of his time with Shaw.With regards to Shaw, he is potentially the worst developed character. We have no idea how he obtained his powers and have no idea where his motivations arise from. This is hugely problematic for a lead villain in any film.Overall, the movie helps the series, but it had the potential to be much more.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of the best prequels ever!,"I know when it comes to prequels, you usually end up with something disappointing like Star Wars: The Phantom Menace or X-Men Origins: Wolverine. But what makes prequel so great is the acting, the cast, the directing, the script, the action, the characters and special effects all work so well together that it's hard not to watch this movie.I think one of my favourite things about it is the cast, especially James McAvoy as young Professor X and Jennifer Lawrence as young Mystique and their relationships with each other. Like Charles Xavior and Raven/Mystique have a brother/sister relationship. Moira acts as Charles' love interest. Charles and Eric Lehnsherr act as good friends and companions but have different views for mutants and humans as they did in the previous trilogy. Hank/Beast and Raven kind of have a love interest for each other. Even the other minor characters have interesting relationships. Like Hank and Alex/Havoc have trouble getting along because Alex is kind of a jock and Hank is a nerd, but Alex learns to appreciate Hank for being smart and useful.My favourite character in this X-Men movie is probably Professor X because he's wise and loyal and he's a good leader to the mutants and trains them well. I also really like Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique. She's a real rising star in Hollywood with other movies like Winter's Bone and The Hunger Games. But I think this was her best performance ever because I like how she portrayed Mystique as being compassionate and gentle but she also wants to be accepted in society as a mutant. I also think Kevin Bacon was a even better villain as Sebastian Shaw than Ian McKellen was as Magneto in the original trilogy because he seemed almost unstoppable. In fact, part of me is sad that they killed him off. And I also like how this movie connects with the Cold War and the Cuban Missile Crisis. I like how Wolverine made a cameo which was pretty clever.After watching this movie, I can't wait for the prequel to come out in 2014, X-Men: Days of Future. Now it may not be as good as this one, but I just it will be at least decent. And I'm also looking forward to The Wolverine which is coming out next year. But hopefully it won't be as bad a X-Men Origins: Wolverine.Overall, this prequel is tied with X2 as my favourite X-Men movie and also one of my favourite superhero movies and one of the best movies of 2011.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
X: First Class,"If it's not sacrilegious for a Brit, I found this outing for the ""X-Men"" to be far better without the presence of the two elderly thespians who usually underpin these adventures. James McCoy takes on the mantle of the younger ""Xavier"" with Michael Fassbender introducing us to the role of ""Erik"". The former has the ability to read minds, his friend to manipulate metal. By means of flashbacks, we learn the back story for both of these characters, illustrating how they met and started to work together to ensure that their kind were safe and sound in an increasingly hostile world of human paranoia and suspicion. They are making progress until the re-emergence of ""Shaw"" (Kevin Bacon). Now he and ""Erik"" have a past - and the latter blames the other for leading atrocities carried out by the Nazis on his Polish family during WWII. His determination to seek revenge causes a rift between the two friends, and soon they - and their respective followers - are at loggerheads whilst a dangerous nuclear war looms for an humanity caught up in a devious cross-fire. Bacon isn't at his best here, he isn't remotely menacing - but the others, including Jennifer Lawrence's ""Raven"" and Nicholas Hoult's geeky ""Hank"" work well to give us quite an action-packed flavour of the birth of ""Magneto"" and of the foundations of his later hostilities with the ""X-Men"". The visual effects deliver well and the underlying narrative actually offers us a bit to think about - forgiveness, vengeance, fear and intolerance are all touched upon with a superior script that doesn't entirely rely on the effects and pyrotechnics to make it's point. This film works better on a big screen, these stories never really thrive on the television, and is easily - for my money - the best of the franchise I've yet seen.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

I'm a huge xmen and all things comic book fan but the recent trend in the movie industry is to put out butchered comic book movies just to make the big bucks.,"I'm a huge x-men and all things comic book fan but the recent trend in the movie industry is to put out butchered comic book movies just to make the big bucks. The x-men series, the hulk and even the batman and remake of superman movies attest to that. They all sucked, why you may ask, well crappy story lines that deviate from the originals, bad acting, and shitty cgi action scenes. These movies just seem to kid oriented which is good for the people collecting the paychecks (bigger demographic = bigger payday) but sucks for true more mature fans who covet a more sophisticated and grittier cinematic presentation. Dark Knight was a god send and a true testament to how every adaptation of a once thought ""kid"" genre can make big waves on the big screen.

Definitely worth a watch.,"OK, so I've seen X-Men: First Class at least a couple of times now and suffice it to say it definitely holds up to repeat viewings. Let's start with the good.The casting is great, the two leads Erik Lehnsherr (Fassbender) and Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) have great chemistry between them and these are the most important roles in the movie, so you need strong actors for that.The entire plot revolves around the dynamic between these two characters and it's the better for it.Erik Lensherr comes from a troubled (German concentration camp) past which results in this sort of bottled rage which is his source of purpose in his older years.""My anger outweighs my guilt."" Heresy! How dare I use a quote from a Batman movie!But honestly, I think the same applies to Magneto with a big difference of course. He is blind to the fact that he is on the road to becoming what he hates the most. This difference in ideology between Erik and Charles is what causes the conflict between them.Fassbender certainly proves up to the task and I can honestly say I enjoyed his performance as Magneto more than Sir Ian Mckellan's.Without saying much, James McAvoy as (Professor) Charles Xavier is equally brilliant. He exudes a calmness and gives off the sense of a man wise beyond his years. I enjoyed his performance and it was also fun seeing X's younger years.The action/special effects are remarkable, which is to be expected from a (Marvel) comic-book movie. And I liked the music too, in particular, Magneto's theme.If I had one complaint it's the constant hammering of the idea of feeling out of place. I get why they do it, it just gets annoying after a while.All in all, if you're a fan of comic books (movies), you should make sure to see this.If you're not, it's still good entertainment.9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

If Only George Lucas Could Make A Prequel This Good,"In X-Men: First Class we meet Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr before took the names Professor X and Magneto, they were two young men discovering their powers for the first time.

In the process, a rift between them opened, which began the eternal war between Magneto's Brotherhood and Professor X's X-MEN.I can't praise the cast enough of this movie enough here. Especially Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence and McCavoy, but for me the star of the show is Kevin Bacon. He is delightfully devious. He is always reliable, but here he is truly awesome. Oliver Platt also deserves special mention too.Prequels that totally recast popular characters are always on shaky ground, but given the talent involved, I'm not surprised this found an audience.X-Men: First Class is a highly professional piece of work, swift and suspenseful, with a good sense of pace and atmosphere it makes for almost perfect entertainment.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Surprisingly good-kind of a history lesson,"I grew up reading DC comics and lived through the Cuban missile crisis when I was in high school. Marvel comics came a little late for me, so I was unfamiliar with a lot of their characters. I have seen all the other X-Men movies and while I enjoyed them, I was a little lost in the characters, their powers and their origins. This movie, much like Batman Begins or Star Wars I, fills us in on the beginnings of characters that we have already been exposed to.It is really neat that the writers weaved the missile crisis with historical clips into the story. Just as I was out of the era of the characters, the majority of viewers will be unaware that the crisis was very real and very serious. I just hope that they do not believe this is the way it was actually averted. Perhaps it will encourage a few viewers to look into the history of it and the Cold War of that era. While they are at it, since the beginning of the movie was set in a camp during the Holocaust, a look into that era and the mindset of a few people would add to your understanding of how the mental and emotional being could be affected by the experience.For those who like action and special effects, they are all there and pretty well done. There is nothing there that I can remember saying that I have never seen anything like that before. The computer generated graphics do not have the pasted up look that you see in many attempts. The nice thing is that the movie does not consist of nothing but action and special effects-there is actually a decent story line. That in itself is becoming quite rate in most movies.All in all, this was a good attempt to fill us in on how it all began. Obviously, the ending set us up for a sequel.

Marks the Beginning,"After Matthew Vaughn refused a prior X-Men movie, he finally came and made this one. And it seems like he made the right decision.

Still even as it is, there are of course a few things to be considered (timeline-wise) and even I could see and smile about a few nods to things/nods to future happenings.It has be said, that this is a stand-alone and has not that much to do with the other X-Men movies. But since I am not that aware of the comics I can only compare it to the other movies. And this is definitely a very good entry into the series (and ties can still be found, with one particular cameo that was just really funny).Apart from the coherent story and nice build up (even if you can see where it is going and you probably will), the other thing that makes this movie special, are the actors.

X-Men: First Class (2011),"X-MEN: FIRST CLASS does a lot of things right in providing smart and exciting entertainment with strong lead performances and a solid origin story. James McAvoy charms as a young Professor X as he brings both the charisma and intelligence required to portray the revered character in a genuine, respected, and eventually sympathetic manner. Likewise, Michael Fassbender commands the screen with his powerful presence as Magneto; he displays an impressive control of emotions, balancing a coolness when calm is needed with the pain and intimidation and anger that conflicts and fuels his character for much of the narrative. This film hinges on the quality of these two leading roles given the enormity and relevance of the two characters in the Marvel comic book lore. And as the film's highest marks, both McAvoy and Fassbender deliver.With that said, the film, as entertaining as it may be, has its flaws. Kevin Bacon plays Sebastian Shaw with your typical supervillain destroy-the-world (or something similar) mentality in which he smirks and smiles and scoffs his way through the film. His henchmen are even more one-dimensional - an especially stoney performance from January Jones. Additionally, Vaughn can't help but include campy elements like his depiction of Cold War threats and visions, corny thick-headed generals, cliché military leaders barking out cliché orders in cliché environments - elements that add an excruciating cartoon factor to an otherwise smart narrative; flaws that dumb the film down by resorting to lazy developments that reflect the typical run-of-the-mill Hollywood blockbuster. These shortcomings are unfortunate since FIRST CLASS does offer a compelling story that delves deep into significant societal issues that include prejudice, race, and an us-vs-them mindset. These themes were always a strength of the X-Men universe and an asset that proves vital to this narrative arc, and Vaughn successfully nails it here.In the end, FIRST CLASS is a very good movie that rises above its X-Men peers. It delivers a last act in which the acting, visual effects, and action come together to form a gripping and sufficient climax. Composer Henry Jackman's score also stands out and makes watching X and Magneto grow into their personas that much more riveting. Though the flaws are frustrating, Matthew Vaughn's film is still well-made and marks an auspicious new beginning for the franchise.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
a loud and proud preface with balls and brains to spare.,"First class by name, first class by nature, this explosive chapter in the wilting X-Men film anthology is not just the best of the bunch by an absolute mile, it's also a complete game- changer. Following the abysmal Last Stand, it couldn't get much worse for mutant buffs. Then it did; the awful Wolverine origins tale of rise and maul was a daft and rushed affair rife with flaws and frailties. It was the Batman and Robin of X-Men movies. Back to the drawing board, then; the failing franchise in desperate need of its Batman Begins.Enter Kick-Ass helmer Matthew Vaughn and co. with a heady and rousing cold-war embroiled script charting the genesis of the original mutant coalition lead by then chums Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and Erik Lehnsheer (Michael Fassbender). Before they were worn, sworn enemies and answered to Professor X and Magneto, the two forged an elite class of mutants to help bring down a band of baddies hell-bent on sparking World War 3. X-Men: First Class chronicles the events that made the early-day mutants X-Men fans know and love and love to hate while shedding light on some unfamiliar faces like nasty Nazi Sebastian Shaw (a dastardly Kevin Bacon) and the seductive Emma Frost (January Jones).Featuring a horde of nods and groundwork to what lies ahead in both the comics and films, Vaughn's vision is an action-packed and highly satisfying benchmark in superhero cinema. Yeah, yeah, Chris Nolan's Batman renaissance may be the bee's knees but to class it in the superhero niche with the likes of First Class would be wrong. OK, they're both inspired renewals of mainstream material with top-class acting but ask yourself this; would you see a submarine being plucked from the sea by a magnetic man in a Batman movie? Exactly.Over-the-top First Class undoubtedly is, then, but that's not to say it's ridiculous in its scope and execution when its context is considered. Set in the sixties and amongst the paranoia surrounding an imminent nuclear war, the film's historical backdrop helps establish an air of fidelity despite being pure baloney. There is plenty viewers can relate and refer to; prejudice, friendship, love, loss, anger, revenge, Nazis, the Cuban missile crisis, war and peace.The brunt of the film's class lies within its cast, though; both McAvoy and Bacon give exceptional and highly-convincing character performances inside their taut and tailored roles but it's Michael Fassbender who owns all. Complex, tortured and conflicted to the core, who better to take on the vengeful Holocaust refugee than the intense and immense method man. The German born thesp of Irish descent turns in yet another absorbing performance of great concentration and great effort. His measured turns in the likes of Hunger, Fishtank and Inglorious Bastards ensured he earned the praise and respect of film buffs but seldom that of the mainstream. Until now. With this film and this performance, Fassbender can no longer be ignored. He could well be the best thing to happen to big-screen acting since Christian Bale. Expect more from him. It's rare for a film of this ilk be praised for its acting. Without it, the emotional impact and poise of key scenes would be lost. It's the best the action/adventure genre has had to offer since, you've guessed it, The Dark Knight.X-Men: First Class is a spectacular slice of high-octane, globe-trotting cinema and is nothing short of a revelation that action film fans and X-Men nuts should ready themselves to marvel at; a loud and proud preface with balls and brains to spare. Add to that a chic and pulsating score, a wry Hugh Jackman cameo and the urgent need for a follow-up and you're left with two words. You know what they are; first...class.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Very strong prequel with great lead performances,"Professor Charles Xavier and Eric Lehnsherr join forces to battle Sebastian Shaw.'X-men: First Class' is an very enjoyable origin movie that mixes character development and spectacle well.The story of Xavier and Lehnsherr does a great job of showing how their relationship evolves into what is portrayed in the original X-Men movies. As characters they are cleverly written depicting a parallel of each other's very opposite starts in life. This makes their differing attitudes towards humanity highly plausible.What makes it work so well are the excellent performances of James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender. Depicting characters made famous on screen by other actors is difficult to achieve due to the obvious comparisons made. McAvoy actually feels like a younger version of Sir Patrick Stewart. Fassbender definitely does not feel like a young Sir Ian McKellen, but he puts his own take on the character that works fantastically well.As for the other characters, I found them to be solid. Jennifer Lawrence is great as Mistique, likewise Kevin Bacon as Sebastian Shaw. Although Shaw is written as a fairly one-dimensional baddie, but we can't have everything.The alternative history element of the script is used quite cleverly by setting the main plot during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Also the casting of January Jones, who at the time was playing another 60s alternative history icon Betty Draper, helps establish the period feel. There is some very 'Mad Men' like sexism thrown into some of the movie's dialogue.The visuals are as spectacular as you would imagine from a comic book movie. However, the general cinematography, editing and art design is top drawer. Some scenes with Lehnsherr using the imposing Magneto theme music are epic.Easily my favourite scenes involve Lehnsherr. The 5 reichsmark coin works brilliantly in a cinematic way to remind the viewer of his character motivations. It is similar to the use of the watch chimes in 'For A Few Dollars More'.Some parts are slightly frustrating. One element of the plot changes part of Xavier's backstory presented in a previous film. There is nothing wrong with this depiction of the event, but truly great writers are able to keep continuity and tell a great new story. There are some eye-rolling moments of characters speech-making, and the ""Mutant and Proud"" phrase is cringeworthy.For me it is a 8.5/10 but I round upwards.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"""X-Men: First Class""- A well-constructed and oft-thrilling backstory for the iconic mutant team!","Since its debut in 2000, 20th Century Fox's ""X-Men"" film franchise has stood tall as one of the longest-running and generally most successful comic-to-film franchises of all time- currently boasting ten entries and with several more sequels, prequels and follow-ups looming on the horizon. But it hasn't always been a smooth ride as any fan will tell you, and the quality of the individual films has ranged from stellar to sub- par, depending on the entry and the creative team behind them. And this is best exemplified by the first five entries... with the original two films being very fun and well-constructed action- adventures, only to be followed-up by two lackluster let-downs in the form of ""The Last Stand"" and ""Origins.""But then something magical happened. After a two-picture absence, original director Bryan Singer returned to produce and co-write the fifth chapter in the ever-growing saga, with Matthew Vaughn taking the reigns and assembling a talented cast of relative newcomers. And together, these brilliantly creative minds unleashed ""X-Men: First Class"", a quasi-prequel that gives us the previously hinted-at backstory of Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr, and how they became the best of friends before turning into bitter enemies. ""First Class"" is a very well assembled and often thrilling installment in the franchise that boasts strong visuals, likable characters and a surprising depth!Haunted by the death of his family and his own exploitation at a Nazi prison camp during his youth, Erik Lensherr (Michael Fassbender) seeks to use his mutant powers of magnetism to strike back against his former tormentor- a twisted man named Sebastian Shaw. (Kevin Bacon) At the same time, young telepath Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and his shape-shifting adoptive sister Raven/Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) find themselves pulled into the world of the CIA by agent Moira MacTaggert (Rose Byrne), to be used as consultants working against Shaw. Eventually, the two men meet and form a strong but begrudging friendship, putting together a team of mutants known as the ""X- Men""... But Lensherr's past agony and pain might be too much of a burden on the group, and threatens to tear them apart...The strength of the film lies in the surprisingly thoughtful and complex story that Vaughn and Singer weave, in addition the keen visual direction and highly likable cast. The story is an emotional roller-coaster, with many twists and turns to keep the audience invested all while still grounding the plot in real human relationships. Much of the film is centered on the interpersonal friendships between Erik, Charles and Raven, and they give the story a strong foundation to build upon. At its heart, ""First Class"" is a story about damaged people, and how confronting the past can either save or destroy us. Thankfully, the film avoids being bogged down in constant turmoil through clever humor brought about by the youthful energy of the team, and it strikes a fine balance. It's never too harsh to be entertaining, nor is it ever too fun to be impactful.Vaughn's brilliant eye for composition and flow never ceases to amaze, and ""First Class"" is arguably the most visually arresting film of the franchise. Vaughn's films always have a certain ""hyper-reality"" to them in terms of style and tone, and it mixes well with the series that Singer has established. There's plenty of eye-popping action and subversive thrills to be had, in addition to some subtle and very intimate scenes. It's a very well-made film. And this is only made all the better by the magnificent cast. McAvoy and Fassbender both command the screen with their performances, and are each given many a moment to shine as they go through life-changing experiences. Particularly Fassbender, who is just awe-inspiring as the man who will become Magneto. I also quite enjoyed Lawrence (in her pre-""Hunger Games"" days) and Byrne in their more supportive roles as the women in Xavier's life. Both have unique and clearly defined character arcs and add a lot to the film. Other parts played by the likes of Nicholas Hoult, Lucas Till and Caleb Landry Jones as members of the ""X-Men"" team are pitch- perfect in their casting. And of course, special commendations go to the delightful Kevin Bacon, who does a great job as a scenery- chewing baddie that you'll just love to hate. Also, keep your eyes peeled for a surprise cameo that I won't spoil, but made the entire film for me!Unfortunately, I do have to say that there are some minor problems holding the film back just shy of perfection. While the movie is well-paced and well-structured for much of its run-time, the third act is a bit messy and relies too much on generic clichés to strike home with the same impact as the rest of the film. In addition, the fact that the film is a prequel does rob a lot of the suspense as we know who will live or die and how it will all end. And finally... despite being a prequel, the film makes some rather unorthodox choices that really bugged me and contradict what came before. Yes, it was only ever meant to be a sort-of ""quasi-prequel"" that would bend or change canon and continuity when needed. But the fact it tries so hard to tie into the original trilogy while also incessantly changing key details of the previously-established backstory does genuinely annoy me as an audience member. And that's not spoiling anything, because it happens throughout the entire film.""X-Men: First Class"" might not be a perfect film, and the questionable choices it makes in regards to the canon and continuity of the franchise might alienate some hardcore series fans. But that doesn't change the fact that it boasts a remarkable cast, keen visual direction and an absolutely wonderful storyline filled to burst with emotion and pathos. It's a darned-fine film and overall a fantastic prequel to the excellent original. And I give it a very good 8 out of 10!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Prequel That Brings Back the Excitement of the Franchise,"There are two sides to the X-men film franchise: the good side, which is ""X-Men"" and ""X2"" and the bad side, which is ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" and ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine."" The good side really brought the excitement and greatness of X-Men to the big screen and the bad side completely ruined the franchise. What this film actually did was making the story extremely enjoyable and bringing back the franchise to the same level of greatness of the first 2 films. This film did a great job of telling a story that connects this film to the others from the franchise and making it enjoyable for all. If you watched the good sides of the franchise, then you will be able to point out the resemblance and connect the dots that lead to the events of the franchise. You will get a better understanding of how the characters became how they were to be, giving strong feedback and enough depth to explain their ambitions and characteristics.Director Matthew Vaughn not only did a great job of connecting this prequel to its predecessor, he developed a strong story that is enjoyable for both fans and for people watching this for the first time. The director treats this as the first of the franchise to be made into a film, allowing people who have not seen or heard of X-Men, to be able to get on and enjoy the ride. You seriously don't have to watch any of the predecessors in order to understand the characters and the storyline. What I really liked about the story was the creativity of adding this historical event, making it fictional and adding scenarios that are filled with enthusiasm. The film focused extremely well on the characters, giving them a great amount of depth and characteristics, making these characters really likable. Unlike the last two films of the saga, I didn't have that feeling that most of the characters were there just to be on screen and to brought in for no particular reason. All were added for a purpose and most of these characters play a critical role in the plot. Most of them have incredible abilities and it is quite amazing to see these characters unleash their power. My only complaint about the characters was Beast because of how ridiculous he looked compared to the 3rd entry. Beast in the 3rd film looked like how Beast should look, but Beast in this film looked like an overgrown Beast doll that didn't get the cuddling and love from children.Another thing that diverse this with the last two entries of the saga was bringing in the excitement and making these scenes count. It was amazing to see these characters use their abilities, fun to watch them train and the final showdown had that action packed excitement that you want in a super-hero flick. You may complain about the final showdown, based on how these characters have these crazy abilities, but didn't receive the justice and showdown that you wanted to see; other than that, the final showdown is great and it will get you quite excited. Personally, the director brought up some pretty awesome, well shot scenes that were pretty awesome. My favorite has to be near the end of the final fight between Magneto and Shaw. Just watching that scene really brought a huge grin because of how awesome it was and is definitely one of the most awesome scenes I have seen in 2011.The main question that people will wonder is if James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender can pull off being Professor X and Magneto's younger self. The answer is simple: not only did they gave out great performances, but they were extremely great and portrayed as the characters quite perfectly. You see a different side to the characters, something that you didn't get to see in the other films, and the film gave plenty of depth to these characters and both actors just did a tremendous job portraying as both characters. None of them outshine one another, since both gave out equally strong performances, making you like both characters equally. Kevin Bacon was simply great as the villain, Sebastian Shaw. Shaw is definitely one great villain and stand tall with other villains in the saga. What Shaw can do is quite impressive and once you see what he can do, you will be quite amazed and will definitely like him as a villain. Every other cast also did great and fit very well with their characters.Not only did this brought back the saga to its feet, but it definitely stands equal or actually better than the first 2 entries of the saga. Great characters, exciting moments, great portrayals and perfectly combining the story with the others made this film a worthy comic book film and an exciting film to watch.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Clears up the background of known mutants and introduces some new ones,"So this movie does great actually, it shows us the background of our known mutants of X-Men, X2 and The Last Stand and I think they did a great job here. But I think it's questionable what they focused on in X-Men and X2 and therefore this is what they had to deal with in this prequel.The whole X-Men saga has a bit too much of a teen feeling around it imo, so it's watchable for the brighter masses and younger people and I'm not a huge fan of it. I like the special effects and parts of it and the X-Men universe has great potential, but I'm not fully sold on the whole franchise yet. I actually think Origins:Wolverine was one of the best X-Men movies since it felt more mature. I yet have to watch all of the franchise, still missing some of the puzzles. I have hopes in 'Logan' !",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
coolest x-men ever,"I am a huge fan of X-Men series, and I must say that X-Men: The First Class is my favorite of the all. At first, I didn't expect that much, but I absolutely enjoyed the movie and loved it after all!New more kinds of X-men and mutants are awesome, and the past of Professor X and Magnito is so interesting. Especially about Magnito, I think this movie is successful to make the character more lovable and attractive. Watching the time Charles and Eric were close friends was very nice. It is described with delicacy and care, so that the movie is somewhat heart warming, and somewhat thrilling. The tragic past of Eric makes me understand why he so hates normal humans and how the figure Magnito was created. He is not an evil nor villain at all, but he should keep fighting. And i think the fact makes X-Men series more profound and cooler.This movie clears everything up of the previous ones and contains a story about all of them, so it's meaningful for people who love X-Men. Now I am waiting for the next one. X-Men always feels good.James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender were great actors to play Charles and Eric respectively. Kevin Bacon was the best. he was a real villain in the movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The mutants are back!!,"X-men First Class came out in 2011 and it is a reboot-prequel of the original trilogy who end with the Last Stand ( what a dumb movie) and it is awesome . Until I see X-men Apocalypse I will review the installments of this franchise which with this flick came back from the dead!! To the film itself ,is set in the sixties during the Cuban Missile Crisis and we meet the younger versions of Magneto, Professor X, Mystique and Beast, who try to stop the World War III for happening. To the cast everyone plays his or her role close to excellent with James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender stealing the show.What I liked was that they both want the best for their mutant brothers and sisters but the means they prefer are as far as it get ,dispute that their friendship is totally real. Bonus fact Fassbender is the better Magneto than Mackellen and I stand to my view!! To the rest Jennifer Lawrence ,before becoming Katniss ,plays Mystique and she rocks, you totally believe that she wants nothing more than to fill part of a bigger team ,the same goes for the Beast, who is my favorite character of the X-men since I can remember myself and his depiction here redeemed the character from his first appearance in the Last Stand. The only character that felt a little shallow were the team of the villain of the story, apart from Kevin Bacon who was the epitome of an arrogant, mad scientist,but it was not so bad to break the movie.Now to the theme, because every superhero no matter who great ,over the top or Strange( for Dr Strange :)) he or she is has a theme ,which is the fuel for the actions that they do. Spiderman's is responsibility ,Batman's is justice, Punisher's is vengeance and so on. To the X-men the theme is as I previously wrote to find somewhere to belong and face the racism of the rest of the society because of their powers. And here we get it and then some ,with Magneto been the Malcom X and Professor been the Martin Luther King of this universe and in the end their view are both right!! ( Although personally team Magneto)In summary the movie is great and its only weaknesses , which to find you must nit pick, it is the the villains ,except from the leader and their plan .But its strong parts is the rest characters , the action, the setting ( in 1963 the first X-men comic was published so they literally return back to the basic) and the alternate history from our own ,which the creators of the movie made. I like it due to it answer indirectly a big question ,what would the world today be like if heroes like that of the myths walk among us!!A thing of Beauty!!

'X-Men: First Class' Makes The Grade!,"X-Men: First Class unfolds by deliciously setting up the yin-and-yang between the mutant population's two most powerful people. On the one hand is Charles Xavier (James McAvoy), who is eager to help mutants like himself - he's a telepath - and his shape-shifting best friend Raven (Jennifer Lawrence) and seek acceptance from non-mutant humans. On the other hand is the metal-manipulating Erik Lensherr (Michael Fassbender), who's bent on destroying the former Nazi scientist (Kevin Bacon) responsible for killing his mother in the Warsaw ghetto in 1944.Set primarily in 1962, the script sets up Charles and Erik as allies. Their mission is to stop that Nazi doctor, now a businessman named Sebastian Shaw who also has mutant energy-absorbing powers and has gathered his squad of mutants, from pushing the Americans and Soviets into launching a nuclear war. But in battling Shaw, Charles and Erik also argue between themselves. Charles seeks acceptance of mutants from humans, even encouraging his lab genius to create a serum to make mutants appear ""normal."" Erik takes a more radical stance, arguing mutants should never have to hide who they are and should fight humans, even the more sympathetic ones.Using the Cuban Missile Crisis as a backdrop, X-Men: First Class delivers a riveting action drama, mixing whiz-bang special effects with a story of Shakespearean proportions, and in the process writing a fascinating mutant-based alternative history of the early 1960s. Dropping a genre film in the middle of a historic event immediately and successfully adds depth, substance and helps place the characters in the proper chronology.On the acting front, McAvoy's Professor X is more relatable than Patrick Stewart's in the original trilogy. He is still as much a genius, but maintains his boyish charm and an accessibility that has yet to have been afforded to X's character. Fassbender similarly takes his Magneto to a new place, trading the campiness of Ian McKellen's character and focusing more instead on Erik' anguish and tragic past, delivering a standout performance. Together they provide a wonderful centerpiece for the film with their two characters, displaying some great chemistry.But the glue that holds the whole film together and balances everything on a thin wire like a stage magician is Matthew Vaughn. He keeps the complex globe-hopping story moving fluidly, peppered with moments of good humor and high drama. The movie deals with the age old dilemma of power over peace, but credit is deserved to Vaughn for managing this aspect so attentively, and being delicately precise with the emotional baggage involved. Most superhero movies would not even attempt to cover a subject like this with such a high maturity level.Whether or not you're an avid fan of the comic book series, this class graduates with top marks!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An Amazing Prequel!,"I've never been a big fan of the X-Men movies, but this is really a spectacular film.The time period fit more to this kind of story than the others, as comics were a much bigger thing in the '60s, so it kind of felt right. It just worked. The acting was great, the action was pretty exciting, and the story was investing. I must say, the ending felt just a bit anticlimactic in comparison to the rest of the movie, but there was plenty of tension in it, and there's a moment that will make you shiver.This is a fun, emotional movie. One about friendship, betrayal, acceptance, and going separate ways. It's not for everyone, but you'll probably enjoy yourself.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Part of the elite group of comic book films.,"This was a very pleasant surprise. After the infamous X3 and X-Men Origins, the X-Men franchise was slowly crumbling. One good movie could rejuvenate the franchise; instead we got a fantastic movie. The acting stood out, especially Michael Fassbender's performance as a young Magneto. I was immediately invested in the story and captivated by the progression of Magneto's character. I thought this was done very well. X-Men: First Class is not your typical summer blockbuster; it's got more layers to it. For one, the script is witty and effective. I found myself on the edge of my seat just waiting for the very well written dialogue. Another merit this film carries is the amazing soundtrack composed by Henry Jackman. It was evident that Hans Zimmer had his fingerprints all over it, for the music sounded similar to Inception, which is never a bad thing.

One of the greatest prequels of all time,"One of the best prequels of all time. No doubt. This film is amazing, the plot is absolutely fantastic and all the actors put in a great performance, especially James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender and Jennifer Lawrence. The chemistry between Charles and Erik is magnificent, from the moment they met until the moment they died, you could never say they were not friends. Another amazing performance was from Lucas Till, who played Alex Summers, I think he pulled off the anti-social character perfectly. The reason this is such a great prequel is because not many questions are left unanswered, maybe how did Charles lose his hair but that is answered in a later film in the trilogy, it shows the origin of many people from the original movies, while introducing some new characters too, some never to be seen again, such as Banshee, or some that appear in later films, such as Havok. Michael Fassbender's emotion in this film is both great acting, and quite funny, it's a lot like the faces Tobey Maguire makes while pulling the train in Spider-Man 2.

James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender are entirely convincing at Xavier and Lehnsherr, and they have strong support throughout a well-constructed story from both A-listers and up-and-coming young stars alike. Jennifer Lawrence is again worthy of great plaudits essaying the troubled Mystique and January Jones is the screen equivalent of super glue to the eyeballs.

Definitely the best X-Men movie.,"First let me point out that I didn't have big expectations for this movie. So far the best comic book movies have been distributed by Marvel Studios, while this is still 20th century fox. When I learned Matthew Vaughn and Brian Singer were heading the project, i knew it would regain what X-Men 3 threw out.The acting was what made the movie shine. The character development was what really made the film. It definitely made up for the mediocre special effects, which were only so I'm sure due to budget limitations. James McAvoy and Michael Fassabender (Prof. X and Magneto) gave fantastic performances as their characters. You could really feel for all the characters, they all had their importance. Even the teenagers gave great character portrayals.The characters are all so much more likable in this installment. The professor, Magneto, and especially Mystique seemed so much more interesting. Something I found strange though was that they made many references to the past 3 movies, but there were things that broke the continuity. However, I feel that it is important that they broke the continuity, because it was also done so perfectly. There was also an old character reference that was done in the best possible way it could have been. What this movie should have been is the start of a reboot instead of a prequel, since it was so much better. But overall it's one of the best movies i've seen.

The best part of the story being the relationship between Charles Xavier/Professor X and Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto (no not that kind of relationship, get your mind out of the gutter, good god), and we also see how Magneto became a villain, which I love (though you'll spot a Star Wars connotation in there, but whatever). There are 2 small problems with the story. One, a few of the mutants' powers are not explicitly explained, they are shown, but not explained. Two, it would've been nice to see how they got their powers and their first reactions to learning they have powers, (Though, I think a few powers are shown in the opening scenes of the 1st movie) In addition to the great story, there's a lot of great action as well, giving this movie a close-to-perfect mix of story and action. Are you a fan of comic book movies, the X-Men movies, and/or the X-Men in general? If so, then this movie is a must see.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A great X,"In a world where mutants lived camouflaged among humans, Charles Xavier, a mutant who can read minds, starts recruiting in preparation for an imminent battle with a malicious group who is determined to start World War 3. This movie presents the beginnings of the X-Men, how each of them began to use their powers, their struggle to accommodate with humans and the battle that separates them into two distant factions.It manages to tell its story in an entertaining and thrilling way alongside all the awesomeness generated by the mutants and their powers. It's unexpectedly captivating and the fact that it leaves almost no question unanswered regarding the origins of the mutants makes it even more interesting. I have to admit that one or two aspects of the ""young ones"" are a bit exaggerated and awkward but that doesn't affect the overall quality of the film. It was a pleasant surprise from this franchise and I can only hope they will maintain this level in the upcoming titles.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Witness the moment that will change our world.,"Narrating the origin story of the many significant characters in the X-Men universe & set in the 1960s during the Cuban missile crisis which put the entire world on the verge of a nuclear armageddon, X-Men: First Class mainly concerns the close friendship between Charles Xavier & Erik Lehnsherr before they turned into archenemies and adopted the names of Professor X & Magneto, respectively.Director Matthew Vaughn brings an entirely fresh approach & style in almost all filmmaking departments here and succeeds in balancing its quality action with impressive storytelling without ever letting down the entertainment factor. Tightly edited from start to finish, the film looks absolutely fantastic, thanks to its vibrant cinematography, state-of-the-art visual effects & sensational score.Coming to the performances, the entire cast is pretty well-rounded & each member is pretty convincing in their given roles. James McAvoy plays Charles Xavier aka Professor X while Michael Fassbender is in as Erik Lehnsherr aka Magneto, and the performance as well as chemistry between these two is what makes this film work so wonderfully along with the fine input coming from the rest of its supporting cast.On an overall scale, benefiting greatly from its brilliant direction, strong script, magnetic performances from McAvoy & Fassbender, terrific visual effects, tight editing & a marvellous score, X-Men: First Class comes out as a highly potent package that guarantees a cinematic experience which is surely going to entertain & astonish its viewers in more ways than one.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Mutant & Proud,"There are a lot of great things about First Class, but I think the one that sticks out to me the most (even after years and tons of viewings) is that it works as both a reboot and prequel. Even though the continuity has since been mingled with even more, this film did such a great job of resetting the universe without tarnishing what came before.In large part, the strengths of the film lie with Matthew Vaughn's direction. Up to this point, I liked most of the X-Men films, but even the people who have loved the series would say that there wasn't much ""fun"" to be had. The original X-Men trilogy took itself very seriously and rightfully so. But there's something to be said for a mutant story that poses similar thought provoking questions and themes like before, while also making a fun adventure out of it. Vaughn does a wonderful job balancing the two.Setting an X-Men film in the 1960's meant having to recast all of the recurring characters. Luckily, casting was something 20th Century Fox had no problem with. I don't think we could have dreamed of a better pairing to take over the roles of Professor X and Magneto than James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender. Perhaps, some would say that the two of them have outdone their counterparts, Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan (I, myself being one of those people). Much like the film itself, McAvoy and Fassbender put their own spin on the characters, but bring enough similarity in their performance to understand the connective tissue between the pairs.Something the new trilogy of X-Men films does incredibly well is use the decade the films are set in to enhance the overall story they were going for. First Class is set in the 60's, and uses the Cuban Missile Crisis as the film's climatic sequence. But it uses it in a way that doesn't exploit that event, instead, gives a reason for there to be tension between Charles & Erik. This film and Days of Future Past nail the relationship between those two more so than any X-Men film to date.Going back to the fun stuff though, the rest of the mutants are made up of mostly throw away heroes and villains. No one was really asking for characters like Azazel, Riptide, Angel Salvadore, Havoc, Darwin, Banshee, or even more Mystique. But even as much as these characters could have felt like throwaway characters, Vaughn managed to build them into the story in a creative way. Everyone has their own arc and moment to shine. In fact, my favorite part of the film involves Charles & Erik recruiting, and subsequently training everyone. It's classic superhero stuff.Overall, First Class makes good with its new cast and setting. Matthew Vaughn transitioned what was originally planned as a Magneto origin story into a wonderfully balanced comic-book adaptation. One that nails the characters motivations and mindsets in a refreshing but respectful and realistic way.+Charles & Erik+Recruiting & Training+Score+Vaughn's directing+Setting adds to the story9.4/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Really good! It was worth suffering the other X-Men films,"Someone had the idea to cash in the X-Men concept in a series of movies and they did try to follow the comic, adding as much special effects as was computery possible. However, it all backfired when the dated (and often conflicting) general ideas in the graphic novel made the movies little more than casual entertainment. So they did the ""reinventing"" trick. Find some smart people and rewrite stuff so that it matches with the past, but removing the ridiculous part. Kind of like changing the Klingons in StarTrek, another perpetually reinvented franchise.The amazing surprise is that they did a good job. The plot is complex, the characters well defined and in the end you are left wanting more, while understanding why everything happened the way it did. A cast of good (but not unnecessarily shiny) actors ranging from James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender to Kevin Bacon and Michael Ironside complemented the well written plot. I even liked the little Wolverine cameo scene, which was funny and subtle, something rarely seen in American movies.Bottom line: I really want more! If they keep up the good work this could really mean a movie renaissance of the X-men idea. Not flashy arrogant super power stars, but people with feelings and complex history behind them and normal except the mutation that is both blessing and curse. In spirit, so much closer to the comic than the other dreadful attempts at putting it in movie form.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Something for everyone,"As a kid, I collected some comics, mostly ADVENTURE from DC about the Legion of Super Heroes, some Superman, and from Marvel, some Fantastic Four.DC was known as better heroes, while Marvel was known as ""better characters"".In those days, those were about the only two real choices. The India Ink artistry was unbeatable. And it was the days before hacks began drawing pictures which had every hero with a 90 inch chest.So, I'm not a die-hard comic fan, but I'm not a completely free agent, either. I see this film from both sides, roughly, but mostly from the middle.This super hero film has something for everyone, I believe. It seems to stay fairly true to the comics, as I recall, certainly to the emphasis on characters.For non comic fans, it has good characters.The directing, I think, helps a lot. There really seems to be an emphasis on only two characters, with a brief attempt to show glimpses of three other characters, and a very small hint at four other characters at the very most. The others may as well be called ""Extra Number One, Two, and so forth"".Really, it is about two characters. They aren't brothers, but they behave as brothers. They are in the founding father days of a super hero group.Charles is the charismatic one, the one you would expect to be the older brother if they were brothers. He is mature and composed. He even reminds me of my older brother.Alex is the more emotional one. He has a good heart, and has good intentions, but one could say he has a ""dark side"". He isn't evil, but he isn't ""good"". There is one time when I believe he crosses the line. They are teaching a young man how to use his power of vocalization to fly, and Alex pushes him to a certain doom if he doesn't use his voice correctly. In the comic world, it's acceptable as ""sink or swim"", but in ""sink or swim"", you can always toss a line to a drowning man. I suppose here that Alex had a back up plan to use his power to somehow save the poor boy if he ""sank"".At the climax, Alex has a bout with Humanity, in which he seems to want to kill a beautiful young woman for a bullet that hits someone he cares for. He obviously never intends to really kill her, but to coax another character to stop him, as he takes his time. Many of us have been in this ""someone stop me"" situation before.What I think is best is the work done on the five characters they explore. However, I think that's laziness for a full length film to only explore five characters to this degree. Even many of the ""heroes"" and ""villains"" are just fillers, basic extras.What I didn't care for were the action scenes. Again, a film has to have something for everyone. And special effects are needed for the geeks. I did like the simplicity of some of them, however. This made it more of a good balance of action and character.The weakest moments were the action moments. At one point, the villains wipe out the self important CIA team and the guards. It wasn't badly done. It was overly done, though. It seems to have been a case of ""lets give the dorks in the audience some more silly bloodthirsty killing scenes"". Fortunately, this was a small part of the film, and looked to be just an effort to appease the dorks.The direction for establishing the two central characters was outstanding, no doubt about it. We get Alex and Charles in reaction to almost everything, sometimes in unison, sometimes in differences.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
a.k.a Magneto: The Movie.,"Under the direction and writing of the bloke 'n' bird who brought Kick-Ass to the big screen, the ever-enjoyable X-Men franchise gets a cinematic reboot. Like a more accomplished version of the Star Wars prequels, FS depicts the origin of the mythos' primary antagonist and his agenda of mutant separatism/supremacy. The success of the whole thing rests not only on the shoulders of Mr Vaughn and Mrs Goldman, but also those of the well-chosen cast. Standouts include Nick Hoult's clever-yet-conflicted take on Beast; January Jones playing Emma Frost with an air of detached ennui; Kevin Bacon in bastardly form as Sebastian Shaw; and James MacAvoy's roguishly idealistic Professor X. There's even an amusing precision F-bomb of a cameo from a staple member of the franchise.Star of the show, however, has to be Michael Fassbender's steely-yet-sympathetic take on the Master of Magnetism. With a singleminded charisma he effectively takes 'n' makes the movie his own, conveying a full range of states, ""between sorrow and serenity"". Indeed, I found myself rooting for him over the clear-cut heroes of the piece. Even his glaring awkwardness in the final scene, whilst dressed in Magneto's trademark threads, can't diminish all that leads up to it. Also, he gets the most memorable background score in the whole film.Is First Class a top-tier comic book adaptation? Sure. More significantly, though, it's the first of a new subgenre within that subgenre--the supervillain flick! Enjoy...",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Redeemed the X-Men,"X-Men: First Class, to a lot of fans, was gonna either make or break the film series for them after they were disappointed by X-Men 3 and X-Men Origins: Wolverine. Me, I'm not a big fan of the X-Men, and I never have been.This movie, however, was enough to make me interested. X-Men: First Class is an origin story for the X-Men, obviously, but the internal conflict in it makes it soar above other superhero movies. Charles (played by James McAvoy, who was great) and Erik (played by Michael Fassbender, who is fantastic in everything he's in) are both mutants, leading a team of other mutants - but at the same time, their personal philosophies differ so greatly that it gives a lot of tension to the film.The performances in this film are all great - Jennifer Lawrence, Kevin Bacon, and Nicholas Hoult all stood out to me especially. The movie has great action and great dialogue as well. However, I thought certain moments were rushed, leading to some either awkward moments or really abrupt ones.Overall, definitely see X-Men: First Class! I give it a 9.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"A Surprisingly Great Prequel,","X-Men: First Class is a fantastic movie with an extremely well developed storyline with an outstanding cast and great characters.Prequels are always hard things to do,and I didn't enjoy the majority of prequels i've seen,I wasn't sure about a prequel to an already troubled franchise (with X-Men: the Last Stand and X-Men Origins: Wolverine),but it was fantastic and the cast is just as good if not better than the original X-Men cast,every actor suits their characters very well and it is very interesting to see how they all developed in to Professor X,Magneto,Mystique,etc.X-Men:First Class is a top notch superhero movie and prequel that fans of the first two X-Men will definitely be pleased with.A young Magneto and Professor X recruit a group of mutants to save the world from an evil scientists plans to start a third world war.Best Performance: Michael Fassbender",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Another franchise reboot....but this one's good.,"After three X-Men films and a pretty poor origins story attempt for Wolverine in a film of the same name, i might be forgiven for feeling a little underwhelmed by the prospect of sitting down for over two hours and watching another reboot of a popular comic book franchise. Turns out, contrary to my expectations, i had a great time. This is an origins story that attempts to entertain you rather than bog you down with exposition. The film is surprisingly light on it's feet and has many fun action set pieces as well as some eye catching sets and sexy performances. Michael Fassbender shines for the good guys as Magneto while Kevin Bacon seems to be having the best time of his career in his role as a bad guy. My only disappointment was the performance of James McAvoy, i found his character hard to believe and more importantly, hard to like. Something just seemed a little forced. Full credit must go to Matthew Vaughn for pulling this off. I was a huge fan of Kick Ass and if it weren't for how much i loved that film, i may never have tried this. I'm glad i did.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Although the film felt a little bit rushed, overall it was extremely effective.","I, for one, was extremely apprehensive when I heard about an X-Men prequel. Bryan Singer's first two films will remain near and dear to my heart as superhero films go, and when Brett Ratner's ""The Last Stand"" hit theaters, it destroyed my hope to ever see another great X-Men film. While Singer's films were smart, carefully plotted, action films, the last two (The Last Stand, Wolverine) felt like a rushed, disorganized, cash grab. That being said, I expected nothing but the same from ""First Class."" However, what we got, while was still very rushed, was an incredible superhero film. Fassbender really floored me as, a man who would one day be Magneto, Erik Lesher. The story explaining how a mild mannered young Jewish boy in a Nazi occupied Germany became a powerful villain, hellbent on ridding the world of the human race was very compelling, and in my opinion what made this film as enjoyable as it was. However, I feel the fact that it was a mutant who created the monster that is Magneto, makes his vendetta against the human race seem a little less justified. While McAvoy is solid as always, I feel it's the supporting cast that really steals the film here. Lawrence really earns your sympathy as her character as she begins her transition from a self loathing little mutant, unsure of her identity, and slowly begins to accept who she really is, and the awareness that no human ever would. I have to give Vaughn his due here... It takes a very good director to make such a big budget action film, with shooting locations that span the globe in such a short amount of time, and still make it, not only watchable, but genuinely compelling. Now, given that in less than a year, the film suffered rewrites due to plot changes (going from an origin film just about Magneto, to the beginning of the X-Men), and just what Vaughn felt wouldn't feel fresh (scene's which he compared similar to fights that took place in Inception), he did, what I feel, was the best job any director could have done with this film in such a short period of time. I also feel, despite the fact that there are some continuity errors between this and the previous series, that this fits in as a excellent companion piece. I highly recommend giving this one a chance.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
