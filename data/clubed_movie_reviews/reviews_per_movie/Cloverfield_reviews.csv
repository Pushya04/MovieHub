Overall not bad but I found it unsatisfying and annoying to watch,"I agree with most of the comments I read, in that this film is definitely worth watching, BUT thought I'd mention a few things that others didn't.The lack of a steady camera shot, even though it fits well with the plot, began to wear on me. I found myself relieved whenever the camera fell to the ground and gave the same view for a few seconds. It felt like I had on the wrong glasses - I was constantly trying to bring the scenes into focus and the continual motion, coupled with the random focus and quick glimpses of things I wanted to see clearly, made me feel stressed, strained and then annoyed.Add to that the ending, which leaves so many issues dangling, and, overall, I found it very unsatisfactory.Despite that I still gave it a 6. If you can handle triple rides on a roller-coaster then you'll probably really enjoy this film. If you get motion sickness easily then you may want to pause it every 10 minutes and focus on the wall!",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Tremendous thrills!,"Some people have derisively compared this film to The Blair Witch Project because it was all told from the point of view of someone's shaking camera. Unless you have motion sickness, I don't think that's a bad thing. What matters is who's in front of the camera. While The Blair Witch Project featured annoying people screaming at each other, this movie actually made me care about the characters. In fact if it had continued with the romantic drama tone established during the first half hour, I STILL think it would have been worth watching and that's the biggest compliment I can give it.Of course people will be watching this movie for the visceral pleasure and Colverfield delivers. Many thrilling visual and sound effects wowed me (there were a few times I yelled out in shock at a sudden scare). Any horror film will also benefit from a sense of entrapment and this movie pulls off the seemingly impossible feat of making New York City seem claustrophobic because there was seemingly nowhere to hide from the monster.What is the monster? Whatever it is clearly is meant to be an allegory for the carnage 9/11 inflicted on New York, much the same way Godzilla was meant to be an allegory for the damage inflicted on Japan by the atom bomb. There are moments seemingly recreating the documentary footage from 9/11, and they give the film verisimilitude. Touching upon real life horror, plus creating characters that we can relate to and care about, and assaulting our senses with incredible sights and sounds leads to entertainment worth watching many times over. Perhaps the 80 minute run time will bother some people, but on the other hand I think that's better than a film wearing out its welcome. Great job J.J. Abrams and company!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Breath of fresh air,"It was nice to finally watch movie that didn't seem like anything I'd ever seen before. This, much like Spielberg's ""War of the Worlds"" and ""Children of Men"", completely immerses you in this incredible situation with absolutely no knowledge to comfort you. It's very disorienting, which adds to the experience; you never figure out what the hell is going on but you're so into survival that you put it past you. You're placed with a bunch of characters whom you get to know and eventually must join in their frenzied search for a friend while being subjected to some horrifying imagery and new threats.The effects look great and realistic thanks to the hand-held camera, which isn't too bad-looking if you manage to get a seat further from the screen. The filmmakers came up with some really great creature designs that were menacing yet very much original. If you're bound to be upset over seeing a movie with a lack of music, then stay for the credits, during which a fantastic suite of music composed by Michael Giacchino titled ""Roar! (Cloverfield Theme)"" plays.All in all, a fantastic time at the movies. A little more background on the monster would be nice, though the absence of this information is intentional. Everyone in the theater was rooting for a sequel; maybe a second set of footage is found elsewhere? Or perhaps there is more the the viral marketing -- what exactly were Slusho and Tagruato? Also be prepared to suspend some disbelief, but considering the movie is about a monster destroying New York City, that shouldn't be too difficult.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not the film that I remember upon my revisit!,"They needed Godzilla to fight that thing, not tanks or missiles!Jokes apart, it's a well-acted and well-made found footage feature, no doubt whatsoever. However, I remember liking the movie much more when I first saw it in my teenage years. I vividly recall caring for the whole ensemble and the devastating tragedy that struck them out of nowhere.More than a decade later, I cannot state the same, though. Perhaps it's the overexposure of the found footage genre in general or the fact I've now gotten habituated to such filmmaking and have seen much better works in the process. Whatever the reason, it did not resonate with me on the same level this time; I wish it did.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
The First Great Monster Film of the Century,"If you haven't heard by now Cloverfield is a film about a giant monster attacking Manhattan all seen through the perspective of a 20-something's hand-held camera. The film has been hyped for months via viral marketing, JJ Abrams fan boys, and media coverage/ monster speculation. Did it live up to the hype? The answer is OH GOD YES Cloverfield is by far the most intense monster film I have ever seen in my lifetime, after the initial 15 minutes of character introduction and whatnot the film does not go 5 minutes without a HOLY CRAP moment. Constantly driving you to the edge of your seat at every turn and it really pulls no punches, I was surprised to learn it was rated PG13. Now the film is entirely filmed in shaky cam since you cant really survive a monster attack pushing a trolley around and it just works, you may get motion sickness though so be warned. The camera itself becomes a character of the film as it IS the viewer making everything happening on-screen more and more realistic. Now the acting is amateur but thats for the best considering that the film would have made no sense if they had used big name actors/actresses, the characters are not that deep either and mostly serve as fodder, comic relief, moral guidance, panic, commentary, puzzlement, a little bit of annoyance, in other words they're people surviving a monster attack. The presentation is brilliant, the only music heard is in the party and at the ending credits and the special effects are some of the most seamless stuff you'll ever see in a film. The monster itself is actually not seen in its entirety only being viewed from different angles for the audience to piece it together as the survivors themselves are, you pretty much know as much as they do about everything going on making you actually feel like you're there. Critics compare the film to Blair Witch meets Godzilla but it is so much more than that, Cloverfield is the definitive American Monster Film, best if seen on the opening weekend just to hear the audience's reactions not to mention the presentation is far greater on the big screen, watch it again to see the things you missed or just to enjoy the ride again, admittedly the shock value will wane with multiple viewings but for what it's worth Cloverfield is an excellent piece of film and special effect engineering and is the first great monster film of the millennium. Its also downright scary at parts. 8/10",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Cloverfield delivers the thrills - but haters of the Blair Witch style should be wary!,"So, I went to a 5PM showing of Cloverfield today. It was pretty good. I found the characters to be very human and developed quite nicely over the course of the story. The special effects were excellent, with quite a few ""oh $#!@"" moments.Be warned: If Blair Witch Project made you nauseous, then I don't recommend Cloverfield. The *entire* movie is filmed in the ""handy-cam"" style of the trailer - but in my opinion, it works better here than in Blair Witch. It helped draw you into the movie and make you feel like you were in it, and it made the CGI more convincing.Very intense film.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Monsters movie in which a camera manages to shoot  the frightening events that spontaneously  happen,"When some New Yorkers are celebrating a leaving party the ground starts to shake , with blowing up happening anywhere . They decide to abandon the flat when a monster terrorizes the Great Apple , breaking buildings , and every to get in its ways. Various characters cross paths with the giant beast, and they attempt to escape along with a young carrying a hand-held video camera.This eerie tale is plenty of thrills, chills, restless horror and suspense . Film itself takes place from point of sight of a cameraman , with camera over shoulders , displaying a documentary style filmed by photographer Michael Bonvilliam . In fact , during the first weekend of the release, many theaters posted signs warning guests that the hand held camera movements may cause motion sickness . The title ""Cloverfield""; initially just a codename for the movie, is named for the boulevard in Santa Monica where the Bad Robot offices were located during the making of the film . Good but unknown cast as Michael Sthal , Jessica Lucas, Odette Yusman , Michael Vogel, among others . Well worth watching if you appeal shaky cameras , such as : ¨Blair witch project¨, ¨28 days/ Weeks after¨ or the classic Italian ¨Holocaust cannibal¨; and recently ¨Rec (2007)¨ by Paco Plaza and Jaume Balaguero and its American remake ¨Quarintine (2008)¨ by John Erik . The flick is a crossover between Gozilla picture , catastrophe genre and documentary with Steadicam camera . Lavishly produced by J.J.Abrams (Lost, Star Trek) and Bryan Burk with excellent special effects and monsters made by Phill Tippet studio . The motion picture picture was professionally directed by Matt Reeves . He's a writer, producer (Yards) and director for television (Felicity) and eventually for cinema ; furthermore , usual collaborator of J.J. Abrams . Rating : Interesing and spectacular , above average.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
An extremely well-made movie. Don't listen to the haters.,"I can remember back months before this movie came out, watching the teaser trailer for this film for the first time. The sense of foreboding and mystery I felt watching the trailer was the same as when I watched the film in the theater. It is an excellently-made movie.Although it starts off a little slow (with introducing the characters and their relationships), when the action kicks in, it doesn't stop. There are maybe 6-7 minutes where there is not some kind of thrilling event happening. The relationship between the characters Rob and Beth is palpable, as is the chemistry between all the actors.Pros: -Many thrills -Surprisingly good acting for a 'no-name' cast -Great story -Convincing special effectsCons: -The shaky camera may be nauseating to some people -The acting in some scenes could be a little better -If you are someone who likes for all the loose ends to be tied up at the end, this is not for youOverall, I give this movie 8 out of 10 stars. I love it, and it is in my top 10 favorite movies. It always will be. I highly recommend watching this on a large screen, with the sound turned up loud for maximum enjoyment.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A clever trick but nothing more,"And the monster is out of the bag.Thickly veiled in secrecy and fueled by the hype surrounding it, ""Cloverfield"" is the result of ""Godzilla"" and ""The Blair Witch Project"" after having a one-night stand. Without saying much, the film revolves around a group of twenty-somethings who hold a farewell party for Japan-bound Rob Hawkins (Michael Stahl-David) when a monster attacks New York City.It's a great marketing ploy, actually, and the J.J. Abrams-produced film, directed by Matt Reeves, certainly looks interesting on paper. Written by Drew Goddard, a frequent collaborator with Abrams, the film unfolds through the perspective of a hand-held camcorder as recorded by someone, mostly by Hud Platt (T.J. Miller). The first few minutes is spent introducing us to Rob and his girlfriend Beth McIntyre (Odette Yustman) waking up one morning, accidentally recorded over with interviews of a bunch of other people we're going to hang out with as mayhem starts.I have no problems with the shaky camera nor the awkward camera angles. In fact, it helps with the realism and if only for those factors, plus the clever editing, the movie works. Still, the film doesn't present itself as anything more than a cheap catharsis for a post-9/11 New York. One is smacked in the middle of the events yet it doesn't generate the requisite urgency. There are few moments of genuine tension but those fragments never form into a consistently gripping product. You hang out with these people, but you never find the sympathy to care for them, when their motivation is anchored on manipulative gimmickry and their interaction fueled by amateur acting and a hackneyed script best suited for the emo populace.""Cloverfield"" is a clever trick but nothing more. It's the big-screen treatment of a YouTube video, only here the gimmick is more conspicuous, and what usually lasts for about 10 to 15 minutes is stretched to 80 minutes or so.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Don't believe the hype - They didn't hype it up enough...,"Right, Let it be known, this film is f****n quality! Genuinely, i watched it with no expectations- the cheeky marketing of it revealing very little worked perfectly in my instance. The opening 5/10mins meets characters, and almost tricks you into a false sense of calm and normality.When 'events proceed', the camcorder style filming instills a genuine realism to events, and the films definitely feeds off the mass concern and shock at global events/terrorist attacks/disasters, and the disjointed way news feeds through.I will say no more but this- watch this film. Don't go finding too much out, just watch, and get taken to a place most fiction movies aren't able to transport viewers to. Intense has been said a lot in other peeps reviews its exactly that.

Worst high budget movie of all time? Maybe.,"I will firstly state I only give this movie 3 stars, because of the CG effects. if you enjoyed Blair witch project...don't see this movie. If you like monster flicks...go see it, and be disappointed. The actors in my opinion were extremely low grade, the approach of ""Realism"" failed because of horrible acting skills. Was the entire movie scripted, or partly improvised? Either way, it was badly done.The ending is horrible, no matter how you look at it. It looks rushed, and the actors fail at their jobs once again. It was such a generic ""Thiller"" flick I was sitting there thinking ""Are they ever going to hit us with something unexpected?"", sadly they never did.I really love Lost and all...but J.J...you've failed me this time.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Intense!,"I thought that this movie would have its best scenes in the trailers, so when I went in I did not expect too much. But I did expect that it would be different given JJ Abram's influence on Alias. Well, if you're not much for jumpy cameras and are prone to motion sickness, you probably will not stay too long in the theater. But if you can focus wide and not get caught up too much in the details, you are in for an intense and unique take on the monster hits a major city (New York) genre. Where does it come from? What is it? One can speculate, but the movie is really dealing with the trauma of a small group of party goers and their encounter with the extraordinary! The effects are amazing, the acting by relative unknowns, hits on all marks; making the movie all the more convincing to the very end. Not for the faint of heart or the under-aged; under 17s might be up nights with the shakes, definitely don't take preteens! Way better than, ""The Mist,"" a must see for giant monster fans everywhere!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Much better than anticipated,"I didn't have high hopes for this one, having read the reviews. Monster movie meets Blair Witch. But it's absolutely an OK flick.Great effects and an extremely cool apocalyptic atmosphere. Definitely worth a watch.Hand-held camera can be tiring, yes - but in this case, and combined with the great effects, it works.The plot itself isn't exactly news, but as it's all seen from the antagonists point of view and with no further explanation, you really get that ""what would I have done""-feeling.Yes, we need explanations, but I really like that Abrams hasn't tried to tag on an ending explaining what happened.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Doesn't Live Up To The Hype,"Cloverfield doesn't live up to the hype. They clearly had a sequel in mind when they made this movie. At the end of the movie, I went ""That's it?"".It's a love story with the monster as a sideshow. Yes you get to see the monster, but it doesn't even touch on what the monster is, where did it come from, why is it attacking Manhattan, etc. I didn't go to see the movie just to see a monster being hit by missiles, but that's what the movie really is. Who cares about the love story, I want the monster to be the star of the movie, not a bunch of yuppies with relationship problems. I have nothing against sequels but at least make the first movie a complete movie, and not just a jumping point for the real movie. And the camcorder style thing, was okay, it didn't bother me that much, but I prefer normal traditional camera style.A real disappointment. Not worth my 10 bucks.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
I haven't been this tense in a movie theater in sooooo long,"With all of the crazy viral marketing (that started way too early) some people were worried if it could live up to the hype. It COMPLETELY surpassed my expectations, and I went in expecting it to be good in the first place. Once things pick up and start rolling about 15 minutes in, I didn't relax until the credits started rolling. Yes, they give you a few brief moments to catch your breath, but even then you're still on edge, waiting for the next attack. I can't imagine this movie being executed in any way other than the hand held approach. They somehow managed to pull off SEVERAL absolutely beautiful shots/camera angles while still fitting into the hand held setting. The acting and dialog is so natural that it doesn't feel like they're acting a script...at ALL. It's incredibly intense, you're really pulled into the character's corners, and it's filmed wondrously. If you get motion sickness easily, you'll probably want to wait 'till this is out on DVD. Other than that...GO SEE THIS MOVIE. It's one of the greatest monster movies of all time. Actually...scratch that...it's THE greatest monster movie of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
and then what?,"Like the review before me, I have to say that this movie really did leave many people wondering what happened. I went into this movie with an open mind as to what I was going to see after reading other reviews and knowing the small basis of what was going to happen. I was in shock to see that there really was no ending to this movie. It seems that they spend most of their budget on special effects and location that they lacked the funds to find some one to finish writing this great movie.I love the way it was shot, and its feel of you watching from a first person Point of View. You actually feel involved in the movie and I could tell many of the people in the theater felt to be in the suspense. I could also tell that some people did not like that, as one girl sitting in my row was telling her friend out loud how she thought that it was ""stupid"". As for my friend sitting next to me, he was actually getting dizzy and a headache from the bouncing of the camera.I think the trailers for this movie were very accurate. The trailers would be clips and pieces, and you were left wondering what it was all about, well the movie will leave you the same way.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Awesome, just awesome!","Cloverfield is nothing like your average Hollywood movie. Entirely filmed from the perspective of a (shaky) handy-cam, one would not expect a very visually attractive movie. This movie proves that this assumption would be so damn wrong. The story starts at a yuppie party, but then crap hits the fan. And when I mean crap hits the fan, it really does hit the fan hard. Cloverfield is a very intense movie and the first person view really makes you feel like you are in the middle of something that you would try to avoid in real life. It has been a long time ago that I sat through a movie with clenched fists and my jaw on the floor most of the time, but this movie managed to do so. Nevertheless the movie still has its funny moments, which are timed right, so it does not take away from the tension. I could say much more about this movie, but it is really something you should see for yourself. Get the tickets now!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Jaw Dropping!!!!!!!!!,"First of i would like to say that this is hands down the best monster movie made. Some people will say "" The Host"" which was a great movie, but does not compare to the suspense and terror in Cloverfield. The visual effects in this movie were absolutely stunning. Superbly acted by a mostly unknown cast added to the realty of this movie. Cloverfield definitely tops my list of movies in 2008 so far. A MIND BLOWING movie experience that must be seen.one more note............. Don't LEAVE THE THEATER TILL AFTER THE CREDITS ROLL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I warn you DON NOT LEAVE!!!!!!!!!

For the ones who laugh with the horror genre,"Honestly, you will fear a lot, the point of view prespective just changes the game. You are not watching a main character in a horror movie face all kinds of challenges in addition with some good old jumpscares. It is U against everything, you are not anxious for the characters in the movie but anxious for your friends and ""yourself"". Maybe i am exaggerating, maybe not, but one thing is certain, i was at the edge of my seat throughout the whole, not once was i bored and uninterested. Also the writers decided to include a love story in the plot which definitely upped the anxiety and worry levels and made it even more exciting. I rate this movie 9 out of 10 cause it should have lasted more, too short!!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
An Amazing Interactive Experience,"The scariest part about Cloverfield is not its monster, but its realism. Casting a bunch of unknowns to be witnesses of the monster's wrath was a brilliant idea; both that and the camera footage added to the movie's believability. I've heard some reviewers criticize the ""acting"". I think they're missing the point. This movie isn't about that, and making millions of people believe a terror is raging Manhattan through dialogue does take some sort of skill.If you're reading the review you know the story: a bunch of twenty-somethings are holding a party to see their pal off on his new job in Japan when something straight out of Japanese cinema rudely interrupts their celebration. The scenes before the monster do feel a little forced; the screenwriter's desperation to make his characters more authentic shows in the first twenty minutes of screen time. The actors do their best with the direction and script, but the party almost feels like the homework you need to finish but rush through so you can go watch television.Yet the first few minutes are pivotal. While slightly one-dimensional (Rob is stubborn, Hud is the comedian, etc.), the interaction of the characters does set the entire movie in motion. Listen to all the conversations closely and you'll be even more impacted by the movie's ending.And a few booms, crashes, and explosions later, our twenty-somethings are scrambling through the streets of New York, trying to find a way out of the perilous wasteland our monster has created. Most likely you'll be frustrated by the characters' inability to have common sense in an emergency--the most cliché part about the film.However, the cinematic experience entirely compensates for the stupidity of the characters. You will the notice the difference between a true Hollywood film and JJ Abrams' creations. Something...gets you about seeing CGI characters on homemade, crappy quality, REALISTIC footage. The moving camera did make some people nauseous, but for me the cameraman should have been nominated for an Oscar since it added to the chaos quite well. By the third BOOM I was in almost as much confusion and panic as the people on screen--and I liked it.The movie's gritty reality--in contrast to its overblown, often ostentatious genre--was what captivated me. Cloverfield was made on a budget of 25 million, and I was 10000 times more into it than I Am Legend. Making anyone satisfied is the least of Abrams' priorities; all the horror film and monster movie clichés--INCLUDING THE MONSTER--crash and burn like the decapitated Statue of Liberty. Horror and thriller cinema needed a shock to the system, and this is it.The ending is expectedly unexpected, but appropriate. It doesn't matter what it would have been because the audience would have applauded anyway.P.S. Stay after the credits.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"The Monster movie,from the margins","Having read through a sampling of some of the other comments on this site,I gotta say that I'm very struck by the fact that this film doesn't inspire much ""in-betwens"": a fair share of either 8s,9s or 10s or else 2s or 1s on the star rating,and more than a couple of angry,sardonic dismissals paired in with a few positive ""I get it"" type reviews.I suppose,having to chose between the negative and positive reviews,I'd be counted on the latter,though barely.At this point,I don't think I'm telling any secrets or revealing anything that isn't already known about this film:producer J.J. Abrams,director Matt Reeves and writer Drew Goddard have constructed a spare,seemingly low-budget concept movie. That this is a creature movie--and what a creature it is,replete with nearly impregnable skin and spouting offspring that's much smaller but nasty and plentiful--seems to be somewhat of a subject experiment. In other words,this is a monster movie,but the monster seems to be of less direct interest than the viewpoint and survival of some of the New Yorkers who are enduring it,in this instance the five-some of friends/family who are coming from a going away party for one of them in mid-town Manhattan. While the five actors Michael David-Stahl,Jessica Lucas,Lizzy Caplan,T.J. Miller and Mike Vogel(searching for a sixth,played by Odette Yustman)seem to show some sparks of interest,humor or emotional depth,their characters have almost no depth and hence,no real reason to care about them. It isn't until the more intimate,scary and tangential moments of the later film does it seem that there's much reason to have any interest into their fates,and by then,it feels like too little and too late.The best part of this film is by far the concept and,in a grudging sense,the execution of it. The hand-held effect of filming a movie,particularly in a horror/sci-fi sense,is something of an work in audience endurance. Since there is a premium on audience fear,confusion and apprehension in any scary film,the objective of the filmmaker is to make that fear roundly and emotionally real. If one can stomach(Literally and figuratively)the bouncy,disjointed and shaky filming process--which seems fairly credible given the circumstances--then the movie's creators have done a fantastic that said viewer will be impressed. Promotion of this film,as mentioned by others,also is the grand mark or opus of this creation,being able to achieve a sense of audience interest and curiosity WELL before its release,an accomplishment that puts it up there with such cult films(which became equally famous for the public interest burnout that followed the initial swell of turnout)as ""Blair Witch Project"" and ""Snakes on a PLane"".Overall,I'd say this movie is certainly worth a look,though I wouldn't give any grand superlatives for how brilliant or great it is. It's effective,""BOO!""-type sci-fi/action/horror,that revels more in the concept and image than the volume of the product. NO more,no less.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
First Camera Perspective,"Unless there was a lot of clover in the fields of Central Park where some of the story of Cloverfield takes place, I'm not sure of the significance of the title here.Director Matt Reeves had the interesting idea of filming this movie in the first camera perspective. The film is the recorded viewpoint of a video camera and whomever is holding it at the time. Just about every one of those Fifties Science Fiction films takes it from the viewpoint of the people who will eventually slay the monster or defeat the aliens, whatever. You see masses of folks running in panic from whatever the threat is.What we've got in Cloverfield is a group of ordinary 20 somethings having a party. When some kind of alien invasion hits New York City. Then the group of them take off in understandable panic in search of safety. The film is about that quest for safety.No name players of any kind are used here and to be sure that does give the audience a good identification. They're not a terribly interesting bunch though, I'm not sure if I really cared whether they made it or not.Cloverfield is an interesting, but not terribly entertaining science fiction film.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
I Thought It Was Great,"I went to see this movie at 12:01 A.M. on Friday morning, the first show, and thought the movie was great. Althoguh I will tell you that if you get motion sickness or easy headaches DO NOT see this film, and if you do move as far away from the screen as possible! My friend got a bad headache and we were halfway up in the biggest theater in at the place which probably holds about 300-400 people. I was not affected because I would just close my eyes for a moment if I felt like it was a lot of moving and it would help my eyes a lot. But I went into this film with no real knowledge of the film and no expectations. The marketing of this film was brilliant, and I believe they delivered a very good film with it! Now people are coming out and saying there was no plot or back story, and felt it was hard to relate or understand the characters, but what people aren't getting is that Cloverfield isn't supposed to be that kind of film. It is a film that we are supposed to watch as if we basically found or were shown footage from an attack on NYC by an unknown creature! I thought the film was effective and I truly felt as if I was with the characters while this all was happening and experiencing it with them, so it's not supposed to be a film with character development or a real plot or explanation. The film feels eerily similar to watching a 9/11 footage video, and when you watch those you feel for the people but don't need or expect a plot about them. Don't get me wrong their is a story within the film, but I'll just leave it at that. I thought the film was very innovative and almost ground breaking in the way it was shot and the feel you get from it! Great Job!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Decent but nothing to write home about,"I had extremely high expectations for this movie (as I'm sure many other fans did). They were not met, but that doesn't mean that the movie was a complete flop. I jumped in my seat many times and I appreciated the unique way the movie was filmed.The movie succeeded at creating a realistic feel. The acting was better than the average movie and the CGI wasn't too bad either.Without spoiling anything, the monster looks kind of weird. Some people will like it, others will not. I am on the fence. It was unlike anything I've seen before, but that isn't necessarily a good thing. One thing I am sure of is the fact that I wish I saw more of it (as well as the destruction that it left behind).I think, in this case, a bigger budget would have yielded a more satisfying result. I am also not too sure that the hand-held camera approach added a whole lot. The way the wide angle shots were set up was pretty clever though.One thing that really bothered me was the product placement. There is one shot in particular when the camera hovers over some candy for no reason whatsoever. There were embedded ads for Nokia, Dunkin' Donuts, Juicy Fruit, Mountain Dew, and others. Call me old-school, but, like David Lynch, I don't think that product placement has any place in true cinema. I expected better from Cloverfield.Overall, I think this movie was on par with Godzilla. Godzilla had better CGI and way cooler shots of the monster but a weak plot and pretty bad acting. It just depends what you value. Since I am a sucker for cool action sequences and good special effects, I would probably prefer watching Godzilla. At least I wouldn't have a headache when it was over.Speaking of the ending, I liked it. I have heard a lot of complaints, but I think it was appropriate and well done.7 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Cloverfield Is An Intense, Action Packed, Break Through Thriller!","Simply put, this movie was incredible. I'm not going to spend any time going into plot detail, or try to make an explanation for everything, because the best way to go into this film is not knowing anything at all. To me, it was a lot like 300 in the sense that this film has placed itself far away from everything else out there that's thrilling and filled with action. (don't take that comment literally, there's no spartan's in this movie, or huge holes for kicking people in... that said, 300 was totally awesome!) When I left the theater, Cloverfield had me waiting for the movie to keep taking place in real life. I felt like I had been right there all along, and that's the feel you get from the unique first person, free-hand camera angle you get the entire film. Now I'm telling you right now, I've seen tons of movies, I love movies, I even work at Blockbuster!!! (aka huge movie nerd) Go see this movie!!! If you're into action, thrillers, and looking for anything that will inspire or amaze, or even make you question (much like I Am Legend - another great film)... this movie is dauntingly realistic. I'm highly recommending it to you, and telling you, it really is worth it. Don't try and figure everything out, don't try to make an explanation for everything, just watch, and imagine, and this movie will have you at the end of your seat and you'll never get the chance to sit back and catch your breath. Go see it!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
What This Genre Should Be About,"A low-budget found-footage shakey-cam film that does the genre justice.Enjoyed the edge-of-your-seat style horror, the hidden monster, and genuine terror that the main characters showed throughout the film.Still, found some of the characters annoying. But life gives us those types of people sometimes.This is one of those few films you can watch multiple times and enjoy every bit of it.4.5/5. Not too sure how to feel about the ending.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Pretty Close to Something Terrible...,"At one point during the mayhem of ""Cloverfield"" our jerky-jokey cameraman Hud (an annoying T. J. Miller) remarks that the monster ravaging New York City is ""something terrible."" Well, ""Cloverfield"" is pretty close to something terrible, but it's also laugh-out-loud funny and loads of fun.Taking cues from ""The Blair Witch Project"", ""Godzilla"", and our current YouTube/MySpace crazed youth oriented culture that believes everyone's point of view deserves to be recorded, producer J. J. Abrams' opportunistic ""Cloverfield"" operates at a mercifully quick clip to maximize entertainment value with a minimum of effort (and budget) while showing us allegedly top-secret video footage recovered after a massive monster attack on NYC.Though barely ninety minutes long, we still have to suffer through an excruciatingly banal opening twenty minutes of vapid, spoiled twenty-somethings partying the night away before the monster strikes. There was a moment somewhere during this that I actually zoned out completely and found myself staring at the dark theater wall. The cast of unknowns thankfully contains a few people who might be able to act if given the chance in a normal film. Standouts include the painfully lovely Jessica Lucas as the feisty Lily and Zooey Deschanel look-a-like Lizzy Caplan as the sarcastic Marlena. These two young actresses acquitted themselves nicely while a group of anonymous and interchangeable actors playing stupid characters making bad decision after bad decision whirled around them. It made for one of those odd movie-going experiences where you actually start routing for certain characters to die in horrible ways while you hope the pretty girls make it out alive because, well, they're cute.As a gimmick film, ""Cloverfield"" is as shallow as they come. It's also too silly and too much fun to end up mad about it. At least the idiot hand-held cameraman/character wants to see the monster and the destruction as much as we do. This leads to some great money-shots of the creature and its tour of terror through midtown Manhattan. It would've been more thrilling had I not seen very similarly designed creature effects in last fall's ""The Mist"". Like that film, ""Cloverfield"" certainly has its moments of giddy monster oriented fun, but it ultimately implodes and leaves behind a wreck of a movie that is pretty close to something terrible.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
I really enjoyed this film,"I thought that this was an EXCELLENT original film shot with a new style and really getting a lot out of the first person perspective. It adds to the realism of ""this just happened"" or ""this really happened"". Although the film got off to a slow start, the SFX and story more than make up for it. Once the movie got going, it really took off. One of the most interesting aspects to me is how they manage to keep the story moving very quickly, but fit so much in its rather short runtime. I honestly believe that if you are interested in any of the horror/ thriller/ action/ monster(?) genres you should see this movie, and even if you are not, it made 1-18-08 a fine day. Trust me- the film is a lot of fun. I wont spoil anything, but the last thing i would like to comment on is that the ending was not what it could have been, but nevertheless, 10/10 from me.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Finally a blockbuster not ruined by CGI,"I watch Cloverfield last night after months of hype. I rarely get impressed anymore by CGI and feel director's often ruin films by relying on it too much. But I couldn't help but be impressed with this.At the start I was a little concerned with the Blair witch project style filming. At times it can send you dizzy, but after awhile you get used to it and it really does make the movie stand out from all the other disaster blockbusters. You feel as if you are there with them making it feel less like a Hollywood production i.e more realistic. Really clever and risky idea but it definitely pays off.Overall a really good film that kept me hooked till the very end. Cant wait for the sequel!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
How NOT to make a movie!,"This movie is by the far the worst movie that I have seen in over 10 years. The entire movie is shot hand-held without any stabilizers. What this means is that you will get dizzy (unless you are stoned), and that you may even puke before you can make it to the toilet. I saw several people running out of the movie and most likely for that reason.The storyline is nothing new, in fact nothing about the movie is new. It's just a rehash of several other movies, mixed in a blender, and puked out on the screen. The really bad thing is that it could have been an awesome movie. Just a little more work on the storyline, some real lighting, and for God's sake a real cinematographer would have made a HUGE difference. Just because the entire movie is supposed to be through the POV of one of the actors does not mean that we actually need to see it like that.Think about it. If you are jumping or running around, does the entire world shake around you? Hell now. You're brain forces your eyes to focus on individual objects so that you don't get sick. When the entire movie frame shakes, your brain is not capable of focusing your eyes on a single point as your body is not physically involved in the action.This movie gets a 0 out of 10. Don't even waste your money to see it on DVD, it's that bad.",,Anonymous,Horror
whole plot relies on stupidity of one character,"The movie leaves too much to the imagination.Like a lot of films, it relies of people doing crazy/stupid things for ""love"". I don't understand it, but there wouldn't be a movie without it.I find it very detracting when the plot totally relies on one character's stupidity.The motivation for stupidity is ""love"" but I don't think that is a good enough reason.It was entertaining though.Worth seeing on a cheap night on a big screen.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not as good as the marketing. Not nice people.,"The idea of the handy cam following a group of people through a disaster works really well. The quality of the sets and the CGI is very high and the action is believable.The story flows well enough, but there are parts where it feels like a re start of the action as they can't think what to do next. The point where they leave the Army camp for the first time being an example.The Army come out of this really well, organised, brave and with plans already in place. It's just that the numpties that have the camera don't have the self awareness to realise this.This is where the film falls down badly. I really did not like the people that I was following, they where self absorbed and without context in the chaos that was around them.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
I was sincerely terrified at moments.,"Plain and simple...you'll either love or hate this movie. No in between.I loved it! My girlfriend hated it and got really sick.DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE IF YOU HAVE MOTION SICKNESS!!!! If you can handle the shakiness then you'll really feel involved.It was fantastic. The special effects were amazing and the terror seemed so real. The scale of the monster seemed to change, but even that did not disturb my enjoyment of this film. I have heard the guy behind the camera referred to as an idiot, but the sold out audience and myself found him really funny. Well worth the hype.GO SEE IT!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Magnificent Mayhem,"Simply one of the best films ever made. Packed house at Pleasure Island. See it in Digital. Exciting while being well paced. Romantic while not being sappy. Tender while being tough. Just like the name Cloverfield, the movie conjures up uncertain, ill defined images and internal reactions. It is the perfect analogy for today's listless world.It was a pleasure to see a film which fully utilized the movie watching experience.Stay until the end credits for a mysterious clue and an amazing piece of music titled ""Roar.""If nothing else, the overture theme should be nominated for an Oscar.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great movie for monster buffs!,"Just got back from seeing it with a few friends and I must say, I was really surprised.If you like monster movies then this is the movie for you. This modern take on the old Godzilla film has you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. You may ask what it is. My only response to you is ""God only knows."" It was a really fun time. We yelled, we cried, we laughed (yes, there is a great deal of humor in it.) If you are planning to see it, there are some things which you must be prepared for. Namely, because this film is seen through the lens of a camcorder, the constant moving and jitteriness of the scenes may lead to motion sickness (a friend and I experienced this.) If you have a slightly weak stomach, bear in mind that because this is a monster movie, there will be some gross scenes. However, you will only hear things and see some blood spattering.With possible side effects aside, it is my belief that you will enjoy this movie just as much as I did. And one more thing: stay until AFTER the credits and listen very closely.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great Invasive Idea,"Sometimes the idea of a movie can transform the experience of watching it, and sometimes only on remembering it. The challenge is to have ideas that are not only clever and appear so, but which actually make good, effective films that matter.I went into this thinking that it would be an evolution of ""Transformers."" That film worked for me, and worked in ways that were beyond anything I had seen. Sure the story was dumb and the very idea of the robots was childish. But the way the film was put together was a bit astonishing. In old movies, if there was a monster destroying a building, well then you saw the building being destroyed as if you were a placid god in the sky somewhere. With Transformers, you never really saw things this way. You saw them as if you were an observer threatened by and involved in the action. You were running, avoiding, occasionally glancing and sometimes accidentally seeing part of what was happening.It was new, marvelous. But we always knew the cameras were not associated with humans, at least not the ones on screen. The idea was to trick us into adopting the disembodied cameras we always accepted and allowed us, the audience to be threatened, to be there.Now this. Some of the effects are the same. At least in the beginning of the disaster, we only partially see what is happening. And there are many times when the camera is unsteady. But I got the impression that although the camera was handled by a panicked character, we always saw more than he would have. The camera was always where we would have wanted it, arranged to increase the dramatic effect.Transformers was silly and we could assault it. Cloverfield was supposedly real and it assaulted us. That makes the deliberation of camera a whole different thing. Its control is external to what's happening. We do realize this without thinking about it, and it diffuses the terror and changes it to spectacle. This folding technique only works when you have the commitment of the audience. They thought they would get it with the teen soap opera at the beginning. Didn't work for me.It would have worked better if she hadn't ASKED to be rescued.Nice bridge though.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",,Anonymous,Horror
Overall this had the potential to be an all time great film but falls short due to some poor writing.,"Cloverfield (2008) is a movie I rewatched for free on Tubi last month. The storyline focuses on an alien invasion in Manhattan and a group of friends that are helping one of their male friends rescue his ex-girlfriend who just cheated on him and is now with the guy she cheated on him with...This movie is directed by Matt Reeves (Dawn of the Planet of the Apes) and stars Lizzy Caplan (Mean Girls), Jessica Lucas (Evil Dead remake), TJ Miller (Deadpool) and Michael Stahl-David (We Win). The storyline for this movie is absolutely awful, I'll never know how it got approved. The cameraman is the most annoying character in a film of all time (on purpose, I know, but still annoying). There are aspects of the film that are super long and annoying also like the opening party scene and the fact they never have a plan and are chickens with their heads cut off the entire film; however, there's some over the top great aspects to this film also. The action scenes are magnificent. Every depiction of big and little alien beings are remarkable. The scenes at the military base, running through the city and in the helicopter that just couldn't have been done better. Overall this had the potential to be an all time great film but falls short due to some poor writing. I'd give this a solid 7/10 and strongly recommend it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Totally awesome.,"Best. Movie. Ever. So realistic, so scary, and so amazing. 10 stars. I seriously don't think I'll ever see a scary movie as realistic as this one was. It was very satisfying, even though the POV was slightly dizzying. I wouldn't mind watching it again, and I can't wait until it comes out to buy. I really just can't get over how amazing it was! I've seen that some people don't think that it was that good that it didn't meet their expectations but I think that it met mine and then some! Seriously, it was a great movie, and I recommend it for anyone who doesn't mind monster movies, but I think that you should have someone there to hold on to, mostly because there are some ""jumping"" scenes.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A masterful piece of work,"It's not surprising that the below average viewers can't grasp the subtleties and professional finesse of ""Cloverfield"". The movie recourses deliberately to a tacky cliché (the invincible crocosaurus attacking Manhattan) and, by combining it with the minimalistic view pushed to the extreme (the 100% adoption of an amateur video-cam perspective, ""Blair Witch Project""-like), creates a very interesting, dramatic and significant aesthetic formula. The deconstructivist recipe works artfully and skillfully in this case. The suspense is extremely well built up, the thrills abound, and let me tell you: no matter I'm a 48 years old movie professional who watched and coldly analyzed most of the best thrillers, SF, horror and action movies of all times, ""Cloverfield"" REALLY gave me the creeps! One final piece of advice: Are you ready for a breath-taking experiment? Go see ""Cloverfield"". Are you the sub-mediocre viewer, looking for cheap thrills? ""Alien vs. Predator: Requiem"" will bring you the much desired visual orgasm.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A City Falls,"Cloverfield, directed by Matt Reeves, is a found-footage-style monster movie that follows a group of friends trying to survive a massive creature's attack on New York City. The film's narrative is presented through the perspective of a handheld camera, capturing the chaos and destruction from the point of view of the main characters as they attempt to escape the city and rescue one of their own. While Cloverfield is ambitious in its execution, mixing disaster and monster movie tropes with a unique visual style, it ultimately suffers from a lack of character development and narrative depth, making it an entertaining but flawed experience.The performances are decent, though the characters themselves are somewhat underdeveloped. The central character, Rob (Michael Stahl-David), and his friends, including Hud (T. J. Miller) and Beth (Odette Annable), are largely defined by their roles in the narrative rather than by any particularly deep character traits. As the story unfolds, the characters make decisions based on the situation, but their personal arcs aren't explored in a meaningful way, making it difficult for viewers to become emotionally invested in their fates.Reeves' direction is effective in creating a sense of chaos and urgency, utilising the found-footage format to immerse the audience in the terrifying experience of witnessing a massive creature wreak havoc on the city. The shaky camera work and close-up shots add to the realism and intensity of the situation, making the audience feel like they're right there with the characters. The monster itself, while mysterious for much of the film, is well-designed and offers some visually striking moments of destruction and terror.However, while Cloverfield excels in terms of atmosphere and spectacle, it struggles to provide a cohesive and satisfying story. The lack of character development and the focus on visual thrills over substance leaves the film feeling shallow. The found-footage format, intended to add realism, sometimes feels like a gimmick rather than an integral part of the narrative. Additionally, the film's conclusion feels abrupt and unsatisfying, with many questions about the creature and the larger world left unanswered.In conclusion, Cloverfield offers a thrilling visual experience with impressive special effects and a unique take on the monster genre, but it falls short in terms of character development and narrative depth. Fans of disaster and monster movies will likely find it entertaining, but for those seeking a more engaging or thoughtful storyline, the film may leave much to be desired.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Amazing special effects, but don't watch it if you are prone to motion sickness!","This is a video chronicle of a group of young people's escape from Manhattan, where a monster roams the streets, destroying everything in between.The film is intense. The visual effects are stunning, and the realism of the attacks is phenomenal. Buildings collapse, cars get burnt and rocks fall from the sky. These scenes send chills down my spine, and will surely evoke traumatic memories in people who has been through disasters. Things happen quickly, and there is hardly the time to breathe. The plot is rather weak, posing a lot of unanswered questions, but it is made up for the pacing and the action. The only thing I have to complain is that the constant motion from the hand-held camera made me sick. If you are prone to motion sickness like I am, make sure you don't watch this film. Otherwise, you are in for an adventure!",,Anonymous,Horror
It was good enough for me,"I didn't going to watch this movie,I really wasn't interested, but I got some free tickets and said, why not, let's give it a chance. The movie was good, it will keep you on the edge of your seat but it isn't the greatest film as I've heard in other places. The story about a monster trying to destroy a big city isn't new, but this one is different because of the special effects and the ending that in my opinion wasn't the best. It also left me many questions like What is that monster? Where did he come from? Why is he attacking New York City? The camcorder style gives you the feeling of being there but as time passes by, you can get tired and even dizzy with it. The cast doesn't have any known name, thing that makes the movie a little more credible and the performances are convincing enough.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Bigger scaled found footage movie,This is one of the better found footage movies I have come across.

Good Found Footage/Giant Monster Film,"This was film I was intrigued by when I first heard of it as I'm a big fan of giant monster films. My first viewing for this one was right after college. I enjoyed it, but that was the only time I'd seen it. The official synopsis is a group of friends venture deep into the streets of New York on a rescue mission during a rampaging monster attack.It starts off telling us that the footage we are about to watch is from the area now know as 'Cloverfield'. It is formerly known as Central Park. The footage begins with a guy looking out of an apartment overlooking the area. He goes into the bedroom where we see Beth McIntyre (Odette Annable). The man is Rob Hawkins (Michael Stahl-David). They plan their day together going to Coney Island.The footage then shifts to Lily Ford (Jessica Lucas). She is with her boyfriend, getting things ready for a party that night. He is Jason (Mike Vogel), Rob's brother. Rob is leaving for Japan for a new job and they are throwing a going away party. They don't realize they are filming over the great day that Rob and Beth spent together.Back Rob's apartment, Hudson 'Hud' Platt (T.J. Miller) is convinced to film the party and to get people to say on their goodbyes on tape. They give a surprise to Rob and he had no idea. He starts to ask about Beth. She shows up with a new guy, upsetting Rob. All the while, Hud is trying to get the attention of Marlena Diamond (Lizzy Caplan) and figuring out what is going on between his best friend and Beth.Things take quite the turn though when an earthquake hits. They turn on the news to hear about a ship overturned in the harbor and then rush up to the roof to see it. There's another earthquake and they flee outside. There's a giant monster that moves past and the head of the Statue of Liberty rolls down the street. They decide they have to flee the island. This all changes when Rob gets a call from Beth. She's trapped in her apartment and he decides to try to save her. This won't be easy with whatever this giant monster and the things that fall off its back.As I've alluded to, this is only the second time I've seen this film. I knew from the first time that I liked it, but after this rewatch, there were a lot of things I didn't remember. The first thing that struck me is the emotion of this film. It starts off as a really good drama. I love the editing of the happy day that Rob and Beth had together, with the reality of where they are today. Building that emotion in the beginning makes sense as to why he is risking his life for her. To be honest, this is something that I've thought about on a regular basis if something like this happened around me. I was a big fan of that aspect.The next thing was I for whatever reason thought they really didn't show the monster much. I was wrong about that. We get to see the monster a lot. I will get into more about the look of it a bit later, but I do love that much like the Godzilla and other giant monster films, we get to see it quite a bit. Making the film found footage is interesting as well, since we get to see it from the perspective of what it would be like trying to survive this.There is a section where the surviving members of the group have a run in with the military. I love what happens to Marlena during this stretch as I found it interesting. Everything all happens in one night, so they wouldn't have the answers yet. It was interesting how this plays out for sure.Now really the only issue I have with this film goes back to the found footage aspect. I believe that Hud would keep the camera and keep filming. It is even more prevalent in today's society that we would film things around us like he is. This is a major event and will change the course of history. There are just times where I'm like; wouldn't you put the camera down here? It just makes it implausible that you would risk yourself to just keep filming. This doesn't hurt the film, but it is an issue with found footage.This brings me to the pacing, which I think is great. The film doesn't waste any time. The introduction of the characters is good and it doesn't take too long. We continue to learn about each one as they try to survive this event. I really dug that aspect of the film. Rob becomes the catalyst for what they are doing and I thought it was interesting how it presents his issue and how he actually grows from it. I thought the ending was good and bringing us to how the footage was found. I dug the making confidential and that the government has confiscated it.Acting was something else was really good. It is crazy that quite a few of these actors have gone on to do other things and this film really shows their potential. Caplan is solid as the outsider. She does bring some sarcasm and I thought her role was good. Lucas is interesting and her frustration was good. She is a good friend throughout. Miller also brings humor. His character isn't that different in Deadpool. I love his nervous tick to just talk, especially about inappropriate things. Stahl-David is good. He is kind of the hero and I thought his growth was solid. I just love that he's scared to fail and can completely understand it. Vogel was also solid as his brother. Annable is gorgeous and it is just a shame she wasn't in the film more. I'm also a big fan of her. It does well at making you care about these characters, so when some of them die, you feel something. The rest of the cast round out the film for what they needed as well.Next would be the effects of the film. To bring a monster like this to life, you have to go CGI, which I thought looked great. The monster looks real and the things they have it doing are as well. There are a few moments where it doesn't hold up, but very little. As I said earlier, I was actually surprised how much they do show the monster. The setting is also great to make New York look as empty as everyone is trying to flee. That is an underrated aspect of the film as well. The film is also shot very well for being found footage. It does make you feel like you are really there.The score is something else that can be tricky in a film like this. The only music I remember was at the party and it felt like we were really there. The rest of the sound design was good to make it feel as real as possible. You get the sounds of monster, the army fighting back and just buildings falling part. I thought this was well done to help build the realism.Now with that said, I'm definitely glad I gave this film a rewatch. I knew that I liked it the first time, but I can confirm this film is really good. As a fan of giant monster films, this one feels so real. Going with found footage like they did make it feel like this really happening and the realism is great. I thought the acting, effects and sound design were really good. The low running time and editing of the film keep the tension building to a satisfying conclusion. I even like the beginning being somewhat of a drama helps us to like the characters and care about what happens to them. If you don't like found footage, I would avoid this. If that's not the case, I think this is a really good film, especially if you like giant monster films. I'd recommend giving this one a viewing and it really does hold up to multiple viewings.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Watch this film, but be prepared for the flaws.","I just re-watched Cloverfield, I originally saw it in the Cinema when it was first released and remember enjoying the film, but disliking parts of it, so a year later decided to re-watch it to get a better idea of what exactly worked and what didn't.My first thought after seeing it again at home, even on a big TV, is that the atmosphere is much stronger in the cinema. I remember driving home after seeing the film in the cinema once it was already dark out, and looking at the sky and finding it too calm, after seeing the explosions and fires and general mayhem brought about in the film. I think moments like these are what make movies most memorable, which reminds me of being a kid watching Jumanji in the cinema, and on the way home hearing the drums of a nearby circus or fair which instantly led me to think of the Jumanji drums when someone is about to discover the game.Anyway, back on topic, this film isn't perfect, the obvious flaws are the pretty boring, elongated beginning of the movie. The first 20 minutes to me are unbearable, and one reason I love being able to watch the film at home, is that skipping the first 17/18 minutes is a trivial thing to do and very little of the feel of the film is lost. I do think it is important to establish a a ""calm before the storm"" atmosphere in films such as these. A film that nails this perfectly is The Host (2006), which has one of the best introductions to a monster in modern cinema. (In fact there are many similarities between The Host and Cloverfield, and anyone that even partially enjoyed one should check out the other.) Cloverfield, unfortunately, does not do the ""calm before the storm"" very well. The character's are not interesting, their lives are not something I want to witness 20 minutes of when they aren't running for their lives, which is obviously a big flaw in a film that needs you to feel loss when characters are killed.I do not understand the hate towards shaky cam in films that apply it well, and this film applies it well. Unfortunately due to the acting more than anything it doesn't always feel realistic, despite the visuals being stunning and very apocalyptic. I find myself having more issue with the acting, which isn't terrible, as emotional scenes like in the subway, I feel successfully do their job. However some of the throw-away dialogue seems very difficult to listen to, which might be more of a script issue than acting, but the acting to me still feels over the top, but without a better dialogue I guess there's no real way to measure this.I note that some reviews seem to indicate that people take issue with the lack of information of the origins of the creature and other facts and information about what exactly is going on, but I strongly disagree with this point of view. A ""realistic"" shaky cam film that is meant to be from the citizens' point of view shouldn't have facts, because it is unlikely facts would be given if a situation like this ever did arise. As stated in the movie ""by the time you see this video you'll probably know more about this than we do"", which is pretty much exactly as you'd expect, nothing is ever known the minute it happens. I hate to make 9/11 references because every review of this movie has one, but no one knew what was going on as the events of 9/11 happened, all we had was speculation.Finally, I also have a problem with the ending of the film. I don't want to have any spoilers in this review so I will be very vague, but some of the events (if not all of them) are extremely over the top. I'm not sure how it should have ended as trying to think of the film ending earlier than it does would make it way too abrupt and would leave the film very anti-climatic. Perhaps the film would be better if the flying scenes were removed entirely, which would be sad because the visuals are very well done. Also the ""face to face"" scene is over the top for my liking.I look forward to the sequel of this film, I hope they learn from their mistakes and if they do reveal more information about what exactly happened, do it tastefully and not just have a scene with a scientist explaining everything because he's a scientist and therefore knows everything.if you haven't seen this film, do so, it is for the most part a decent film, especially in terms of atmosphere and visuals. If you see this movie at home, don't feel bad about wanting to skip a big chunk of the character introductions, because they are pretty hard to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Filming a monster live,"Cloverfield is a movie that with the passage of time has been somewhat forgotten, but at the time there is no denying that it was a fascinating movie because of how it was made when found footage movies began to be born. The production of the film is quite good due to the amount of special effects and action that are well coordinated with the movements of the camera that captures all the events that occur in the film. Doing something like this should not have been easy because of how it should have been planned and normally, found footage is usually done without much budget or high-end special effects. Even so, Cloverfield is a movie that works well and was well constructed despite being somewhat forgettable. My rating for this movie is 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Interesting but ultimately unsatisfying,"Take the hand-held camera gimmick of The Blair Witch Project and marry it to a standard monster-destroys-city flick and you've got Cloverfield. It's an interesting way to tell a monster movie, seen closely through the eyes of a small, bland group of friends caught up in the disaster, yet while I found it interesting it never really pulled me in, and the ending did not make me happy.You can't talk about this movie without talking about Blair Witch, mainly because Blair Witch took the same gimmick and got so much more out of it. Even though that earlier movie had a fraction of the budget, it used the device so much more effectively; compare the final talking to the camera scenes from both films and tell me Cloverfield's is even a tenth as effective.It is also less convincing as a premise. The guy with the camera is oddly devoted to documenting the event, to the point where he will stand back and film when he should be helping. In the real world, one of his friends would have grabbed the camera and thrown it against a wall. Because of the way it's done, you never forget that this is just a clever device. Blair Witch was more convincing because the camera was the whole point and you were dealing with someone who would think in those terms.Still, it does have it's good points. Because we see everything from one point of view, we get information in bits and pieces and never get anything like a real explanation of what's going on. There are individually effective scenes. The cameraman is vaguely likable, although everyone else is pretty forgettable.Ultimately though, the hand-held-single view camera is not an effective way to film action or horror scenes, the story and characters fail to be interesting, and the ending is very disappointing.

instant classic!,"at first i was upset that they decided to go the hand-held camera route, but once the action started, i thought it was nothing short of genius. this movie is perhaps the greatest pg-13 movie i have ever seen. it had non-stop action as well as phenomenal acting. while the concept was somewhat far-fetched, this movie made me believe that it is extremely possible. some people may laugh at that comment, but only because they are close-minded. if you stop and think about how big the ocean actually is, it is entirely possible that there could be ""things"" in there that have not yet been discovered. i usually won't give movies like this the time of day. however, i couldn't be happier that i did.GO SEE CLOVERFIELD!!!

Wow!,"The Blair Witch styled first person shooting was clever for about 5 minutes then it started giving me a headache. I had to close my eyes to regain my equilibrium. I just don't have the stomach for that shot. That's why I hate watching people's home movies. However, I regret that I was not physically able to fully enjoy the experience, because the movie was really good. It was definitely an original take on a classic sci-fi tale of alien invasion. The suspense kept me on the edge of my seat. And the ending was not entirely predictable as it often is with this type of movie. And the graphics were spectacular.And best of all, it is a discussion movie. I love a movie that my friends and I can discuss after we see it.

One of the must seen monster movie,"The point of the movie is actually what i am interested in.It shows how life can change or collapse in a second,how everything suddenly can turn into trouble .And also i am so surprised about the backward hidden message.Sound gave me goose-bumps.Just for that i watched the movie twice. In my opinion this is not the kind of movie that you can watch,understand and enjoy the first time it is watched.The intrepid young guy is trying to record all the extraordinary situations.I had a different kind of experience watching the second time.There are different kinds of recording techniques in the movie that i saw first time in my life. I guess the main topic is not the creature or having fun or something mortal but the main topic is how life is empty.Money,fun,friends,alcohols,relationships...all are temporary.Especially at the end of the movie where there is another part remaining ,i think that part explains everything.So i voted 9 out of 10 and it deserves that.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Cloverfield is a thrill ride! Nothing more, nothing less.","Now a lot of you may hear about this movie lacking in certain areas such as: bad camera, boring opening, plot holes, lack of monster shots and lack of explanation. With that being said, those aren't the points that the movie was trying to hit. The movie is shot with a first person camera that is very shaky, but I can't imagine someone going through this and holding a camera very steady. The first part of the movie is not intense but sets up the story nicely to let you know why the people do the things they do in the movie. There are things that make you go like wait how did that happen, but you can look at every single movie ever made and pin-point problems like that. The lack of monster shots and explanation ADDS to the effect that the makers are going for in the fact that the movie takes place over a single night and the characters in the movie don't get an explanation either. This isn't a movie that was made to be some dramatic masterpiece with a neatly done opening and wrapping things up nicely with perfect closure. This movie was made to be a pure thrill ride and that's exactly what it is. A MUST SEE!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

traditional creature feature in found footage style,The military recovers a camera from Central Park in NYC after a mysterious incident. The movie consists of the footage found on the camera. Rob Hawkins (Michael Stahl-David) and girlfriend Beth McIntyre (Odette Annable) are going to Coney Island. Then the tape is recorded over at a later date. Jason Hawkins (Mike Vogel) and his girlfriend Lily Ford (Jessica Lucas) are throwing a surprise farewell party for his brother Rob who is moving to Japan for work. Idiot friend Hud Platt (T.J. Miller) is given the job of recording. He starts flirting with disinterested friend of a friend Marlena Diamond (Lizzy Caplan). Then things start happening and the group goes out into the streets.The story is a traditional creature feature. The young cast is photogenic and charismatic. The found footage is good as far as the new style goes. The main problem I have is the camera always finding just the right frame. It gets a little too obvious over time. I like all the big effects but the scariest stuff happens in the dark tunnel. This is bigger than most found footage movies and done well.,8.0,Anonymous,Horror

"hey, that's actually pretty good","Yes, Cloverfield's pretty good. IT had fast paced action with quite a good horror/monster movie premise. The monster was very well done the story makes sense, unlike lots of horror flicks that is just full of dumb people. It was actually scary and quite intense, it is a faced paced movie not an excruciating and long horror movie of some creepy baby attempting to murder someone for two hours.The found footage element was quite well done too, actually I feel that it elevated the movie a lot. In fact if we take that out it wouldn't be half as good as it was, obviously the whole mystery of not knowing what the movie is gonna be about was quite a marketing strategy. It really sort of creates an immersive and real-world vibe to the film.I watched cloverfield just as many others, not knowing what I am getting myself into but the outcome was great. In fact I must reiterate this movie I feel is as good as it is because of the nature of it and that great marketing strategy. Because no expectation= positive outcome even if it's not as good as it is. This is an example of how a movie going experience does not always start in the theatre and in fact the entire marketing campaign building up to it really helps make the experience a much better one.However I think that there are some flaws despite all of those positives, first of all as I have said the movie alone is not so good, it was quite well done but the marketing deserves a lot of credit. Second of all, I do wish that the monster was much better realised, perhaps more focus on the monster that could come with a slightly longer run time. But overall the positives definitely outweighs the negatives",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Redefining the Found-Footage Genre,"Gritty, dirty and stylistic, it plays on very dark and painful imagery of real-world catastrophe through the lens of forced perspective to build a truly immersive and tense experience. Cleverly juxtaposing scenes of destruction against more hopeful and positive memories through the use of the camera's old recordings, Cloverfield is able to invest its audience into the lives and character of its cast in very short time which puts us firmly on their side, while the exceptional sound design and sparing use of effects make this feel more like a VR experience than a movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The monster was creepy AF,"First of all, when I first watched the official teaser of the movie I liked it and I had high expectations about it. Eventually, it was as good as I had imagined and I enjoyed it. The plot of the movie was very interesting and mysterious, but not innovative because there are many monster movies similar to this one. The storyline was kinda well-written and well-explained, even though it was simple and easy to understand. The characters were interesting and likeable, but they weren't well-developed. Also, the filming location of the movie (New York) was great. The casting was nice and their performances were descent. I have to admit, it wasn't a scary movie, however there were some jumpscares. Moreover, the monster's appearance was creepy and the CGI effects were very well edited. The killcount of the movie wasn't bloody and most death scenes were done off-screen, so nothing explicit was shown. The 1st attack was definitely unpredictable, shocking and intense. The 2nd act was action-filled, terrifying and full of death scenes. The ending scene was kinda predictable and emotionally intense. Overall, ""Cloverfield"" was a nice found footage horror film, intense, terrifying and I would definitely recommend it to anyone!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

One of the best films in genre!,"Clearly one of the best films in the genre, Cloverfield delivers an intense and gripping experience. At just over an hour long, it packs a lot of action into a short runtime, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats from start to finish. The film's unique perspective, shown through the lens of a regular person who happens to be caught in the middle of a monster attack, adds a layer of realism and immersion that sets it apart from other monster movies. The handheld camera style and found footage approach make the chaos and terror feel immediate and personal, drawing audiences into the story in a visceral way. The characters are relatable and their reactions to the unfolding disaster are believable, adding depth to the narrative. The pacing is relentless, with little downtime between action sequences, ensuring that the tension remains high throughout. The special effects are impressive, especially considering the film's modest budget, and the design of the monster is both terrifying and original. In a genre where giant creatures often wreak havoc on cities, Cloverfield stands out as my favorite. It combines innovative filmmaking techniques with a compelling story and memorable performances, making it a must-watch for fans of monster movies and action thrillers alike. The film's impact on the genre is undeniable, influencing many subsequent films and setting a high bar for future entries. Whether you're a longtime fan of monster films or new to the genre, Cloverfield offers a thrilling and unforgettable cinematic experience.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the best monster movies you'll find.,"Cloverfield is an exhilarating experience. A perfect cross between a kaiju movie and a monster horror flick. The use of the found footage format almost a decade before it was popularized must have made it a real spectacle to see in 2008. You also get to see the story play out from the character's perspectives, further enhancing the scares and action. The first half of the movie gives us time to spend time with the characters before the plot fully kicks into gear. The Clover is such a great monster design, and is portrayed in the best way possible to be put into a movie like this. The visual effects are top tier, and the scares are exciting and get your heart racing. We see the military in a dire state of panic trying to get rid of this new unknown threat, we see the civilians fleeing for their lives, and the monster annihilating everything in it's path. The film also leaves things unexplained, like the monster's origins, what happened to the city, and if the monster was actually killed. It's left to our imaginations to fill in the gaps, and this is something I have always loved.If you're looking for a monster movie like no other, if you want a movie experience you'll never forget, this is the thing you're looking for.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Didnt mind the shaky cam,"I think it was a pretty solid movie. The found footage style did not bother me. And while, I dont think many people would opt to film the entire thing I can at least buy the reason why the character Hud gives. Though, maybe it would have been a simpler fix to make the character a journalist. That might have been more believable. But, overall I actually liked the aspect of the found footage. I felt like it gave you a unique experience. Yes, it can be shaky at times and yes sometimes the focus isnt always the best, but thats what it would be like in that situation. I think it captured how disorienting and out of body that would feel. And I think the movie really shines with how tense it is.The movie loses some points for me for the characters. They werent very likable. Not too mention some of the choices they made. Like, at one point (still somewhat early on) Rob decides he's going to rescue his friend (whom he's in love with) and his 3 other friends decide to go with him. Why? Its not like they dont know whats happening yet and think its safe. They know (and have seen) that its a giant monster (which personally would make me crap my pants) and one of their group members has already died. I get why Rob might think its a good idea, but why do the others think this a good idea (especially since the Monster is in the area they are headed towards). And especially Lizzy Caplan's character Marlena. As far as I know, she doesnt even know Rob that well and wasnt supposed to be at the party anyway. It would have made sense for her to join the evacuation team when she had the chance. I get movie has to movie but I think it would have made more sense if something had happened that caused them to be truly separated from other people. At least then I could understand why they would all follow him (safety in numbers).I don't know. It was good, certainly could have been improved upon. But a fun watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Decent if unremarkable found footage thriller,"I'm no fan of the 'found footage' format and have never understood the popularity of the original 'Blair Witch Project' movie, but I honestly don't think 'Cloverfield' is as bad as some of the other reviews would have you believe. The film is exactly what you expect it to be - a first person thriller full of scares, screams and CGI. It's unoriginal, uninspiring and unspectacular, but it was never intended to be in the first place.If you can put your brain into neutral for an hour an a half, 'Cloverfield' is a decent if unremarkable piece of entertainment. Okay, the constant camera movement is nauseating and the characters dumb and annoying, but it functions well as a cheap sci-fi flick.

cgi DOESN'T make a good film,"Right, i'll try not to spoil the film for anyone but heres my review:Rubbish. I'd like to say blair witch with a budget but its not even that. At least blair witch had a cool story and wicked script to it. This was just lets show you what we can do with CGI whilst trying to be ""real"". When is Hollywood going to realise that effects don't make a GOOD film?The so called plot of this film, is a guy trying to save his EX girlfriend when the city is attacked by some monster. Thats pretty much it. But some questions have to be asked along the way. 1: why would you care about saving a ex when shes busy banging another bloke (who just disappears) 2: Why is it that a monster is attacking the city and your main concern is a camera. 3: You've just been attacked by little monsters in a subway, why wouldn't you think to arm yourselves with anything you can find? 4: How is it that this camera is a normal camcorder, though it can survive being dropped god knows how many times, a helicopter cash, dropped from the monsters mouth and a explosion without a scratch on the lens or marks on the tape? 5: What the hell is the monster? There's no explanation at all of what it is and where it came from.There are more stupid things but it would contain spoilers. Basically this film is the biggest no brainer i think I've ever seen. One good thing about it though is the sound. Quality surround sound",,Anonymous,Horror
Cloverfield,"I suppose the first thing to warn of is - it is shot entirely POV, and for many (including me) that can prove to be really quite annoying at times (and particularly difficult to light effectively). The premiss is that ""Jason"" (Mike Vogel) and girlfriend ""Lily"" (Jessica Lucas) are living the happy lives of a young couple. When one night they set off to attend a leaving do for their pal ""Rob"" (Michael Stahl-David) their party is shattered by what seems like an earthquake, followed by a desperate hunt for his girlfriend ""Beth"" (Odette Annable) as something ginormous is stalking the streets of New York. The camera passes from person to person, so that does give us a different perspective of the ensuing mania - but actually I didn't find them a particularly engaging bunch of panic-stricken folks so I can't say I was very concerned for their safety. Some of the decisions they make - admittedly under a fair degree of duress - seem staggeringly risky and/or stupid; the sound editing overdoes the screeching and wailing to such an extent that the dialogue can be barely audible at times, and though well paced eventually, it still takes just a bit too long to actually get going. It is certainly an interesting concept, and if the style of cinematography doesn't drive you mad after twenty minutes, then I reckon you will quite enjoy the intimacy of the thing - at times, it is actually quite scary.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Near brilliant,"Man, what a rush! ""Cloverfield"" is, in short, a wild ride.I'm not going to go into the story at all because there isn't much more to the story than everyone knows. It's not that kind of a movie.What it is, however, is near brilliant. Not everything works (almost everything does though), but all in all, it's well worth the admission price.The decision to make it using a hand held camera was genius. It really puts you into the middle of the chaos, and makes the need for richly-developed characters not needed. Plus it intensifies everything by about 100 times. Some will complain that this makes the film have a dizzying effect, but except in a few spots, that's not really an issue.The best part of the movie is the dialogue and the acting. For the most part, particularly in the beginning, the film feels almost unscripted. The people say things and talk almost exactly like real people do, and the actors supplement that quality by acting like real people, and not like movie characters. Again, this heightens the movie's immediacy and realism, and avoids making this movie having an intelligence level of zero.In any review of this movie, there is going to be some mention of 9/11. This is as unavoidable as it is necessary to discuss. In a few spots, it brings back unsettling memories of that tragedy. I can't fault the filmmakers for this because since the event was so traumatic, it was probably unavoidable. Or maybe it was intentional. If so, it works.This is a summer action movie without a doubt. Why the producers decided to release this in January is quite obvious. This time of year is a bridge between Oscar-movies and movies that would cost less to flop than to shelve. Since this is a radically new approach (one that has never been tried with a big-budget action movie-at least for the whole film), the producers probably didn't want their whole summer resting on the shoulders of something they weren't confident would work. Releasing ""Cloverfield"" at this time would cover two bases: if it was a huge, unexpected success, it could be up for some Oscars (as it looks now, that is highly unlikely except for the awards that typically go to action movies, since the Golden Globes are typically good indicators of the Oscar nominees). However, if the movie flopped, it would disappear along with the rest of the post-Oscar trash without so much as a blip on the radar screen.I really hope this movie does well. Given how stingy mainstream movie producers are with new ideas, they probably won't try this approach unless it makes big (and I mean BIG) bucks. That would be a shame, because when used appropriately, the use of a hand-held camera can be very effective. However, it is a little early for the post-Oscar garbage (that usually comes in February), so there is a definite threat that it might get lost in the Oscar racing movies. Should this happen, mainstream movie producers would probably assume that this movie was rotten as a whole, thus ending the careers of the approach as well as the actors (which would be horrible, since all are great, especially Michael Stahl-David, who is excellent). Only time will tell what the future holds for this kind of movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Gets better and better with every re-watch,"I enjoy this movie more and more every time I watch it.

Having read some of the other reviews it appears that some folk have been hyper critical with the lack of explanation of some parts or consistently repeating the mantra ""this doesnt make any sense.""Others levy that as a criticism towards the movie, I actually think it's a strength. The POV camera style immerses us as if we are in on the action, and the 'not knowing' or unanswered questions that we have mimic the characters knowledge and lack of understanding through out the movie.What's more, and I learned only after watching the movie is that it is jam pack full of easter eggs and there were entire websites/news stories created in the run up to its release which gives some context and answers a lot of the questions that come to mind throughout, so if you're looking for more details/backstory, the information is out there.You dont have to go to that length to appreciate it though.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
One word: Breathtaking,"Wow. I mean wow. I had really low expectations when in reality, it became one of my favorite monster movies of all time. A concept like found footage is still pretty new amongst the film industry after the insane success of The Blair Witch Project back in 1999 (picking up 3 times its budget). That's why we are still exploring with this new format of cinematography. Thus, a lot of them are utter garbage.Let's go over what makes this movie phenomenal and, especially, why does the found footage style does fit as the cinematography. The main plot of the film is basically ""Cloverfield"" attacking Manhattan alongside with the filler love/family conflict just for the sake of the runtime. Even though I absolutely didn't find anything interesting or at the very least likable with the characters, the experience that they had to go through made my heart raise to the level I barely couldn't breathe. The camera-work was genius not because it's ""new and groundbreaking"", but because we have to witness the horror the stars of the movie had to deal with, mainly the big dude holding the camcorder.Now for the ""not so great"" portions. Like I mentioned earlier, characters are just as bland as a plain yogurt you can find at your nearest grocery store, with the addition of being total unlikable d-bags. If there's a skyscraper-size creature demolishing New York, might want to hide inside the building or find an underground cellar rather than roam around the streets.But hey, it's a monster movie that suffers similar issues like Pacific Rim and Transformers. You were expecting the monsters and robots to be the icons, not the people. Yet, you left the theater without a major let down.I highly recommend this found footage movie (unless you have motion sickness) if you're into disastrous flicks.

"Fairly effective & well made, but don't expect logic","A relatively small budget for a film of this scope gets a lot of bang for its buck. It's impressive looking and never really boring, but man some of the characters' behavior sure is stupid now and then. Actually, probably more than now and then. An attractive cast, a splendid production and a weak script made this a success and created some awful sequels though one is interesting, but it's not really a sequel in anyway other than the title. This put Matt Reeves on the map and he must be given credit for making this work as well as it does.

I waited 6 months...and it was damn well worth it!,"When I first saw the trailer and the beginning of Transformers I turned to my brother and said ""We've got plans for January 18th."" And I just got back and it was worth the wait! Many people complain about the shaky camera movement making them sick, but it didn't bother me and I really believed it helped the movie feel more real. The great acting also extremely helped the overall mood of the film. Although I saw the statue of Liberty head fly in the trailer so many times, there was nothing like seeing the characters reaction to it after it happened.If you go into the movie expecting it to be all about the monster you WILL be disappointed. Although the monster looks crazy and great and does show up at various points of the film, it is not the star. The point of the movie is to show what a normal person would do faced with this situation and not what the army and president would do. Therefore, the characters obviously don't go looking for the monster.The movie has no real back story or explanations as to the origin of the monster, but it would make no sense if it did. This is just a video taped by four teenagers fighting to survive. So unless the monster had a big ""Made in China"" sticker on his back, how could they ever know.Overall the movie was amazing. Great characters, sound, special effects, and it's a roller coaster ride of emotion as the movie unfolds. This was worth the long wait, and I'm glad a movie as great as this can be made.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
worst camera work,"What bothered me most is the annoying camera work. Yes, yes I am aware that the viewer should get the impression that the footage it shot by a handy cam and not by professionals. But it just more and more annoying the longer you watch. The camera keeps most of the time tilting from left to the right in exactly the same angle, this gives the audience the impression that you are on a ship at open sea rather than being on land. Indeed, I had to fight sea sickness!For comparison, the movie Quarantine is told by a hand held camera, but the makers didn't overdo it to become such a nerve-racking camera shaking.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
amazing!,"This movie didn't let down the fans! Ever since it's mysterious trailer premiered before transformers, the internet has been buzzing like crazy! Now it's out! after 6 months it out. The first person view gave me chills, and the monster looked liked nothing I have ever thought of. There were some scenes in this movie i swear they should win an award. the acting wasn't bad either. few cheesy lines but hey, many masterpieces do as well, and that won't ruin the fun people will have watching this movie.

Just Doesn't Reach Its Potential,"Background: Though it was a successful online/social networking campaign for the mysterious Cloverfield (named after an L.A. freeway exit), the secret came out early enough that it's simply a monster movie. Directed by Matt Reeves (writer of TV's ""Felicity"" and Under Siege 2: Dark Territory) and written by Drew Goddard (TV's ""Lost"" & ""Alias""), Cloverfield stars a diverse bunch of good-looking young people who you've never seen before. The gimmick is that the whole film is supposed to be confidential government footage recovered from a camcorder recovered at the area ""formerly known as Central Park."" Ooooh...Synopsis: The movie has no music, starting from the beginning. Seriously, it's ""government property,"" with a confidential stamp and all kinds of ""official"" A/V garble. Anyway, we meet Rob and Beth, hot best friends who have recently become a couple (they had a one night stand?). Rob, all of maybe 22 years old, is the Vice President (why?) of some unnamed company that is relocating him to Japan. Footage of Rob and Beth on their dreamy date is cut off by a live recording of Rob's going away party three weeks later, which is where the story starts. Beth shows up with ""Travis,"" Rob is crushed, Beth storms off, blah blah blah. After watching what feels like about 20 minutes of MTV's ""Real World,"" a rumble shakes through Manhattan, followed by explosions and, shortly, the head of the Statue of Liberty rolling through the streets. Our narrator and videographer is Rob's friend Hud, the kind of idiot sidekick that would be ridiculous (and strong) enough to hold a camera up in front of his face for 7 hours - all while dodging monsters, little monsters, bullets, mortar fire, collapsing buildings, and a helicopter crash. Anyway, we're with Hud, Rob, Rob's brother's girlfriend, and Rob's friend's friend, who Hud has a major crush on. While the ENTIRE population of Manhattan evacuates over the Brooklyn Bridge, our foursome heads to Midtown to heroically rescue Beth. Here and there tragedy strikes, and more than once we see the plodding monster stomp through the streets, impervious to all military weaponry. By the end, our lovers have reunited in Central Park, which is of course where the camcorder was recovered...ooooh...I Loved: + Some of the visual effects - buildings leaning against each other, explosion from the rooftop, monster shots.I Liked: + That some significant plot pieces were unresolved (where did the monster come from, what happened afterwards, etc.). + The ending, in a way. A little cheesy, but ultimately satisfying.I Disliked: - The predictability of the Brooklyn Bridge and post-monster-bite scenes. - When the video would obnoxiously cut back to Beth and Rob's happy date.I Hated: - The cringe-inducing acting. Really bad. Really. Bad. - Not being able to suspend my disbelief about some things (the little monsters would have hunted them through the city, no?), while totally accepting other things (a monster existing). - Hud's unceasing sense of humor.Grade: Writing - 7 Acting - 5 Production - 10 Emotional Impact - 8 Music - 5 Significance - 3Total: 38/50= 76% = CLast Word: Cloverfield is a movie with an identity crisis - bad enough to doom it, but unbearable when combined with terrible acting. It's easy enough to say it's Blair Witch meets Godzilla meets Jurassic Park meets 9/11 meets King Kong meets Alien. But that's not what I mean. What I mean is Cloverfield doesn't know what it wants to be. You can't have have some realistic elements (panic in Manhattan, accurate geography, real time, human weakness) and some ridiculous elements (ability to hold a working camera that long, nobody in the subway stations, functioning electricity, no cars on the subway line, etc.). Either go way over the top and make it funny, or take a subtle, scary approach (don't even show the monster, for starters). I'll give Cloverfield credit for at least trying a new style, but all it really showed was that that style doesn't work without a better story. This is where I desperately suggest seeing The Host, which has all of the elements of Cloverfield yet somehow manages a balance between comedy, fright, amazing visuals and characters you can care about. This is also where I'll mention J.J. Abrams - as only a producer, this is where his mention belongs. Had he written and/or directed, it might have been a better movie...",,Anonymous,Horror
"Intriguing Marketing, Poor Follow Through","I gave it a six because it was only boring during the opening party scenes. After the opening the action picks up and you start to enjoy it, then the nausea from the camera's movements start to kick in, this had me screaming in my head to just end already because no movie should make you feel like you've been spinning in circles for 30 minutes. I only went because the mysterious marketing campaign sucked me in, after leaving it left me wishing that I hadn't paid $9 to see it, if interested try to make it a matinée. Overall, interesting story, moments that will make you jump, a nauseating camera and poor story leave you feeling screwed over but entertained for a short while.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A New Standard In Monster Films,"I just got back from seeing Cloverfield and I have to tell you, I was amazed. When the teaser first came out in July, I was one of the many who was blown away with it. And like many, I started thinking: What if this thing doesn't live up to the hype? Those fears were put to rest today. The fact that this filmed from first person point of view really hads to the thrills. Sure it gets kinda shaky at times, but just remember, this isn't a professional cameraman. This is just a guy filming a surprise party that gets caught in the middle of an attack and he is trying to film while the world around him falls. The monster was totally original. To answer questions people have, you do get to see the entire monster in the end. It is an amazing thrill ride to go on. And if you just go with your fear when watching it, you will enjoy it even more. There will be scenes that ring familiar from 9/11 but that adds to fear. To know that New York had something similar happen and that people were walking through the rubble and dust in shock really makes you think. Anyway, this is a very good monster flick and I wouldn't be surprised if we see other movie producers copy this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A pretty good apocalyptic thriller,"Cloverfield was definitely one of the best monster movie ever made, if not the best. The beginning of the movie is basically the introduction of the characters, and Rob's goodbye-party. Then the fun begins. The producer did a great job showing us the destruction of the city and the chaos that was ravaging the streets.I don't think the movie would've had that kind of atmosphere without the hand-held camera view. Some people might get headaches at times but I didn't. The monster was quite original and the idea of introducing smaller monsters was genius. The only disappointing thing is that there is no information on the monster whatsoever..! I recommend Cloverfield for any action/monster movie fans.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the Scariest Films Ever!,"This film is what The Blair Witch and the American Godzilla wanted to be. Those of us who grew up in the 50s and 60s and watched all the giant something-or-other movies on TV after school or Friday's Fright Night late show saw a world where scientists with screwdrivers, pilots, soldiers, reporters, or teenagers with headlights could stop monsters. And there was always the lengthy exposition scene to tell us where the monster came from and what it wanted. Cloverfield has none of those conceits. It just shows ordinary people in an extraordinary circumstance they don't understand--which, I imagine, is how it would really be for the average person if something the size of a skyscraper attacked his or her city. Cloverfield is a stunning piece of work.",,Anonymous,Horror
Slice of Life Revival of the Monster Movie,"The mark of a great film is when the audience can't stop talking about it when they walk out of the theater. Cloverfield certainly delivers in that area, combining electrifying effects, great character development, and a unique point of view that brings a sleeping genre back to life in a stunningly real way.I was definitely foaming at the mouth for the 18th to roll around so I could catch this film on opening night, and it was well worth the wait. The most remarkable aspect of this movie was the realism. Shot entirely from a first-person perspective, I caught myself trying to get a better view right from the edge of my seat. I was afraid the hand-held camera would take away from the experience, but it only made it better. The visuals are on the cutting edge of Hollywood realism and you can't help but ask yourself how it was done, as much of the green-screen work looks perfect. When it comes to special effects, Cloverfield is a 10.The downfall of this genre is typically a perspective that gives away too much. Cloverfield is simply a slice-of-life. There's no explanations, no resolutions, just a few hours of an experience that leaves its mark. The characters are easy to relate to, and the dual plot gives resonance to it's realistic charm. The beginning wets the appetite just enough so that when the action starts, you almost weren't expecting it. This isn't a hero film though, it's too honest to try and be more than it is; it just gives us enough to leave us wanting more. The only thing I found to fall a little short was the length of the film - it's only 80 mins and my audience really wanted more - to the point were they were yelling at the screen and calling for a sequel.I think Cloverfield has set the bar much higher when it comes to indie-style films that tackle a major Hollywood trademark. The effects, character realism and point-of-view that includes the audience in the action hasn't been done this well before. The movie is fun, scary, flows well and definitely kept my attention right through to the end. Big recommendation on seeing this in the theater to get the full experience.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Knowledge,"When I watched this (years after the actual release of the movie), I did know what this was about, as opposed to the people who may have gone with little knowledge into this. I still think it works out pretty neatly and even holds up after all those years. You can call this an adventure if you want to.So it is mostly pretty people doing their thing and it is ""found footage"", but this never really bothered me much. I was surprised by the different endings on it. Some not that bad to be truthful, but that's up to you to decide if they chose the right one. But before that you get a tension filled movie, that could've been a romantic comedy, but has as you probably know a twist to it ... Enjoy the (well executed) mayhem!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the best movies I've seen,"I don't see a lot of movies because I don't like many movies; for better or worse, my standards are way above those of most people.

Anyway, all of the people I went to see the movie with, including myself, thought that the film was great. I was impressed.If you're the kind of person who likes the standard fare of movies, where you the hero gets the girl and saves the world after saying some cheesy line, you probably won't enjoy this film much more than anything else. However, if you'd like an artistic and dramatic spin on a done-to-death genre, I whole-heartedly suggest that you see Cloverfield. You won't be disappointed.Cloverfield kept me interested and on the edge of my seat for the entire length of the film. From its perfect beginning to its perfect ending, I had a blast.

"Cloverfield, more like ""Dud-field""","Okay, I just went an saw it, and quite frankly, it BOMBED! It took for ever to get this going, and not to mention, it's like watching the Blair Witch Project all over again. Maybe if it had more noticeable actors other than the hot-tie that chick show on WB (Related). (watched it with my girlfriend, don't ask) Other than the constant motion of the camcorder, which got a little annoying after awhile, the movie itself kept ""teasing"" you, showing glimpses of the ""monster"" and the military fighting it. This was a lot like Will Smith's last movie, you want more--- more action, more showmanship, more something!!! Bottom line- if it was a regular movie, it would have kicked a little more ass, but unfortunately, it's a dud, and a 6 out of 10 is right fully so.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Cloverfield was Excellent!,"Not since Alien have I seen such a great preview; just enough info to tantalize, without ruining the movie as so many do these days. Cloverfield delivers, too; plenty of suspense, chills, and action, with believable characters and realistic drama that truly moves you. Michael Stahl-David and the rest of the cast impressed me with their abilities to show us characters, not actors, as I was drawn into their interactions, and their reactions as the chaos began. The point of view, that of the video camera, could be tedious and trite, but great direction by Matt Reeves makes it highly believable, and the varied camera angles throughout the action scenes add a wonderfully unsettled feel to the unfolding drama. As a long-time creature feature fan, I highly recommend this film. Just leave the kids at home, please. Any younger than mature teens could be very frightened.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Waste of my time.,"I know a lot of people loved this movie but to me it was an almost total waste. First off it took way too long for it to develop. Even once it did the action and drama were below par. And the end...did it end. So glad I got this from the library and didn't pay a cent thus the only thing wasted was time. I did notice there is suppose to be a sequel so maybe that was the whole idea. You know, kind of like a soap where they entice you to come back to see how it turns out. Unfortunately for this sleeper it did not spark my interest enough to bring me back to find out if it really does end. If the writer of this dribble has a day job I suggest he/she keep it.",,Anonymous,Horror
"A lot of people say that they hated it, probably just to be opposite","This is not a movie which tries to get people's attention in order to do well at the box office. In other words, what people call, not pretentious. J. J. Abrahams is one of this movie's producers, but Cloerfield was not appreciated, even the half of it as Star Trek was appreciated. Instead, there are a lot of people who say that they hated it and there are a lot of people either who give it only 1! There is not even one flawed moment in the movie on all counts and acting that is criticized by the haters is not amateurish at all. I did not understand why it is criticized. All the actors and actresses are amateur, but the acting is not amateurish, very persuasive. Cloverfield is extremely realistic that makes it much more effective. It is because all the things seem extremely realistic, how is it called? Documentary style. The most unusual opening sequence for such a movie is in Cloverfield I guess. The mood, the atmosphere are very interesting and it is like someone records a party rather than the director introduces the characters of a monster movie to us. Therefore, it starts like a stylish drama. However, it is not like party, girls, drinks, chats and music, something different. I just can't describe it. Because of realism? or because of another reason? I don't know. As for the first attack, I haven't seen such an engaging and impressive one before. This is much more than panicked people run and scream and a monster attacks them, really it is too hard to describe how it is impressive, brilliant. Almost everyone compares the movie with other mockumentaries which is unnecessary, if you ask me. By this style, the movie does not become an imitation or pretentious, it makes it real effective. Then, why realism does not effect people? It seems that the haters do not care about whether it is extremely realistic or not. I put myself in the characters's place, panicked as if I am in there and I worried about each of them. By the way, there is an action scene which the forces clash with the monster and it was much more satisfying than even the whole War of the Worlds!! The subway scenes are one of the best parts of the movie, also one of the most realistic parts of the movie, it was like it could happen and also so sad. The movie, Gwoemul was very appreciated, people say that it was dramatic that generally other monster movies are lack of, believe me, it is nothing. And the final. Very exciting and at the same time dramatic. However not for everyone, especially if you don't like unconventional finals. Lastly, this is one of the most engaging movies ever.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Superb Execution - The Best Sci Fi Reality Film Ever,"Currently in the middle of watching Cloverfield for the second time and I have to admit the second time round, forgetting all the hype, this is an incredible film.

While watching the film you feel immersed in the action and it really is a good survival guide for disasters, so long as you're single.If reality TV is so cool, then a reality Movie, even though it is fictional and full of breathtaking effects, is a breath of fresh air for Hollywood and I for one think it's one of the coolest takes on Sci Fi in Hollywood's history.Two thumbs up for Cloverfield.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
The geist in the machine.,"Something is happening in escapist genre film-making, can you feel it? My zeitgeist gland started to vomit chemical nausea into my body twice recently and the reasons are obvious  like you my friend. It's this notion that escapist genre fare is starting to appropriate the language of cultural trauma in order to entertain us and a new kind of blockbuster is the by-product  a style in its infancy that is flirting with immorality. This is the kind of flirting that unchecked can lead to a violation of the audience and what it understands to be normal in terms of how it should get it rocks off. Be careful says I because like a dirty old uncle that whips out the little gentleman for his unsuspecting niece, the consequences are a potential warping of what we consider to be harmless fun  something David Director and Sidney Scribe must ultimately take responsibility for.Rambo was at it recently, hijacking Spielberg's D-Day realism approach from Saving Private Ryan to murder the Burmese Militia. In Spielberg's film the technique had been used to strip warfare of its Technicolor entertainment value and give the battle scenes an unsentimental air of reportage. Stallone reversed this idea by applying the same tools to sate the blood lust of his seen it all before ghoulish adolescent audience  a corruption of the original style. What used to be fun about genre movies with high death rates and judicious dollops of wanton destruction is that it was escapism  larger than life, utterly ridiculous and therefore completely safe to enjoy.Cloverfield may be a better film than Rambo but it uses the same methodology to get it jollies. Here its 9/11 that gets plundered to add an uncomfortable real world sensibility to the old monster on the rampage movie. Filmed from the perspective of a single camcorder, events unfold in fits and shaky hand held starts with the beast periodically glimpsed whenever the terrified documentarian gets the chance. The characters aren't up to much and are irrelevant in any event but their panic feels genuine enough and its in these scenes of fleeing, glancing upward to see a building topple and the like that déjà vu hits you in a very unpleasant way. One scene in particular  the collapse of a apartment block and the unfolding dust cloud is a direct lift from Al-Queda's greatest hits. This of course is a very effective device to make something absurd genuinely mortifying but when popular entertainment starts to play on its audience's real fears by appealing to direct experience rather than the base instincts that traditionally were its bread and butter (you didn't need to have seen real footage of a shark eat a man to buy into Jaws  the premise was primal in its efficacy) then arguably a line has been crossed. There's no doubting the filmmakers exploitative glee here or the skill in which the enveloping disaster is juxtaposed with the couple's day out recorded on the same tape and occasionally 'cut' to in the gaps in recording, to produce emotional punch but there's an air of cynicism about the execution. Fun doesn't seem well, fun any more.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Yep...it works....,"I just saw the midnight showing of Cloverfield, and overall I thought that approach worked very well. From the beginning I felt like I was there and apart of these people's world's which then get's very fun and even scary when they become attacked. When I first saw the preview I thought the whole idea of the movie being filmed in a digital camera point of view would just annoy me and take a way from the enjoyment of the movie, but actually it was on the complete opposite. Some of the cuts and editing worked fantastic given us that frantic feeling. I also liked the fact that they got mostly unknowns to play the parts. I thought that added to the effect of realism by letting the audience believe that they were there living in these people's worlds and lived up to the approach the director wanted, because had an A-list actor been casted it would have taken the audience out of their world, and we would have thought, ""oh there's Brad Pitt,"" and it just would have taken away from what the director was trying to do. With that the camera does get a little annoying at times, and I felt I may have lost some valuable information because it was frantic and I couldn't quite understand what was being said. Some questions, without giving anything away,of why some specific things occurred I felt weren't all that clear. Another problem some people might have is the ending. But the more that I think about it, I think the way it ended was appropriate to the approach and style of the movie leaving us with many questions, as it would it if this type of thing like this really happened. I also felt it was a bit short, but at the same time sweet. So overall I think this was a good idea and worked in so many areas, and at some points leaves the audience feeling what the characters in the movie are feeling. I felt like I was there and enjoyed it. But really you're just going to have to see it to judge for yourself because I have a feeling this will have a lot of mixed reviews.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Pretty good.,"Well,I went to see it almost purely because I wanted to see what that freaking' monster looked like. I'm sure a lot of people saw it for the same reason. Yes,you do get to see the monster in completely full view in the movie. It looks kinda stupid. I thought it'd be like a Godzilla or something,but it is more like a cross between a spider and those monsters in DooM 3. It starts out at the party where Rob is gonna go to Japan and there's a going away party. There's some comedy bits,but it's mostly build-up. The monster comes they run and Rob gets separated from his girlfriend. They eventually go back to save her,because they get this message that says she can't move or something. Three major problems though: *Spoiler***** They put Marlena in a quarantine and then--I dunno. And they don't't elaborate too much. I think maybe an spider-thing busted out of her all ""Alien""-style,but they just really don't explain it.*****End Of Spoiler*** Second thing,the ending's quite the cop-out.

"Incredible, unique and, yes, ""intense""","I feel a little weird giving this 10 stars, but I'm going to throw it out there, if only because it is completely unlike anything I've ever seen in my life. I've heard that said about many films before, and it's terribly cliché. I use that wording here because, for the first time, it's actually true.Another cliché I've encountered when reading about this film is that it is ""intense."" I kind of laughed it off when reading reviews and hype leading up to the release, because I never seem able to lose myself enough within the imaginary world of a film to actually find it intense. After all is said and done, a movie is just a movie, and I've always understood that. With Cloverfield, (another cliché, coming up) I actually felt like I was there. As soon as that first explosion went off, I was there, and it was scary as hell.The only problem I have with this film is the first 10 minutes or so, in which the acting and interaction between characters seems a bit fake and forced, but the rest of the film will wipe that from your memory. Other than that, just make sure to suspend disbelief, because some pretty preposterous things happen throughout the course of the film. To me, the probability of these events didn't matter as much as the overall spectacle and sensation that the film achieved.I came into this film just expecting to see an entertaining, so-bad-it's funny film along the lines of a Godzilla movie, since I've been enjoying Godzilla films since my childhood. I've always thought the ""giant monster"" genre was something that was impossible to make scary or believable, because it's so inherently laughable. Watching this movie in the theatre scared the hell out of me. And movies never scare me.Go see this in the theatre. It is a one-of-a-kind experience.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

I am over Clover,"On seeing the short short previews of this movie my first thought was is this going to be another Blair Witch Project style of movie, so I had a few concerns with seeing this movie based on the short short preview. The lights goes down and the movie starts with all the usual characters appearing on screen. Act 1 starts by trying to make the audience feel more relaxed before some might say the roller-coaster ride of Act 2 begins for the virgin viewer of this type of film while others more experienced with this type of film may start to yawn with a seen it all before attitude. When the final Act began I felt it was just added to pad the film out because how the film is set out in Acts 1 and Acts 2. On a side note I am very impressed with the battery performance of ""camcorder"" they used but not impressed with the ""thing"" that was supposed to be ""scary"".",,Anonymous,Horror
Lost it's appeal,"I was never completely hyped up to see this movie. I looked at it as a ""down on the streets"" point of view of a Godzilla type movie and that's pretty much what it was. Unfortunately that point of view wore thin on me.I didn't mind the set up at the beginning to get you interested in the characters you were going to follow around. I didn't mind a group of 20 somethings acting... well like 20 somethings. It all gave it a bit of realism. I had no issue with the camera being shaky (although I had to look away at one point when I started feeling some nausea). I even liked a lot of the aspects of the attack in Manhattan.My issue was at some point in the movie, probably in the last fifteen to twenty minutes, I didn't care about it anymore. The whole thing just seemed to go on too long. I didn't care about the people we were seeing on the film anymore. I didn't care if they survived or not. I just wanted it to end.I also, for the first time I can remember in the past few years, felt like I wanted my money back after seeing Cloverfield. That is a bit strong of a statement considering there were aspects of the movie I did like- the creature in this has a very cool design and let's just say the ""in the street"" fighting really feels like you're right there in the action. It's just that by the end of the movie I felt like ""yeah been there done that"" a thousand times in other Godzilla type movies. That's all it was in the end.Maybe it's just me as the other two people I saw it with really enjoyed the movie. It's just my opinion so take it for what it's worth.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Its everything you wouldn't expect,"I have never commented on a movie on IMDb. I have been a fan of the site for years and I have been thoroughly influenced by movies my entire life. Growing up I have seen a lot of good movies, and a lot of crap. Cloverfield was the first movie that even made me comment. Not because it was the greatest movie ever made, which I won't lie and say it was, but it was worth every day I waited since I first saw the teaser trailer earlier in the summer. Knowing nothing about this movie is what makes it worth seeing. There's none of ""Ohh I saw that in the trailer"" crap. Every reaction seemed realistic and every emotion seemed real. Not because they were the best actor, even though they weren't nearly as bad as I would have though, but because you didn't know them. Real life isn't filled with good actor. Listen to people complain and they sound pretty stupid.The filming did shake, but there is no steady cam in the real world. Go watch a home video and tell me Uncle Johnny is a grade A cameraman, you can't. You don't really learn to much about the characters, but that is because you have only been drawn into their lives for a few hours. There is no year gap where you can see them grow as people. You see them at their worst, at their barest level of fear.So before you read a review on how bad the movie was go watch it and decide for yourself. I'm not saying you have to agree with me, but don't miss out on a very interesting movie experience by being afraid of what other people say.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Blair Witch Godzilla Style,"Cloverfield (2008)*** (out of 4)The Blair Witch Project meets a Godzilla type movie in this action film that has NYC being ripped apart by some unknown monster. Okay, this film has some really great moments but the screenplay really left me cold. I understand the whole gimmick of having a hand held camera capture all the action but the screenplay gives us four rather bland characters and none of them are more interesting than the actual monster and destruction of the city. Even though the film runs under 80-minutes I found myself getting bored whenever the film focused on the characters but thankfully there's still plenty of action to keep things going. I hate CGI but the effects are used very good here with some really great scenes of the city being destroyed. The ending with the monster on a full rampage while coming under attack was very thrilling and I also enjoyed how the film ended but the very ending was a little frustrating but perhaps this will be cleared up in the upcoming sequel. The performances were okay but the screenplay really didn't give them much good dialogue and the love story was just downright stupid.",,Anonymous,Horror
"A dark, depressing movie; some will enjoy, others will be disturbed.","The monster movie genre is as old as cinema yet in almost every film from Godzilla to King Kong the star of the movies are the monsters themselves with the humans often viewed as the antagonists or cause of the monster's rampage.Cloverfield is a whole different ball game. The movie is filmed entirely through a hand camera; if The Blair Witch project made you nauseas, this movie will do the same. The beginning starts off slowly as we get to know some characters, all of which happen to be generic rich teenagers who have their own little back stories filled with love interests and sexual encounters. Eventually, they hear a roar, witness an explosion, and the movie kicks off in full force.Before seeing the movie, get this out of your head right now: this is not a traditional destroy-the-city-flick. This movie is about survival. Very little is explained, the monster's origins are kept in the dark, you hardly see the creature for more than a couple of seconds, and the film doesn't hold your hand in any way. Cloverfield is a roller coaster ride of suspense and thrills. While some may draw comparisons between the destruction of Manhattan to that of 9/11, the fact remains that the film's focus is on the plight and survival of the humans involved.If you're looking for a tale about how a group of plucky youths overcome their fears and defeat an ancient god-like creature, then you'll be sorely disappointed. Cloverfield is dark and tragic while bordering on depressing. There is no hope. There is no bright light at the end of the tunnel. There is only death, destruction, and carnage. There are no morals or lessons-to-be-learned about preserving the environment or the fallacy of mankind. Cloverfield is more akin to a film about natural selection where the strong live and the weak die.If you don't like tragedies, stay far away. If you're in the mood for a wild action flick with an engrossing atmosphere and dark images then you'll leave the theater very satisfied.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great Film. Separates intelligent moviegoers from the less educated,"I have to laugh at the negative comments especially the ones that discuss ""shaky camera"" work. The movie was excellent and entertaining. It's not for everyone but the ones who get it are lucky to enjoy this film. The moviegoers that despise this post comments that completely shows their overall ignorance on going against the grain film-making. Bravo to J.J. Abrams for revealing to all of us which people enjoy lazy, standard film-making and which ones enjoy something that challenges society's conditioning to accept the mundane.The film is dedicated to the camera's point of view and the visual effects and directing is top notch.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Cloverfield's name being well, Cloverfield","The movies name is Cloverfield because that is a nickname for Central Park. And you know what happens in Central Park. Also, a four-leaf clover is a symbol for luck. So it's ironic. All-in-all, great name. Great, great movie as well. I've been waiting for this sort of thing for a LONG time.So anyway, about the movie. Obviously, I loved it. If you are an ass, and aren't going to like it because of the shaky camera, then you are condemning all visual media to horrendous ""film"" like Step Up. Anyway, this is definitely what War of the Worlds should have been like. I liked War of the Worlds, but this was so much better. It's almost as if J. J. Abrams was watching WotW and thought to himself, ""I could make this a whole lot better."" Some people thought it was a bit pretentious, but it wasn't. Seriously, if you're going to judge this movie based on it's realism, you're missing the point. Of course, if you understand things like propellers and blood-clotting, this movie is as real as it can get, besides the whole monster-destroying-the-world thing. Great movie though. I'd advise everyone who isn't prone to motion-sickness to see it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Watch this at your peril,"Well, I went to see this full of the hope given by just about every review I head read or heard that the movie delivers something special. For me it didn't work, there was absolutely no way I could sit through 80 minutes or so of the worse camera action I have ever seen. It starts promisingly enough, but the moment the hand-held video camera that the film is shot on is passed to someone who has obviously never held one before, that did it for me. I have to admit and it's not easy for me to do, that I walked out on this movie. I have seen thousands of films and consider myself passionate about movies. I will give anything a chance but the continual movement of the camera, replicating a badly shot home movie just left me feeling sick with motion sickness. I got about 40 minutes through the movie before my stomach could take no more swaying too and fro, back and forth. I felt like my brain had been thrown about in my skull, what a shame. I was really looking forwards to this as I love a good monster movie. I have rated it 6 out of 10 as I gave it a chance.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A must see!,"You must see this movie! ....For those who want to know.....Cloverfield is a code that a military gave to the tape they found. Some think J.J. named it Cloverfield since his Production company is on Cloverfield street! Some argue that Cloverfield means, that the tape was found in an area on Central Park which had clovers. Many see some connection to his long series, Lost.You won't be disappointed. I was very impressed with the acting abilities of a bunch of no-namers.This movie will grab you in its jaws, toss you around like a chew toy for an unstoppable 85 minutes (yes, it's a short  but oh so sweet  flick) and still leave you panting for more.It's gonna be difficult to top this movie this year!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"The ""Cloverfield"" review","(Before I start this, I just want to say I'm 22, going on 23, and that I grew up watching Japanese monster movies, or ""kaiju-eiga,"" and I consider Godzilla to be the ultimate movie monster. I've also come to love Gamera and Ultraman, and I was gosh-wowed last year by South Korea's contribution to the genre, ""The Host."" Now here we are at ""Cloverfield,"" what I will refer to as ""the first great American monster movie of the 21st century."")It makes no sense to describe the plot to the ""Alias"" J.J. Abrams-produced, Drew-Goddard-written, Matt Reeves-directed flick ""Cloverfield"" in any real detail because therein lies the problem: there is no real detail, only raw, on-the-scene, up close & personal action. In a hype campaign the likes of which haven't been seen in a movie of this type for quite some time now, ""Cloverfield"" remarkably lives up to expectations. Ever since the first trailer appeared during the previews for ""Transformers"" last year, a three-syllable word has come to describe a movie to be released on January 18, 2008, and it was called ""Cloverfield,"" even though early press releases said that wasn't the movie's real title.So what's all the hoopla about? Some suspected a war movie, others a viral outbreak, or a terrorist attack. As you know, the plot has been kept real hush-hush, though sordid details have been allowed to leak on the Internet.Rumor control, these are the facts -All you need to know is this: in an inventively bizarre hybrid that combines elements of both ""The Blair Witch Project"" and ""The War of the Worlds"" with ""Godzilla,"" a monster is laying waste to New York City. Buildings crumble, the Brooklyn Bridge is snapped in two like a twig, the military strikes back, mass hysteria as thousands try to flee the city, and a giant reptilian beast of unknown origin is causing mass destruction. The chaos is captured through the hand-held lens of a couple of terrified New Yorkers as they give a first-hand account of the devastation while trying to reach safety.And that's all you really need to know. First of all, because this is a first-person account of a New York City monster attack, we never get to see a really good picture of the monster until somewhere close to the very end, since it decides to make its debut at nighttime in the City That Never Sleeps, and up until then all we get are brief flashes and glimpses of ""it."" (To get an idea of this creepy critter, imagine a reptile, like a shell-less turtle, combined with a slug and a sea crustacean. And then imagine its nastier, creepy-crawly subordinates that come to chow down on many unsuspecting New Yorkers.) To get this out of the way, this beast is a force to be reckoned with. It's certainly an impressive CGI creature creation, like all the classic Japanese monsters I grew up with - Godzilla, Rodan, Mothra, King Ghidorah, and Gamera. But what's paramount here, is that this flick, despite any misgivings I'll probably have in the future, is way better than the 1998 American adaptation of ""Godzilla.""""Cloverfield"" does have some pretty wicked special effects sequences, including some genuinely intense moments of peril and a few particularly chilling sights and sounds. Some have panned the shaky and frenetic camera-work; if you were in the middle of all this chaos, would your camera be perfect and composed? The guy's right there, in the thick of it, scared to death with his closest friends; does anyone really think he's going to get the Oscar for Best Cinematography or something, if he makes it out of the city alive? I don't think so.New York has seen some pretty wild sights over the decades. In the post-9/11 world, you would think that ""Cloverfield"" is the last thing Americans would want to see right now, and Abrams will be accused in the future of being insensitive to the feelings of Americans. But it seems that every so often filmmakers need to vent some unstated/unwritten frustration/aggression and this is what we occasionally get sometimes.And as for those poor New Yorkers I was telling about? Well, their footage was found.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
I wish 'Cloverfield' was as good as it's marketing campaign,"J.J. Abrams has a reputation for leaving audiences hanging. While I won't reveal if 'Cloverfield' follows the trend, I went into the theater ecstatic about seeing the mysterious monster that he had cooked up for this film. The first person camera is difficult to handle at first, but after about 10 minutes you will hardly notice it. Abrams does a good job of not having it shake when the character is running or during action shots. The plot is very fast moving, and the characters in the film are very real. Getting to see the monster is probably the best part of the film. I would recommend this movie, but it probably won't make my top five for 2008. It really isn't as bad as people make it out to be. 'Cloverfield' isn't a must see...I would classify it as a ""Should See"".",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Dazzling without Disappointment,"This was an intense film. The plot was a little unrealistic but the suspense and the mysteriousness of the film made it one of the best films of the year. Although the filming could make one sick, it is the very aspect which made the film so brilliant. Good acting, laughs, and suspense were all brought together in a new wave movie, and I can easily say that Cloverfield was not, in any category, a disappointment. Cloverfield not only triumphs over the Blair Witch Project but gives hope to this new and exciting class of movie thrillers shot from a 'handheld camera'.9 out of 10",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
I am at my wits end,"I have been reading various comments how this movie was awful and they should not have been shaking the camera. This is supposed to be someone recording the events of the horrible day that they are going through. Do you hear music?? As in a traditional movie!!! Except for the party scenes. The only music played.Does anyone have an imagination anymore?? Or do you need everything served to you on a silver plate?? I read somewhere that the movie had no ending? The tape ran out!!!! That is why the previous recording was being seen. Also I think a bomb does not agree with a camera very much.I am not saying I love what I watched but I do like it very much, It was very original. This is why we go to the movies to see something memorable. I watched this and when it was done and I left the theater I was expecting people to be running around for dear life. I was immersed in this movie for the time it was on the screen.I read about the hype and saw the trailer during the beginning of transformers, which some of my friends thought was an excellent movie. I didn't think much of it during that time. Then I got into more investigation. Maybe a month before this was going to be released and I got into the story a little more and was excited to see it.My wife thought it was a bad movie because she did not know a little back story about it. I don't what to get into arguments about how some people got sick, I'm not sure about how true that is. especially when not one person did in the theater I was in.I liked what I saw and I imagine if it really happened, and NYC would be the worst place for it to happen in. Especially with all the people living there. I have one more thing to say, To all the people that think the people who made this are now making money from 9/11 because of various scenes that look the same, Think about it!!! If a building falls down it is going to make debris and something really big goes walking down a street, it's going to wreck that street.Another thing to the 9/11 people, Watch ""9/11"" (look it up on IMDb) It was supposed to be a documentary about a probationary firefighter, But the film makers recorded in one of the towers what was going on that terrible day. That film is real compared to cloverfield and the man running the camera couldn't keep it straight. But I see some things that are the same in both experiences. I see fear and trying to help people you think you know and find out more about them.I will end this with one more thing, Some people need more imagination especially when watching anything.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Ingenious Storytelling,"I have to say...this movie is good on many levels. First of all, the plot is fascinating. Having borrowed a page from the best video games, the monster and the havoc it wrecks on New York City is ""edge-of-your-seat"" captivating. Fans of Half-Life II might relate. This screen gem brings back the thrill of the MONSTER MOVIE. As a kid, I LOVED the old Godzilla & Gamera movies, but as an adult, those movies became corny and outdated. This movie brings back that thrill in a fresh, contemporary setting with all the anticipation and chills I experienced with those classics as a child. I couldn't really enjoy the Godzilla remake because that's all it was...a remake.Godzilla represented the fears of Atomic war, but I think this monster does a great job representing the next generational challenge: terrorism. Faceless, a humongous threat that can knock down buildings and ruin cities, but also affect everyone on a more personal level. I don't think it was mere coincidence the monster in this movie and it's assault on New York City was portrayed similar in nature to the fear, horror and devastation experienced during 911.The next piece of praise I have for this movie are the special effects. Absolutely amazing is all I have to say. And as spectacular as the visual effects are, the SOUND effects must receive special mention. To it's benefit, this movie does not have a soundtrack that tells you how to feel...rather you feel this movie through the numbing bass tones you would expect to experience in an earth moving event such as an earthquake. The monster's earth shattering footsteps and distinct roar brought back the fear experienced in the unique, terrifying sensation heard with the death ray of the original ""War Of The Worlds"". It's easy to overlook the challenge movie makers undertake to recreate a memorable audible experience, until you consider less-successful attempts. For example, Steven Spielberg's attempt to recreate the terrifying sound of the Martian machines in his remake fell far short of the original, but in this movie, the sounds that originate from the monster are haunting to say the least, both in it's roar and in it's attack on the city.I reserve my greatest praise for last. J.J. Abrams & Co. have cracked the code. In my opinion, the most entertaining experiences in the past 10-15 years have come from the video game world, especially first-person shooters (ie Doom & Half-Life). But Hollywood has had a less-than stellar track record in trying to reproduce those experiences on the big screen. Their solution to that problem was so simple and yet so ingenious, I'm surprised no one had previously thought of it...depict the movie from the point of view of a character stuck with holding the camera through the whole experience. Now don't get me wrong...the first-person portrayal has been done...most infamously with The Blair Witch Project. I did enjoy The Blair Witch, but that movie was supernatural and small in scope, whereas Cloverfield is large and earth-threatening...a truly grandiose cinematic experience. I took my family of five and two friends of my children...and paid a pretty penny...but felt it was worth it.Just a word of advice. Because of the unique perspective the story is told through, one or two sequences are dizzying. If you grab a seat toward the back of the theater, you'll minimize the potential for ""motion-sickness"".To summarize, if you are up for a unique cinematic experience, a thought-provoking, captivating plot, with earth-shattering visual and audio effects that go a long way toward effectively portraying the story from a first-person shooter perspective...you'll enjoy this movie. If you like movies that tell you how to think and feel, if you enjoy brainless mind-pap, reserve your copy of ""House Of The Dead"" today, and leave enough seats in the theater for me and my family.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Good , solid, different ,excellent not quite.","A few weeks ago I didn't know much about this movie so I had little expectations, but a friend of mine wanted to go see it so I came here to see what people had to say. After reading a lot of comments I felt that this was a can't miss movie. So my expectations were turned from not much to anticipating this movie.All in all this movie was indeed solid, it had a lot of the same type stories that you can compare to other movies but with a different take on the presentation. The story was decent, it did however lack details but I think that if you think of it as a first person experience you wouldn't have all of the details either.The camera shaking was good for most of the movie, except some parts was making me dizzy and had to turn away if not I was going to be sick.If you get a chance give this movie a try, it is a short movie and the pace was good the entire way.My take this is a different movie in a lot of ways and if you sit down and think about it most people will enjoy it, but it isn't worth a 9 or 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
This movie was incredible - The best monster movie ever in my opinion,"Male/24 yrs old/Detroit, MI This movie has it all. Comedy, suspense, horror, and tons of action. My expectations were very high and this movie definitely exceeded them. I was weary of the whole ""Blair Witch"" aspect with the hand-held camera documenting the whole movie, however, it works VERY well. This movie feels very real, the characters are great and it is pretty funny in many parts as well.Fans who can't wait to see the monster don't worry because you see plenty of it in the film, much more than you would expect watching the previews. I don't want to describe it, but trust me, you aren't left guessing what it looks like.This movie had some of the most intense scenes I have ever watched, and I don't think I have ever left a movie thinking ""wow, that was an incredible movie"". But I did today.Do not cheat yourself out of an amazing experience, GO SEE THIS MOVIE!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Solid monster movie despite disorienting shaky cam, simple story","Cloverfield follows a group of five friends as they traverse Manhattan during a monster attack. Along the way, they encounter other survivors, falling debris (like pieces of the Statue of Liberty), soldiers firing guns and rocket launchers on city streets, and creatures both large and small.The action leaves little room for character development, but Lizzy Caplan shows the most range, going from dismissive friend of a friend to shell-shocked trauma victim to bad-ass heroine. As the friend holding the camcorder, T. J. Miller, in his first film role, displays his typical snarky sarcasm while rarely being on camera. Mike Vogel shows the most charisma but leaves the group far too early. Jessica Lucas and Odette Annable play their parts admirably in early film roles. And the ostensible lead, Michael Stahl-David, does what he can with a one-note character. But the real lead is the monster, and the movie does best dealing with the slow burn reveal and the chaos a giant (baby) monster would unleash on NYC.Overall, fifteen years after the unique marketing campaign, Cloverfield can be viewed for what it is. A lean monster movie experiment with a young cast by young filmmakers (including director Matt Reeves of The Batman (2022)) that succeeds when it features the monster and mostly just gets by the rest of the time.",,Anonymous,Horror
The Bar is Raised......,"It's not often you can say that about a movie. But with Cloverfield you'll be safe to say that it's raised the bar for cinema. For one, the sound mixing is near perfect. To really get the feel of it, I suggest you see this at the expensive multiplex. Francis Lawrence (dir. I Am Legend) will look at this picture and say, ""That really s*** over my movie""The only thing that'll bother you is the camera-work. 100% shot hand-held Blair Witch style. Most people should adjust over the course of time, but if you can't, you may need to sit further back for this one...Matt Reeves and JJ Abrams have raised the bar.Sit tight for this one.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
a good idea and good concept,"The trailer freaked me out and so it did to most of the people, i spent days surfing trying to find out how the creature looks like and i must give them the credit for holding a darn great secret about it. And so i ended up buying it. The real reason is that i like when new things are tried out, so whatever the story was, id buy it if its filmed this way. Now, for the movie, itself, its a good one. Its suspense, and has moments that grip you. The camera movement (which the movie is all about) is believable and works good with the characters which are also pretty good. The acting was also pretty darn good. Now, the things that i did not like. But this is just because i manage to find a flaw in every movie i ever see. And these two mi gonna mention are those that worked for me and most people wont even notice it. So here goes, the monster is a bit to skinny, and funny looking. It doesn't seem fearful or whatever... than there are a few times when one or the other character tries to be funny and damn, it doesn't work if you're being chased through a big city bu i freaky alien monster. but as i said, you'll get past these thing without noticing them... its just me. Oh, and another thing. i don't think this movie will be a memorable one, but just one of those pretty good ones that you see once, and the second time they just don't work any more.

"Well, Damn...That was actually really entertaining.","The last three movies I have seen have been Cloverfield, There Will be Blood and Juno. All three are such different takes on their respective genre. Cloverfield does not disappoint, from the first scene until the amazing song at the credits; I was entertained.The theater we went to had two separate versions of the movie, the digital and the film version. We went to the digital version, and it was just as good of quality as any film movie I've seen.The monster in Cloverfield is worth seeing, its not like any movie monster I have seen before. As if Denzel Washington were the monster screaming ""King Kong Ain't Got Sh*t On Me!"" It's so true.You get emotionally attached to most of the characters and laugh and love along with them. You feel their pain and their fear as they try to survive an attack unlike anything you have seen in the theaters before.I recommend this movie to all who enjoy new directing and filming techniques, and just general lovers of movies.

Exhilarating terror.,"We were pretty early for the film and I was worried there wouldn't be a crowd. Yes, I wanted a crowd. This fear was unwarranted because just before the previews started the place filled up. Mostly adults. Think about that for a moment. Adults, filling a theater at two in the afternoon on a weekday. My friend Jason and I were a little nervous that the film might suck and we'd look silly for being so excited about it for as long as we have been. One person who was leaving the theater after an earlier showing said 'It sucked'. We didn't believe them. The previews were ones I've already seen before except for one. It's was a teaser for the next J.J. Abrahms film and the audience was all atwitter about it. I won't tell you what that film is going to be but it'll be huge.The film opens and it's immediately apparent that it will perfect. The first twenty minutes is basically set up. Talking, no action. Even this part was great. The humor and camera work was done well. Jason turned to me and said 'How could this film not be great? This is awesome!'The drama reaches an apex and then things go wrong. Very wrong. I get the added anxiety because New York is still vivid in my mind and I love that city. Seeing the city empty in 'I Am Legend' was fascinating. Watching this city get destroyed was also fascinating, but also brought back memories of 9/11. The destruction is massive and believable.You, the reader have questions. You want to know what the 'thing' is. You want to know what the film is actually about. Trust me, you don't want to know. Just let it unfold. Pretend it's you in the situation, imagine yourself as one of the characters and what you would do. I found everyone's reactions reasonable and logical. The terror one would experience during such an ordeal makes for strange decisions. I found my reactions occasionally divergent with the people on screen but it turns out my reactions would have gotten me killed simply because I didn't have enough information about the situation. On the ground, you don't really know how bad it is. The situation is beyond bad. Beyond dire. Escape? Wait it out? Hide? Good luck.Jason and I have similar tastes in films and I can't tell you how many times we said 'What!?' in unison or swore in disbelief. I jumped many times, my hands clenched, pulse racing. At one point Jen screamed. We all did. My hand actually went out towards the screen in self defense. It didn't work. A moment expected yet totally unexpected. There were many moments of shock and they were earned, not cheap. A quiet terror builds inside, a numbness. 'This can't be happening.' One minute you feel hope, the next despair. You keep begging them to run. Run faster actually.You'll be hard pressed to stop watching and I don't recommend you leave the theater for more popcorn or to go pee. You'll definitely miss something. Don't take your eyes of the screen at the end. Yes, you'll know when the film is ending because it's almost perfect. You should sit through the credits as well. The film leaves you wanting more and you'll have many questions. During the credits Jason remarked that he'd never seen so many people still seated and talking with each other after a film. He was right. People were in no hurry to leave.Jen and I talked about it and we're going to go see it again tomorrow in Federal Way. Yes, it's that good.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""Godzilla"" for the YouTube Generation","This monster movie tries hard to be ""Godzilla"" for Generation Y, but it doesn't quite make it.It's a terrific looking film and it's capably acted -- when you watch the special features on the DVD and realize that most of the time actors were interacting with nothing but green screens, it makes both the acting and the effects that much more impressive. But it's one of those gimmick movies that's pinned down by the very element that makes it unique (I use the word ""unique"" loosely, since ""The Blair Witch Project"" has already covered this ground, to an extent). The hook in this film is that the destruction of New York and the attempts of a small band of twenty-somethings to stay alive is captured on a camcorder by one of the kids. But the technical necessities required to pull off this stunt result in too many logical flaws, not the least of which is how long would it take someone running for his life from a giant monster ravaging downtown Manhattan to ditch the camera?But of all the holes the screenplay creates, the one most perplexing was this: how the hell do all of these young kids afford spacious apartments in Manhattan?Grade: B",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

The best behemoth movie I've ever seen. Period.,"After first having seen the now famous teaser trailer a couple of months ago, I thought that this movie - then tentatively referred to as ""Untitled J.J. Abrams Project"" - was going to be a fluke. A minor hit fueled by a clever marketing strategy. The teaser got me curious, but I thought the CGI-shot of the statue head landing in the New York streets looked cheap and fake. Unexpectedly, I was proved wrong. A lot of very positive reviews preceded the Austrian theatrical release of ""Cloverfield"" and having finally seen the movie now I have to say that all the praise is more than deserved. And the CGI has thankfully been worked on.What makes ""Cloverfield"" work better than any other behemoth movie is quite simply the concept of having the whole thing being shot by one of the characters. Sure, that idea isn't new at all. ""The Blair Witch Project"" had done it years before ""Cloverfield"". Even George A. Romero has made his latest ""Living Dead"" flick with that technique. Still, the concept works best here. Somehow the contrast between this giant monster wrecking a whole city and this one guy with a small camera creates amazing tension. Showing the main characters' adventurous journey through the lens of a shaky, hand-held camera puts the audience right in the middle of the events. We never get an overview over the whole situation - neither visually nor plot-wise. Rockets, wreckage and monsters fly around our heads left and right and make us feel as if we were in the middle of a war. Don't see this without a Dolby Surround system! The sound design is brilliant. From the roars of the behemoth to the creepy, blood-thirsty gargling of its crab babies it makes your skin crawl. What adds to the realism of the movie is that there's no music, which also makes the jumps completely unpredictable.""Cloverfield"" plays out almost like a Haunted House or a roller-coaster ride. We never know what waits around the corner for us. We only get very brief glimpses of the giant monster and its even more horrific little spider babies and every time we see something it scares the crap out of us. There's one scene that I liked in particular: the characters run through the streets and into an underground station. Shortly before they walk down the stairs the ""cameraman"" looks up and there's the monster letting out a terrifying roar. That moment is ten times more effective than any high gloss production like Roland Emmerich's ""Godzilla"" could ever have hoped to be.Of course, another reason why the perspective of the guys in the streets running through the ruins of New York is so genuinely horrific these days, is because we've seen scenes like that on TV in real life-news. It's the memories of 9/11 that ""Cloverfield"" is toying with. Just like every good horror movie this one is incorporating current imagery of terror and fear.The hand-held camera is not only used for action purposes, though. It also backs up the story brilliantly with occasional flashbacks that appear as the remains of previously filmed material on the video cassette in the camera. That is a very original stylistic touch and one of the great things about ""Cloverfield"": the movie is bursting with fresh ideas. This can also be said about the various settings, most of all a nerve grinding walk through the staircase of a half-collapsed skyscraper and a helicopter ride that you're never going to forget.Even less spectacular scenes like the exposition at the beginning, which has been dismissed by some reviewers as being too long, is brilliant and fast paced to an extend where I thought, that I couldn't care less if a monster was coming any time soon or not. The characters alone, played solidly by a largely unknown cast, were interesting and well-crafted enough.Finally, let's talk about the main attraction, the behemoth and its spawn. The big one itself must be one of the most memorable monsters in movie history, looking like something that jumped out of a Derek Hess-painting. Its spider babies are even creepier, though. Although they don't look that original, you can never go wrong with aggressive arachnids that lurk in the dark (see also ""Starship Troopers"" or ""Gremlins 2""). The CGI is fantastic, and even though it may not age well, in 2008 it looks flawless. There wasn't one special effects-scene in the movie that I didn't buy and that's also due to the fact that the camera is used so thoughtfully.Which brings us to the direction. Director Matt Reeves does a superb job in that the whole ""filmed by an amateur""-feel never seems forced. We're shown exactly what Reeves wants us to see, yet it all feels completely coincidental and natural. I even bought the fact that the guy holding the camera would go on filming throughout the entire trip.""Cloverfield"" sets new standards in its field. It outshines every other behemoth movie that has been released, yet, and raises the bar for the whole subgenre. You can't make them much better than Reeves and Abrams did with ""Cloverfield"", because this doesn't rely on CGI mostly, but on character development and tension. Similar projects will have a hard time topping this movie in the future.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
It's certainly a first and it probably needed to be made...,"So here I am at home, having just gotten back from watching Cloverfield with two friends, and I'm all set to impress my opinion upon you like my fellow public and tell you why Cloverfield sucks/rocks.Except not, I'm not going to tell you that you should or shouldn't go out and watch Cloverfield. You can decide that for yourself. What I will tell you about is how my experience watching Cloverfield was. I thought the movie was all right, nothing to blow my socks off, but I wasn't upset either. After all, I had friends with me, Cloverfield probably would have been less entertaining for me had I gone by myself.It really is a different kind of movie. A familiar movie, but done up in such a way that it crosses multiple genres by combining different styles of movie-making. On one hand, we have the traditional story of a monster attacking a large, populated city. I've heard the comparisons to Godzilla over and over again, but in my opinion, the point of view Cloverfield was filmed in takes it further from Godzilla than closer. We, the audience, view the entire spectacle from behind a video camera being held by one of the characters. If I had to try and pin down what type of movie Cloverfield was, I'd say Monster Docu-Drama fits the bill pretty well. If nothing else it's a fast-paced, disaster-film version of the Blair Witch Project.The movie doesn't spend much time establishing characters, it doesn't answer any pressing questions. It presents itself as if the audience were actually taking part in the events happening on screen. We know as much as the characters do at the end of the day, and can only really speculate and fill in the missing blanks with our imaginations.Since Cloverfield has done so well in the box office, I expect to see a sequel or two in the coming years. Maybe not written or directed by the same people, but it's coming.To its credit, Cloverfield is certainly a first and it probably needed to be made. The monster movie genre has become pretty stock and dead in the past years and could use a different, fresher viewpoint. If only a familiar, yet slightly altered view.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great idea but not such a great execution,"I just got home after watching the movie and I was probably the only one in the theater that liked it. The idea of shooting the whole movie from the eyes of ordinary people and their cam is just great. The best example is of course ""The Blair witch project"".The movie is full of tension, suspense, great action, great sounds and the view of the ruined Manhattan is very convincing! The atmosphere is recreated so realistically, that you can almost feel yourself involved in the action. This movie is definitely one that you MUST see at the theater, at your home I'm sure you'll miss the whole action and thrill.So that is for the good stuff - now let me tell about it's weak sides. First is the emotions and human relationships involved - they were so fake and so full of clichés, that there were some people laughing in the cinema. I know it's hard to enact true human emotions and feelings through the eye of a home camera, but that doesn't mean that it is impossible and definitely doesn't mean that director Matt Reeves should just place them there full of clichés and so fake and boring! The second serious fault is the monster - when will they learn that even the best computer made monster isn't even 1% as scary as our imagination, and believe me the monster is very well executed, but that is still not good enough, I would prefer it if it was left for me, to torture my imagination what king of thing is attacking them!So to sum up - I liked the movie but at the same time I felt it could've been done better! JJ Abrahms has come up with great idea and approach of making the movie, but director Matt Reeves was not equal to the challenge!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Fails To Live Up To Its Hype!,"Taking the concept of a monster film & applying it in the found footage subgenre of horror, Cloverfield is considered by many to be amongst the better examples of modern horror yet the story it packs in is quite generic, the characters inhabiting its world aren't worthy of any emotional investment and much of the movie is redeemed by its frenetic camera-work, smart editing & chaotic ambiance.Set in New York City, Cloverfield follows a group of friends who are throwing a going-away party for one of theirs before the entire city is shaken by an apparent earthquake. Going out to investigate, they find that the situation is far worse than imagined for Manhattan is being razed to the ground by a gigantic monster. The plot then covers their peril as they attempt to get out of the city but first have to rescue a close friend who's trapped in her building.Directed by Matt Reeves, Cloverfield opens on a calm note but once the monster surfaces in the town, a frenzied energy takes over the screen and Reeves does well in retaining the intensity from that point onwards. Written by Drew Goddard, the plot outline & how all of it is supposed to unfold is taken care of quite well but the characters aren't interesting at all and one of them easily manages to get on the nerves for he was incapable of shutting up.The hand-held camera-work is finely carried out, the warm colour palette fits the narrative, its 85 minutes of runtime flies by once the main plot surfaces, VFX is kept to its minimum for we don't see the monster in its entirety but only in bits n pieces and also notable is the fact that the filmmakers chose to not explain the monster's origin & other stuffs, thus giving its viewers something to ponder about once it all finishes while the performances from its cast is mediocre at best.On an overall scale, Cloverfield definitely has a few interesting things going on which work out in its favour but for the most part, it remains an underwhelming experience that fails to replicate the excitement its earlier hype generated. Stylishly directed, making effective use of shaky cam & brimming with 9/11 references but also marred by poor characterisation, some terrible lines & a highly annoying input from the guy holding the camera, Cloverfield isn't as special as many have called it to be but it nonetheless makes up for an entertaining ride.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Visceral, action-packed, and original.","I really enjoyed this film. I thought it was very original in the way that it was filmed from a first person perspective, and the ending was very bold for an expensive American film. Like most people I had high expectations for this movie and it mostly lived up to them. The special effects were very good and it clearly relied on evoking images of 911.I don't have much to say that hasn't already been said but I'd just like to make some comments about the monster. While I thought the monster was pretty good (and scary), it could have been better. Obviously the makers of this film were aiming for maximum realism and so the monster could have been more ""believable"" by for example not giving it humanoid features. Since it is supposed to have come from outer space how can it have a humanoid face with recognizable facial expressions. For that to be so it would have to have descended from the evolutionary ancestors of mankind. Also another point of realism, how can the US military fire so much ordinance at the monster (destroying much of the city) and still not kill it? Absurd! The film makers captured a very realistic and immersing feeling and they did the right thing by not showing much of the creature until the end since it is much more effective when only partially and briefly glimpsed in the midst of the action, thus maintaining its mystery.The characters were hard to sympathize with I think. They were just twenty-something yuppies living in New York and I find it hard to believe that they would go out of their way and risk life and limb to document the events portrayed in Cloverfield. Perhaps they should have been scientists or journalists, that would have been more believable.If you are thinking of seeing this film you should definitely go see it in the cinema and not wait for it to come out on DVD since it is a visceral experience needing a big screen and powerful surround sound system to be truly appreciated and will not be half as good on a small screen. Also, be warned that because it is filmed in ""queasy-cam"" style it may make you feel nauseous on the big screen.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
In a field of its own: getting the story right and the art of wowing viewers,"Since the dawn of humankind stories and narrative have been about perception. And good stories were the ones that managed to play tricks with their audience's perceptions. This doesn't have to be overly meaningful or oh-golly mind bending and life changing. It's enough to get much more than what you were expecting to get upon sitting down to hear the tale.And this Cloverfield (CF) does so, so well. In fact, it's one of the best, most memorable movies of the decade so far. I was literally and physically gripped with emotion when it ended, a situation amplified by my prejudiced, indoctrinated psyche mumbling ""but it's a monster movie, for Pete's sake!"" That's like saying the Grand Canyon is a gap in the ground. It's true, but somewhat underwhelming and unappreciative. Put plainly, CF is a masterpiece of storytelling because it's potent and powerful, not to mention well managed: the thing is just over 80 minutes long and succeeds in narrating more than most would require three times as long for. It becomes omnipotent thanks to its short run, which means we only get fleeting glimpses of everything, from the beautiful to the terrifying.CF is also a superb vehicle for some new and exciting talent. All actors herein rise to the challenge and perform marvelously, so here's hoping we'll be watching more from Michael Stahl-David, Odette Yustman, T.J Miller, Jessica Lucas and Mike Vogel sometime soon.The film has been the subject of much speculation, with producer JJ Abrams of Alias and Lost fame and director Matt Reeves (Felicity) playing it hush hush. The wait was worth it, and indeed the team used CF as a neat way of acknowledging many of the other gorgeous stories we've all enjoyed in the past: War of the Worlds, Stephen King's The Mist, maybe even TV series Jericho. Of course Godzilla  perhaps more 1998's US Godzilla than the original movies, but that was a fun version no matter how you look at it.CF, on the other hand, isn't about fun. It's about sheer emotional and contextual impact. It starts with a going away party for one Rob Hawkins (Stahl-David), who's bout to leave for Japan. This is where we learn the characters aren't all perfect and have some issues. Then the attack comes, and a group of friends finds itself on the run, with only a hand-held camera to document events as a mysterious monster rampages around Manhattan.At first we get next to no information on what's going on, it's all a big tease that keeps you guessing and thus makes the inevitable twists and angles all that more gratifying. Likewise, the destruction wrought upon NYC is excellently depicted via capable but never overwhelming or cheesy CGI. This also holds true for the monster when we get to see more of the character  everything looks perfect, unlike that other New York disaster flick of recent times, I Am Legend. Maybe this is why CF has been catching flack vis a vis the events of September 11, it's just so vivid and moving, there's nothing cinema-detached about it.The roller coaster that this motion picture amounts to doesn't last long, but features everything in the storyteller's guidebook: love, romance, fear, hate, loss, hope, despair and quite a few more. And you'll feel all of them right along with the story, down to the sobering closing moments of this wonderful ride.I therefore salute Cloverfield and all those who had a part in making it a silver screen reality. It's a great movie, I love it, it caught me completely off guard and came out on top with that elusive magical quantity called emotion, a thread so woefully missing in many other narratives and, sadly, from life as we know it in general.Well done people, well done: I'll be thinking of this one for some time to come, and am waiting with bated breath for the special edition release. Just let me at those deleted scenes.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Cling to the character relationships.. and hold on for a good ride :),"The relationships formed at the beginning between the characters really does carry the film through the 80 or 90 so minutes, if and only if you are drawn into these relations.It so happens I was, I connected with the characters and laughed with the amusing comments that were made at times. So it was no surprise that I was very interested in seeing how the movie concluded.In general, the first thing i'd touch on is the acting as these are not big names, we don't expect to see Denzel Washington like performances. And on that, to be honest these generally unknown actors do suit these roles much better then a famous actor would. The acting is convincing enough.The camera work is a main focal point as most would know or heard of, but it is done a heck of a lot better then The Blair Witch. The people behind Cloverfield did their homework and took advantage of the Blair Witch's downfalls in this department no doubt.There are instances in the movie where you may question why the camera is still rolling, but as I see it, this is common in these such films.Summing up, this film is rewarding if you are able to cling to the characters at the beginning of the film. If you don't by the time all the crazy stuff starts happening. You most likely wont enjoy it.Overall i give it a 7/10, I don't really want to write specifically why it loses 3 points as i will spoil some things, but they are due to unrealistic events occurring in a movie that is using realistic camera work.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Cloverfield is amazing,"This movie was hyped up to a huge degree. Everyone I knew had at least heard about Cloverfield in some form or another and this movie lives up to any portion of hype it has created. To completely call this movie a monster movie would be wrong because it's more about the characters trying to survive the attack but the monster, obviously, is a big part of it. The acting was magnificent, the hand held camera (can be a little uneasy for some folks) but I think it worked quite well and gave you the sense that you were really there with those people, feeling the same emotions and are just trying to make it with them. The monster is... well, amazing and terrifying. I definitely recommend seeing it.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good Movie,"This film could be reduced to a cross between The Blair Witch Project and Godzilla, but it rises above such amateur labels. This is a good flick based off of original cinematic methods, but addressing coherent and pertinent subject matter. The cinematography was good (as far as the genre goes). There were certain parts that I would advise anyone who is in any way sensitive to 9/11 to avoid. That is a big minus of this film: it is a great story, but the setting is... somewhat unsettling. The film makers could have used Chicago or L.A. as a setting and avoided the distraction. This distraction is onmniscient throughout the film. Nevertheless, I liked the film. There was a flow in the concept and the storyline.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Gripping, Terrifying Experience","Congratulations to director Matt Reeves, writer Drew Goddard, producers J.J.

If you ever wondered while watching a Godzilla movie, what it must've been like for all the little ""toy"" people figures being crushed, exploded and otherwise killed in the monster's rampage, CLOVERFIELD gives you the up-close-and-personal version of what was actually taking place on the ground. A lot of people won't like the ""Blair Witch""-style, first person/shaky-cam method used to tell the story, but this is exactly what sets it apart from and above your ""average"" monster mash. Add startling visual and special effects and some believably frightened performances, and what you have here is a movie that is going to be dissected, debated and discussed all the way through 2008, and probably beyond.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
The good and the bad,"Cloverfield was a pretty good movie all and all. Besides the hundreds of point of view shots and the camera bouncing around every five seconds it was a pretty good movie. I thought that it was very clever and smart the way they made this movie. Despite me not being a fan of the camera shots and the way they did the camera work you might be a fan. I just thought that the beginning was boring and the ending was bad. The actors did a great job for the roles they had to play. I also thought that some of the messages and themes aimed toward this movie were great. I also loved what the characters did for each other in this movie. So in conclusion if you like bouncing cameras, and big monsters then i recommend this movie for you.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Very Bumpy Ride,"I would have given this movie an eight if I hadn't felt a little motion sickness about half way through my popcorn. There was a warning concerning this posted outside the door, but I didn't see it until afterward. To be fair, I knew it had the Blair Witch jerky camera effect but was too curious to pass on it. It was a very original approach to an old sci-fi theme and for that alone, it deserves an 8 or possibly 9. My wife and I agreed that our daughter's age group (twenty something) would have identified more with the characters. The special effects were very good and the overall mood of the movie was sustained by the latter. If you aren't bothered by jerky camera movements you will enjoy this thriller. It keeps you on edge right to the last second. I see a sequel coming soon to a theater near you.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Fun Romp Through New York,"A neat found-footage film that explores an alien invasion from the ground floor.

I'd see it again,"Before I say anything, I feel I must call to attention a point that defines whether or not you will like Cloverfield.In my opinion, there are two types of monster movie fans: People who like Alien, and people who like ToHo's Godzilla movies.If you are a fan of the Alien-esquire genre, you get a rush from the mystique of clever plot devises, and the suspense of NOT knowing exactly what it is you're -supposed to be- scared of.If you are of the ToHo Godzilla persuasion, you enjoy a movie with very few loose ends and a full-body shot of the monster within the first ten minutes of the film's beginning.Allow to admit that I am a fan of BOTH. However, both will not get the same experience from Cloverfield that I did.If you were in the percentile that enjoys rubber-suit Godzilla... I'm sorry. Its just not that kind of film. No, Cloverfield takes a refreshingly different direction with a genre who's light is slowly fading away into the mindless explosions and gore of films like AVPR.Not to say that this movie LACKS either of those things. In fact, explosions make up a large portion of this surprisingly short film. It just chooses to present them to you in a much more realistic fashion (or, at least, as realistic as a movie like this can be). Plus the filmmakers use them to execute what I think makes this movie a standout, and ultimately genius... To actually HIDE the monster from total view for the greater percent of the viewer's time.And HERE is where the Godzilla people will be disappointed. Don't get me wrong, seeing the creature immediately has its own advantages, but its honestly an overused devise. Movies like Alien, Predator (it pains me to put them so close together, but I'm going for a point here), and even Jaws/The Abyss have been intensely enjoyable in their own ways, with ALL of them have a substantial wait before the ultimate 'payoff' of seeing the movie's central focus... and Cloverfield handles this beautify. The viral marketing that has made it so popular only added to my curiosity, thus making that 'payoff' all the more enjoyable when I actually DID see the beast (sorry if that's a spoiler... but YES. You do get to see the monster).The camera thing is another issue that seems to bother a lot of people. For those that don't know, its shot from the PoV of one man's video recorder. There's a lot of jerky shots, static, and the occasional jump forward (and sometimes, randomly, back). There's also a few times when the viewer is denied a visual of what's happening around the characters, even though it would seem relevant to do a quick pan towards the action. HOWEVER, one should keep in mind that the actual cinematography is MUCH better than the widely-compared-to Blair Witch, with the camera used being of a much higher quality (there are several scenes where its easy to forget you're be being toted around by one of the characters). I personally felt that this added to the whole premise of 'realism' the picture was going for. As in, the characters honestly were too scared or too occupied (with things like running, creaming, etc.) to attempt filming one thing or another. It'll work differently for different people, probably NOT so well with people that are prone to motion sickness.Cloverfield does not offer you any answers, nor does it aim to. Its meant to keep the viewer guessing, and leave you with that small, slightly ignorant feeling at its end. This again will bother some people. I would have liked a bit more from it in that respect, but I understand why I was denied such.All in all, I came out very satisfied. Whether or not you will depends on your type. Casual moviegoers will more than likely enjoy it, while die-hard fans will either love or loath it.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not that bad, but not great","OK so I was in the mood for a monster flick tonight, and Cloverfield did it's job in keeping me somewhat entertained throughout.The beginning is SLOW .. so be prepared for that. It's also really not exceptional in my opinion because it tries too hard to be scary without being over the top. Normally this is a good thing, but for me it was sub par, this movie could have used a little over the top. The characters are believable 90% of the time so that's a good thing.All in all I wasn't mad for having watched this, but honestly the camera style turned me off. I give it a 7/10 because it tried, but it just didn't quite do it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Was not ready for what I got...,"I am a projectionist at a theatre. I decided to run this down because, I have followed, but not really been a part of, the hype of this movie. Going in I was expecting a fun but possibly mediocre film. I am glad I was wrong.If this has been shot the way most films are, it would have not have been as great as it was. The first person, hand-held perspective puts you, the viewer, right in the middle of the *CHAOS*, not action. You grow to care for these characters and feel what they feel. You become one of the friends in the group. If it were shot the way most films are, it would have pulled you out of that completely. Not to mention the fact that the way it was filmed in some of the scenes really made it pretty intense.The effects are absolutely amazing. The creature looks real. Wow, there is a lot I would like to say here but I am avoiding spoilers so, I will just leave it at, there is not a shot of this that doesn't look like it came straight off the miniDV it is supposed to be filmed on via story.Acting.

CLOVER what?,"I hardly remember watching this movie when it was released, back in 2008. Long time after CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST, a little less after BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and during the same year as REC, CLOVERFIELD explores the endless options to tell a horror flick thru the found footage, and of course associated with the long take processs. It was not new at the time it was released, and now, in 2024, it nearly looks old fashioned. But from time to time, it may be agreeable, entertaining to watch such film, even for an old timer like me. I guess this time of scheme, concept enjoyed thousands and thousands of audiences. That's the reason why two years later, you'll have MONSTERS and SKYLINE, with very close plots but without the subjective camera and footage.",,Anonymous,Horror

Surprisingly good found footage horror,"This is the 2nd time i watch this movie. 1st time i thought it was trash, and now i see why - i watched it on laptop, so the dark scenes were almost black on bad laptop screen, and no surround and bass makes it even more disapointing.Now that i watch it again I'm quite pleased. The movie starts pretty slow with that party, yet the moodines is quickly disrupted.Acting overal is decent. The plot is good, and not-so-holywoodish ( you know what i mean, almost all of the holywood movies with that theme have the same outcome...).Camera work is pretty good, which is hard for self-found footage movies because if you want to make it look good, you have to put a lot of thought in it. Editing was also good.The monster design is superb, one of the nicest designs i've seen in such movie. VFX in general were quite on par.Sound was very good. Suring the normal scenes, it all felt like normal homemade amateur video, while they managed to add just the right amount of surround sound, to make you feel more immersed (even as it makes no sense to have that since it's mono or stereo microphone on such cameras but i close my eyes for that :D ). There's a lot of heavy bass in many scenes, tho not as low as i'd love to. Yet - a lot of bass.Overall pretty good movie esp if you watch it in home theater. It will lose a lot on a laptop.P. S.

Shocked,"I wasn't sure what to expect...which I think is most people's reaction when going in to Cloverfield. We got to go to the screening in Tempe on Wednesday night and saw it with a full crowd. Honestly, it was slow at the beginning. It takes a while to get used to the hand-held camera shots and really, the character development is a little obvious. It is nice that they took time to build a relationship between the main 4 characters in the movie, but really, I could have done without it.Once the movie gets going (the part you see in the trailer when the monster attacks) it really kicks in to high gear. The hand-held camera allows the movie to cut out the boring stuff and only show the exciting parts without seeming disjointed. This is a revolutionary approach to monster movies and is probably something we will see lots of in the future.Without going into the plot of the movie (and ruining it) I have to say that the acting was wonderful and the writing was well done. The editing is what made this movie great though. There are no cheesy scenes and there aren't any laughable moments (like the alien reveal in Signs) that ruin the movie. While parts of the dialog are funny, the plot never turns over-the-top. I enjoyed it immensely.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Blair Witch meets Godzilla, either it works for you or it doesn't","During a party in New York City celebrating Rob Hawkins's (Michael Stahl-David) promotion to Vice President at his company as well as a last hurrah before he goes to Japan to take the job, Hudson ""Hud"" Platt (T. J. Miller) at the request of Rob's brother Jason (Mike Vogel) goes around the party recording testimonials and well wishes from the partygoers inadvertently stumbling upon tension between Rob and his girlfriend Beth McIntyre (Odette Yustman) much to the annoyance of Jason's fiancé Lily Ford (Jessica Lucas). When a blackout briefly strikes the city and news of capsized tanker reaches the partygoers, they investigate only to find a giant creature is rampaging through the city. With Hud still recording the events, the group go through the ravaged remains of Manhattan to rescue a trapped Beth with the threat of the creature looming over them.Thought up by J. J. Abrams during production of Mission: Impossible III, Abrams upon visiting Japan was inspired by various Godzilla toys to create his own American monster movie free from the ""adoribility"" of King Kong or the ""charm"" of Godzilla and make a legitimately scary take on giant monsters. Produced by Abrams and written and directed in secret by Drew Goddard and Matt Reeves respectively, the movie's marketing campaign began with a title less trailer attached to the first Michael Bay helmed Transformers movie in 2007 fueling speculation for an entire year until the reveal of its full name Cloverfield, which was one of many working titles floating around (along with Slusho, Cheese, and Greypoint). Released in January 2008, the year long marketing campaign and secrecy of the project paid off resulting in the biggest January opening at the time making $170 million against its $25 million budget and earning solid critical praise. The movie's found-footage style applied to larger situations has been a sticking point with audiences (and even became a source of mockery in many parodies and comedies). Cloverfield remains a fun ride even if the faded novelty of the format and presentation has diminished its appeal somewhat.In terms of what you expect from a giant monster film, the movie certainly delivers with lots of city wide destruction, military skirmishes with the beast doomed to end in failure, and a pretty memorable monster design. The monster (known as ""Clover"") with its pale white skin and elongated arms gives it a very alien appearance that doesn't fully align with any particular creature and is quite striking. The movie also adds an element of parasites that fall off the creature that serve as a secondary threat which is also pretty well done.While the experience watching the movie is solid, the characters range from bland and passable to grating and annoying. While the fact that it's a found footage movie means you have to suspend some level of disbelief as to the ""why"" behind the filming, the filmmakers cameraman in T. J. Miller's Hud is given the reason by being an aggravating presence in the film who only serves to be obnoxious in just how glib he's being about the situation. Hud talks WAY too much and when he does it's usually either inane commentary or stupid jokes like ""Remember that guy who was lighting homeless people on fire? I'd hate to see one of those now!"". The found-footage element does have some unique applications such as with older footage that shows the relationship between Rob and Beth before their spat which was a unique addition that built upon what was established in Blair Witch.Cloverfield is reasonably enjoyable as a monster film despite often disorienting camera work and a bland cast of characters, but in terms of delivering on a frightening take on giant monsters it succeeds giving us a memorable journey through ravaged Manhattan as an unstoppable monster plows through it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not even 90 minutes - That is my ONLY complaint!,"When you consider that my single complaint was that the film was not even an hour and a half long, and yet I still have so much to say...That should tell you something. From the opening sequence - a near-black background with pitch-black lettering spelling out ""Property of the U.S. Government Do Not Duplicate"", then in white lettering little official statements about ""designate Cloverfield"" and where the camera was found...It was already exciting. The editing in this film was stupendous!! The action was incredibly realistic, so much so that a suspension of disbelief was entirely unnecessary. I was immediately drawn in, completely immersed in the events, horrified and excited by each new happening and all that threatened to happen next. There was action, horror, comedy, drama, and intense realism all rolled up into basically eighty minutes of film! At the end of the film, many people sat through the credits expecting there to be more, seemingly unsatisfied, as if there had been no resolution...but I disagree. The events in the film did resolve themselves. But from beginning to end, this film was like nothing I had ever experienced in a theater. Blending the first-person-camera concept of the ""Blair Witch Project"" with the Monster in Manhattan ideas from ""King Kong"" and ""Godzilla"" with the harsh-realities-of-love-in-a-war-zone story from...well, pick any war flick from the bunch; this film stands on its own as the first extraordinary action flick of the new year! It was truly amazing! A definite nine star film!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A good ""found footage"" film where New York is, again, devastated in the cinema.","This film is based on the appearance of a gigantic and monstrous creature in the middle of New York. It is not a horror film in the strict sense of the term, it is more within Sci Fi and thriller. Directed by Matt Reeves, who ensures an effective and interesting direction, the film works very well.There is much in this film that is not evident. The film plays on it a lot to create more atmosphere and dramatic tension. The creature's origins are never revealed, its real appearance is only shown in very specific moments and the whole film is essentially a race in a besieged city and in great life peril.Filmed using the odious technique of ""found footage"", it works incredibly well, in spite of the shaky image, cinematography knew how to give perspective in the first person and transport us, to the place and to the action. The actors are complete strangers, and this allows us to better identify with the characters and view the film as a true ""found footage"". Personally, I would highlight the good work of Jessica Lucas, Mike Vogel and Michael Stahl-David. The problem is that the characters are so poor that they could be any anonymous face in that crowd, who we really don't care about. The sets and costumes are also very good, especially in the tough task of reconstructing the destruction caused by the monster. Finally, a word of great merit for the special, visual and sound effects, as well as for the effective CGI that was used in the film.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Wow...,"Seriously, that's about all I could say, or think after walking out of the theater at the end of this movie. I still remember nearly having a heart attack when I fist saw the teaser for this movie before Transformers. It left a lot of questions and I immediately went crawling on the web to find answers. JJ Abrams and his crew that put in a lot of really hard work did a very impressive job keeping this under wraps and building the almost endless and impatient-inducing hype. From the beginning of the film all the way to the end I was constantly craving more. Some critics say the acting was terrible, but to them I show them a certain finger, because honestly, if you were running around NYC fearing for your life, how would you act? The story, which the audience can relate to, revolves around, for the most part, Hud and his best friend Rob (Hud being the comic relief behind the camera). Rob is leaving for Japan with a new VP position at some unnamed company (my guess from the start was Slush-O, look at what shirt Rob's brother, Jason, is wearing). Weeks before Rob sleeps with his good friend (and as we find romantic interest) Beth, what do you know, Rob falls in love. Then the night of his going away party he sees Beth and it pretty much ruins his fun, that is until the ground shakes and the power fails temporarily. Enter: ""Cloverfield"" from the ocean tearing off the head of the Statue of Liberty and capsizing a ship on it's entrance into Manhattan. The rest of the film continues with Hud behind the camera and Rob with a small group of close friends in tow in a desperate attempt to save Beth and flee from this creature. There is the story that I can tell without ruining the film. This unique style that hasn't really been done before (we'll just forget Blair Witch on this one) really gives the audience a new view on a movie not yet seen, the first person perspective of the main characters. Yes, you see the monster, and they do a great job of teasing you with small glimpses of it (and the smaller almost more terrifying creatures that come with it). The special effects are well done, and the action scenes involving the Army are just as intense as the destruction this creature unleashes. A ""you never know what'll happen next"" ""edge of your seat"" thrill ride- sorry to sound cliché'd. I loved this movie and really hope they follow through with the rumored plans to make another from a different perspective. If you like monster movies, thrillers, action, and keep-you-guessing films this is one you must check out. Hey, if it's good enough to beat out Star Wars: SE and Black Hawk Down on the opening weekend box office records then it must be good. $41 million and counting can't be wrong!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Brilliant,"People that didn't watch this movie right most probably didn't like it at all,I loved because i watched it at the theater with the huge screen,cool surround sound and peace and quiet.I personally loved the blair witch project because unlike other Hollywood movies this was realistic,the special effects were excellent and the acting was superb.And it was totally different from the other monster movies that came this past decade.Just because Johnny Depp or Brad Pit ain't the stars of this movie don't put it down,it's a must see for everyone who enjoys a scare and a jump.Stay away from the avp2 movie and enjoy this one for movies like these are very rare",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Decent Sci-Fi/Disaster Film w Great Casting. A Little Slow, But Worth Watching.","For this review, I watched 'Cloverfield' (2008) for the third time. Previously, I was under the impression that this was a J.J. Abrams film, because the marketing told me it was. This film may have used a little of J.J.'s money and his name, but it's not a J.J. Abrams film.As for the content, the film is a little slow. The idea seemed to be that the viewer would come for the disasters, and would learn to care about the characters. Ok, then give us a disaster inside of 45 minutes. At times, it's easy to forget that this was supposed to be a disaster film, because there is no disaster and the filming of the party gets boring.Lizzy Caplan is great in every role she plays, and she carries this film.Another interesting aspect in 2019 is use of the technology in the film. ""Taping Over"" something is a concept that some viewers in 2019 (and most viewers in the future) will not understand. Since ""taping over the past"" is central to the storyline, 'Cloverfield' (2008) will eventually become a cultural nostalgia piece. The effects are dated and cheesy, the technology is dated already, and this will become a film that people watch to see the past - not to enjoy a SciFi/Disaster film.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

It's beyond description!I know we can say, it's just another typical adventure/thriller, based on a weird looking monster.... A total fantasy, what's targeted audience is the younger people!Yes you may say all those! However, I watched the movie as I was there in the action,....actually it is the movie instead, that makes me feel like that!I faced the death with it, I fought for my friends in there, I heard the screams, I saw those terrorized faces, I ran for my life, I witnessed my colleagues dying in front of my eyes.... Everything I saw, I felt! The feelings were so real that it took over me in no time!I cannot judge the movie how it is! It could be just an average movie to you, but it is more than that for me!The movie makes me pray that I do not want to be one among those billions people who will experience the judgment day/the day when the world ends! I cannot take that for sure! I wish I would not be there!I respect all the casts and the crews of the film. They deserve more! You are pretty much successful, at least for me its 100%.

Really love this one,One of the best monster sf movies ever BUT. The more I watch it the more the bud caractor anois me. Damn but this actor is mostly a annoying in any role he plays. But it's here so deal with it. When I saw it in the cinema the Handycam shots made me dissy. It's to shocky for a big screen later on it worked beter at home. Shame there never was a descent part 2. Because the monster was just a baby so..... I never understood the 2 movies after. I really was looking forward what would happen next. Maybe of were lucky some great moviemaker will pic it up where we ended in this one. And show us the big one. The mother ore the father of the little one in this. CLOVERFIELD.,9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Don't Be Such a Sissy!,"People said the same thing about ""The Blair Witch Project""; that is, the hand held camera made them nauseated. Get over yourself. It is an effective film technique that is used to heighten the feeling of panic and escalate the manifestation of fear in the film. I liked ""Cloverfield"". I thought it was great fun. I thought the hand held camera was used to good advantage to help build the emotion and move the story along. It is appropriate to the characters running in the streets from a gigantic monster. It helps heighten our own fear and is appropriate to the situation. It certainly would not have been the same movie without it.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Monster Holocaust...,"CLOVERFIELD is an exhilarating ""found footage"" film featuring a rampaging behemoth destroying NYC.The setup is simple, but effective: A group of partygoers become caught up in a night of terror, all filmed by a handheld camera.Of course, the main problem with this sort of movie is the contrivance of having someone with the miraculous state of mind to actually record such a catastrophic situation. Wouldn't they be too busy screaming and going insane with fear?That aside, CLOVERFIELD is one of the best of its sub-genre, mostly due to its fun, comedic beginning that quickly devolves into a nightmare of survival against a seemingly unstoppable force. Once it gets going, it barely stops to catch its breath!It's most effective to watch this in total darkness on a huge screen with a dynamite sound system.

I love this film and recommend it to everyone!!,"One of the things I have inherited from my father, besides the eyes, is a love for this film. Now, just to make this clear, I'm not saying the sun rises and falls with this movie, I'm saying I think it's well made, has a great and engaging plot line, and likable characters that you can root for- which, I believe, is what anyone would want from a film; ""Cloverfield"" does exactly what any good film should do: it entertains the audience.I love the use of home footage, and think it works especially well in this movie. Unlike similar monster-terrorizing-Manhattan movies, Cloverfield gives a personalized experience of a group of people navigating through the city and the destruction. This, aside from an exciting view of events and a more immediate sense of danger to the characters, creates a fresh view on a disaster movie (so unlike films like Godzilla, you aren't just following some stereotypical science nerd explaining where the monster comes from, followed by some stereotypical army dude trying to blow the thing up). Also, although the film itself is not exactly mentally taxing, it has some fascinating trivia etc. which I would recommend reading after watching the film...Cloverfield is an exciting, engaging and humorous film which I really love and would recommend to everyone. It's even sort enough to watch twice without people realizing!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Original found footage flick def worth a watch,"Another dabble into the found footage genre, so many bad ones, but this is definitely a gem, silly story of course, big Godzilla type monster destroying Manhattan, big difference here is, you very rarely see the Beastie, only glimpses, which adds to the suspense, what the hell is it, CGI is pretty dam good, the cast are the real stars though, one in particular, HUD, amazing comic relief at times, he definitely stole the show, clever use of the hand held camera, making it as real as possible, ultimately, don't over think it, just enjoy the spectacle and performances ,once again HUD the character is funny as hell.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

The effects are top notch. The monsters are intense and frightening.
This film was made before found-footage was so horribly overdone. At the time it still felt fairly new.
In all honesty this might be the scariest monster movie I've ever seen.

Firsthand Experience,"The movie does an extremely good job of making you feel as though you're taking part in the movie. The creatures are a good mix of scary and interesting. JJ Abrams did a good job of creating a story that not only offered the viewer a first hand experience because of the camera style, but also the chance to connect with the characters. Even though you're only shown bits of and pieces of each person and how they act - they way they respond to things really gives us, the audience, a good view of who they are. The cinematography itself is intense, but interesting - some may find it hard on the eyes, but it does offer the viewer a unique firsthand experience of a monster attack and I highly recommend it.",,Anonymous,Horror
Better Than Expected,"Given that i am not the biggest J.J Abrams fan, i headed into this with some reservations. However, i am pleased to say that 'Cloverfield' is a great success for the monster movie genre in the 21st century. By playing on the current western fear of terrorism, the film presents the kind of fear that the cinema goer can invest in, in 2008. The film also boasts some strong performances from its cast of relative unknowns, who, because of their anonymity, also add another layer of reality to the film. Having said this i feel that the films biggest success, is the use of only the camcorder footage captured by the group, which in many parts of the film greatly adds to its atmosphere and intensity, in particular in the subway scene. Despite its many strong points i feel there were two problems with the film, which hampered it slightly as an experience: Firstly, i feel that the monster itself did not quite live up to its hype, which i suppose is not surprising given, the films promotional push prior to its release. Secondly; I feel the film suffers from what i like to call return of the king syndrome with respect to the ending, as it feels that the filmmakers couldn't quite decide what they wanted to do, so they packed everything in at the cost of the films coherence.However, despite these issues, 'Cloverfield' is great, daring, and genuinely scary popcorn cinema, and a very strong addition to the monster movie cannon.Rob Yeomans",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Not too much and not too little 1st person concept,"My biggest upset is T. J. Miller's role as Hud. For whatever the reason T. J. Miller is a very one dimensional actor. His acting style is the exact same no matter what movie it is. He acts as a simple minded, smart aleck, oblivious to human connections, and has no regard for ones emotions. What a truly daunting character. Every movie. As far as the other actors I give them props because they acted in a way that was very convincing. Their characters had a sense of urgency and decisiveness. I can't say they made the best decisions at each fork in the road, however that goes to show you their reality, imperfections, and the existence of human error. I've seen this movie years ago and thought it was good, looking at it now in 2022 I can say it has definitely withstood the test of time.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Watch the triology together to appreaciate the world building aspect of this franchise. Its more than just alien invasion.,"Rewatching the trillogy, still the best among the other two. It was overrated and i totally didnt get the hype back then, probably due to its interesting filming style but in terms of the storyline it was quite common. Only starting to appreciate the movie more after watching the others two, connecting the dots on this franchise. Quite fascinating.Despite all that, for me the drama from the first 18 minutes of this movie was totally unnecessary, like literally. In terms of the casts - all of them are okay, not very compelling tho. The production was okay, seems to be cheap but actually it wasnt especially for the set and graphics - which were seems to be decent.The production style is not something for everyone as it may trigger headaches and dizzyness for people with photosensitivities and motion sickness. Falls in the category of scifi, mystery, action and adventure - which i enjoyed so much watching except for the romance (totally unnecessary). Sound effects and scores were okay.

What a ride!,"The phrase ""emotional roller-coaster"" gets bandied about a bit, but Cloverfield is exactly that, in more ways than one. Yes, it's a monster movie (yay!) but it's also a lot more. A combination of hand-held camera work, emotional acting, realistic drama and a high sense of urgency means there is a massive connection between film and audience. I found myself, a few times, wanting to yell at the characters to ""Run!"" because the monster would get me if they didn't. This is not a feeling any other movie has given me. Usually, when there are big explosions and Monster VS Army battles, I want to watch because it's cool. In Cloverfield, the cameraman was one of the main characters, which meant that when there were action scenes I was willing the camera to turn around and not watch because it would mean he was (finally!) running away. I came out of the theater feeling as if I'd woken up from a dream where I was riding a washer on spin-cycle in the dark with spiders: dizzy, confused and wary of anything moving. And yet, I wanted to line up for the next ride. If you ever want to know what it's like to be a civilian caught in the middle of a war you know nothing about, watch this movie. Cloverfield is not just a movie, it's an experience and I heartily recommend going for the ride.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
War of the worlds meets Blair Witch Project,"You are looking at a ""War of the Worlds"" setting with some unknown Force/Creature/Whatever attacking humanity (or just Manhattan in this case). The Whole movie looks like it was filmed from a hand-held camera by people caught in the incident. Even without no background-music during the whole movie it still manages to build up a dense atmosphere since the viewer is (as he experiences the events through the eyes of a small group of people - or their camera) left with almost no information whatsoever. There is no scene in which the viewer for instance gets a good look at what is wreaking havoc in Manhattan, which again contributes to the atmosphere.The down side is that at the point, the movie ended, I found myself expecting a ""second half"" of the movie.

Should Have Let Someone Else Carry the Camera,"I have to admit, I really enjoyed this movie when I first saw it years ago, but rewatching it recently was not nearly as fun. I can appreciate the found footage filming technique. I've seen some fantastic movies shot in this style. The problem with Cloverfield is how shaky the camera is and in a setting that is so dark. It's hard to make out much as the camera is constantly whipping around. It's frustrating when you're wanting to focus in on something but the guy with the camera won't cooperate. The monster terrorizing New York City is a creature straight out of a Godzilla movie. I love that sort of thing. I just wish this movie would have let us see more creature action and less of blurry, chaotic scrambling about. Another problem with this movie is its completely unsatisfying ending. It drops you off suddenly and leaves you asking, ""Is that it?"" The dialogue is meaningless and the characters are not very interesting. The coolest thing about this movie is the perspective from which we experience this invasion. The found footage format puts us right in the city with this giant beast. While the camera never stays long on the creature, there are some thrilling shots of monster mayhem. If you have enough patience to not get annoyed with the jerky camera movement, you might enjoy what makes this movie unique.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"My first 10 star rating for a movie, but 15 years too late :(","One of the first movies of the year that I saw in theatres, Cloverfield was a completely new way of immersing yourself in the cinematic experience.Being shot in a found footage format in an era when movies were still focused on the widescreen aesthetic of capturing action, was unheard of unless you saw The Blair Witch Project. And even then, it wasn't exactly a style with a huge fanbase.I was 12 at the time, and still getting accustomed to various types of films. I dragged my dad to go for it, and he begrudgingly bought us tickets while staring at the poster in disbelief lol.(He always liked posters that told a story, and seeing lady liberty's head ripped clean off was not exactly Kubrick level cinema.)During the movie however, I never saw my dad this invested in a film that wasn't about war or historical events. Avengers 1 managed to get a great reaction too!We were both shellshocked by what was transpiring on screen, but to hear my dad laugh at TJ Millers jokes was unbelievable, and proof that he really did enjoy the movie thoroughly.I was beyond ecstatic and frightened at the same time.This movie kept us both on the edge of our seats from the 20 minute mark till the end, and while me and my dad were quite unaffected by violent movies, there were times when I thought we made a mistake with this one loll 😂It's a superbly crafted, extremely intense ride of a movie, that starts with a calm breeze before growing into a thunderstorm of catastrophic proportions.The ARG itself was stellar marketing, the kind that I wished they utilized for movies in the MCU. Sadly disney cares more about money than quality, which is why they cannot hold our interest after 15 years, and this movie can.One of the best monster/found footage films I've seen.If you are a gen z, or someone who hasn't seen many movies before 2015, I would tread caution when watching this.Me and my dad were freaked ourselves!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

"a contradiction that works, up to a point: big Hollywood blockbuster/monster movie meets (stylized) subjective POV","JJ Abrams is very clever at delivering projects that drive up the hype machine like some kind of crazy storm, which can either go off smashingly (Lost) or not so much (Felicity). Cloverfield is an experiment that needed some clever marketing - hence the ""what the ?"" trailer that came out last summer with people partying in a video camera viewpoint, and then looking out at a big explosion over New York City. What the film is is a bit different from the mystery surrounding the buzz on it, though the director Matt Reeves and writer Drew Goddard (the former's first movie since The Pallbearer, the latter his first feature script after years of television), end up delivering some clever ideas and some good scares, even surprisingly juicy metaphors, while also making the audience suspend an incredible amount of disbelief.And it's this amount of disbelief that had me personally feeling very mixed about the picture when it ended. I knew I had seen some good entertainment in the sense of delivering the shocks and thrills that a good monster movie can provide (some of it, arguably, reminds one of the recent film the Mist). But there's more than just the ambiguity around where the huge would-kick-Godzilla's-toosh monster that reigns havoc all over midtown Manhattan, though that's a part of it. There's a specific purpose in having the characters Reeves and Goddard have in the picture, who are shallow, self-obsessed twenty-something cretins that look like a cross between your suburban Abercrombie acquaintances and rejects from MTV reality shows. The filmmakers bring the audience early on- and in increases steadily as the story goes on- to despising these people, not simply for their actions (have any of these people heard of the phrase ""every man for himself and huge f***ing creature against all?""), but for doing the stupid things that happen in most horror films.And yet, at the same time, the filmmakers have something special going on here, aside from the technique, which is of course part of the message (medium-message yada yada). The monster and its minions, for these kids as well as everyone else in the city, is like what philosophers call ""the big other"". Look at the scene where looters rush into an electronics store, and on TV there's news footage of the monster ripping apart the city. All the looters stop dead in their tracks, and for Rob and Lily and especially Hud the creature is like some unfathomable presence that can't be stopped, and despite being right where they can see it is something they can't totally grasp their collective consciousness around. That, plus some (slightly obvious) allusions to 9/11, and a slight tip of the hat to Japan (the kid going off to Japan, almost clever by half I'd say), make this a movie that does have some good metaphors going for it under the surface.This being said, there's something about the aforementioned characters that sort of bugged me, startling early on with the twenty minute lot of scenes with the party, and trickling down as the film went along. The style is meant to convey something specific, that we're right along with the viewer as they go through an extremely chaotic situation that is inconceivable (at least, unless, you haven't seen your share of Godzilla movies). Which, in its own way, treks back to the legacy left by Blair Witch Project, where one cared about what would happen to the trio as their defenses whittled down to a nub in the midst of the dark woods. In the case of Cloverfield, however, we're put in a situation where the subjective point of view is intense, a way of revealing a creature that is designed like out of some weird graphic novel. This part, of revealing the horror elements, works fine and effectively (particularly the spiders in the subway)...And at the same time the characters don't quite follow the reality that would be for most people. It's good to see a movie like Cloverfield with an audience (especially, if you're lucky, in Manhattan itself) to see the kind of response it gets, which to me seemed like a collective form of stretching the suspension of disbelief. Aside from the character Marlena, who is arguably the most sympathetic (or just least ""what the ?"" of the characters in what they do or say or act), they're like most characters we see in many a horror movie, following a logic that is more based on getting through the points that will lead the story through its harrowing end. I'll be able to suspend disbelief even in the sorts of things one has to go with in Cloverfield. But it takes some identification, some sympathy with the characters, to make it really worthwhile. I didn't get that from the picture, adding to it a muddled (if slightly exciting) climax.In the end, Cloverfield left me with mixed feelings, and I'm not sure when I would watch it again. But as the biggest hit so far in 2008, it's hard not to want to see what it has to offer, as a tip of the hat to old classic monster-destroys-city movie while trying a different approach. Least I can say is Abrams fans wont be too dissatisfied.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Interesting experiment,"This film was a bit of a let-down after all the hype but it was still good. As an experiment, it takes the handheld approach popularised by The Blair Witch Project (1999) and applies it to a big monster movie. The result is some tension as the characters are kept in the dark. There is some character building at the same time as the mayhem and the actors do a good job. The monster itself is a bit contrived though, as it is not explained within the film itself and it seems too invulnerable to be believable.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Very Good and Thankfully not too Long.,"The reason I say thankfully not too long is that the hand-held cam is so headache inducing that it almost isn't worth having. But, without it the movie would lose what makes it so cool. Looking at the visuals like this really made it seem like it all was being destroyed. The best scenes are seen in the previews but they really are amazing to behold. It makes it all the more terrifying that it's happening in New York and it seems like another terrorist attack at first. The chaos is very cool when it is about, the running around, while necessary, very hard to keep watching. The monster is what it is. It's pretty cool I guess, but you really never get a great enough look to tell. To me it looked kinda like a oceanic praying mantis. There are some really well done intense scenes and pretty serious shocks. I really enjoyed the film and do recommend it. However, if the shaky hand-held cam makes you sick, you might want to avoid this one.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Simply doesn't live up to the hype.,"Since the untitled teaser trailer was released with Transformers in July, hype and mystery have been on this movie like flies on crap. Sad to say, Cloverfield doesn't live up to it.The biggest hook this movie has is ""What does the monster look like?"" I won't spoil it, so don't worry. You DO get one clear shot of the monster near the end of the movie; the rest of the time it's bits and pieces. For the first 10-15 minutes of the movie or so there is no attack. It is a going away party for Rob, the main character.Which brings me to the camera. I was expecting it to be used for the party, not for the ENTIRE movie. When the camera isn't focused on the monster, I felt sick looking at the screen. It feels a little too realistic most of the time. However, the special effects and sound are spectacular.I would've given this a higher rating, but the camera, overall forgettable characters and terrible ending bring this to a somewhat generous 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Before Found Footage Movies Got Out Of Hand,"Cloverfield takes the Godzilla formula but with the found footage style. Director Matt Reeves and Drew Goddard took something that should have been terrible, but gave it enough style and substance to make it a fun and entertaining thriller. You don't go to these films for Oscar worthy acting or ideas. You go to these films to shove popcorn in your face and have a fun time. That's why it deserves a 9 out of 10, because as a standard monster thriller, it is a well above average movie. The action is intense and not lazily filmed, you are never bored, and thanks to the Cabin in the Woods writer/director, has some humor in it as well. This is not a horror film, which some think it is. The acting is good enough to not take you out of the movie immersion. This is an excellent rental.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

"A very, very above average movie.","First of all, many many people bashed this movie for its ""cheap"" cinematography and acting. Coming into it, I honestly did not have very high expectations. But I must say, this is easily one of the most satisfying films I have seen this year. The camera work gave a sense of immediacy and suspense that was not present in the Blair Witch Project, which this film is often compared to, and the characters seemed pretty real and easy to identify with. I am admittedly not an Abrams fan, but this is a cut above his usual work. The special effects were excellent, the characters were pretty believable (despite several disappointing, cheezy lines), and the experience itself was totally thrilling. With Juno, the Coen Brothers, and Jesse James, this was a great year for cinema, but I definitely think Cloverfield is a film that should not be overlooked.",,Anonymous,Horror
OK but certainly not original,"As mentioned by other reports this film is fairly intense and certainly has that feel of realism in the fact that you (or the camera) puts you in the situation of a real life monster attack on Manhattan (again)!!. But the film is not original, add Blair Witch, War of the Worlds and Godzilla and here you have it. In most films there is an area which is totally non believable and this one is no different in the part that (a spoiler here) the three party goer's try to rescue a girlfriend who is not only injured but in a building which is just about to collapse and have minutes to do this and get on a final helicopter ride out of the city before it is nuked, quite ridiculous!

A uniquely enigmatic and satisfying monster movie,"So here it is, after months of speculation and hype, Cloverfield has finally arrived in theatres. And the wait just may have been well worth the price of admission.A plot synopsis this late in the game may sound a bit like overkill, but suffice to say, a gigantic creature appears in New York City, and lays waste to it. Meanwhile, a group of friends, who happen to have a videocamera, record their point-of-view of the attack as they try to make it out of the city alive.What is surprising about Cloverfield is how it lacks any real depth or three-dimensional motivations for any of the characters (including the monster), but it draws you in anyway. It works in a way of saying very little, but packing a lot of strength into the things it does say. You feel an enigmatic sting right after the movie gets going, and it never manages to subside. It leaves a lot to the imagination, but at the same time, it works in so much that you fail to notice the many discrepancies and minimal plot details that would otherwise destroy a film.The storyline itself is heavily convoluted, and at times, melodramatic at best. I realize that the subplot of the party is integral to getting the group together (and the explanation for the camera), and I realize that some of these characters needed to be more than just a walking cliché waiting to get killed, but it really seems like a bit of work could have been done for them. The pathos for their situation is there (and their varying heartbreaks, including one powerfully done scene on a train platform), but the film never seems to take a crack at really making us feel for them. A lot of the dialogue exchanges between the characters are what drag the film down in its already blazingly fast running time, and could have easily been fixed up. They have their poetic moments, but they could all have had some work done (not to say that the adrenaline saturated performances here are not terrifically done as it is).Instead of focusing on the characters so much, the film's key strength is what is going on in the background. The satire and political allegories are just stunning in more than a handful of occasions. All at once the film draws on xenophobic ideals drilled into us by 9/11, old monster movies of yore (especially Godzilla) and the war on terror. The film even has a sequence that borders on being a recreation of 9/11, bringing the true realism and fear of the characters home to the audience. Seeing some of these scenes are downright terrifying, and mainly because we have seen scenes just like them in real life. Hell, the film even toys with the actions of the current generation. Instead of running for their lives, a group of people take pictures of the fallen head of the Statue of Liberty with their camera phones, presumably to later post on Facebook or MySpace. It prods around with these ideals, and in the process, creates a film that is undoubtedly immediate, and belongs to the kids of 2008. It may feel a little too close in touch with its excellent Korean brethren The Host, but its uniqueness lends itself to being more than a copy.And while some may write off the use of the handi-cam as a gimmick, it is what makes the film so enthralling and so strong. I had my doubts about the movie being entirely shot in this format, but as I watched it, I could not imagine it being nearly as powerful, or nearly as watchable if it were made with a standard film camera. Instead, the camera treats us into a sort of all-access pass, allowing the audience to feel as if they are a character themselves. And once the actual characters get running, the audience may feel like they are in for an endurance test as well. The edge of your seat mentality the film lends itself is more than enough to suggest that the film will get your blood pumping. It is not blazingly original, but for a suspense filled, mass-marketed, Hollywood film, it is definitely somewhat of a unique experience. Yes, the dizziness of some of the camera work is a bit jarring, and more often than not you may not be able to tell what is going on (and you will unlikely realize all the little things going on in the backgrounds of shot until it is too late), but these minor inconveniences only make for a more immediate and gratifying trip. The audience involvement tactic may not be for everyone, but is something that those who are willing to try, should.What impressed me the most however was how great the monster itself looks. It never stays in one spot for long, but the fear and terror that grips the characters as they catch glimpses of it is just enough. For such a small budgeted film, I was expecting something a little less realistic. Instead, it looks authentic and scary enough to be more than just someone's nightmare. Describing it will ruin the fun (and watching it tear up New York is the real treat), but the short glimpses do not last all that long thankfully. I was a little less enthused about the smaller parasitic looking beings that show up halfway into the film (and in one shot, you can tell it is clearly CGI), but they still look very well done anyway.Cloverfield is a flawed creation, but it is also very strong. Its enigmatic presence and genuine satire is something that monster movies tend to lack, but is quite hard hitting here. A little less melodrama could have made this terrifyingly and satisfyingly quick ride a whole lot less bumpy.8.5/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Blair Witch Project for the kaiju community,"I'm pretty sure once Cloverfield was released, everyone who saw it thought that it would be the ""monster movie to end all monster movies"", what with it being so far-removed from the cliched-but-familiar norm of the traditional giant monster movie formula by having the unique distinction of it being a survival horror thriller shot entirely in a found-footage documentary style (a novelty which really got overused and outstayed its welcome, over the course of the 2010s decade). When I watched it for the first time on home video, I didn't really like it all that much (probably because the idea of a ""found-footage"" format was still a relatively new concept to me, at the time). But as the years have gone by, I now see it as revolutionary masterpiece that actually made the kaiju genre feel genuinely scary again, after having numerous child-friendly, entertaining Godzilla and Gamera movies.I think the film perfectly captures that same chaotic sensibility of a tragic 9/11-type disaster, in which your irrational paranoia gets the better of you and you feel totally disoriented standing in a large crowd of panicking bystanders running for their lives (it really does put the audience's mind into that perspective, to see firsthand how the destruction events occurred from the point-of-view of the petrified onlookers). I'm only assuming that director Matt Reeves drew upon some inspiration for this from the real-life 9/11 terrorists attacks, kind of like how Ishiro Honda was inspired to make the original Godzilla after the atomic bombings on Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II.The filmmaker's made the smart decision to shoot the movie from a human's viewpoint with a handheld digital camera, as it makes the towering behemoth that's terrorising New York City seem more real and creates a foreboding mood (they use it to their maximum advantage). The most effective scenes where the film's ""shaky-cam"" cinematography looks best are when you're at ground-level looking up at the monstrous destruction or seeing it take place from a distance away, shrouded between the semi-demolished buildings. They also keep you in constant suspense by only giving brief glimpses of the creature's body (like an elbow here or a knee there), but they never relentlessly tease in the same way Gareth Edwards did with his murky Godzilla movie. And by the end of it all, there'll be a payoff that's been well worth the wait (""all good things come to those who wait"", as they say). Even the titular monster itself has an otherworldly design, making it totally alien in appearance.Without spoiling anything, I want to address a couple of complaints that people bring up when discussing this film, with the first one being ""why do they still keep recording when a normal person would stop and put the camera down"". I think it's just imbedded in our human behaviour to be naturally curious about any and all strange stuff we come across and instinctively want to document it down by recording the shockingly catastrophic events we bear witness to. Then there's the central young adult characters who honestly, I thought were passably serviceable to the film's plot and I didn't find them to be anymore annoying than any other mindless partygoer characters you'd normally see in most horror flicks out there (besides, the camera guy did give us a good dose of some much-needed levity, which I found to be a tad funny at times).Another pet peeve of mine is when dumb people complain that ""they didn't explain what the monster is or where it came from"" (I'm getting so sick of hearing people say that). This should in no way be the slightest bit of an issue, because we don't need to know! The more knowledgeable you are about something, results drastically in you becoming less and less scared of the thing in question because then, at that point, you'll understand the creature too well and it'll start to take the essence of fear away from it being a creepy spine-chilling, unexplained mystery (it's the simple, age-old ""fear of the unknown"", which in-turn leaves it up to your own wicked imagination to fill in the blanks as what you don't see is often more scarier than what's right in front of your eyes).Without ruining what happens, this rollercoaster thrill ride of an immersive cinematic experience (let's face facts, the movie was always best seen on the big-screen in a cinema with a quality sound system) ends on an exceedingly haunting high note, with the only piece of musical score heard in the whole film played over the credits. Composer Michael Giacchino's eerily classical operatic soundtrack truly evokes an immensely strong sense of dreadful hopelessness (it helps amplify the grim tone).Rather than putting a permanent end to this worn-out, tired genre for good and let it rest in the past, Cloverfield was so popular that it singlehandedly managed to revitalise the interest in giant monster movies for a new generation of younger fans (once again, history has repeated itself because this situation is exactly like what happened with Wes Craven's Scream and how that brought about a rejuvenation of sorts to the stale, monotonous slasher sub-genre of horror films during the late-1990s and early-2000, as they made a big come back after the first one's release in 1996).",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Go ahead and see it, you will be entertained.","As with most monster movies, the monster in this movie is awesome enough to outshine bad writing, bad camera work, and a bad plot. The monster, in fact, is so awesome that I would recommend seeing this movie just for the grainy, fleeting glimpses you get of it. It's been said that the monster is based on H.P. Lovecraft's Mythos, and I can definitely see the connection there, although there's no direct connection to any of Lovecraft's monsters specifically. Several scenes are directly ripped off from Blair Witch, and if you had any problems with that movie (like I did) you will have the same problems with this movie. Given the unrealistic reactions of the main characters and the totally unbelievable elements of this movie, there are still enough explosions and destruction to keep things moving. It would be nice to have more story revolving the monster, but I'm sure that's coming in the sequel.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
It Knows What It Is - A Tremendously Entertaining Ride,"Back when found-footage/mockumentary genre was alive and kicking, out also came ""Cloverfield"", which has kept its place among the better examples of the now almost extinct horror subgenre. And, very importantly, years later, a movie universe was built on it - ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" (2016) and ""The Cloverfield Paradox"" (2018) are the ones. ""Cloverfield"" was also Matt Reeves's start for an amazing run which hasn't stopped yet, for we are all currently waiting (im)patiently for ""The Batman"". Perhaps ""Cloverfield"" can't be called very sophisticated, thoughtful or a prime example of realism, but it is without a doubt one of the most thrilling and fun found-footage horror movies ever made, along with REC, The Troll Hunter etc.In its first 20 minutes, ""Cloverfield"" introduces the group of characters whose fates we're going to witness tonight, it does so via main character's going away party. Even before any real threat has presented itself, the movie feels fast and dynamic, tagging along with no problems whatsoever. When the mysterious monster strikes, it's mostly all-out action and tension till the very end. There are a couple intermissions, of course, but all in good traditions. The hand-held cinematography, trying to pass the feel realism, does feel faux quite often, and some situations have characters doing actions that are questionable, but even in the light of these flaws the entertainment value is impossible to ignore. ""Cloverfield"" is also one of those rare found-footage movies that feel, look (and are) expensive - a galore of special effects and lots of destroyable scenery. I've heard people complaining about the casting - personally I thought all the performances were fine and above, I couldn't care less if they are ""too good looking"". Young people in the same age group, it's more or less justified in the plot. ""Cloverfield"", as a singular unit, works well on all levels and succeeds at most of the tropes it utilizes, even if they are cliché.I believe that this film - and many of its genre relatives - should be viewed as an adventure, a rollercoaster ride, a walk in the haunted house, call it what You will. It's big, loud and feels packed, but ultimately works on simple terms. Unless you get dizzy easily, enjoy the trip. My rating: 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Cloverfield review,"The entire show was literally hand-held footage. It was very shaky throughout the show. Due to the fact that it's a hand-held footage, the perspective of the whole show was very limited. It's basically from a first person point of view. It's like comparing between watching a football match in a bird eyes' view and a close up replay on a few players, except that it's really shaky and can be pointless sometimes. If you do not like the close up and limited view then this is not a show for you. However, there's suspense throughout the show, and quite some bits of thrills and excitements.Ending was too abrupt though and lots of parts left unexplained. Not a bad movie overall.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

A Simple Yet Entertaining Monster Movie,"So i went to see ""Cloverfield"" yesterday and i know a lot of you are dying to see it. So i decided to write a review about it.The story of ""Cloverfield"" is simple. A bunch of people are hanging out and minding their own business when the city is attacked by a huge creature and they have to try to make it out of the situation alive. Its your basic monster movie plot and there's nothing really special or different about the plot to make it anything more than your basic monster movie plot. The characters are all fairly shallow. The only ones who have any real sort of depth are the Rob and Beth characters but they aren't much deeper than the rest of the cast. Any actor aiming for an Oscar are likely not going to get a nomination for these roles. Not because they're bad actors but because there's not much to work with when it comes to these characters.Speaking of the acting, everyone did what they could with these characters. There aren't any breakthrough performances here but at the same time there aren't any terrible performances either. It's all pretty average. In fact, most of the acting consisted of running and screaming and the occasional fall now and then. But the parts when they weren't running and screaming were pretty convincing so props to the cast there.The special effects were undeniably good with this film. The visuals of the tore up and broken New York city were pretty beautiful as ironic as the sounds. The most impressive visuals, in my opinion, were the statue of liberty's head when it came crashing down into the streets. Watching that scene in the commercials is great and all but you really have to see that on the big screen to get the full effect of it. To put it simply, this movie had some really great special effects. Not as great as the special effects of ""Transformers"" but then again i doubt that anything in the next few years will be able to top that movie in the special effects department.Anyway. The one big complaint that i have against this movie is the way it was made. Don't get me wrong. The concept of the film and how it is shown through a hand held camera was a brilliant idea but that was the very reason the made this movie extremely hard for me to watch. The camera was really shaky, especially during the scenes where the camera man was running. Halfway through the movie I had to tilt my head back and take deep breaths and i had to continue this every few minutes so i was watching a lot of the second half of the movie through the corner of my eye. I usually don't get motion sickness but this movie really had my stomach turning.The bottom line is that if you can get past the shaky camera you'll have yourself a simple yet entertaining monster movie. But if you're looking for something that will make you ""feel"" things this is not the movie for you. As long as you don't look too far into ""Cloverfield"" and just take it for what it is i'm pretty sure you'll enjoy it. And you might want to bring a barf bag just in case.My Overall Rating: 7 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Cloverfield review.,"When I first heard of this movie, I was skeptical because I wasn't a big fan of Paranormal Activity and I haven't seen the Blair Witch Project. I watched it and I loved it, but I did started to have a bit of dizziness 20 minutes into the movie. The reason I love this movie is because It's extremely realistic and the acting doesn't even look like acting and it's everyday people just doing their everyday life things and then all of a sudden, they are the victims of a giant creature and just like they, the audience have no idea about this thing and what it is. The special effects are amazing and the dialogue is very ordinary and normal. My favorite part is when the guy holding the camera sees the monster for the first time and it looks extremely huge in size. Cloverfield, Paranormal Activity, The Blair Witch Project, and any other found footage are the type of movies that you either ""love or you hate"". I love this movie, but I can 100 percent sympathies with you if you get motion sickness, because my brother Gerard got motion sickness and hated the movie. Another thing I was taken by surprise that a reference to 9/11 was used when the Statue of Liberty's head fell into the city and the dust of clouds came. It's very offensive that they referenced to that. That's the only problem I have with this movie. Go see Cloverfield, but bring some Dramamine when you go and see for yourself. This is my opinion.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Effective Approach,"(Flash Review)A taught and modern spin on a classic monster invades a big city movie. The approach of appearing to be filmed with a handheld camera worked for me as it echoed the chaos. The chaos triggered by some huge monster ravaging Manhattan. The film starts at a condo party to introduce the characters and then abruptly turns into a survival film as the authorities try to protect the city and people. While the characters aren't really sympathetic, they do show concern for their close friends and the film with all the mayhem and tight editing is engrossing. And you have a turn a blind eye to the cameras battery life and durability but it didn't impact the movie for me as it is a monster movie! Not sure if this is a spoiler or not but the film owned the found footage approach by not revealing how this started or ended, you just get a snapshot of the attack from a few people's harrowing perspectives.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
GODZILLA For Twenty-Somethings,"A giant monster attacks New York City: the idea is at least as old as THE BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS (1953). What distinguishes CLOVERFIELD is its perspective. Stealing THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT's gimmick, it tells the story exclusively from the point of view of five twenty-somethings armed only with a video camera. Instead of the usual panning shots of thousands of anonymous screaming extras fleeing in panic, which has the effect of distancing the audience from the action, we are right down there in the carnage, underfoot as it were, in danger of getting trampled like the rest.Unfortunately, this verisimilitude has landed CLOVERFIELD in political hot water. Some people claim it offensively exploits the memory of 9/11 (like a certain former mayor of New York/ex-Presidential candidate). Just to put things in historical perspective, GODZILLA was made in 1954, just nine years after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. (In an early scene, CLOVERFIELD acknowledges its kaiju roots when it is revealed one of the characters is moving to Tokyo to pursue a career.) CLOVERFIELD isn't a classic like GODZILLA, or even as good as THE HOST, another recent giant monster movie that focuses on people. The characters--the heroic guy, the heroic girl, the nerdy guy, the stuck-up girl, the heroic guy's heroic brother--are far too generic to be memorable. On the other hand, it towers over the disappointing 1998 remake of GODZILLA, also set in New York City. CLOVERFIELD is efficient scary entertainment that will hold your attention for its scant 84-minute running time.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The gimmick in the delivery is effective and impressive in the midst of the action but the characters and narrative take away more than they add,"A group of young New Yorkers are holding a surprise going-away party in Upper-East-Side Manhattan, with the only excitement being revelations about the relationships between some of the friends. However a massive boom brings the party to an end and everyone heads to the roof in time to see further explosions, culminating with the head of the Statue of Liberty hitting their block. They attempt to flee Manhattan along with everyone else on the island while the military flood in from the other direction but a phone message from one of the group sees them heading back to try and rescue her as well.The first ""big"" film of 2008 deserves credit for what it does very well indeed, which is its marketing strategy. Although I failed to see any of the trailers until the week before release, even I knew about it a year ago. Given the extent of the hype surrounding the film, it is hard to fault it in this regard. However when I got around to actually seeing the film, the way it had been sold was not really a factor in my enjoyment (or not) of it so I put this all to one side. The film opens slowly with an introduction to the characters and establishing of the party for later but after what does seem like an age we get the ""attack"" finally happening and with it comes the panic and hand-held chaos that the trailers gave us.The next twenty minutes or so of this are great as we are thrown right into the middle of it and the effect is dizzying but yet very real. Many have compared this to the Blair Witch Project in its gimmick (the discovered ""real"" tape watched after the event) but this is not the gimmick that I think Cloverfield is built on. Instead the film relies heavily on the fact that we have all watched the news in the last two years and will have experienced many ""real"" events through the eyes of camera-phones and shaky-handed survivors as they are replayed on the network news programmes. This is a clever and effective gimmick and it is one that is at its strongest when it is making the action and attack the focus.Sadly the gimmick does not work as well when it is trying to hold a narrative together because this is not what we are used to. Of course it doesn't help that the story is not that great. I didn't really want a mission back into the city and it did feel like the plot had been come up with to try and ensure ongoing action in the danger-zones rather than everyone running away. Massive coincidences ensure this feels more clunky and obvious than it should and, outside of the most intense scenes, you do feel it. The fact that I didn't like the characters was probably a bit of an obstacle to me as well. It is not just that they are young, it is that they are impossibly beautiful people who live wonderful lives in a wonderful city; it would not have hurt to have had a bit of diversity in the group to try and reduce this but then I suppose the makers know who their target audience are. The cast of mostly unknowns deliver well enough in terms of running and being frightened convincingly while looking attractive but the film is not about them and they are annoying at the times when the detail of their problems become the focus. I did like that the film treat them all as equally disposable though.Reeves directs the action really well though and is helped by tremendous special effects that manage to feel real whether it is the destruction of buildings or a massive lizardy creature being fired on by jets. Indeed this is what the film is best at as it recreates the feeling of fear and destruction that we all experienced on television on 11th September 2001. Overall then this is why it is worth seeing  for the parts where the city is being destroyed and we are simply stuck in the middle of it all; just a shame that the characters and story seem to get in the way more than that they enhance the experience.",,Anonymous,Horror
Rip-roaringly entertaining,"In this rip-roaring, home-movie styled monster movie a group of teenager partying for the departure of one their closest friends find themselves amid a blaze of destruction when a giant 'thing' starts ripping the city to shreds.

Although the shaky camera and choice of the 1st person view may put off some viewers who suffer from motion sickness, Cloverfield for the most part is barnstorming entertainment, fully exploiting the resources available to it. The idea to shoot entirely from some poor sap's camera is not entirely original, dating back to the Italian cannibal movies of the early 80s.

Scared the S___ out of me!,"The filmmakers effect of course is that as you watch the handy cam footage, you experience what the protagonists experience.The core of the story is the first bit of video with ""Rob"" and ""Beth"" - Two new, non-familiar non-Hollywood faces, faces you will meet at any party like the party ""Hud"" was filming. Well, not like that particular party.But it takes an invasion by some unknown thing to tell the tale. It also takes the side-story about a Rave-Gone-Bad, which started to go bad the moment ""Hud"" got the camera. Personally, I would have killed ""Hud"" at the start of the film, but we needed Hud to lug the Camera around.This film uses the Hitchcock-ian method of filming with almost NO CUTS as in ""Rope"" and ""Under Capricorn"" - But with the added Handy-Cam kind of footage- This brings the film into an incredible level of first-person experience... Because WE become Hud as Hud films the events of the evening- So we see what Hud sees, and also what the camera sees.At first viewing, we have no initial idea what is happening, no warning, and we are not sure until we see a huge TAIL. And we have not a clue as to why the heads of Statues of Liberties are being flung as if they were crumpled aluminum foil projectiles, and we are teased like that all through the film, a lot of things we see are not really explained. Matt Reeves builds the picture, step by step, and to great effect.But what it comes down to... THIS is probably the GREATEST Monster Movie made in 25 years, not since the Original Alien- As Alien had the Chest Burster scene, this film has...Never mind what it has. I won't tell you, you have to SEE it- New York City has NEVER been Tokyo-Trashed like THIS... And while Tokyo has Godzilla, New York has Clover!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A good thrill ride.,"Basically a melding of ""Godzilla"" and ""The Blair Witch Project"", this high-concept movie is a better than usual example of what has come to be known as the ""found footage"" genre. Whatever it may lack in character development or storytelling skill is made up for by a nonstop sense of excitement. It just thrusts characters and the audience alike into a horrifying situation that nobody can explain and seemingly with little to no chance for escape. It starts out mildly and then around the 18 minute mark it abruptly shifts gears. It's genuinely spooky at times and features a monster that is frightening in its capacity for violence, not to mention its immense *size*. Director Matt Reeves and company, working from Drew Goddards' script, follow conventional wisdom in showing this thing just a bit at a time, gearing up for the big reveal.The story starts out as a group of friends in Manhattan have a farewell party for one of their number, Rob (Michael Stahl-David), who's moving on to a job in Japan. But things go seriously awry when this monster shows up and creates chaos and panic. While the military works feverishly to try to take the monster down and evacuate the citizens, Rob and his friends embark on a mission to locate and rescue Beth (Odette Annable); all the while, the character of ""Hud"" (T.J. Miller), who was given a video camera to record testimonials at this party, insists on documenting the unfolding events.One good thing is that, at least from this viewers' perspective, the six main characters are basically likable even as they attempt something that looks foolish and suicidal. Once the action starts, it achieves a respectable intensity level, although there are quieter moments when our protagonists desperately try to take a breather. The special effects are generally decent (the image of the Statue of Liberty's head in a street is a memorable one), and the monster itself is amusingly designed and completely bad ass.If one can stomach the overactive camera work (a bone of contention for many who've seen it), ""Cloverfield"" does manage to be a solidly enjoyable thriller.Seven out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
2008 reviews vs 2018 reviews,"I get a kick out of reading the early reviews of 2008... interesting to read the sensitivities people expressed here when comparing the movie to 9/11.
Things are different in 2018.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Cloverfield,"Cloverfield 6/10 The opening twenty minutes of the film might hold the dullest scenes in any movie I've seen. The party provides nothing to the movie, no good character development, interesting dialog or purpose. It's a terrible party I'd leave in real life. Getting past those initial scenes and into the bulk of the monster film is well worth the wait. The fact that the monster is never shown right away is a great tease, which builds up the wanting to see more throughout the film. The monster itself looks realistically clammy and the little monster fleas that come off of it are a great little twist into the equation. The destruction scenes by the movie are great and so are the military action effects. The story, dialog, and action scenes improve as the movie goes forth. Although the ending is typical of a giant monster film its filmed well and tops of the hopeless feeling perfectly.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Original,"Cloverfield made me curious when it came out. The whole thing with the film-makers not wanting to give anything away before the release has been done before. And the other similarities to ""Godzilla"" were also worrying... But i chose to ignore them and feel curious nevertheless. Cloverfield looked it had something pretty unique to offer. But you never know until you actually watch it.And was it unique? Both yes and no i guess. The whole ""monster attacks New York""-thing is old as King Kong. But Cloverfield did have a few things to offer that sets it apart from most other movies. First of all the whole home-movie style works pretty well. We only get to see what the people in the movie see, nothing else. It creates both a sense of urgency and actually being there. That was a good move. I might also mention that the camera work is still not that bad considering it's supposed to be handy-cam. The picture is clear, the effects are really good and there is very little of nausea i can feel sometimes when the camera is waved around a lot.There are however a few things that i didn't like as much. While Cloverfield highlights the way the feel of a movie can really benefit from an unusual approach (handycams), it also shows one of the classic weaknesses of horror movies. Namely the monster itself. I'm afraid it works just as bad as it did in Godzilla. In the end the movie is also a more or less standardized action movie with a more interesting presentation.I did like Cloverfield fairly well. I think there are things that could have been done better. Not least the monster (how hard can it be?) and also it could have been more experimental with the story, like it was with the presentation of the story. But in the end this movie is pretty original and i did enjoy it. I think it's good to see something that at least tries to break the mold a little bit. I rate it 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Ultimate monster experience,"This is a superb monster movie. It's scary, mysterious, menacing and looks amazing. The fact it's all filmed in a video camera style is not going to be to everyone's taste but I think it adds an extra edge to the movie and makes it a more authentic experience. Whilst the characters aren't totally interesting, and a little stereo typical you feel their terror and desperation to get to friends and to safety. I love how the creature was kept a secret before release, how it teases your imagination for its existence and is completely forced upon them out of the blue. The creature itself gets screen time progresively, leaving an air of mystery but you get more than a glimpse. There are some memorable moments in this movie and its one of my favourites to rewatch.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good Idea,"Perhaps the first viewers of this movie in 2022 will not be impressed. But I liked it. Even though the script was weak, all the power went to the technical team and I think they did a good job. I think it would be a great idea to shoot such a story film with a hand camera. Yes, it's obvious that some of the effects in the movie are bad today, but it was good for that year. Anyway, overall I liked the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good Found-Footage/Kaiju Film,"This was film I was intrigued by when I first heard of it as I'm a big fan of kaiju/giant monster films. My first viewing for this one was right after college. I enjoyed it then. I've now given it a few viewings for different reasons. Once to show my now wife to gauge her interest in found footage. I've seen it for the People's Council on the Podcast Under the Stairs. Most recently I watched it with the commentary on of the director Matt Reeves for a bit more insight behind the movie. The official synopsis is a group of friends venture deep into the streets of New York on a rescue mission during a rampaging monster attack.It starts off telling us that the footage we are about to watch is from the area now know as 'Cloverfield'. It is formerly known as Central Park. The footage begins with a guy in an apartment overlooking the area. He goes into the bedroom where we see Beth McIntyre (Odette Annable). The man is Rob Hawkins (Michael Stahl-David). They plan their day together going to Coney Island.The footage then shifts to Lily Ford (Jessica Lucas). She is with her boyfriend, getting things ready for a party that night. His name is Jason (Mike Vogel) and he is Rob's brother. Rob is leaving for Japan for a new job and they are throwing a going away party. They don't realize they are filming over the great day that Rob and Beth spent together.Back Rob's apartment, Hudson 'Hud' Platt (T. J. Miller) is convinced to film the party and to get people to say on their goodbyes on tape. They give a surprise to Rob and he had no idea. He starts to ask about Beth. She shows up with a new guy, upsetting Rob. All the while, Hud is trying to get the attention of Marlena Diamond (Lizzy Caplan) and figuring out what is going on between his best friend and Beth.Things take quite the turn though when an earthquake hits or what they think is one. They turn on the news to hear about a ship capsized in the harbor and then rush up to the roof to see it. There's another earthquake followed by an explosion that sends debris their way. Everyone flees the building. Outside they see a giant monster that moves past and the head of the Statue of Liberty rolls down the street. They decide their best chance is to get off the island. This all changes when Rob gets a call from Beth. She's trapped in her apartment and he decides to try to save her. This won't be easy with this giant monster and the things that fall off it that are also alive.I knew from the first time that I liked it. This one got better though with rewatches. The first thing that struck me is the emotion of this film. It starts off as a good drama. I love the editing of the happy day that Rob and Beth had together, with the reality of where they are today. Building that emotion in the beginning makes sense as to why he is risking his life for her, especially since he messed it up. To be honest, this is something that I've thought about on a regular basis if something like this happened around me. I was a big fan of that aspect and it also helps us connect with our characters.The next thing was that I for whatever reason thought they really didn't show the monster much. I was wrong about that. We get to see the monster quite a bit. Making this film found footage is interesting as well, since we get to see it from the perspective of what it would be like trying to survive this. That is what the filmmakers were going for and I feel like they nailed it. It sets it apart. The group does some stupid things, but if they don't, we don't get to see all of things that happen. When thinking about though, there's a chance I would make some of these same mistakes in a panic. There are some interesting set pieces as well.There is a section where the surviving members of the group have a run in with the military. I love what happens to Marlena during this stretch as I found it intriguing. Everything happens in one night, so they wouldn't have the answers yet. It was noteworthy how this plays out for sure. I did have a bit of an issue that the military letting them go and allowing them to film as much as they do. Not sure that they would, but the only thing would be the humanity of the military officer which could cause him to break protocol. He probably wouldn't be found out so there is that since this is all haphazard.Now the only issue I have with this film goes back to the found footage aspect. I believe that Hud would keep the camera and continue filming. It is even more prevalent today that we would film things around us like he is. This is a major event and will change the course of history. We see that when people come up to the head of the Statue of Liberty. There are others with their camera phones. There are just times where I'm like; wouldn't you put the camera down here? It just makes it implausible that you would risk yourself to just keep filming. This doesn't hurt the film, but it is an issue with found footage. I will say that he's awkward and to be honest, I see a bit of myself there. I could legit see him continuing. He also adds comedy with things he says.This brings me to the pacing, which I think is great. The film doesn't waste any time. The introduction of the characters is good and it doesn't take too long. We continue to learn about each one as they try to survive this event. I dug that aspect of the film. Rob becomes the catalyst for what they are doing and I thought it was interesting how it presents his issue and how he grows from it. I thought the ending was good and bringing us to how the footage was found. I dug making what was filmed confidential and that the government has confiscated it. Going along with that, you'd assume that New York is made safe at some point, but we don't learn the outcome of this event.Acting was something else that was good. It is crazy that quite a few of these actors have gone on to do other things and this shows their potential. Caplan is solid as the outsider. She brings sarcasm and I thought her role was good. Lucas is interesting and her frustration was fitting. She is a good friend throughout. Miller also brings humor. His character isn't that different from his in Deadpool. I love his nervous tick to just talk, especially about inappropriate things as that would be me. I like his banter with Marlena. Stahl-David is good. He is kind of the hero and I thought his growth was solid. I just love that he's scared to fail and can completely understand it. That is part of the burden he needs to overcome. Vogel was also solid as his brother. Annable is gorgeous and it is just a shame she wasn't in the film more. I'm also a big fan of her. It does well at making you care about these characters, so when some of them die, you feel something. The rest of the cast round out the film for what they needed as well.Next would be the effects of the film. To bring a monster like this to life, you must go CGI, which I thought looked great. The monster looks real and the things they have it doing are as well. There are a few moments where it doesn't hold up, but very little. As I said earlier, I was surprised how much they do show the monster, but also how quickly or being shown from a distance as well. The setting is also great to make New York look as empty as everyone is trying to flee. That is an underrated aspect of the film as well. The cinematography is very well done for being found footage. It does make you feel like you are there. I did learn that the quick shows and using the Steadicam helped this. They didn't need to flesh out more of the monster since we aren't seeing from different angles. It made since listening to the special features for this.The score is something else that can be tricky in a film like this. The only music I remember was at the party and it felt like we were there. The rest of the sound design was good to make it feel as real as possible. You get the sounds of monster, the army fighting back and just buildings falling part. It is done ambient, so it builds that realism.Now with that said, I'm glad I gave this one a few rewatches. I knew that I liked it the first time, but I can confirm this is good. As a fan of giant monster films, this feels real. Going with found footage like they did makes it feel like this is happening and the realism is great. I thought the acting, effects and sound design were good. The low running time and editing of the film keep the tension building to a satisfying conclusion. I even like the beginning being somewhat of a drama helps us to like the characters and care about what happens to them. If you don't like found footage, I would avoid this. If that's not the case, I think this is a good movie, especially if you like giant monster films. I'd recommend giving this one a viewing and it does hold up to multiple viewings.My Rating: 8.5 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
It's all about the monster,"It took me some time to finally see Cloverfield despite it was pretty hyped movie when it originally came out. The reason was, I really didn't like the style that was shown in the trailers. And now, after seeing it, I still don't like the style, but the movie has aspects in it, that makes some of it a fun watch. Though, I did find the movie a bit boring, despite it was trying so hard to be frantic and portray a feeling of a great urgency. And that isn't a good thing, as the movie isn't that long either.The scenes I'm talking here are of course the scenes of destruction and pretty much everything the monster of the movie has a bigger part in. The destruction of Manhattan is fantastically done and the monster itself is just glorious, even in the close shots it looks stunningly real. The monster is the real star of the movie and the way it has been executed manages to save a lot in this story.While it's a good thing the movie wasn't centered around some standard gun ho military personnel trying to kill the beast, I didn't warm up to the pretty forced plot line of good bye party turned into a rescue mission of one true love.The actors are surprisingly pretty good, but honestly, this movie works only because there's a huge monster mashing things around.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Cloverfield,"If you're a misanthrope or a pedant (ideally both, obviously) then prepare to have a field day with this one.A steadily decreasing number of impossibly pretty and wealthy New York twenty-somethings scramble around Manhatten island as it is briskly destroyed both by a gigantic, unseen creature of some kind, and the US military, who are trying to kill it. There's a very rough through-line involving a missing ex-girlfriend, but as far as story goes, thats your lot.The film's premise and plot are all riddled with more holes than you'd find in a very productive tea-bag factory; the central conceit - that the entire movie is composed of home video footage shot by a civilian luddite - is visually and conceptually inconsistent; and if the story's decision to focus on a set of characters who are almost profoundly unlikeable is the injury, then a light smattering of utterly diabolical acting is the insult.But you simply can't argue with populist film-making this effective. The shocks pull no punches and hit home every time, the aura of suspense and expectation is ferocious and beautifully maintained, the effects are outstanding, and at barely 70 minutes minus credits, it is as tight as a duck's sphincter.Love it, hate it, relentlessly rip the pish out of it... just make sure you watch it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

The Cloverfield Experience,"Cloverfield. Brought to you by Nokia.The best way for me to describe Cloverfield, in the simplest terms is, part Godzilla, part Blair Witch Project, part War Of The Worlds. Of course many, as I did, will know that going in. I didn't expect however, for it to be the best parts of those movies.It should be noted that many have mistakenly called this a J.J. Abrams movie. Really, it's not. Any good in this film should be credited to the actual director Matt Reeves and writer Drew Goddard. Who's previous writing credits include Lost, Angel, Alias, and Buffy TV.As I started to see more and more trailers for Cloverfield before its release, I feared it would become Dawson's Creek meets Godzilla. For the first 10 minutes, I started to feel that was where it was going. Until the first 'shake'. Then it became a full fledged giant monster rampage flick and it never let go. But I will admit that it had the copy paste guy meets girl, guy looses girl, guy saves girl, elements that plagued the Transformers movie. Big difference is Lili Mirojnick, even though she had less screen time, had more substance than Megan Fox in Transformers.Cloverfield clocks in at only 84 minutes. But it is a tight film that gave me just enough of everything to be satisfying. For me, it's the first time a giant monster rampage flick gave me that feeling of having lived what I saw on screen. It did this by never breaking from the first person camcorder format. At first the jerky camera was a little jarring, but my eyes quickly adjusted.When 911 happened I kept my VCR recording for almost a week 24 hours a day. A lot of Cloverfield reminded me of the amateur video that was shot then. But the film seems to try to avoid the comparison. Since nobody on screen, that I can remember, ever associates the two events. Even though in real life, I bet that everyone there would state, 'it's like 911 all over again!' When remembering that 911 footage, it helped me justify some parts when the camera guy didn't point the camera at the action. A few times I thought, 'point the camera at the monster you idiot!' But I remembered times in my own life, when using a camcorder, I found myself watching one thing, and pointing the camera at something else. Of course I wasn't being attacked by Mothra.For the reasons I loved Cloverfield, my twelve year old son hated it. There are no winners. No Rambo stunts. No wrap up with a pretty bow. No explanation as to why or how. I don't want to give away anything. But this isn't a happy movie.I predict that another version of this film will be released in theaters, with additional footage, if it is the success they hope it to be. I know I want to see it again on the big screen and additional footage could fill the seats a second time. The DVD release will be interesting. Since watching this version, I felt there was even more carnage they wanted to show. But they wanted that PG-13 rating. Wise or not. I don't know.The oddest thing about the Cloverfield Experience was the audience reaction afterword. Full theater....dead quiet. I know I was quiet because in my head I was thinking, 'Wow. I just lived that.' But I wondered how many there thought, 'What the hell was that?' While watching the film, I kept wondering how it was going to end. How would they eventually break that fourth wall. Since the film began as though it were a video feed stating, Property Of The United States Government. My son turned to me and thought there was something wrong with the movie. It ended much in the same way. But eventually, when the credits did roll, the Cloverfield Overture 'Roar!' played. Loudly. That piece of music kept me in the theater until the last credit. Just before the Paramount card shows at the end, I could hear a faint voice. I am not sure what it said. But it gave me that last bit of creepiness.I would recommend all my friends see this on the best screen with best sound system as soon as possible. So they could enjoy the Cloverfield Experience as I did. Since calling this a movie in the traditional sense would be a false representation.Have some fun. Go Live Cloverfield!",,Anonymous,Horror
Seriously?,"Im giving this film a 1 out of 10 Because there was one good thing about this film ..when it ended""oh my god, oh my god"".... shut up!The actors were too obviously trying to act normal, and this did not work - because they could not actThere was absolutely no mystery - we knew straight away that there was a monster and there was nothing else to find outAnd it looked cheap although they probably spent millions on all the special effectsI want my money back",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A fun 90 mins,"I was expecting this movie to be a bit more scary. That's my main gripe. Nothing really bad happens to the characters (on screen) so no real fear is conjured up. It's scary in the same way the movie 'Earthquake' was scary, ie. like a disaster movie, not a horror movie.This might be your bag but I needed more to make me feel the fear I would have, had I have been in NYC during the onslaught.The fx are great and I think future monster movies will use more of this first-person approach to drive home realism. The monster is killer.The acting's *ok* and doesn't really let the film down but is questionable in places of high emotion. Towards the end, I just yearned to watch people get eaten or something.To sum up: a fun 90 mins but didn't knock my socks off.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Go see it.,"Like a demon roller coaster ride from hell! Like ""The Host"" but far superior. Better visual effects and incredible sound. Also nice to see that WETA isn't the only effects company worth its salt. The first person perspective will probably be THE definitive way these films will be made from this moment. If only these guys had gotten behind ""Doom"". One warning: If the ""The Blair Witch Project"" made you experience some motion sickness - this one will spin you onto the floor. They should have safety belts with this ride. Intensity-wise, heed the PG13 warning if you have youngins', it's a little too full throttle for most tots.The box office on this one is going to far outweigh the monster.

With Hud's own eyes,"Starting with the fabled 16th century ""chain map"" of Florence, Rennaissance draughtsmen would place likenesses of themselves, sketchpad and feather in hand, in the foreground of their cityscapes. These tiny self-portraits act as warrants of authenticity: they had been on site to see their subjects first hand. Similarly, Matt Reeves makes us believe that we witness a monster attack on Manhattan through the lens of a party-goer's hand-held video camera. To authenticate the footage, he has Hudson ""Hud"" Platt (first-time screen actor T.J. Miller) shoot flashes of his own face at regular intervals, exactly the way the draughtsmen inserted themselves into their designs. The camera tilts and jiggles to suggest Hud is actually filming this as he runs from a very ill-tempered lizard the size of the Chrysler building. But the crystal-clear footage is on 35mm film, not videotape, and of course the jiggling isn't at all like the shakes of ""real"" hand-held video. But what's real anyway? The whole thing is an illusion, fabricated to corroborate an illusion. This is also how this is different from ""The Blair Witch Project"", which was actually (mostly) shot on video. ""Cloverfield"" starts out as a fully-fledged rich kid relationship drama. Until the monster hits town some 20 minutes later, you can't even be sure you're in the right movie. All in all, I think it's pretty clever for a mainstream thriller. Oh, and Lizzy Kaplan is very hot in the part of Hud's love interest, deadpan beauty Marlena Diamond.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
This film is like the Yankees,"So you are either going to love this film or hate it. I personally loved it. I was on the edge of my seat cringing for most of the movie and the seen with the helicopter was genius... I felt like I was there and it even made me a little dizzy (which I liked). If you like roller coasters basically you will like this movie. It was completely different than the Blair Witch Project and comparing it to such a crappy film would be a huge disservice. In my opinion the acting and personalities in the film hit right at home and Hud reminded me of that annoyingly funny friend that we all have and love. I also felt like the movie did not sell out by giving up its ""first person"" experience. Some people will say the movie was nauseating but it just made it that more intense... shooting this movie any other way wouldn't have been the same. The only flaw I could think of is the battery life of the camera. However, most cameras have a battery life longer than an hour and 40 minutes... isn't that how long the movie was? It clearly show the camera getting shut off and turned back on later. None the less there are still going to be those people that are never satisfied with anything and can't stand change so I can't guarantee everyone liking this movie as much as me and the people I went to see it with.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"It Came From ... Who knows, who cares?","Okay, once again it seems as if I missed out on a gigantic hype and once more I do not at all seem to comprehend the huge success of this superficially attractive but eventually bland and substantially void hybrid between an amateur YouTube video and a massively budgeted monster flick. The short trailers and secretive teaser clips didn't miss their effect, as ""Cloverfield"" quickly became one of the most anticipated movies ever, but does the finished product really live up to the beforehand promoted hype? That's a big fat ""NO"", in my humble opinion, because all I saw was an overlong (at barely 85 minutes, can you imagine), preposterous and pretentious blockbuster with very few redeeming qualities. This isn't a monster movie at all. Admittedly I might be a bit biased because I swear by the monster flicks and alien invasion movies from the fifties and early sixties, but at least they were charming and spectacular in a non-exploitative fashion. For the action and mayhem in their film ""Cloverfield"", Matt Reeves and Drew Goddard obviously cash in on the fear & paranoia caused by the 9/11 tragedy. People nervously and hectically force their way through collapsing skyscrapers and giant clouds of dust, unaware of what happened exactly, yet they resolutely continue to register their own misery and agony on a digital hand-held camera. That's like shamelessly promoting voyeurism and gratuitously manipulating people's deepest fears. And yet, whenever parts of buildings are falling down for (still) unknown reasons, ""Cloverfield"" is a tremendously boring film! Especially the wraparound story prior to the first big bang is almost intolerable dull and overlong. A bunch of irritating twenty-something people gather in someone's Manhattan apartment for a goodbye party and it seems to go on forever. Nobody cares about their romantic issues and the more they open their mouths, the dumber they appear, anyway. Particularly Hud, the guy operating the camera through tick and thin, makes some of the dumbest remarks I've ever heard. The continuously shaky camera wasn't as bad as everyone said, and at several times it clearly noticeable that professional cinematographers are holding the device instead of one of the players. I understand that, since J.J Abrams pumped quite a lot of budget into fancy digital effects that had to be shown at least a bit properly. The eventual nature of the menace actually raises more questions than it provides answers and logic and its design is not the least bit impressive. Rudimentary the concept of ""Cloverfield"" has a lot in common with the much better Korean monster-highlight ""The Host""; only the latter didn't cause motion sickness to any of its viewers of course. ""The Host"" is just far superior. First and foremost the monster looks more original, the character drawings are more realistic and likable and the production doesn't purely thrive on pretension.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Cloverfield was neither a ""classic"" or a ""bust""...Its just very good!","OK, I had to write my review of this film because I see a lot of people bashing it.

""If you go into this movie thinking its going to be the greatest movie ever, then the chances are you will be disappointed, because its not even close..But if your like me and just want to take a break from artsy indie flicks and just want to be entertained and not think too much in a film, then you will be very pleased with ""Cloverfield"". People complain that it leaves way too many questions unanswered, but HELLO THATS THE WHOLE POINT OF THE MOVIE. I will say that if you suffer from motion sickness then think twice because the camera angles are just crazy, but for everyone else go see this movie. Solid entertainment!

Wow was that disappointing -  Rent or bring a vomit bag,"I went with my father to this movie. ( No I am not 10. I am 30 and my father is much older.) He loves monster movies and the first words out of his mouth were ""That was really disappointing"".Whoever said that shaking a camera around through the entire movie should be banned from movie making for life(JJ Abrams). This was a little too artistic and shows that the producer is full of himself and won't let anyone enjoy the movie. This is essentially a home movie of people running around in NY for an hour and 5-7 minutes of big and little monster shots.The whole point of a giant monster movie is to see a giant monster. That's what all the fuss was about and why you paid $11. Oh yeah, the movie is only like 1 hour and 20 minutes. You only get to really see the monster the last 20 minutes of the movie. My suggestion is to go to another movie across the hall until for an hour go into Coverfield, to see the monster, and then go back to a better movie.You only really see the monster in in about 5% of the movie. When you do see him the camera is out of focus and only shows the monster for a brief second. You also only see glimpses until the end. Really ticked me off.The best part in the middle of the movie is when these parasite spider looking things attack the characters in the subway. Of course you can't really make them out either because the characters are running away from them and shaking !#$* out of the camera. (I turned green at this point)This could have been a good monster movie if they shot it like a normal movie instead of a 13 year old, and if they had focused on the monster and parasites a lot more. The whole ""it's more intimate"" thing doesn't belong in a big monster movie. That's for girl flicks that my wife loves like Sense and Sensibility.Is the monster cool and realistic? Yes it is.Was it worth all of the other crap to see the monster at the end.Not for $11.What does the monster look like?It is really hard to describe. It looks like a giant hairless cat, but it's front legs are really long and inverted so it walks almost like a bat. Also it has multiple limbs underneath like a crab and a really long tail. I t is not a giant whale looking thing.Are there parasites coming off of the monster?Yes and they look like a cross between a spider and a crab. They do start to eat people. You see them 3 times alive. One shot of a dead specimen being carted away by some soldiers. This dead shot is the best shot.Just trust me and wait for it to come out on video so you can fast forward through the shaking and lame moments.",,Anonymous,Horror
I'm still waiting...,"for this film to have a main event occur, i don't know if it was just me or that the film was just a buildup for nothing. The plot that the group was out to save beth was just too thing and when they eventually reached beth it did not feel like a significant event and u just kept hoping for more, sadly it didn't deliver. Don't get me wrong the film was good, well done, original idea, very suspenseful but it just left me wanting something else. There was just something not there. I do recommend it however, well filmed, original, great set pieces, just lacking some pizazz. 6/10 :) This is just a line of text so if your reading please ignore :)",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
really great action movie,"I really enjoyed this film with my 17-year-old son. Some of the movie is expected, some of it is not. I thought it was an awesome action movie and appropriate for 13+ year olds on up (depending on how your young teen handles some very brief violence and blood, and how you feel about your child hearing the world sh*t quite often -- go to www.commonsensemedia.org to get the full low-down for parent decisions). We had been forewarned about the handicam unsteadiness of the film, so we sat in the back of the theatre so we wouldn't get queasy. But then, later I thought it wasn't that bad and any seat (except way up front) would have been fine. JJ Abrams has proved once again how ingenious he is -- go see this movie and have fun!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A great marketing campaign for a great monster flick!,"After browsing the net for the very best of viral marketing campaigns, I found myself hooked on the back story involving the fake oil company that awoke the monster in this movie, and I just had to view it again and I am so glad I did. If only I had been actively pursuing the campaign before the movie was released! And what a great looking monster, along with the parasites that apparently spawn off of it. The actors do a great job in this of showing how terrifying the entire experience is and the sheer state of shock really flows off of them well. A great monster movie and definitely something I can see myself watching again in the future!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
I saw it.  I's alive.  It's huge.,"i absolutely loved this movie. i thought the monster was awesome, i liked the story, i ended up loving the way in which it was filmed (which i was skeptical about at first), and was overall very satisfied.however, here's what i've learned from the people around me that i will warn you about: 1. don't go into this movie expecting to see a film all about the monster. there's a good amount of the monster in it, but this isn't Godzilla.2. realize that this movie is told through the eyes of the people living through it. it's a documentary. i heard complaints about the ending, lack of explanation, etc. to which i reply, ""get over it."" those were two of the things i liked BEST about the movie.3. know what you're going to see. i overheard plenty in the audience before the movie started saying they had no idea what it was about. way to go, jackasses. maybe you shouldn't be seeing it then, 'ey?",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Horror made differently, works out well in the end","I do believe this is one of those movies you either love or hate. For me, it was a breath of fresh air. It was realistic in a way unexpected for a horror/sci-fi flick. It must have been a combination of the first person camera view, along with the acting, which I found to be way above average, since the actors made their fight for survival seem real. You were in for the ride, right besides the protagonists; and what a ride it was. I won't go into any details because the purpose of this review is to make more people go see it and I wouldn't want to spoil anything for them. When all hell broke loose, I felt absolutely submerged in the action, almost like playing a really realistic first person shooter. This movie certainly brought something new to a somewhat aging genre. It's not even about the monsters and people getting killed, it is about changing your point of view and showing you how things can be done differently and still work out in the end, to bring you an emotional thrill ride. Having in mind the budget, I really don't know how they made it work this well, this gem of a movie is up there with the best of them. To sum it up, this movie is great and I thoroughly enjoyed watching it.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

A fireball explodes on the distant horizon. A power failure follows.

Lives up to the hype,"So I just got back from possibly the most hyped movie of 2007, and 2008 thus far, (before Indiana Jones 4!!) and it amazed me. I almost don't know how to explain it. The entire movie was shot using only a hand-held camcorder, high definition, yes, but hand-held consumer quality nonetheless. Some people may criticize this, but I don't see how the story could have been presented any other way. Oh, and the story, nothing I've ever seen before, it felt un- scripted. But was it a bad thing? No. It wasn't like a bad Uwe Boll movie, but the whole feel of it was that this was actually someone taping the events as they unfolded. As far as the story goes...it starts off at a going away party for a friend, the camera man ""Hud"" is given a camera, and told to take confessions of all the friends at the party, and, not to spoil the movie, an explosion erupts from the center of Manhattan. The crowd guns it outside to the streets, only to catch the statue of liberty's head landing right in front of them. OK, if you aren't already hooked, then stop reading. Anyway the entire time I felt as if this was really a tape found by the US Military (as it was pretending to be). Sorry, I'm gonna stop there I got carried away. And because it was made to look as an amateur video, the camera is constantly shaky, and usually out of focus. The funniest part was before the movie when a staff member told the audience of this fact, and actually offered a refund in the next 30 minutes. All I can do now is wait and see how long it takes for a video of someone taping an already video taped movie, to be uploaded to the internet. As a ending note, many people compared this to the Blair Witch Project, which was also filmed entirely with a hand-held camera, to give the more personal and real effect. I don't know if this had anything to do with that movie, but a line near the end read ""I'm so scared."" A line almost the same, and made famous by BWP, ""I'm so scared I could cry"". I didn't.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not as good as people say,"After all the hype me and a couple of friends decided to go watch Cloverfield a few weeks earlier, and I have to say I was not that impressed. First of all, all the shaking and the bad camera work was not nauseating that's all just an exaggeration. But what really bothered me is that the character holding the camera (conveniently called HUD or Heads Up Display) wasted most of his time filming people and soldiers running around rather than the monster itself, I found this very annoying and quite stupid. The quarter of the movie is in a party, an extremely boring party might I add. At the end of the movie i felt kind of unsatisfied for numerous reasons. by the end of the movie nothing was clarified, I felt that the hole movie was just a big publicity stunt for the producers to make more money out of the sequel. The monster itself was very good and extremely cool, I did however recommend Cloverfield to my brother but I told him not to expect much. It is very over-hyped and they try to pass this movie as something that it is not like I told my brother it's just another monster movie nothing more.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Doesn't perform miracles. Does entertain.,"Cloverfield won't change your life. It might make you puke in a movie theater, which I guess could be life-changingly embarrassing, but aside from that you'll leave this film the same person as when you entered.That said, it does what it sets out to do admirably.The first few minutes of action are extremely intense, very heavily evoking 9/11 memories for better or for worse. The film keeps a fast pace from that point on, but never again recreates those initial moments of fear.The characters are likable, realistic young New Yorkers who are established ~quickly~ and effectively. Their behavior throughout the film fall somewhere short of realistic and there is heroism to a degree that seems sometimes unbelievable, and yet... people do heroic things in times of crisis. I'm inclined to believe that some people (not most people, but some) would indeed do what our main characters do.The ""camera work"" is a mixed bag. It's sometimes very effective and fun (the beginning and the military scenes are stand outs). It's also frustrating at times, and occasionally feels like it's try to save budget by not showing us what we obviously want to see. Overall I think it works in Cloverfield -- it gives the film a unique sense of immersion -- but I would not want to see this approach overused. It will become one-note very quickly.Without giving too much away: the ending is a shock. It will leave some viewers frustrated and others impressed. I was impressed. I thought it was ballsy and unique, and I appreciate its purity. I do not blame people for being annoyed by it, however.Overall I enjoyed Cloverfield. It's a rush. It's funny and honest and likable. It's different. Give it a look, but temper your expectations: it's just an action flick, folks.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
will there be a cloverfield 2 ?   i think so,"I'll keep this quick cuz i don't want to give anything away from the movie. i personally loved this movie, the only one bad thing that can be said about it; is that it can cause motion sickness lol. the whole movie was filmed in a personal cam format, that can get annoying to some people but i think was done to add to the suspense of not knowing what it is. the less you see the more that is left to the imagination.I want to let everyone know to go into this movie with an open mind, i don't think any big budget movie has ever been filmed like this and it definitely pushes the norm of the movies we are used to. just like J.J. abrams ""lost"" this movie will keep u guessing even after its over, and who knows maybe we will see a cloverfield 2. at the end of the credits there is a quick comment made that sounds like ""what now"", but if played backwards says ""its still alive"" but who knows.link to credit track backwards can be found on IMDb's message board, tell me what you think",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Get the hell over your need to be spoon fed your horror, then you might like this film","I saw Cloverfield last night and I have a few things to say, so I figured what better place to say em.First, if you're the type that gets motion sick, wait for the DVD. I'm completely serious. This is a rough film for those who get motion sick and while I want everyone to see it, I don't want it to be lumped in with a nauseous stomach in folks' memories. And if you push it and go ahead and go, just the first 10 minutes of Hud's crappy video technique is gonna have you ralphing in the aisles.Next, to those of you who are prepared to hate this movie because you think the marketing/game was dumb: Get your heads out of your behinds. It's been a breath of fresh air to have something different in film to look forward to. If you want things to stay the same, keep pumping your money into classics like ""This Christmas"" and ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" and let the real movie fans have the good seats.Look, Cloverfield ain't a Disney ride type horror film. You don't see people cutting off their arms, legs whatever to get away from a murderer. You don't have some maniac chainsawing coeds into pieces. This is a thinking' man's (and woman's) monster movie. And if you take a few minutes to THINK about WHAT they were trying to convey with this movie, you might just like it a little better.I have had to listen to so many nasty comments about this movie being ""stupid"" or ""gay"" from so many ignorant folks I'm about ready to barf. I'm not disgusted by the opinions these people have. I'm disgusted by their need to have story spelled out in detail in order to enjoy it. The movie going public has, in a large part, become so used to cut and dried stories with a beginning middle and end (which this one really did have if you pay the heck attention to the frigging thing) where everything is cut and dried that when they're shown something like this, which is basically a teeny tiny cut of a teeny tiny portion of an attack on a major city, they don't know how to react and immediately dislike it.Look people, this movie is the monster film equivalent to 1. If someone had a handy cam with them when heading out on a trip where the plane crashes and kept the thing running all the way into the ground. 2. (I apologize for the 9/11 analogy. Gods, so many people have done this but it's kinda true) If someone had their handy cam with em on 9/11 and taped their own efforts to get out of the building and the cam was found but they weren't.It's a split second view of what it was like for these yuppies, many of whom have probably never really faced true fear before, who got caught up in this weird, terrifying situation. The beginning is just to get you an idea of who these people are. The rest is a documentary of their fight to stay alive.That said, I plan to smack the next person who says they didn't see enough of the monster. WTF are you ON idiot???? I bet these people didn't understand Psycho or any Hitchcock film since he didn't shove folks face into the blood and gore.You get to see plenty of the monster: Just as much as the actual characters saw which is the frigging point! And, to be honest, that last scene where you get up close and damned personal with the monster, that was PLENTY for me! Between that scene and the parasites, I was THRILLED with the monster stuff in this movie.To be honest, I'm glad some folks hate this movie. Because those who do ain't the kinda people I want to watch movies with anyhow! They're better off in line for Hostel, Saw, Wolf Creek or the horrific remake of Halloween foisted on us by Rob Zombie.We need to encourage Hollywood to keep making original stories like this (no they didn't invent the monster movie, but at least this wasn't a frigging sequel, remake or other.. it was something someone actually thought up on their own for a change). If we don't, we're showing Hollywood we aren't smart enough to watch original stories and we'll keep getting fed crap.Give the movie a chance. If you want, go to www.cloverfieldclues.com and dig deep into the back story. No, the back story is NOT a big part of this movie, but it serves to make you really curious as to what's going on. The marketing/game was VERY interesting and probably will spawn some follow up whether audiences pan this movie or not. And I'd love for that to happen.I'm just sick of the whiners, whingers and downright ridiculous comments calling this movie stupid from folks who have become used to having gore, violence and idiocy crammed down their throats. We've got to get over our need to see everything in full Technicolor every second. Otherwise we're never going to get a decent film outta Hollywood ever again.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Clever, but still not enough to make it great.","I would never consider myself a critic for movies, but just someone that enjoys them, and goes to them on the premise that I want to be entertained and see something cool.Clever filming and creature design weren't enough for this movie to be worth the time or money I invested in it. It can't be helped to draw parallels to Blair Witch Project in terms of buzz or how it was filmed. As one user said before this was indeed the better movie, but I felt cheated. If anything could be learned from the home video feel that both movies have it is this - it is a gimmick. It really didn't add to the movie. I felt that it would have been considerably more interesting to have the home movie be and introduction to the main movie - cut to a recovery team. To Aliens to you? Okay... then perhaps something else. I wasn't the only one that was irritated after spending the time to watch this. I have never heard as much cussing at the end of a movie as I did after watching this all the way through. The crowd was clearly as displeased as I, and I tend to have a bit of a snobbish taste for movies, and think tailoring a movie to a test crowd is stupid, but it left me wondering what those people thought.In the end great idea - in fact clever, but clever can't carry the movie in this instance. I felt nothing for the characters, in fact was waiting for them to get wiped out by the beasties, and was disappointed they didn't. Ending was too Blair Witch, and those that saw this you have to admit it was. The only thing I thought was worthwhile was getting to see the Ironman trailer, but still wasn't worth eight dollars to see. Rent it, don't buy it. I see no re-watch value in this.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
wow,"What can I say. I thought this movie was great. The movie Jarhead was not about a war or combat, it was about the bond that develops between soldiers. this movie was the same way. It wasn't about the monster and how they fought it. it was about the experience these people went through just trying to survive and the decisions they made along the way. after reading all these negative reviews I'm guessing a lot of people didn't get that. they went into the theater and expected Godzilla or some big movie about how humanity defeated another giant monster. I have to say it was a welcome change from your everyday film. Honestly I don't know how people expected the movie to end. When they said the movie was filmed like a home video, they meant it. I felt like I was right there in the action. This was one of those movies where I focused on nothing but the movie in the theater the entire time. This movie is not for everyone. Don't walk into that theater expecting another Godzilla type movie. U WILL B DISAPPOINTED! U have to appreciate that this movie is about something smaller than that.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
horrid,"Quite possibly the worst film I've seen. And I've seen some stinkers (Dungeons and Dragons anyone?). I'd rather watch 3 hours of Jar-Jar doing karaoke than see this again. Too many ""over the top"" elements, zero suspension-of-disbelief, the shaky-camera got tiring in less than the first 5 mins, the opening was utterly boring exposition-via-3rd-person-camera- as-character and I thought the writing and acting was quite poor. It was innovative / an interesting concept, but I think it failed miserably when it came to execution.I'm sorely disappointed, I didn't except a summer-blockbuster style effects film, or an epic/monster/disaster movie. I did expect that this would be more than a higher-budget effects-laden Blair Witch. For something that was supposedly ""character driven"" you'd think they might have developed the love interest further than a fawning-frat-boy level. I had high expectations for what this could have been but instead of follow or develop any of the interesting side-stories or concepts brought up, or being a wild ride, it substituted shaky- camera-fast-cutting ""edgy"" editing for good film-making, and suffers greatly for it.AVOID / dollar-theater / netflix with 10 friends and a lot of beer...",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

Mixed feelings...,"I love going to movies. Flat out. I love movies, and I even get crap for loving indie films where everybody dies in the end (because that is what happens sometimes). But I don't like movies that feel as though they don't have much point. The entire movie just didn't feel like it was going anywhere. It felt a little like a dream that you wake up and don't remember much of, because there's not much for you to remember. And all kinds of controversy comes from the first person camera view. My friends and I all couldn't eat for a good hour after the movie ended. None of us really had motion sickness, but my girlfriend started getting a little dizzy and we had to duck out for a second. It absolutely adds to the intensity and effect, but at a price. Overall I did enjoy it, but it just seemed like more of a rental movie than an $8 blockbuster.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Intense Action/Thriller,"I decided to use my ""movie money"" that I got for the holidays on this movie. It was well worth it.Cloverfield gets your attention and keeps you drawn in, wondering ""What happens next?"" throughout the whole movie. The action is intense, the cinematography is great (For how its done, that is, with a camcorder) and this movie makes you cringe, jump and laugh in all th right places.The characters are realistic and there's no big-name actor to pay special attention to.

"Watch it just to see New York getting trashed, again.","A 'Godzilla' movie for the YouTube generation. A giant building-sized monster came out of nowhere and just wrecks havoc in New York City. The thing that makes this movie different is that the entire film is captured with a hand-held camcorder by a bystander. Couple that with the excellent special effects and the movie has that gritty and yet out of this world realism.Conventional narrative, this movie is not. I heard a lot of disappointed groans from the audience at the end of the movie. Just treat the movie as a documentary and that this film was just extracted from the rubble during the aftermath of the monster's attack. This gimmick has been done before in The Blair Witch Project. These two movies really share a lot of similarities by the way.The movie production tried very hard to give it that amateurish film-making look at the expense of the viewer's comfort. The cam is so shaky I heard stories people throwing up while watching the film, so beware. It didn't bother me but my only beef is that the lighting is so dark. A lot of times I can't figure out what the hell is going on or even the entire look of the monster. I guess it's the intent to show as little as possible to make it more ambiguous, and hence scary.A very good monster movie but the acting and story are so-so. Watch it just to see New York getting trashed, again.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great Movie!,"I really liked this film. Not sure what's up with all of the negative reviews. If you are expecting a movie that is earth shattering, you will be disappointed.The monster was pretty cool looking (doesn't look like Godzilla, which is one thing I was afraid of) & it had some pretty nice thrills. I also liked the fact that it was only about 90 min. because there wasn't as much filler that would slow down the pace.The only things I didn't like were the jerky motion of the camera (which got a little old after a while but if you know the premise you should be expecting that regardless) & slightly too much time at the party before things really get started.Overall I thought it was a damn good monster movie & would definitely recommend it to others.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
original disaster movie,"The experiment is not about an epic disaster but regards a kind of style injecting a strong sense of terror into the whole story.

The overall effect, probably helped by the moving camera, is terrifying, ""Cloverfield"" is really intense and gripping, scarier than other apocalyptic movies I had seen so far.

Relentless and disorientating - a fantastic cinema experience.,"Well, I thought it was amazing.Looking up and down this board, I see that Cloverfield has really split the vote. Most of the comments seem to say that the movie was 'derivative' (of course it was, but that was besides the point. It wasn't about the b-movie monster, it was about how people would genuinely react to the b- movie monster) and 'didn't live up to the hype'. Well, I haven't been following the hype of this movie, in fact the only bit of promotion I saw was the trailer before Transformers, so I went in with virtually no preconceptions. Perhaps one of the problems lies in the ability of hype to whip fanboys into a frenzy to a point that they already have a version of the movie in their heads when they go into a theatre, and are naturally frustrated when the real movie is different to theirs...But I was utterly blown away.I've watched so many films in my life, and haven't been scared or bothered in any way by a film since I was 12. I think this is because, as a filmgoing public, we are used to all the set ups, all the knock downs. Every camera angle, music cue, every way a scene plays out. we're utterly fluent in the language of cinema, to such a point that we are never going to be affected by it on anything more than a superficial level. This movie throws that all out of the window - in a good way. No music. No set-ups. No cheap scares. Nothing in this movie tells you you're watching a movie. You're completely disorientated from start to finish, completely uncomfortable and on edge. And that is a hell of an achievement in today's de-sensitised movie environment. While I didn't jump once, like some of the people I was sitting with, I did find myself clutching the chair arms at various points.And of course it's derivative. EVERY monster movie cliché is in there, and so it should be. The monster destroys landmarks. The military fight the monster. News reports advancing the plot. But it's delivered with such style and such punch that you can't help but be awed. You're seeing these events on an ant's eye level. There are no sweeping special effects shots of the White House being demolished by aliens, no aerial shots of buildings being destroyed - instead we get distant, unidentifiable bangs, fires obscured by the cityscape, an enormous leg moving behind a skyscraper - and a distant object which comes hurtling through the air, finally landing amidst chaos in a street, revealing itself to be the head of the statue of liberty.This personal touch goes deeper - characters disappear from the story, and we (the audience) don't know their fate because the main characters don't.The effects, with one or two exceptions (the money shot of the monster at the end springs to mind), are seamlessly integrated. A lifelong ""effects spotter"", I found myself not even noticing when something that MUST have been CGI was on screen (the leaning skyscraper completely passed me by - I only thought 'wow, that wasn't real' later).And people are going to pick on the film because it doesn't tick all the boxes. You don't know why the monster's here, or what it wants. We don't find out what happened to the girl in the helicopter, or what really happens when one of the little things bites you. The monster could still be out there for all we know. But all of this ambiguity just adds to the realism, the disorientation and the hysteria. You want everything wrapped up in a nice little package? Go and watch one of those awful American J-horror remakes like The Ring, where they took all the ambiguity of the original and ruined the movie by ""explaining everything"". I want a bit of mystery. Remember, this is a very personal ant's eye view of the attack. The guy behind the camera didn't know all that stuff, so why should we?I hate it when people tell me I didn't 'get' something, be it a movie, book or whatever.

"It's a GIANT MONSTER ATTACKS movie - that's it, people","I think people are getting waaay too worked up over this (put down the Taurine and step away from the computer) - let's strip everything else away and focus on what CLOVERFIELD truly is - it's a giant monster attacks a city movie - that's it - from Godzilla to Reptillicus to Beast from 20,000 Fathoms - it has been done forever and the fact that these filmmakers tried to create a new way to do it while still remaining faithful to the genre itself - well - they should be commended. Many things in the movie work - first off, I really appreciated the FACT that they did NOT explain the monster - who cares - you want a military scientist rushed in and blab on about toxins in the water or pollution or microwaves or Lindsay Lohan being responsible for it - all the old movies have that and you don't need it - whatever caused it - it's there and it's ticked off and ready to destroy. (POSSIBLE SPOILERS)I loved how we saw glimpses of it - in my humble opinion - you did not need the big shots of it over Hud at the end - it was on camera too long and that's when the whole CGI of it looked lame to me. I tried to go with the whole premise of Hud filming as much as he did (otherwise you don't have a movie) but that was too much to swallow at times - like, hey dude - there are tiny scorpion/spider thingys trying to kill us - could you put down the *^&%$% camera and help me shut the door on them, please thank you very much? The way they taped over the previous Coney Island day was clever and I thought that was effective. There are some great scenes - the bridge being attacked - the initial ""earthquake"" - the news cameras showing glimpses of the creature moving through the avenues - the subway tunnels scene and the helicopter crash - in fact, if the movie had ended when the copter crashed - that would have been fine with me - I did like how it seemed all the main characters died. Good ending. As for this talk that something is possibly seen falling in the ocean at the end of the Coney Island tape - I thought I saw something too and I liked that touch very much. See, that is one thing I did enjoy - they didn't overexplain, they let you figure stuff or analyze stuff yourself. Use the old brainbox, what. Don't need to be spoonfed everything.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Blair Which crossed with Godzilla and a little Independence Day,"I give this movie an A for Already been done. However done very well, the story is simply a mix of The Blair Which Project, Independence Day and Godzilla. I felt I had already seen this move in another form and this one failed to provide the suspense and trill of other movies. Don't get me wrong this movie is very well edited and directed and contains a lot of creativity when it comes to how the movie was made. I give the director credit for his ability to incorporate special effects in a way never done before, however the motion sickness of the camera got to a lot of the audience, and just screamed Blair Which done on a much higher budget. The plot had so many unrealistic screens, I almost felt myself laughing staying common we all know if you have been impaled by an object you cannot just pull yourself off that object and then run freely for your life....",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Some people said this is Worst movie...But I DON'T THING they CAN made as BEST as CLOVERFIELD,"the Shocking moment in this Movie make you feel like ""you're on the movie at that moment' try to safe yourself from 'thing',the Filmography is Superb 'As real as it feel' the technique,camera angle everything! i suggest watch it in theater or Home theater which GREAT SOUND effect from the story maybe you will say its a common,..but in the whole i think 'CLOVERFIELD' is different. the most monster movie as i known can easily predicted how the story goes, but i think 'Cloverfield' is made audience wondering how the story end, because in a panic situation, the unpredictable thing brutality attack new york in the middle of the night.in every scenes you feel 'What's gonna happen next?'the film lots of disturbing pictures and sounds.

I hope the sequel of this movie is already on Matt reeves mind and launch in 2009..and more SHOCKING and SHOCKING UNPREDICTABLE !!!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"CLOVERFIELD (Matt Reeves, 2008) ***","To begin with, I found this to be somewhat better than I had anticipated (though, admittedly, advance reviews had been generally positive). That said, the opening fifteen minutes are quite deadly - (even if the extended party footage helps to flesh out characters and, thus, heighten the later relentless anxiety passages). Thankfully, the teen relationships stuff gets forgotten pretty quickly  but, when they occur, the elegiac intermittent video footage of the happier past gives one a much-needed breather.This is THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT (1999) meets THE HOST (2006) or, if you, like a Hollywood monster movie of yore updated for the MTV generation and filtered through with a post-9/11 sensibility. SCREAM (1996), THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT itself and SAW (2004) are all recent examples of the next big thing in Horror films; and, yet, who today recalls (or even misses) the film-makers of BLAIR WITCH? The director of this one, Matt Reeves, is already 42  and his previous film had been the comedy THE PALLBEARER (1996); in any case, CLOVERFIELD is more renowned for being a J.J. Abrams project (who produced it).The film is compact (even with its tight 75 minutes duration, barring the typically lengthy closing credits, it stills sags slightly and interest starts to wane towards the end), the title obscure, the monster(s) undefined (the shapeless main creature is creepy and admirably one only gets to have a real good look at it when gobbling up the Hud character! The young cast is variable, anonymous (with the most interesting characters being the misfits  Helena for being a Latina and Hud a geek) and, fashionably, indiscriminately disposed of. As for the cine'-verite' approach, the film-makers' over-reliance on it becomes rather self-defeating: would it be plausible for someone to keep filming this stuff? Besides, while aiding in the immediacy of the destruction and the ensuing panic (with such effective shock sequences as the demolition of the Brooklyn bridge, the tunnel attack and Helena's mysteriously violent and messy death), it never allows the audience a moment for reflection  coming across as a sensation rather than an experience and, given that nothing at all is explained, one isn't any the wiser by the end of it!In retrospect, it seems obvious that the traumatic 9/11 events has transported the U.S. back to the days of political/nuclear/alien paranoia which, back then, was also transmitted into cinematic terms via any number of sci-fi parables but where it's evident that the film-makers of that time were utmost professionals (in their strict majority) whose mission was to provide thought-provoking entertainment rather than merely computer-generated publicity stunts. At least, it does manage a couple of lingering images: the disembodied head of the Statue Of Liberty tumbling to the ground and an empty horse-carriage eerily wandering by night on a practically deserted city street. Sadly enough, but hardly surprising, a sequel is already in the works; the film, then, is no masterpiece but very well done nonetheless: smart, exciting and highly effective  in essence, what the much-hyped Hollywood remake of GODZILLA (1998) should have been in the first place! In spite of my reservations, I still consider it to be the first must-see movie of 2008 (which I chose not to watch it in the theater for fear of the dizzy camera syndrome proving to be a bit much but, actually, one gets used to it pretty quickly).",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A new approach to movie making and filled with strengths and weaknesses...,"Cloverfield was my first ever movie watched in a first person's point of view. i was very impressed and engrossed into the movie as though i was also experiencing the mayhem. nice cinematography but had errors as in lack of depth in storyline and run time ( 70 minutes including a 7 minutes of credits). but once again the flaws i mentioned might not be flaws but just my lack of experience in watching such films. but in a nut shell, it was a 70 minutes roller coaster ride which roots you to your seats. could have given it a 8.5 for the rating if not for what i saw as ""flaws"". nevertheless watch it the Dolby surround system was a huge strength for this movie has it makes you 'feel' the movie. overall, good effort.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Short but sweet....expect a sequel and will be there for it.,"For fans of the genre, Cloverfield refines a not much ventured upon perspective in film making with a YouTube first-person style approach. Allowing the audience to almost experience a catastrophic and unexplainable event. It combines eyewitness documentary with sci-fi monster suspense without failing to deliver although brief, a deeper meaning of love, loss, friendship, and survival. The film gives the audience a realistic but fictional account of how the human psyche would react to the stresses of an extraordinary event while giving the viewers only as much information as acquired by the characters themselves. All this with the contemporary backdrop and the, ""Hey I was invited to the party too?"" immersion make Cloverfield a must see in its own right. *encore*""Man created God in his own image.""

Could be better,"To be honest, the movie didn't live up to the hype it has been gathering. But it did offer something different compared to all the other monster movies its going to be compared with including Godzilla. Moviegoers should go in without their thinking caps on and just enjoy the movie. And what turns out as a sluggish and draggy start will turn into pandemonium. Survive the initial quarter or so and you'll be in for action thereafter. Some might get dizzy or confused by the way the film was filmed, but this element was intended to inject more realism into the scene like what was done in The Blair Witch Project. But those hoping to see much of the monster entity will be unhappy for most of the movie. Only glimpses of the creature will be visible and the director leaves the rest to your imagination. But certain scenes in the latter stages of the film offer views of what this behemoth is all about. Lastly, being a much anticipated movie and a hope for a good start to 2008, it was a bit too short. But then again, how long can the batteries for a hand held video recorder last?",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Unlike any other monster movie.,"Since this was released yesterday (17-01-08) in Australia, I was freaking excited to see this film. I've been anticipating it since July 2007 and now the day has finally come.What can I say about ""Cloverfield"", other than a dodgy title that I don't understand, this film was fan-freaking-tastic. This story revolves around five friends who document the night of NYC's destruction by an extraordinary being. The crew must work together in all means of survival.This movie can get quite unrealistic and scary at times, but this one definitely keeps you on your toes. The shaky camera work can make you feel queezy (as it did me at around 50 minutes), but it's nothing too bad. At one point I felt like leaving the theater but it was Cloverfield.Overall, the film shoots its way beyond excellence and strives for another sequel. The film has some very smart elements that you cannot miss. Cloverfield is DEFINITELY a monster classic since 1998's Godzilla.PS: Stay in your seat until the end of the credits (I regret that I didn't) Rating: 11/10",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"If you're looking for a great movie, keep looking. Just appreciate it for what it does offer.","I've never been a fan of JJ Abrams. Alias and Lost are both quite ridiculous, unfulfilling, pretentious and huge carrot-on-a-stick shows that have you keep on watching in the hope of finally ever making some real sense of it all, but that moment never really comes.Anyway: People keep ripping Cloverfield for the ""homevideo gimmick"" that Cloverfield ""stole"" from Blair Witch for the sake of trying to be original. Who cares? It's just a technique a moviemaker can use to strengthen a certain feel. Most paintings are done in oil-paint, but sometimes a painting works better using acrylic paint or even crayons. It's all about what you are trying to achieve. And yes, the entire movie is filmed this way and sometimes you want to shoot the guy filming in the head for not pointing the camera where you want it to look and sometimes you do get a bit motion sick. But it didn't bother me really. Just that the shaking and pointing at the floor was a little over the top at certain times and could have been toned down for the sake of the viewer without sacrificing realism.You can skip the entire first 18 minutes of the movie since nothing happens. It is supposed to set us up for the shock of when all hell breaks loose and enforce the feeling of realism of witnessing everyday life etc etc, but it's drawn out way to long and nothing interesting happens. 10 minutes max would have been really sufficient, or at least making this introduction more interesting and lively. It didn't even add much to the characters.There is no obvious story during the entire movie, but what went on was entertaining enough, at least for me. The characters weren't fan-shrine material, but they did the job of pulling us along. Although, I didn't really care much about most of em. The guy holding the cam was funny and interesting and so was the first girl to get killed sadly.The acting was..somewhat inconsistent. Some parts felt really good and natural, and other parts just made me sort of roll my eyes. (especially when certain people are hurt, they seem to be packing the magic Hollywood morphine which makes them ignore all pain and keep on flirting and laughing etc) It wasn't Oscar material tho.The action, when it finally starts, is decent. Explosions, panic, soldiers fighting everywhere, people running for their life and loud noises. If you managed to stay awake past the 1st 18 minutes you will be on the edge of your seat for the most part. The CG and effects were very good and looked very real, but this is 2008 after all.Now, the monster, the thing which all the hype is about. To me, the monster was a very big disappointment. It wasn't very scary or interesting. Not even when it flashes by in the background when our ""heroes"" are running across the street does it really cause any real scares. It simply wasn't terrifying, neither in looks nor in how it acted. It looked quite silly IMHO. The scenes with the monster also felt very secondary. It didn't feel all that present during the entire movie and as such killed a lot of the suspense, urgency, danger and claustrophobia.All in all, it was a good movie and a breath of fresh air in many regards. But be warned, pretty much nothing is explained. You don't know anything about the monster, what happened to certain people, what happened to Manhatten, nothing! There is no real beginning nor an ending here. All it is, is a hour and a half (not counting the snooze worthy start) of being thrown into a ride of panic and apocalyptic visuals. It's more of an experience then a story.Many people really hate Cloverfield and I can understand them. If you go in expecting a real suspenseful action or monster movie, you will be disappointed because of the lack of any real storytelling or closure. I also hated the fact that there was no real ""ending"" but I liked the rest of the movie for what it was.7/10 for me. 7 because it is not super duper great, but it still stands above average.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Terrible.,"Absolutely no plot. Just a bunch of CG fire and sparks...don't waste your time with this movie. I for one have had enough of movies of this type with no content to them...directors think they can throw some digital magic and viral marketing together to attract attention. Well, let Cloverfield be an example: it fails miserably. The film is left open-ended, with absolutely no explanation as to why any of the ""plot"" happened in the first place. Almost everything that takes place in the movie seems utterly random and disconnected. The filming gimmick (making the movie look like it was done on a home DV camera) shook the screen so much that it left many people I saw this with dizzy. It was very hard to follow - and I got tired of seeing split-second glimpses of everything. You never get a good look at anything interesting in the movie at all.I was looking forward to seeing this, and it's been a while since I was so disappointed at the box office.We got our money back at the theater afterward, and rightly so.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"This Is Not a Movie, It's an Experience","The way the movie was filmed really is what makes this so well done, you get the feeling that this actually happened, if you let yourself. The scenes of NYC being attacked were very well done, it looks very realistic especially when it is being shown to you through the hand-held camera. The sounds are all amazing, from the explosions to the sounds that you have no idea what they are they all add to the experience. This film really makes you figure stuff out for yourself, it doesn't really give you a direct, concrete answer but, leaves things up to you to decide. This movie is unlike anything I've ever seen and probably will ever see for a while. This movie seems to be one you either love or hate, personally I loved every single minute and will see it again at least 3 or 4 more times in theater and be sure to get it the day it is released.

One word to describe it all...AMAZING.,"So let's get one thing straight, a movie with a hand held camera theme is going to make you nauseous, it's a given. So get over it people.Okay on to my comment. The movie is, as I see it, a masterpiece. Sure I'll give it to most, the ending wasn't the best but I'm not going to spoil it for you guys and gals out there that have yet to see this monster of a movie. This movie not only delivered the scares, but it delivers in nearly every other emotion as well. The comedic relief was genius, the sad moments were tear jerking, the action-y moments where suspenseful unlike any other movie I've seen in a long long time. I just wish it was longer, with a run time barely under an hour and a half, it had me sitting in my seat wanting more every second that passed. The monster was absolutely brilliant and the acting in the movie is some of the best I've seen in a long time especially from a cast of really young actors.Overall this movie was a wonderful experience and I hope Hollywood comes out with more like this. Maybe not so much hand-held cam but maybe a little more interesting and fun like ""Cloverfield"". I'm sure anyone who watches this will agree and say it is one of the best monster movies ever made, quite possibly the best.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"An epic accomplishment in cinematography, imho","Abrams really outdid himself with this movie. At first, I thought Cloverfield was going to suck, given all the hype and its cliché themes and marketing scheme. But I was wrong. Cloverfield sucks you in and keeps you on the edge of your seat from the second people start getting stomped on, in part because of the amazing incorporation of a first-person experience into the movie to add to the immersion factor. In fact, I think Cloverfield is the first piece of media to really rivet and frighten me in the way that it did other than video games such as Half Life and FEAR. My only gripes with the movie, of course, are with its lack of character development and over reliance on visuals over substance. But that's to be expected from a movie that's basically a homage to the Godzilla series.Kudos to Bad Robot and everyone else involved in the filming of this movie. And boo to everyone who is giving this a 1 star review because they got motion sickness. Toughen up and take a pill, or stop complaining.

The Beast from Facestomp.com,"Early in J.J. Abrams/Matt Reeve's Cloverfield, long before the monster goes on its city destroying rampage, I found myself secretly hoping the beast would turn each and every one of the Emo/MySpace cast into an hors d'uvre, along with 90 percent of the seat-kicking, cell phone using mouth breathers that made up the viewing audience.Never before have I so enjoyed a movie that contained so many ingredients that I absolutely loathed. Presented as found video footage retrieved from a camcorder in New York's Central Park, Cloverfield ""documents"" a gigantic beast's blitzkrieg rampage through the city from the point of view of one of the many thousands of fleeing masses typically shown as an afterthought in so many of the Godzilla movies.I absolutely detest the shaky, jerky, hand-held style of camera work Hollywood wonks seem so enamored with these days, and Cloverfield ramps this up by a factor of 100, complete with out of focus, poorly framed and lit shots  exactly the sort of stuff one would expect to see recorded by some non-professional average Joe.The movie also suffers from a cast of characters that are as unlikeable as they are unbelievably stupid in their motivations.Moments before the attack begins, as our intrepid cameraman sets out to document a farewell party for Rob (Michael Stahl-David), the movie's male lead who is about to embark on a new job in Japan, we are clued into a soap-opera sub-plot involving his unrequited love for a hottie named Beth with whom he shared a lone night of hot steamy passion mere weeks earlier. The way I see it, this babe must have rocked Rob's world far more than the number the monster pulls on NYC because throughout the film, Rob, accompanied by his faithful cameraman and two friends, set out to make their way across Manhattan, directly through the creature's path, to locate Beth who called him on his cell to tell him she was trapped in her apartment.Along the way they are set upon by some nasty critters that have hitched a ride on the big brute, and which may or may not be offspring or parasites - nasty, spidery buggers who emit an unforgettably creepy sound.Insofar as the main creature itself goes, it can best be described as a variation on that multi-legged mantis-like beast featured in the arena sequence of Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones, and the decision to reveal it in glimpses, leading up to two final extended shots, is one of the best things about this movie. Throughout I was constantly leaning one way or another, craning my neck to look around buildings, or cursing the cameraman who elected to pan away to his buddies rather than at the creature ripping through the side of a skyscraper.As movies go, Cloverfield's flaws are numerous (how is it that Rob's phone battery could die out early in the night yet the camcorder seems to never run out of juice? And how long a tape does the damn thing hold?), however what it accurately captures is not so much the rampage of a mysterious beast, but the incessant self-absorption, to the exclusion even of an otherworldly onslaught, of the MySpace crowd.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
not wasting time,"First of all normally i am not interested in action movies.But this was the first time i was excited about one action movie.Recording styles,acting,sound effects are really professional.The effects are great and realistic thanks to the hand –held camera. Before this film i hadn't watched any film which is shot with hand-held camera. I am really impressted by hand-held camera. It feels me as if i was into the film. So it makes this film more enjoyable and fluent. Except in the party which is given at the beginning of the film there are not any music but my thought this is better because it makes this film more realistic.actors and actresses are not well known but they acts really cool.As a result that movie is not wasting time,it is a good experience. .",,Anonymous,Horror

Nice Try,"Its like you took an original concept too far. I understand the first twenty minutes or so were needed to get us emotionally vested in these characters. I understand you need to set this movie apart from a Hollywood production 'feel' by having it told through the eyes of these characters and the shaking camera, great idea by the way. I even understand why the ending was the way it was. But it fails because you don't know when to let go of a great idea, the shaking camera, and show us a movie and entertain us! I don't need to see a tilted view for the majority of the movie to understand that this character is not a professional camera man. It's annoying. And because our attention span WOULD last more than an hour and twenty something minutes. When the movie was over, it just didn't have any kind of impact and feels empty.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Who cares where it came from; it's big, ugly and mean, and that's all that matters.","The impressive teaser trailers for Cloverfield revealed some stunning footage of the destruction of New York, but refused to reveal the film's title, creating much conjecture and discussion about the true nature of the project amongst film fans. Ironically, it was this well orchestrated hype that made me give this one a miss at the cinema, for I had fallen for this kind of marketing ploy before and wasn't about to be duped again. It's a shame, because for once, the film lives up to the hype and I would have dearly loved to have seen this in all of its big budget, blockbuster glory on the silver screen.Written by J.J. Abrams, the man who created compulsive but confusing TV series Lost, Cloverfield has been described as The Blair Witch Project meets Godzilla, a summary that proves to be very accurate: utilising hand-held POV camera-work (video footage supposedly shot by one of the characters) to achieve a sense of naturalistic realism, the film follows several 20-something New Yorkers as they try and escape from Manhattan after it is attacked by a huge and very destructive monster.Director Matt Reeves imagery is deliberately reminiscent of footage taken during the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and instantly brings to mind the horror of that unforgettable event; this connection with something so real and terrible makes Cloverfield all the more harrowing. Add to this Abram's well constructed script featuring credible and occasionally witty dialogue (my favourite lines: What was that? I don't know... something else, also terrible), an impossibly good looking but largely unknown cast who all give very plausible performances, and superb special effects that merge seamlessly into the live action, and the result is a surprisingly enjoyable experience from start to depressing finish (like REC, Cannibal Holocaust, and The Blair Witch Project, which also used the documentary style to great effect, Cloverfield ends on an extremely downbeat note).",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Intensly Interesting and ""Wicked Sweet""","I went to see Cloverfield, not really knowing what to expect, knowing that there were commercials from the point of a first person camera yet not expecting to have the whole movie through that aspect. And yet, it worked. The music was replaced with the shaking and rattling, the fear and the turmoil created around them. It was the camera's story as the old tape behind the one being film told the past without ever having to have the characters directly re-tell or explain in detail what occurred. The character development in this movie was stupendous, every character feels as though they could be ""that friend you have"", or someone you can really, honestly relate to. What makes this film so great is not only the camera angles and the unknown veil of what may be happening and what actually occurred, but it is the fact that if it had happened then this is how it would be, this is how we would act.There is even some sarcastic comedy but everything is completely suitable for the situaution and seems so natural to each character's personality. The ending was perfect, it left me curious, engaged, upset and even somewhat frustrated, however, not to spoil it, that is what a good movie SHOULD be doing.It was created, different and interesting, I was listening intently, completely obsessing over finding out what was going on, and creating theories along with the characters, and like them, I never found out.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Absolutely brilliant!,"Going into this film I had already looked at reviews on IMDb and saw it had received surprisingly high ratings. To be honest I went into this movie with low expectations. I saw the preview and thought that it would be entertaining but the first person camera style would be too distracting from the actual movie. DEAD WRONG! The filming, however shaky, puts you in the movie. Halfway into the movie I had to remind myself that I was in a theater and not being ravaged by a horrible monster in New York. And after I heard that there was something at the end of the credits I had to go back to the theater and watch it a second time. Although I already knew what was going to happen next, I still found myself right alongside with the main characters in the movie. Last year, I saw at least 60 movies and I don't remember coming out of a movie as satisfied as I did with this one. I highly recommend this movie to everyone.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Worse than epic movie!,"In my entire life i have never fallen asleep during a movie at the theater, but then i saw Cloverfield. The first 20 minutes are very boring and don't grasp your attention whatsoever. This movie has no story and its driven purely by special effects. the confusion starts with the action itself, for example: one of the victims(Marlena i believe) is bitten and then later on blows up??? And of course lets not forget the camera style that makes you feel like your watching a home video filmed by your drunk grandmother. Also another thing that makes this movie so unbearable is that it is so unrealistic. For instance there is a scene where the so-called injured group of survivors climb up a 50 story building with no trouble at all.By the way the reason i didn't bother putting one of those spoiler signs is that, there is really nothing to spoil so please save your money, i promise you will regret it.

Not the worst movie I've ever seen.,"OK, yeah. I had problems with this movie. I also really enjoyed parts of it. Ever since seeing the trailer before ""Transformers"" last summer, I've been looking forward to opening night. My roommates and I went to the last showing of the night at our local theater, and ended up having to sit in the front row because the theater was that full.Despite getting off to a rather slow start, once the action begins, it is non-stop. The camera work is completely different from anything I had ever seen before...""The Blair Witch Project"" doesn't even measure up. I'm not saying the camera shots were wonderful, but they definitely put the viewer in the middle of the action. There were times I felt like running away too...but those times were because I felt sick from all the shaking around.The ending was rather unsatisfying to quite a few people in the theater I was at, but compared to a typical movie ending, I enjoyed how it happened. All in all, the entire movie was an experience I won't soon forget. Whether that is good or bad, I'm not sure yet. All I know is that I've seen far worse, and far better, movies. If you're looking for something with an interesting take on a monster attack, this is your movie.

I was looking forward to this film and have been following it for the past six months so it could only have been a let down if it was not perfect , and i LOVED it. From the opening scenes you know this is not the usual Hollywood fodder and you are drawn into the characters world as you live and breath there experience. I do not wish to spoil anything that this film dishes out so just go and enjoy this genius of a film , but a word to the warning , if you did not like the blair witch project and hated that style of storytelling and cinematography then you might not get on with this film as its very similar. Whether its a happy or sad ending your looking for then this film will keep you guessing , please,please try to avoid any script or plot that you may want to see , keep yourself guessing?",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Cloverfield Don't see,I just saw the movie last night when one of my friends won tickets to see the movie at an early release party. The movie is less than an hour and a half but I was waiting for it to be over by the end of the movie. I enjoyed the way the movie was shot from a perspective of a dude holding a camcorder it made the movie seem to be more realistic and gave the impression that the viewer was seeing the movie first hand.While I wouldn't not recommend to see this movie in theaters due to the outrageous ticket prices I would wait to see this movie on DVD. The camera style resembled a Blair Witch style which other horror movies should follow because it made the viewer connect with the characters. This style also forces the viewer to only know the same things the characters of the movie know.In my opinion I would wait to see this movie on DVD but if you want to watch a movie that is shot interestingly and done in an interesting way this movie could be great for you. This could be the type of movie that could spawn a completely different breed of horror movies and this would not be a bad thing by any means.,7.0,Anonymous,Horror
What a good idea,"This one of the films i thought original,using a Blair witch approach to govern peoples fears and nightmares. J,j Abrams gave this film a unique perspective of how we could view horror in its most raw forms. What ever the creature is,did not come from our world. It looks to conglomerated to visualize a creature toxified by the mans wastes. But some people believed that this creature was a result of cruel waste dumping and hid until it was time to surface. Others say it was something leaping in the DNA pool too fast or other...etc etc. But besides theories of what it is or was,the creature had no compassion or remorse of its own actions,seeing as it was nearly 300 feet tall with smaller drones to clean up the mess for its walk in the park. I have to say that this film was enjoyable,using blended arts of remote cameras with special effects not seen before and also not using once any type of music or music background to give impact for each scene. To keep the realism dancing in our brains no music was used. Whoever heard of a camera recording or hand-held harnessing music?. To J,j Abrams i hope his next film will be something to see,i thought this film was a bit short but made up for the effects and to have each actor relate with terror and their character reflecting the terror. To show that anything out of the ordinary can happen in a......",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Bland yuppie characters don't make me care much that they might die. But the monster is scary!,"I've been thinking of this movie as the Blair Godzilla Project for months now, and I was pretty much entirely correct on what to expect. It's a good concept. I mean, everyone decided to hate The Blair Witch Project after it opened wide, but it was an excellent idea, and an effective film. It didn't work more than once, but that first time packed quite a wallop (for me at least). Cloverfield has the same flaws as that film. You spend a lot of time wondering why the character with the camera wouldn't at least set the camera aside some of the time (they do attempt to make it more believable than BWP did, but it's not always convincing). Also as in BWP, the characters are bland, vapid and not much worth caring about. They're all very TV-style good looking (in fact, most everyone involved with the movie came from that medium), and you'd certainly stare at the girls' butts if you saw them on the street. But on TV or in the movies, they're average. Does any real-life woman actually find the scruffy, unshaven look sexy? Hollywood has been shoving that look upon us for years now, and I don't think I've ever known of a female who wants her face ground down by stubble every time she gets close to her guy. Two of the male characters look so much alike I was relieved when one of them bit the dust. At least I wouldn't be confused anymore. But, oh yeah, there's a monster. And it's pretty scary. And the filmmakers are smart enough to hold back on what you see (although I should mention that Korean director Bong Joon-Ho made a much better monster movie last year in which the monster is seen in toto almost immediately). All in all, Cloverfield is a moderately entertaining monster movie. If you didn't like The Blair Witch Project, I would definitely avoid it. But if you did like BWP, and like Godzilla, it's not a bad way to spend 90 minutes. Make sure, if you do see it, to sit through the credits sequence. There's a lot of buzz about an impossible-to-hear mumble that is audible right before the studio logo comes up, but the real reason to stick around is to hear Michael Giacchino's bombastic and hilariously unnecessary closing overture and what it's called. It makes the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Monsters Kicking Manhattans Ass,"Good and scary roller coaster ride filled with the terror of trying to hide in a city under attack! You can feel and hear the weight of the monster as it walks by cracking the street and the fear that it is causing all those involved.If you want to be scared out of your skin then go as soon as you can and watch this one of a kind Sci-Fi thriller.The reason I gave it a 7/10 was because of the many scenes that were very hard to see because of the low light and shaking of the camera, making it confusing to know what's happening.I know that is what they want but at times it is way over done and for to long! Still as good as it gets, It will make you think twice about being in a big city with monsters!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Blair Witch project clone - it's totally ludicrous,"First fifteen minutes - total wasting of screening time (film is rather short ~ 75 min). Public in the cinema sounds Homeric laughter at the end of the film - director and script writer had made this film in a state of coma in total stupidity - as a result, nobody scared. It's just exact poor clone of The Blair Witch project - same idea, even script very similar, which is very straight-lined, full of a traditional movie stamps. So, producers of the Cloverfield - very greedy guys. They hired some beach boys and girls, cut F/X budget to the minimum. Just think - how it's possible to shoot disaster film only for 30M$ with action in NY?My opinion: save your money and time, if you still want to see this bullshit, wait for a DVD release.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Partially successful attempt to fuse a style and a genre,"For its first twenty-five minutes, this film is excellent. It succeeds in setting a relaxed atmosphere, and lulls the viewer into a state of comfort, and provides just enough light emotional interest that the sudden twist really does come as an unwelcome intrusion. After this, however, the trump card has been played, and from then onwards, the film's point of distinction becomes the unwelcome intrusion, for reasons which I will discuss.The mixed fortunes of this film are not surprising, given its layered structure. There are precisely two important layers to the film. On the one hand, an attempt is made to obscure the fact that the film is an illusion, by presenting it as if it were real footage. On the other hand, the subject matter is unmistakably derived from the history of film, and consists of a familiar set of problems and 'surprises,' illusions which are famous as such. Let us refer to these layers as style and genre respectively. The problem is that the style and the genre frequently work against one another. Presumably, the film-makers' intention was to reinvigorate a classic genre with a technical conceit. However, the genre depends on the surface of the illusion not being disturbed; the viewer must forget that he/she is in a cinema, or the ludicrous conventions of the genre will appear to him/her. The style undermines this requirement, by making itself a feature. By asking to be noticed, it prevents the audience from entering into the world of the film.The film asks us to be savvy and credulous at once; and ultimately, in my opinion, fails because of this.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Very enjoyable,"I thought the entire concept of the movie was very well done: A guy is going away so his friends decide to document his surprise party, and by accident they capture extraordinary events on film.The movie was very believable, meaning the characters respond to a catastrophic event in a very believable way.Through the taped over bits we can see that Rob is very much attached to Beth, which explains his guilt to shooing her away from the ""safe-zone"" that was his complex.They begin a trek to safety only to walk right into the middle of everything happening. Through tragedy we see Rob's future sister in law loses the survivor instincts she had in the beginning, and decides to help Rob, who's also overcome with grief and regret, find Beth.The cameraman is there because he has to support his best bud.The special effects were incredible, you feel like you're on the front lines of this spic battle.The script bounces from digression to situational, which is realistic for a group of friends scared, tired, and overcome with grief.Overall the movie is very much Godzilla in its nature. But where Godzilla follows scientists trying to find answers, and being scripted to know everything about the creature, Cloverfield takes the approach of the collateral damage of a supernatural event; it follows characters who have no idea what the hell is going on, and don't want to know. They just want to find their friend and get the hell out of NYC.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Enjoyed the film,"The use of the camera put the viewer intimately into the scene. You could really feel for each character, especially the one handling the camera. The emotions run high, especially for a ""monster movie."" I was able to relate to regrets similar to Rob regretting letting Beth the party.Interesting twist to this ""Godzilla"" type movie. I thought it was ingenious how the possible origin of the monster was revealed. I also liked the element of surprise and how it made me jump out of my seat.Negative comments: the monster's personal vendetta against some characters seemed a bit extreme. Also, a little more effort could have been taken to develop the plot and characteristic of the monster. What was the Japanese man trying to say? There were many gaps that could have been filled. It was a short film that wouldn't have suffered from more content.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A fun decent into pure chaos,"Cloverfield is a fun monster flick with memorable characters and great set pieces.If you are a fan of found footage this is the best big budget one I have seen. The monster is truly amazing and I love the fact that this TOWERING BEAST is considered a baby. I wouldn't want to meet the thing that brought clover into the world let's just say that.The film really lets you wait, it builds tension till you can't take it anymore and it just shows you the monster in full. It's great popcorn devouring stuff.It is t without its flaws, the dialogue is a bit silly and I don't care how much this group cares about each other I wouldn't go NEAR that monster after seeing how useless guns and bombs seem to be be against it.But still.

Worst movie I have ever seen.,"If you thought it was a great idea to mix the most recent Godzilla movie and The Blair Witch Project you might like this movie. But at least Godzilla featured better cinematography and acting. I had expected it to be at least interesting but it failed miserably. It starts like an episode of Laguna Beach but more contrived, and when it picks up speed it actually makes you want to vomit. The camcorder was never held still the entire movie. The acting was worse than Battlefield Earth and that is saying something beyond what words can describe. I actually thought Lost was an alright TV series but this movie is definitely J.J. Abrams's company's worst. I am surprised it made it to theaters being this amateur, but evidently bad taste isn't in short supply.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Best disaster movie ever,"This film was everything we hoped it would be. We loved the trailers, but we were prepared for some disappointment (as we felt with War of the Worlds). However the film completely delivered. After a slow initial buildup to establish the characters the tension didn't let up for the rest of the film. Lots of monster shots, lots of scares; just a fantastic thrill-ride of a film. Will definitely go and see it again. The M rating in New Zealand doesn't accurately reflect how scary this film is in parts; at our screening there was a 7-year-old with his dad, and this is way too young (will be some nightmares tonight!). We wouldn't take anyone under 14, and they'll be terrified.Hugely recommended; a triumph of its genre.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"great story line and effects, not for the motion-sick","When I first saw the trailers for Cloverfield my first thought was the monster was Godzilla. I was really excited to finally watch this movie and prepared myself for some awesome monster damage. I was not prepared for the motion-sickness, however. I didn't know the cinematography would be like ""The Blair Witch Project"" and the frantic running around looking through a view finder made me sick to my stomach for nearly two hours.Regardless of that, though, the writing was superb and the cast played their characters well. This would have been a more enjoyable and better-rated movie for me if it had been done with less camera shaking. It also had a slow beginning. If you can handle the topsy-turvy motion, I highly suggest you check this movie out.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Pretty intense from the get go! 6/10,"Review: Before I started to watch 10 Cloverfield Lane, I thought that I would watch this movie again, and I must admit, for it's time, it actually wasn't bad. I'm not one whose into paranormal movies, and I hate when films are filmed through a camera, so everything was against this movie right from the beginning but once the massive monster started to attack New York, I actually felt the intensity that the leading characters did. I must admit, the teenagers did get on my nerves after a while, and the camera seemed to have a really LONG battery life. Anyway, the action scenes with the army were quite realistic and the whole evacuation was put together well. I would have liked to have seen more attention to detail with the huge monster, and the little mini monsters but as it was filmed through a hand-held camera, I can understand why it looked sketchy. For a film that was made 8 years ago, it certainly didn't look dated, and you could easily release it today. Personally, I would have used some A-list actors, so they could bring the tension across more effectively but with that aside, I still enjoyed it the second time around. Watchable!Round-Up: After making such a profit at the box office, I'm surprised that it took so long for a sequel. The movie was directed by Matt Reeves, 50, who also brought you Let Me In, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, and is due to direct War in the Planet of the Apes, which will be released in 2017. With J.J. Abrams in the producer chair, who is known for directing Mission Impossible III, Super 8, the new Star Trek franchise, and of course, the new Star Wars movies, there certainly was a lot of experience behind the camera. I just wished that they filmed it normally! Anyway, it's definitely one to have in your collection, if your into movies in this genre, and I'm sure that people will be going back to it, in the future.Budget: $25million Worldwide Gross: $171millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their action/sci-fi/horrors, starring Lizzy Caplan, Jessica Lucas, T.J. Miller, Michael Stahl-David, Mike Vogel and Brian Klugman. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
This movie is UNREAL,"Go see it. You don't need to read another review. This was by FAR the greatest movie-going experience I've ever had in my life.

Then, the stuff hits the fan and it's non-stop.Don't listen to the trolls that gripe about the ending and the lack of explanation. Take it for what it is -- A realistic home-movie account of a monster attack on NYC. How are corpses supposed to keep making their video at the end? You see plenty of the monster. Just like in Jaws, you see just enough of it that it's still horrifying and not a distraction from the characters.You'll never see anything like this as long as you live.

The editing is very different, as it appears to have been filmed on a camcorder, giving the whole film a tint of realism, allowing the audience to suspend its disbelief just that little bit more.Overall, if you hate shaky cameras, don't watch it.

First-person action? Awesome!,"I watched this movie with three friends: one of them hated it, and the other two said it was average while I thought it was just awesome. The whole uniqueness of the movie lies in its first-person perspective which is either a total turnoff or an incredible experience. It was the latter for me and I have absolutely fallen in love with this technique. You actually feel like you're in the action and participating with the characters. I've probably never gotten this involved with a movie before. I was literally gripping my seat through its entirety. The style can be compared to a driving video game. Some people prefer to play with the perspective behind the car so that they can admire the cars/scenery and have more awareness of the surroundings. Others choose to play in first-person mode which emphasizes the speed of the car and generally provides an experience closer to that of the driver.Many people complain about the constant camera shaking making them uncomfortable. I have major motion sickness, but I got through and felt only slightly disoriented at parts. The rest of you should be fine.This is definitely one of those movies that you have to watch in the movie theater. The big screen and speakers allow for a truly immersive experience, so go out and watch it. At least see if you like it or not. Then you'll know whether to avoid these kind of movies in the future.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A good popcorn movie,"I really liked it. I had my doubts before watching it but I was surprised of how entertaining this movie was.I liked the characters, the special effects, and the plot of the movie, specially the meaning that anyone can make anything for love. I also liked the final that is not Hollywood's style.This movie is similar to ""The Blair Witch Project"" in that we see ""Cloverfield"" through what has been recorded by some of its characters by a hand-held video camera along the movie (with some small scenes of what has been recorded before the movie has began).The plot is about a group of people in their twenties who are in a leaving party in NY when suddenly an enormous monster appears killing people in the city forcing everybody to evacuate, but this group of friends will stay to rescue a love interest of one of them.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Cloverfield: Midnight Showing,"At one point in the movie, one character echoes the famous words from the original home-video horror flick The Blair Witch Project: ""I'm so scared."" Only in Cloverfield what they encounter is much more scary and life-threatening than a crazy lady running through the woods. Cloverfield is a 90 minute roller-coaster ride that will increase your adrenaline as much as it will increase your dire need for a vomit bag.Rob is leaving for Japan for his career and a surprise party is thrown on his behalf. Hud takes up the responsibility of cameraman, whose purpose is to document the farewell testimonies. This provided an interesting way to introduce the characters and gave insight into their personalities and relationships. Telling a story through this style of filming could be pretty difficult, but Cloverfield actually pulls it off. You even grow fond of some of the characters in the process, which is especially important for a movie that depends on the survival of the characters. It also helps that the actors gave likable and pretty convincing performances.The party is interrupted by a series of tremors, a short blackout, and a flurry of fireballs flying through the air. New York is under attack. From then on you are sucked into a crazy trip through the panic of the dismantled city as Hud decides to continue videotaping the events, knowing that the world will want to see what exactly happened that night in New York City.Although the movie offers a great story of bravery and camaraderie, that's not what anyone cares about right? Everyone wants to know what ""It"" is. Trust me. ""It"" is something far more ugly and terrifying than a giant cuddly ape.Going into the movie, you of course need to suspend a little disbelief. Aside from the monster itself, you also have to accept their ability to somehow escape certain situations; otherwise it would be a much shorter movie. If I were documenting the whole thing the video would probably last five minutes. To make up for it, little details are thrown in to maintain the atmosphere of authenticity, taking pictures of the head of a decapitated Statue of Liberty with a cell phone camera for example, or the looters who horde the electronics store amidst all the chaos.The special effects are completely mind-blowing. The Toyota Tacoma and ""Ratchet and Clank"" commercials really did something special when they combined special effects with the home video feel. Cloverfield takes this concept to the maximum extreme and does an excellent job making the surreal as real as it can get.The suspense will get to you. There are times that make you jump and times that make you cringe. The end will either leave you wanting more or begging for it to be over. No matter what the case, Cloverfield is an experience you will never forget. (Word of advice: DO NOT sit in the first five rows, especially in IMAX. Big mistake.)",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
It's was cool and great !!,"Man, today I went to the cinema to watch this movie since the trailer blew me out. With such high expectations, I hope this movie will deliver as good as in the trailer, not like AVP2 (quite disappointed..sorry) and it turns out that it was a great movie. Although the movie borrowed the concept from ""The Blair Witch Project"" and ""Godzilla"", it does delivered the people satisfaction. It feels like we, as the viewers are inside the movie, having the same situation as the innocent people of Manhattan. I can't imagine how we are going to survive the day. Anyway, every movie has its own pros and cons. The movie does delivered some unanswered questions, such as ""What did really happened to Marlena Diamond ?"", ""Did the couple died at the end of the movie?"", ""What happened to the monster?""..yeah, it does have a cliffhanger ending but overall, I found this movie is well worth of watching and job well done to the director and the whole crew of ""Cloverfield"".",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

There is no plot to follow, no character development and quite frequently when action is taking place, the camera is out of focus or not pointing towards the action at all.

In fact, a similar occurrence HAS happened in real life and in my opinion is the message of this film.

Fun,"I liked this! Cloverfield is basically Godzilla for the 21st century. There is no plot except for: Alien monster destroys New York and people freak out.The movie lives of the way it's shot. The hand-held camera IS the movie. We've seen the carnage before, the monsters, the battles, the turmoil ... just never from this perspective. It works great! (Although it's not the reinvention of the wheel that J.J.Abrams wants us to believe - Blair Witch Project ... hello?) There is nothing much to judge ""objectively"". The camera-work inherently belittles any acting performance, since there's rarely a steady shot of any actor. The same goes for the special effects or the directing of crowd sequences, etc. But at the end of it all, experienced through the shaky first person perspective, the movie feels sufficiently realistic.The only thing that I didn't like was the voice of the camera man Hud. He annoyed me. His comments were off and people mostly ignored him (rightfully so).I'm giving it 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Accomplished with particular nature, but several flaws at the expense of thrill","I am not a typical viewer of related works, but, from time to and ""on request"" from friends or relatives, I am in for them - especially when they are not long.As my prior information did not include any famous actors and I was briefed about the basics, I decided to focus on scenes and their structuring. The ""introduction"", however, was too long, and when ""the hell broke loose"", then odd things occurred not possible in such situations, e.g. maintenance of lighting or GSM coverage, and if/when explosions widen and buildings crash closer and closer, people do not remain on the streets and follow them, but run away or find shelter asap. Thus, many of subsequent scenes were airy-fairy, and the found- footage style just added tension (true, I have to admit, quite capably), but again: no way the cam and the film inside could last until the so-called end.So, all in all, Cloverfield is just another mind- and technology- twisting creation meant for them completely in following the events, moods and twists.

Cloverfield,"Cloverfield is about a group of young adults who while having a party discover that some enormous creature is rampaging through the streets and that buildings are being destroyed and people are dying. The film features only a handful of main characters fleeing from the monster and one of them has a hand-held camera with him, so basically what he films is what we see. There were things I liked about Cloverfield and some things that only made it an okay film for me instead of a great one. The whole idea of a film being seen from the hand-held camera point of view isn't exactly new, but I thought the filmmakers did an interesting twist with this and it gave us a more personal side to the people running from the creature. While the hand-held camera movements were very shaky and did make me kind of motion sick and nauseated, I still appreciated this original way of storytelling and handling the movie. Another thing I liked about the film is that even though it is released by a big mainstream distributor and got a wide release, it didn't really feel like a big Hollywood movie at all because of how everything happened realistically and for a monster film it didn't really feel all that preposterous at times because of how real the characters, their situation and how they handled it was. Also there are not a lot of big fancy special effects, or camera tricks here making the film look more gritty and real. Because the film is not predictable and doesn't suffer from old horror movie formulas that have been done to death I applauded the film for it's original take on this genre of film as well as the direction and storytelling. Other than making me a bit nauseated, which I don't count as a negative feeling for the movie the only real problem I had with the film is that it started to drag a bit in the middle and the suspense and intensity of the film as well as the characters really started to die off for me in the second half. Had it been a little more suspenseful and had a little bit more action, or just anything else to keep my interest up, it would have made this film a really good one rather than just an okay one. Still, I was pleased that a mainstream Hollywood company would release a film as different and original as this, so I can say that that impresses me, but the film itself is only okay and I do feel it could have been a bit better.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

The First of it's kind,"This movie is the first widespread, big screen pic that uses the first-person aspect, and it was phenomenal. Matt Reeves (the director) got it as close to realism as humanly possible with the movie still entertaining. Now everyone's seen the big monster movies and all the stereotypical things that come to with the title of a monster movie, but the one thing that was different was that it took place in America from start to finish. No other monster/disaster movie can claim that. People want to see the famous city of N.Y. get crushed by a giant alien because the people who live and have visited N.Y. can say 'hey, I know that place, that's pretty cool!'

An extraordinary intelligent movie experience,"Whow - This is one of the best monster/sci-fi movies i've seen in the past. I've only seen the trailer beforehand and all I knew was: big monster - large explosions - city gets destroyed. Perfect, exactly my kind of flick - no expectations, just the usual action movie.I was so wrong.The ""first-person-view"" makes the entire experience feel very realistic and believable, especially with all the cuts at the right moments and the sporadic ""backflashes"" to the content that was already on-tape of the camera. The constant cam shaking, especially when people start to run for their life, totally adds up to the ""realism"" this movie tries to screen. You wouldn't stand still to film burning cars flying through the air, would you? Every now and then, small, little things are added in the background that you hardly notice the first time watching, but they add just another layer of realism. News channels start reporting on the current events, military aircraft fly by, sirens start to announce the state of emergency etc. The producers thought of countless things that would happen in real life - and you sit there and feel like you're in the middle of the story and everything is happening just around you. right now.The sounds fit perfectly and are very realistic, and .... there is no music. seriously, i didn't even notice there's no music until i read similar comments here on IMDb. Added on top: special effects that look so real you won't even notice they're ""special effects"" - and at some point you start to wonder if maybe, just maybe, this did happen for real and you're watching *real* footage from a video camera.Finally, not everything in this movie is being explained, like, where did the monster come from or what happens after the end of the film? I feel sorry for you people who hate this movie because of this, but thats the point where you usually start using your imagination.Summed up, this movie is so well done. Contrary to the ""low quality hand-held-camera point of view""-filming style this is 100% intelligent cinema entertainment. Recommended!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

True survival horror.,"I hate clichés. I hate when Hollywood takes a story that everyone has known since they were old enough to use the toilet and people think it's utterly amazing. As far as horror movies go, that includes everything from Disturbia to Sweeney Todd. I am shockedREALLY shocked to say that list does not include Cloverfield.Yes, you've heard the story before. (Well, as far as this movie goes, that is. Who knows what the final plot will end up being.) But when it comes to this movie, really, who cares? The only thing I can compare the way this movie made me feel to was the original Alien. The characters were as realistic as really being at a real party. The camera just simply adds yet another added layer of realism. The plot was realistic, as I would have done nothing different than the main characters. I never once would have thought I would be writing the word ""Hollywood"" and ""realism"" anywhere near the same sentence.The whole adventure is just awesome when I look back at it. I feel like I just witnessed some of the coolest scenes ever captured on filmthe bridge, the helicopter, ""We have a bite!"", even the party.I'll never think of movie intensity the same way again.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
It was neither realistic nor unrealistic.,"At the beginning of the film, it was quite realistic. Some friends of the main character was being given a good-by party for him. The ex-girl friend of the main character was there with her new boyfriend, too. They argued and the woman went her flat. By that time, everything was normal. After the man went upstairs of her apartment, an explanation occurred because of monster's smashing the sea. Then, the monster was a huge creature and it was eating people. In addition, it was destroying the buildings and bridge. Everybody was trying to escape from it and not to be eaten by it. At that time, the main character and a few friends of his was truing to find the woman who was the ex-girlfriend of the main Chara. After a huge effort, they arrive at the apartment where she used to lived and rescued her. Next, they went out with their camera. The main character introduced himself to camera. Then the army bombed the whole city so that they could kill the monster. They killed not only the monster but also the main character and his girlfriend. After then, the camera was found by some tourists and seen.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A perfect mix of genre,"Two of my favorite genres are found footage and kaiju, and this film combines them perfectly, normally scripted found footage never ends up good (cough cough Megan is Missing), and it usually has to rely on the actors being in complete mystery (think Blair Witch), however unlike most found footage films, Cloverfield was made by an actual Hollywood company and not some garage, meaning actual good actors were used. Now enough bashing my second favorite film genre, although it's not my favorite film, Cloverfield is super rewatchable, and is a great film if you're into this kinda stuff!

Brilliant,"Despite the awful style the movie was shot in, it was really a genius flick. From the story perspective it did not leave the viewer wanting, in my opinion.

I could go on and on about how much this movie rules but, instead, I shall end my praise and go and watch this flick again.

"""People need to see this, you know...""","When I first saw the teaser trailer for this movie in the summer of 2007, I was psyched. The image of the Statue of Liberty's head being tossed across Manhatten to land in the streets was enough to hook me. I had to know what it was that was tearing New York to shreds. When I finally got to see the film in mid-January 2008, I felt it lived up to the months of hype surrounding it. The movie puts a new spin on an old concept: it's your usual monster movie with a giant creature stomping through New York but it's told from the perspective of a group of people caught in the middle.Some people are turned off by this film because it's shot entirely from the perspective of a home video camera carried by one of the characters, Hud (probably my favorite character, played by T.J. Miller). As a result of this odd style, the camera is frequently shaky and sometimes disorienting. People with motion sickness should probably just steer clear (or invest in some Dramamine). For those without inner ear issues, it's worth checking out. The home camera POV places you right in the middle of the action, as if you were running right there with them. We see the destruction and, more importantly, the creature from their perspective. At first, we're only treated to short glimpses of the creature...a tail here, a foot there. As the film progresses, we get to see more and more.I personally thought this movie was awesome (even better once it hit DVD...seems easier to watch on the small screen). The unknown actors that were cast in this movie do a great job, giving you reasons to hope they don't end up creature-fodder. The creature is probably the coolest monster to come out of American cinema in years (and it's tons better than that Godzilla fiasco from the 90's). The somber ending (which I won't go into detail on) leaves you wanting more, though not in a bad way. I just wished the movie was longer; the 85 minute running time flies by. The movie take a little while to get into the meat of the action but it soars by when it finally does.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Accidental lovechild of Godzilla and the Blair Witch,"On the back of one of the most intricate viral marketing campaigns of all-time, Matt Reeves directs the contemporary monster movie Cloverfield, one for the 'YouTube generation', as some have described it. Generating immense hype through the posting of ambiguous images on the film's own spin-off website (1-18-08.com), it almost felt as if Cloverfield had grabbed the entire internet population by the throat, and forced it to uncover the mystery of what exactly has caused so much unexplainable damage to Manhattan. Ultimately, however, the exploits of those who attempted to unravel this enigma seemed more entertaining and fulfilling than the film itself.The film pits a group of beautiful, rich New Yorkers we've never heard of against a giant beast bent on destruction, its motives unclear. In fact, the secrecy surrounding the monster itself was one of the few positives of the film. We never learn where the creature is from, what disturbed it, or even what it looks like in its entirety. Positively, this gets the viewer interested and constantly wanting more (a fantastic environment for a director to work in). Unfortunately, the 'more' never comes, and we are left dissatisfied in every other department.Not only does Cloverfield end far too abruptly, but it does so without really offering any sort of climax. Now, I'm all for innovation in storytelling, and sometimes that can be achieved to great effect with a non-linear plot, but not in this instance. A film built around suspense and senseless action needs to wrap itself up accordingly. That's not just my opinion; its common- sense filmmaking. Because of the final scene, many have criticised the way Cloverfield blatantly plagiarises The Blair Witch Project.I feel this to be a rash statement. Yes, the similarities are there, but one can, in fact, see the direction Reeves has taken in ending the film this way. He tried to create something unique and unexpected, and he succeeded, but for all the wrong reasons. And unlike Blair Witch, where we feel the same sense of terror as the characters (probably because it doesn't feel like a piece of fiction), there is no effort made by the protagonists in Cloverfield to incite audience emotion; the poor acting and lacklustre screenplay keeping us from suspending our disbelief.And of course, there is the camera-work. Once again, I can appreciate the effort made to give the film a point-of-sale, but if the hand-held camera (which acts as our only window in for the entire two-hour run time) dosen't give you motion sickness by film's end, it will definitely annoy you. I fell into the latter category upon first viewing, but it must be noted that I didn't watch it on the big screen. I can only imagine the effect it would have had on people watching on a screen fifty times the size of mine, with no surrounding lighting to minimise the nauseating movement on-screen.That is precisely the type of blunder that can damage a film's reputation even before release, in both a critical and commercial sense. No film can ever be considered a critical success if its falls below the expectations generated through an advertising campaign, and this is the case with Cloverfield.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review.*",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A false documentary,"CLOVERFIELD is a movie that - like THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT did some years ago  is based on a false documentary. I mean there's an amateur film, shot in the first person, about something else and then something strange, which was definitely not supposed to happen, occurs, creating the point of interest of this false documentary. That's what happened with THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and that's what happens with CLOVERFIELD. However there're too many differences between these two movies, and almost all of them, in a good point, in favour of CLOVERFIELD. I can tell two of them: First, CLOVERFIELD never tries to induce the viewer that what was been taped was real, was actually truth, unlike BLAIR WITCH which tried to do so with terrible consequences... Second, the plot is very different and definitely CLOVERFIELD has a lot more of action, interest and suspense. Yet the ending is very similar and, again, too many people claimed a typical ""Oh, that's it? Has it already ended?!"" But in my opinion I think it's a very good ending, the most logical one, and it could have happened even earlier I must say! About CLOVERFIELD I have to tell I enjoyed the experience of seeing a false documentary shot in the first person, more than I did with the BLAIR WITCH.

This is an age-old story of survival. And its brilliant.,"Cloverfield is like nothing I've ever seen before. It grabs hold of you and doesn't let go.

Then something strikes the city.Out of no-where, explosions are seen in the distance, and the action spills out from the party onto the street. It's mayhem, dust and debris everywhere, and then the statue of liberties decapitated head comes rolling into shot.The camera is controlled by a member of the cast, it is shaky and nervy, and gives you a real sense of panic and disbelief. It's the closest they can do to transporting you directly into the panic and horror of the situation.This film takes an established genre, and gives it a bold and innovative twist.

It feels like being right there,"I just watched Cloverfield for the 2nd time after a few years, and I have to say: wow - this is great entertainment in the first place. A science-fiction-horror found footage that doesn't scare the viewers to death, that doesn't use gruesomeness and gore in order to create tension. But there is extremely tension anyway, there isn't a single boring minute in the movie. After 15 minutes of introduction of the characters, there is non-stop action and excitement. It feels like being right there, witnessing the chaos and panic. And there are really good visual effects.One critique point: the guy who was picked for the job of filming the party, must have been the worst choice of all persons in the party. Apparently, the worst choice in the whole city of New York. He never holds the camera still when it's needed. Never. Not for even 2 seconds.

There was a mix of good and bad acting, a lot of the scenes were convincing, some weren't so much. The one thing that really bothered me all the way through, though, is how bad they ripped off Blair Witch Project. There were quite a few scenes and some lines that seemed to have been copied directly from that movie.

"Has a lot of potential, but does not quite make it through.","I had not heard that much about Cloverfield when I first saw a trailer on the internet, but it did look good. The idea of narrating a story through the lens of a camera had been seen before, but the idea of making a disaster movie this way still appealed to me, though I was not expecting much, but still hoped to get that wow effect which is very much in demand these days. The movie and the ideas behind it really had potential and succeeds at some points to capture and engage the audience because you feel like you are in the middle of the crisis. Unfortunately some issues relating to physics etc. is able to spoil the movie if one thinks very logically. The movie has for instance been criticized for lacking realistic physics relating to the cameraman. A point which can also be seen as a let down for the audience and more or less destroying the reality factor, is the quality of the video, which is quite good. This is of course to make the movie as good in quality as any other cinematic movies, but some might still think that this is a flaw and makes the movie lose a bit of its supposed atmosphere. At points the animation of the monsters look a bit misplaced and it is clear that they are animated creatures. It is hard to criticize this because the perception of the human is much harder to convince in this age of technology than ever before, so it is difficult to make animated characters that look genuine, especially the fictional ones. There is no musical score, obviously, but the sound effects are very good and when you sit in the cinema while gun bullets hiss and military tanks works it way through the streets, the sound really makes it all come to life. Again the sound is in a bit of an over quality state for a normal handy-cam, but it does not spoil the film too much. The acting part is overall okay, but not perfect. They are able to make the movie experience endurable, but again, they do not add up to the wow factor that they could have.To sum up Cloverfield is a justifiable movie and easy to watch as the story is not that complex. It also tries to show the audience the innermost urges and instincts that follow with trying to survive and it both delivers and fails at doing so. The idea of narrating the story through the lens of a camera has got some real potential, but the top of the peak has not yet been reached. It is all a matter of time before a big breakthrough is made and meanwhile one must just wait and see. See through the lens of progression.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
What a movie!,"What do you get if you combine THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and GODZILLA? You get that movie. What a way to start the year. This film pays homage to the classic giant monster movies like KING KONG, THE BEAST FROM 20'000 FATHOMS and THEM plus some ma-sized or smaller than man monster films like Dracula (1931) and ALIEN (1979). Now why did I mention Dracula (which is a favorite of mine)? Here's why. There is one scene where they guy rescues his girl-friend and she has a metal bar impaled through her and he takes it off of her off-camera! Just like the way the title vampire gets killed. I also mention ALIEN because there is one scene where you see the small monster comes bursting out of the girl and growls about, which sounds like Donald Duck having a fecal fit or Homestar Runner's The Cheat loosing his mind.Now when I saw the monster, it was sooo original and scary looking. In fact, it could make THE HOST look like a tadpole, King Kong look like a chimpanzee or Godzilla look like Barney. The gigantic beast (created at Tippet Studios, lead by JURASSIC PARK animator Phil Tippet) looks so imaginative, it contains characteristics of various animals (the tail looked like those of an eel).At the end credits, it the music sounded like those of Danny Elfman (MEN IN BLACK, THE SIMPSONS and the SPIDERMAN trilogy) and Akira Ifukube (who did music to a lot Japanese fantasy and science fiction films, but he was known for doing the score to the original GODZILLA). After the credits, you hear a voice, if you mess it around, it says ""Help us."" or ""It still lives.""After the film was a monster smash (no pun intended) at the box office, there was fan-art running rampant on Deviant Art (such as chibi-cloverfield, cute eh?), parodies like the one digital short in Saturday NIGHT LIVE and like KING KONG and THE BEAST FROM 20'000 FATHOMS, imitations of cheesy proportions like Asylum's MONSTER, the low-budget independent schlock-fest MONSTER MOVIE and the porno version, CLEAVAGEFIELD.Usually movies released in the beginning of the year are boring, and not impressive Until there was ELECTRA in 2005. In 2008, there was CLOVERFIELD. I highly recommend it!Rated PG-13 for violence, language, nudity, gore and scary going-ons.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"An actually good ""found footage"" movie.","The monster movie genre died, and Cloverfield was it's last breath. While it didn't bring the genre back, the ""Clover Monster"" is know as recognizable as Godzilla or King Kong to most movie fans. And it's easy to see why.The movie is quite simple, it follows 5 friends - Rob, Lilly, Marlena, Jason, and Hud, as they flee from Rob's going away party to rescue their friend Beth while a 200 ft-tall monster unleashes hell on New York City.Except for T.J. Miller, I knew most no one in the film and the acting is actually really good. It's writing is good too, everything is scripted to seem like real life, and it does a good job of it. It has a simple subplot and thank gosh the movie doesn't have the Clover Monster as the main character.This movie is definitely the best modern-day monster movie. We don't see a lot, and most are bad. Pacific Rim (2013) wasn't bad, but Godzilla (2014) wanted to have a subplot like Cloverfield, and failed, and King Kong (2005) tried to make the large ape a character to relate to, yet that obviously is impossible.My only complaints would be just a tad bit more screen time for the Clover Monster, and also a good backstory for the beast. I had to look it up, but it makes sense and also ties in with the subplot and main character in an ironic and kind of funny way. I won't say it because it may count as a spoiler. But I think I can live wit these problems.At the sound of it, Cloverfield sounds like an unbearable movie to watch, and it's not The Shawshank Redemption (1994) or The Dark Knight (2008) but it's good. It's a solid action/horror film that deserves another look and a higher rating from critics and moviegoers.Now excuse me, I have to go watch 10 Cloverfield Lane (2016) because I want to know just what the heck happened at the end there.

Monsters are much scarier if you don't see them constantly, and they just pop into view briefly and unexpectedly.I thought the whole idea of starting the movie off like a love story, and then totally changing the type of movie after a quarter of the way through was an extremely clever plot device. It's what kept the movie completely unexpected for me.Some people complained about feeling nauseous from the hand-held camera movement effects.

Frenetic and in-the-moment but ever-so-slightly one-note.,"'Cloverfield (2008)' is an insular alien invasion film that puts its focus on its in-the-moment, frenetic action as our characters scramble to survive the large-scale situation in which they're placed. This is really all it does with any degree of certainty - or confidence, perhaps - as it lacks the character depth or narrative prowess to provide any deeper investment or, even, enjoyment. The hand-held, found-footage style is usually handled well and most of the piece is believable (a few dodgy effects aside). It's no more believable than it would've been if filmed traditionally, though, and the lack of any extra personality or intimacy, which could've quite easily come with such a conceit, makes it feel ever-so-slightly one note; it's certainly no 'Searching (2018)', that's for sure. However, there's entertainment to be had when the alien threat puts our core players - and almost, by extension, us - in real, hectic danger. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Above average monster movie,"Matt Reeves' Cloverfield remains popular for all the wrong reasons. Many know it as ""the monster movie that causes motion sickness"", and as many don't give the film a chance because of this, they are missing out on a chillingly effective monster movie.The concept of a found footage monster movie is quite ambitious. How can the sheer scale of a monster movie be properly showcased without the use of cinematic camera-work? In many ways, Cloverfield is brilliant, becoming on of the most intense monster movies I've ever seen, without the use of these grandiose cinematics and overblown action. Nearly all of the film remains on ground level, which adds copious amounts of tension and works at making the viewer feel utterly helpless. The scenes in which the monster towers almost directly over the camera are heart-pounding as we can't help but marvel at the technical scope this movie achieves. And while many complain that the monster remains hidden for the majority of the film, that only makes these surprise appearances all the more terrifying. The special effects are nothing short of spectacular, despite what the direction gimmick may lead some to believe.Cloverfield features a cast of characters that are surprisingly likable, even if they are walking clichés and remain underdeveloped by the credits, but in a film like this, I would be lying if I said it wasn't fitting.The only real issues I had with Cloverfield was the incompetent story and, at times, the camera-work. The story of Cloverfield is reasonably simple, as it should be, but even as our characters set themselves a definitive goal, we keep getting pulled into tiring side stories that don't seem to have much affect on the film whatsoever. The sequence in which our characters are rescuing a friend from an almost horizontal skyscraper, drags on and isn't particularly engaging. While it does serve as a breather from the rest of the film's intensity, it does effect the pacing of the film as a whole. While I do believe that the infamously shaky camera-work benefits the film more than hinder it, it does at times go too far. The scenes become almost incoherently shaky at times, not really adding much to the viewer's experience other than a migraine.While the young adult drama and jittery camera work suggests a quality no less than amateurish, the masterful use of scale and sparing utilization of the nerve-racking creature sightings makes Cloverfield anything but.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

To say that J.J.Abrams and Matt Reeves make an awesome movie-making couple just doesn't say it. I loved the movie they had made a couple of years ago, The Pallbearer. This is contrast at it highest point. It's like Laurel and Hardy decided to make movies, and it was oh so good.Yes, Cloverfield is a monster movie. But, unlike the monster movies which have been made more recently, this one works. It's from the point of view a a few 20-something's living in New York on the night of a farewell party. It's Blair Witch style. But better. It's Godzilla, but more terrifying. It's fear, its pain, its horror, its loud, its everything. All packaged into an hour and fifteen minutes of a roller coaster ride.It is a look into the monster attack on Manhattan on 22nd-23rd May, 2007 recorded on a hand-held camera found in Central Park. The name of the movie is basically the name of the sighting. Read : Multiple sightings of case designated Cloverfield.What I enjoyed most was the hype created before its release. No one had a clue what it would be like. Whether the monster was Godzilla, some dragon, etc etc. I recognized no one in the cast except Jessica Lucas, whom I had seen on Life As We Know It and The L word. So, it was even more of a surprise for me. The casting is perfect, mind you. I haven't seen a bunch of 20-something's running for their lives more horrifically in my life. You can feel the terror. It's like its sitting there right beside you.There is no background music. Its real time sound. Man, is it loud. Man, is it freaky. There's just something about the fact that there's a 400 foot monster roaming around somewhere near you that freaks anyone out. And that ain't all. Wait till you find out that its dropping little many-legged thingies making sounds like 'ayayayayaya' which could tear you limb from limb. Not just that. If you happen to get bitten by those little thingies, guess what happens.. You explode!! (Sorry for letting that go. I just could not help it) Behind all the horror and all the havoc of this 'monster', their lies a very well pronounced story. Something that most films lack these days. A bunch of people trying to save a loved one. It ain't no tear-jerker, but its bound to make you care for the characters. That, added with ""Dude, I really think we shouldn't be here"", and stuff that happens so fast that you'll go,'What the Hell was that!?""makes Cloverfield one of the best creature feature's you'll ever watch. Just listen to the havoc when the severed head of the Statue of Liberty falls to the streets. You'll know what fear is.Cloverfield is short, exhilarating, sad, scary, all at the same time. It leaves certain questions unanswered. Even the closing credits were scary. I hear they're making a sequel. Eat your heart out King Kong and Godzilla. I was hooked on to this, from the time the thump hit and I saw that red robot running around the bushes. Then came the writing, Bad Robot Pictures. And the movie began..9/10 for acting. 9/10 for story. 9/10 for direction. Straight 10 for the music. And I cannot get enough of the dizzy camera!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Lives up to Expectations,"Everything people had dreaded did not occur! The monster was hidden enough so that you only see most of the monster. You will not be disappointed! The acting at times can be a little low key at times, but overall the cast carries through the film, becoming characters the audience can empathize with. Rob especially delivers an emotional performance.The cinematography captures the events through the point-of-view of a camcorder, allowing the audience to feel like they're a part of the experience. The chaos of the attack and the army's attempts to stop the monster is perfect for the sometimes disorienting camera angles and movement.The monster is nothing like any fan imagined and fulfills all expectations and hopes. It truly is the perfect destructor.The scares are provided at a fast enough pace to give you time to recompose yourself. They go beyond the typical jump scene and provide the viewer with a fresh meaning to on-screen scares, with realistic details giving it the realistic edge of people's reactions to the terrifying wrath of the creature.Overall, Cloverfield fulfills most hopes and is dripping with Abram's genius and suspense, with the originality and thrills of Lost and Alias. This is surely one movie that any cinema goer, frequent or not, cannot pass up",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Delivers it's promises,"I have been waiting for this movie ever since I caught a glimpse of the teaser on the net with great anticipation. I was really expecting a disappointment, very much like the last half hour of I Am Legend. But where I am Legend fails, Cloverfield delivers to the fullest.It leaves you hanging by the edge if the seat, there are times that when you want to to grab the camera yourself ti see what's going to happen.It's scary and edgy and exciting and some scenes do remind you of 9/11, but not in a cheesy way. Most surprising for an American action flick is the lack of cheese. (Again, I Am Legend is the perfect example on how to ruin a great idea)In short it's a very exciting movie, very well done and acted, worthwhile seeing and a definite must see on the big screen",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
What do young people who are familiar to YouTube think about this movie?,"The steadicam shot how people escaped from a large mysterious creature what came up suddenly like a video recording.

Nobody would be happy.

"Overall, I really liked it!","I saw this movie today with some friends of mine, who really loved it up until the ending. At first, I couldn't believe the ending. It was so...abrupt. And unexpected. But after thinking about it, it totally made sense.This movie does not have a lot of elaboration or conclusion. It's simply a videotape recorded by a group of people who really didn't intend to get it on video anyway. I LOVE how the whole thing is like a home video. After thinking about this movie more and more, I realized how much I liked it. It was very clever, and just a good action movie. While it got very gory, and a couple parts made me jump, overall it was just really good. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who wants a movie with closure, though, because the ending does not give it. That may just be the best thing about the movie though.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Really, It is worth watching film...","Hence it is extremely short and extremely bad. Heard a deafening noise from a bar in New York City, guests at the bar down the stairs trying to escape the turmoil in the streets of New York occupies a flaming wreckage and debris. Following is a terrible explosion at Manhattan, the Statue of Liberty's head, just like giant cannon to hit the street. New York attacked by a monster in the history of the people who testified. Type in the maximum managed to convince me that a real film '' Cloverfield''.There were some points of criticism. Overall, the movie was worth watching film.The stereotype of the end came. Apparently an army of aggressive, man-sized bugs with giant mandibles just isn't enough of a threat. I do not think that is a waste of time or a bad movie. I like to have seen a lot worse. I'm a bad movie, do not think that. Too bad I can't say very nice movie but never watched a movie, so if you have some free time. Not bad, nice sound effects, acting administers the scenario may be called a movie worth watching.The effects look great and realistic thanks to the hand-held camera, which isn't too bad-looking if you manage to get a seat further from the screen. No credits whatsoever, which just adds to the overall immediacy of it.To be completely honest, I am satisfied. I will say no more but this- watch this film. Don't go finding too much out, just watch, and get taken to a place most fiction movies aren't able to transport viewers to. The movie did have a few funny parts, and a few scary parts, but having the whole thing through the viewpoint of a video camera ruined it overall.

"Quite possibly the ""King Kong"" of this generation","Wow... just, just wow. This film was, without a doubt, one of the most incredible films I have seen in recent years. I expected something along the lines of Emmerich's Godzilla, but I was very wrong. From the moment this film starts, it's addicting. You immediately begin to wonder about these characters, will they live or die? Cloverfield is about a group of people who are throwing a going away party to their friend Rob, who is leaving to Japan for a business promotion. During the party, however, all hell breaks loose when an ""earthquake"" strikes the city (New York City). After an explosion, and the Statue of Liberty scene, they go on a journey to find Beth, Rob's ex-lover, who is trapped in her apartment.Acting was very good from everyone is the picture. With no-names running the show, I was surprised at how good they were, considering monster films can be some of the hardest films to act in. And with a 30 million dollar budget, they did a lot. That is very little for a film(the average is about 70-100 million). J.J. and his team did a fantastic job on this film. With the mixed reviews, I was worried about everything that would happen, would it be worth the money I paid for a ticket? Guess what? The answer is, without a doubt, yes.J.J., Mr. Reaves, and everyone else involved, I hope your proud, because it was one hell of a ride.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not a movie, just a home video","I have yet to figure out how ""Cloverfield"" is a movie, it's just a home video.And no, I'm not just insulting it. It really is a home video. The ""characters"" are introduced to us through way of home video shots at a party. I'm assuming the film-makers thought this would make me feel more connected to the so-called characters, but it did the opposite. I was more distanced and I didn't care about them, worse than that, after so long of this party nonsense, I didn't care who the characters were anymore. But then something happens.The something was some kind of disaster that they weren't sure about at the beginning. Could be an earthquake, or could be some external presence. But remember this is all shot as a home video. Can you imagine what your home video would look like if an earthquake or some other disaster occurred? Yes, that's right, not much was captured. Lots of feet shots and screams of ""what's going on?"".The whole ""movie"" was pretty much shaky shots of people screaming and then shots of the ground as they start running. But you couldn't expect much more from a home video.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Gripping. . .,"I wouldn't say this is one of my favorite movies but it was well worth renting. I initially expected the monster to be something different than what it turned out to be but still had a great time watching it. The things I liked the most about the movie were in the way it was filmed. Many people complain profusely about the camera moving and bouncing around, but hey, you were told about that before seeing it, so I don't know why you rented it if that bothers you. If that would bother you, don't rent it. If you didn't like the way ""The Blair Witch"" was filmed or you get motion-sickness from it, you probably won't like this movie.The best thing about the camera bouncing around, to me, is that practically everyone has operated a video camera at one time or another and the home-video feel of the movie immediately connects you to the actors in a way that a professional handling wouldn't. You feel like you are one of these people going through this experience in a way that the Godzilla movies can't invite you to participate (although I do love all the Godzilla movies, Japanese and American). I was genuinely ""on the edge of my seat"" and I haven't felt that way watching a horror movie in quite a while. Actually, the only ""critical"" thing I could say about the movie is that the detached Statue of Liberty's head just doesn't look big enough to me.",,Anonymous,Horror
A movie that doesn't insult your intelligence!,"Cloverfield was one of the best movies ever. It is definitely worth your time and money. Of all the negative comments I've read for this movie, about 95% of them hate it because of the ""shaky camera"" or the ""stupid ending"". If the camera was too shaky and you actually got sick, that's one thing, however I've found that people are saying that just to have another reason to hate it. The ending was 100% brilliant. Finally we have a movie that makes the audience THINK! People that hate Cloverfield's ending are the people who watch blockbusters like ""First Sunday"" or ""One Missed Call"", or are just used to the crap that Disney and Hollywood has shoved down their mouths for years where EVERY question is answered and EVERYONE lives happily ever after.This movie is intense, has a realistic response to this kind of crisis, and overall is amazing.

"""Something has found us""","Revolves around a monster attack in New York as told from the point of view of a small group of people.Blair Witch Project was the beginning of a new genre, these found footage films. They're main priority is to make you feel like your on in the action, and most of them work... Cloverfield starts off like an average teenage film. It uses some interesting filming techniques, as it switches to different people over and over. Your introduced to each character pretty quick, but luckily it works. Next, the tension is pretty interesting because you'll never guess how this 'thing' is going to appear. The attack hits, the movie progresses, and some pretty cool scenes play. I was fully immersed in the action, and I surely enjoyed myself. The main problem I had with Cloverfield is how hard it tried to be something creative, or new. I was fully into it, and such, but at times I was asking myself why did they even do this? Not in a bad way, but sometimes it annoyed me. Otherwise, the movie was pretty good. The acting was pretty average. For new actors that I have never seen, they did good on their part, and I wasn't yelling out how 'unrealistic' it was. The special effects were the highlight of this film. It looked so real at times, but others fell short. The 'found footage' aspect gave the special effects a more realistic and intense feel to it, which I loved. All in all, I enjoyed my thoroughly. If your looking for something new in these found footage films, or even action in general, you will be surprised. Some parts MIGHT set you off, but overall it was good. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Good, fun and exciting","This movie in my opinion was a very well done and enjoyable. Unlike most monster movies, you don't ever actually see much of the monster, which leaves you in major suspense. As noted, the entire film is shot in a style of a home video camera. If you don't like that type of look, don't bother going, because that is the main selling point of the movie. I found the movie its self to be very fun and at times edge of your set action. Although some may not like it for the lack of monster screen time, it seemed that it made it more realistic. As you can tell, I really enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys this type of movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Cloverfield,"The kaiju genre is one of the best inventions ever dreamed up in Japanese soil. It literally translates as ""strange monster"", and that's exactly what it is, movies centered around the sudden arrival of a giant-sized, spectacularly ugly and scary monster in the middle of Tokyo. Staples of the genre are crumbling buildings, the giant foot of the beast stepping on a poor jap that stumbled while running, mayhem and generally useless military activity. I think the first Asian movie I ever saw was Mothra, which is about a giant butterfly monster invoked by the strange chantings of miniature twin geishas. Of course, the most famous kaiju monster is the reptilian anti-hero Godzilla. On his first movie he's a destroyer of humanity, yet on subsequent films he saves Earth from a gallery of creatures, presumably so he can earn back his title as its main nuclear nightmare. In 1998, there was an unfortunate American version of Godzilla which pretty much was an attempt at Jurassic Park on NYC. The movie featured an unrealistic evacuation of Manhattan. Now that US has been through 9/11, I think they've sort of earned the right to make a Godzilla movie. After all, Godzilla is nothing but a '50s metaphor for nuclear horror.The catch here is the Blair Witch Project gimmick, in which the movie is actually ""found"" home video material from a camera with seemingly unlimited batteries and capacity, in which a group of friends go from late-night partying to kaiju chaos. It's a great catch, actually. Like in Blair Witch, we get to know the protagonists before seeing them in dangerous situations. Our friends here are saying good-bye to Rob, who's trying to return to a relationship with Beth, and the main survivor group is composed of his friend Hub (the one who ""documents"" all the misadventures, a nerdish, annoying, comic relief presence), Marlene, the best character in the movie (it goes without saying she's a wino), and a hot black chick. I can't be arsed to remember her name. They find themselves in the disorder of the (slightly more realistic than in Godzilla '98) Manhattan evacuation, and suddenly decide they're gonna help Rob find her girlfriend Beth, who's trapped and suffocating, somewhere in the island that's being destroyed by a reptile the size of the Empire State. Smart bloody thinking.As you're probably guessing by now, I wasn't too in love with this movie. Its main problem was that, despite the superficial pains they took to make it a ""realistic"" witness home video (the recording over previous Coney Island footage, the date and time, the opening government disclaimer), it played exactly like a by-the-numbers Hollywood movie. Worse, actually. The characters in any teen slasher are more logical than these ones. If some guy loses his nerve and decides that the best course of action (instead of, you know, immediately calling his parents and close relatives) is to run into the danger area looking for some short-breasted chick who's probably dead, I think his mates have a moral obligation to knock him unconscious and save him. I can't believe in characters who are faced with a gigantic lizard and don't want to save themselves. That's not what's being a hero is all about. That's definitively not what a fireman was doing during 9/11. That's being a tool in a poor scriptwriter's mind. And some military guy suddenly decides that their suicidal tendencies are worth encouraging? Come on.Now, technically, this movie is so cool it's a shame it got lost in a bad script. Even if it has been shot in obviously high quality, the constant jerking of the camera (although, gimme a break, this is not seizure-inducing for anyone who has ever watched an '80s videoclip) and the filters made me believe I was watching a first-person account of a giant monster tearing down a city. The way the monster is introduced is clever enough - we see the inmediate consequences of its rampage, and eventually (with a little help from the parasites that climb off him) we get to know it in increasingly irksome detail. But none of this technical (and creative) wonder is any good if the story the filmmakers are telling us has so many logical holes and unrealistic behavior. There are a million plot devices that could realistically set the survivor group apart from military aid and into the claws of the monster. There's no need to turn the protagonists into self-righteous cardboared figures who mumble Garfield jokes (ok, I laughed at that one) while wandering into the unknown. Basically, why do we need a comic relief cameraman? Cloverfield doesn't trust the audience to be smart enough to endure the ""found"" footage without a C-3PO hanging around? So it wants to be realistic, yet everyone is a bloody stereotype? I'll admit it, it's a concept that's easy to explain and sell, but hard to actually film in a realistic manner. I'd say the closest they can come to make a great kaiju in this postmodern style is to combine footage from news and various recording devices into one edited narrative. That way, it wouldn't look so staged and it would offer a bird's eye view of the story with the added ""reality"" element. Of course, that's not what Cloverield, Abrams and company try to do, but I'd recommend a change in priorities. Maybe for the sequel. Who knows?",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""Do you want cheese with your monster...?""","When Lars Von Trier was preaching his Dogma manifesto all those years ago, I'll bet my left nut he didn't think it would be embraced to create Hollywoods latest pile of steaming, stinking celluloid, Cloverfield.Take out the 12 minute credit crawl (arguably the most exciting thing in the film), and you get 73 minutes of headache-inducing hand-held camera-work, a monster that would've been best left unseen and a whiny group of objectionable Manhattanites, everyone of them perfectly suited - nay, deserving - of a fate between the backteeth of any monstrous beasty.I was hoping the brave creative decision to shoot the whole film from a first-person perspective would have the desired affect - put the audience into the action; redefine the disaster/monster movie for the post 9/11 generation; take genre pics to that next level that many promise to do but none ever really have.But in trying to provide realism to B-movie myths of years gone by, the film-makers only manage to emphasise the cornball situations and horrible clichés that have driven these films for decades. You can make the camera-work as dandy as you like, but it don't mean squat if the script and acting is every bit as turgid and wooden as it was 50 years ago - when the giant octopus (an obvious inspiration for Cloverfields critter) crawled over the bridge and headed Downtown.I know we have to give a movie about a marauding jellyfish a little slack, but its not the monster scenes that stink. It's the oh-so-lame set-up of the characters lives that is insufferably eye-rolling from the very first frame of the film. The intimacy your personal video camera captures isn't like a movie, so a movie about the intimacy a video camera captures was never going to ring true. The achingly slow story suffers from awkwardly staged moments meant to look spontaneous, weepy declarations of love and McGuyver-style heroics. The producer's could've saved big bucks on all the military hardware on display in the film - with the cheese in Cloverfield laid on so thick, the monster would've eventually died of cholesterol poisoning anyway.....It's hard to totally hate a film that tries to make something new out of an idea so old but, minus all the new technology that has gone into creating this screeching, lurching mess, Cloverfield is no better than the monster flicks that your mom and dad watched in double-bills at their local drive-in.When the only positive you can take from a film is the viral, pre-release marketing strategy innovatively employed, somethings up. Cloverfield is an admirable attempt but ultimately proves an immense failure.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Kickin ass from start to finish!!!,OK guys i promise not to spoil anything like the other people on here who don't care about the people that wanna see it. okay guys this movie was a breath of fresh air for you eyes. but to all you who just want the filmmakers to keep the camera still don't see this cause the entire movie is from a camera point of view With loads of bumps and shakes. but I'm not saying that this is a crappy film you just got to realize that this was a frantic person trying to document a horrific event in progress. but as far as the plot goes i would give it a 10 out of 10. and thanks to the home video filming technique this is like a nonstop roller coaster ride. just because people would never record a boring moment. so thank you jj for finally bringing America a movie thats just t brand new no sequel remake or adaptation So i would vote 9 out of 10 for this one but if you get sick if the camera is shaky i advise you not to see this movie but for everyone who doesn't get sick if you don't see this is the theater with the great surround sound then you are missing out big-time. just not the front row.

"Catchy idea, mediocre execution","Cloverfield has a catchy idea yet mediocre execution. The premise of a monster attack told from a found footage perspective is entertaining, but unfortunately, that's all Cloverfield offers. The monster is intentionally mysterious, so the movie focuses on its characters. Therefore, these people are principal to Cloverfield's success (along with the messy action). The first act establishes their generic motivations, but it's woefully thin and uninspired. The actors do alright with the slim material, but it all feels like a means to an end. Neither the plot nor the characters are meaningful or constructed. It's all transparently in service of the gimmick.Meanwhile, the gimmick isn't completely effective. First, the camerawork is believably clumsy, but often chaotic and unpleasant. That's the idea, but it's a downside to the experience. Next, the design of the monster is unremarkable, which is disappointing since that's the film's main draw. Plus, the effects are overwhelmingly CGI and occasionally ugly. Lastly, the direction is generally void of creativity, so Cloverfield is missing a sense of craft or cohesion. Conversely, the editing is well-paced and the sound is complex, but these qualities only go so far. Overall, Cloverfield is fine entertainment, but more of a theme park ride than a film.Writing: 4/10

Don't Let Your Curiosity Get The Best Of You,"There's an old saying about how curiosity killed the cat. My curiosity was raised by the trailer for this film I saw when I saw Transformers and the lack of anything really being said about it. So my curiosity led me to seeing the movie. And the old saying is true...seeing this almost killed me.Don't get me wrong it's got some good stuff about it. First off the concept of doing the film from the point of view of people running around with camcorders is an original idea. It helped to ground the film in some kind of reality, something that was desperately needed in this genre. Unfortunately, nothing else does but more on that later. Then there is the special effects which were terrific, particularly with the creature and its minions (for lack of a better word). Then there's the music over the end credits by Michael Giacchino. And that's about it.Noiw on the bad stuff...or should I say the rest of the movie? There is not one good performance from anyone in this film at all! Everyone is self-absorbed so much that you can't have sympathy for them. Not to mention that everyone in the film seems to be able to handle cameras without too much difficulty considering that they were under attack from a giant ""soemthing""! I mean even the military comes across that away and it takes a stretch of logic to understand why anyone in their right mind would let an unarmed group of civilians run around Manhatten without at least some military back-up! There's no logic to it at all.And then there's the script. The dialogue is either terrible or bad. It is just like every other disaster/monster movie ever made, except with a camcorder telling the story of a group of self-absorbed people caught in the middle. And then there's the lack of explanation. Don't get me wrong I'm a fan of 2001: A Space Odseey and Donnie Darko, two films that didn't leave too many clues as to what was going on. But those were cases where explanation wasn't necessary because they were films that didn't need it because they left you with enough to work from to come to some sort of explanation. Coverfield doesn't and its hurt big time from it. These films need (to paraphrase its writer) scientist in the white lab coat who shows up and explains things like that. As I wrote above, the idea gives a sense of reality to the movie but between the bad acting from the horrible script that gives no explanation as to what is going on.They say every film is redeemable in at least some of its aspects. Those would be concept, the special effects and the end credits music for the record. Otherwise, Cloverfield is a disaster. In plain and simple terms that's what it is: a disaster. As I wrote, it is just like every other disaster/monster movie ever made, except with a camcorder telling the story of a group of self-absorbed people caught in the middle. Avoid the film, save your money, and don't let your curiosity get the best of you.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Whole lotta' shaking going' on,"What can I say? I love the movie and everything about it.

I am a big fan of sci-fi/horror movies and thought this had a lot of potential, even though it carried a PG-13 rating. After the ""earthquake"" the movie goes head on into action/sci fi and never stops. When the Statue of Liberty's head lands in the street and people are scream I was going crazy. That was wild and fun to watch. Also, there is a lot of talk about 9/11 and such but you know what, I could not even compare or think about that while watching this. I am sure there are plenty that say it reminds them so much of it when the building goes down. In any case, if a building callopses, there is going to be a lot of dust and smoke ......

A cross between The Blair Witch Project and Godzilla pretty much sums up this film.Now I'm not a big fan of this style of camera work but I've been able to put up with it in many of today's films because it's been used sparingly. But this film not only uses it, it takes it to the extreme. I understand this film tries to add realism by using this technique but aren't there other ways to to this? Ways that don't cause migraines?Anyway, despite the occasional headaches, this film is pretty good. I'm especially impressed by the visual effects. The monster and destruction of Manhattan all look very real. I'm especially impressed by the relatively small budget on which this was made.

They went with realism and to give you that we cant know the ending because it wasn't filmed. This movie takes place in the ""now"". We meet the characters, we feel for them, then we get scared as hell when the tension heightens. This movie was awesome and you need to use your brain a little movie when viewing cinema.",,Anonymous,Horror
"A decent time at the movies, but no classic.","I like monster movies a lot, including both ""The Blair Witch Project"" and ""Godzilla"" (the Japanese one, not the Matthew Broderick one). So I guess it was inevitable that I'd see ""Cloverfield,"" which is frequently described as the love child of those two films.Unfortunately, I didn't find ""Cloverfield"" to be as good as its source material. This movie, unlike the Blair Witch or Godzilla films, focuses an awful lot on character development. That might work, except the characters in ""Cloverfield"" are mainly annoying yuppies involved in really shallow, neurotic romances. I felt sympathy for them during certain scenes, yes, but that was only because they were suffering - not because I especially liked them as people.The other disadvantage ""Cloverfield"" has in comparison with its predecessors is that it features a sort of lame monster. I mean, sure, Godzilla looks fake and all, but at least I can identify him as a dragon-dinosaur hybrid, which is cool. Without giving too much away, the beast in ""Cloverfield"" just looks...bizarre. Icky. Messed up. I didn't think that it had a particularly iconic or memorable design, in short. I doubt that anybody will remember what it looked like 10 years from now.I guess I'm being a little harsh, though, because ""Cloverfield"" has some good suspense moments and memorable apocalyptic imagery. And the characters aren't a total loss - at least they're loyal to each other, and occasionally one of them gets a good line.It's just not a great movie, that's all. I'm a little tired, I guess, of horror films that focus on 20-something ""beautiful people,"" and I long for the days when monster movies featured wise middle-aged professor characters and plucky journalists instead of rejects from ""Dawson's Creek.""Still, if you're interested in enjoying a few scares and experiencing mild nausea in the process, ""Cloverfield"" will deliver for you.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not a big fan of the camcorder film style but....,"I love big monsters stomping buildings, and fighting the army, it's a guilty pleasure, there were some plot holes in the movie, didn't really like the love story angle, I like casting unknowns, just they seemed to have a hard time pulling it off at times, and I said the whole Blair Witch film style, really not my thing..But on the bright side it had the monster trying for a field goal with the Statue of Liberty's head, and smashing a mobile artillery piece, some buildings got wrecked, so not all that bad..And he was smart enough to stay in the downtown areas, even skyscraper sized monsters know better than go into the gang controlled parts, he might be tough, not stupid.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Thee First ""Rollercoaster"" of a Movie of Our Time. Period.","This film was the first film that made me understand the critic expression ""Rollercoaster of a movie."" I have never sat through any genre of film and made any connection between a ""Rollercoaster"" and a film. I now have felt that feeling. Surreal. Intense. Absolutely riveting and exhausting. I can't express into words how realistic and heart-pounding this film was. For the same reasons, I can't express the emotional experience you have on a roller-coaster. Every turn, every drop, and every obstacle you encounter is exciting, yet, at the same time, unnerving. There's only one way for YOU, and only you, to decide whether the ride was worth the measly $10 entry fee. Experience the film for yourself.Disagree?: You don't understand the premise or perspective of the film. Have you ever watched an eerie homevideo and thought, ""That sucked, the camera had a bad angle.?"" Highly doubtful. It's eerie, because it includes YOU in the experience. The unfamiliar and lack of control is terrifying, leaving unanswered questions opened. Real ""home video"" footage conveys this picture beautifully. That's the perspective the film took and that is what I felt. Too dumb to comprehend and appreciate this? Stick to idiot-proof movies like Godzilla, where you'll have the satisfaction of a moronic plot that includes a dweebie scientist who ironically knows exactly the origin and solution to the problem.Note to Self: After seeing this, I feel robbed by every other movie I have paid $10 to see. This movie is not like any other movie I have sat through. It has ruined all hope for me to experience the same mental AND physical emotions I had during this film for future films.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
I liked it.,"This movie is among my favorite foreign films. It has similarities as with the other foreign films. I am a fan of Abrams' television series such as ""Lost"". So, I found that this movie is interesting and fascinating. This is a great movie that has some moving moments and nice action. Because action is non stop from beginning to end. This movie includes six young New Yorkers attending a party on the night that a monster attacks the city. When people try to escape, New York streets burn down in flames. For me, the film is the most impressive scene that when Manhattan was a violent explosion, statue of liberty's head snapped. It hit the street just like a giant cannon.The movie focuses less battle and more about character. Each main character is heroic in their own way. By the way, for me the 2 hours flew by pretty quickly. Overall, I like this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
All Appetizer no meat and potatoes,"First off let me just say this movie isn't bad. But this movie is also FAR from good. I went into this movie with the eagerness I once had seeing transformers (the 1980's one)and then this time i came out wishing i had watched something else and waited for the rental.FIrst off the movie is incredibly slow off the get go. A bunch of meaningless backstory which ultimately if you're a science fiction buff like myself wont care anything about. It took nearly I'd say a good chunk of the movie till they got to the actual part of the movie i came to see.The monster is nothing surprisingly. I wont give away details but it matches the typical swamp thing cliché. Also the movie gives you almost no reference just a bunch of whats this whats that how'd that happen etc etc etc, using a technique i call 'WHAT WAS THAT', basically looping the viewer in simply on curiosity.Also I have to complain about the shaky POINT AT THE DAMN SCENE camera control. There were a dozen times easily i was going to myself learn how to use the flippin camera. If this was a real doc i'd understand. THIS Isn't this is a totally fictional BUDGET movie so lets film like it. THey filled it full of nonsense simply as if to squeeze a bunch of meaningless 'stuff' in just to draw out time.In the end it really comes down to about an hour of back story and jargin added to 20 mins of 'Cool stuff'.Good for the sci fi buff but don't go in with high hopes.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
A new genre  in film is born,"All I can say is that this movie exceeded my expectations! At first, when the movie ended, I was upset how it ended. Then after some reflection, (by the way, if a movie can make you reflect about it afterwards, its worth the price of admission!) I understand why and how it was done! It had to be done this way and leave those unanswered questions! It is after all about a tape that was found documenting the events that happened one night in New York when a monster attacked. I was riveted the whole time and love the fact that it left me with more questions than it answered! I ended up coming home and combing the internet to try and find out more of the story...and guess what....there are official websites that help you! I became totally immersed in this world and left to my imagination, ( yes..there is still such a thing) I have slowly but surely started to put the pieces together! There are a lot of things you will question...such as how the camcorder battery ran so long. Well, since the movie is 1 hour and 20 minutes long...that seems to fit into how long a battery lasts and how much time you can actually tape for...roughly. There is so much I want to say about this film but I don't want to ruin the fun for other people who will take the time to reflect and search for my answers like I did. Trust me ...it's worth it! A piece of advice...at the very end of the movie..watch closely of the footage at coney island...something falls into the water!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
