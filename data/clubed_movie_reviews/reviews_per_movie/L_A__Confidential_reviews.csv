I Wish This Film Had Been Five Hours Long,"What happens when a squad of corrupt cops in the 1950s explore a murder case from multiple angles and find their corruption coming back on them like chickens coming home to roost? Who will solve the crime? Who will survive and what will be left of them?This movie is phenomenal. The only reason I didn't give it 10 out of 10 is because I didn't care for the ending (which I won't reveal). It's a world were Hollywood and law enforcement cross over and even the hookers want to be movie stars.I have not read the Ellroy novels, but I have been told they are even more intricate than this film with a lot more backstory. I would watch a five or six hour version of this film. But even so, that is the strong point of this film: multiple stories that begin to overlap. Sure, others (Tarantino) have tried this, but I think this is the most expertly done conception I've seen yet.Kevin Spacey's part as a Hollywood obsessed cop is beautiful and he fits the part to a tee. His role is supposed to be similar to Dean Martin and I can see that; Spacey again harnessed this kind of character when he made ""Beyond the Sea"". Spacey's role is the connection between the world of law and the world of fame.Russell Crowe plays the ""bad cop"" who crosses the line with sheer thuggery and an attraction to a prostitute (Kim Basinger, who does a fine job being both alluring yet tasteful). His part was supposed to be for Michael Madsen (one of the greatest actors of all time for a cop/crook movie), but I think Crowe may have been the better choice. Who else can be a natural thug?Guy Pearce... I was not sure how to take him. I have not enjoyed him (""Time Machine"") and yet also loved him (""Memento""). In the beginning, I thought it would be another geeky Pearce role and I was a bit concerned. But as the film progresses, so does Pearce's character become more lovable and impressive. You'll agree.Danny DeVito was okay and James Cromwell was insidiously delightful.Brian Helgeland adapted this screenplay. You may know him best as the writer of ""A Knight's Tale"" and ""The Order"". The Order was crappy. But A Knight's Tale is fantastic. This, by far, will go down as his crowning achievement. He may as well call up Michael Bay and go retire in the South Seas where they'll never be found.Simply put, this is the best film I've seen in at least a month (and I watch at least a movie a day). Maybe the best film I've seen all year. Don't set this movie aside, you need to put this on the top of your honeydew list.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
A fascinating look at life in the big city,"Give a collection of great actors a great story to work with and you are likely to end up with something rather special. Such is the case with L.A. Confidential. The boldface names jump off the page...Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, Kim Basinger, Danny DeVito, James Cromwell and, in his first big-time role, Guy Pearce. And none of these big names are just mailing it in, here to collect a paycheck. They're all on top of their games, undoubtedly helped to no small extent by the wonderfully nuanced and utterly intriguing story.This story takes place in 1950s Los Angeles but this is a side of L.A. most people don't get to see. Behind all the Hollywood glamour L.A. has a seamy side which will be the focus of this tale. At the heart of the movie are three cops who ostensibly are supposed to be working together but who go about the business of dispensing justice in very different ways. Crowe plays aggressive hothead Bud White. Spacey is Jack Vincennes, who takes more pride in his work as an adviser on a popular television cop drama than he does in his actual police work. And Pearce plays Edmund Exley, a young up-and-comer in the department who plays things by the book. As we will soon see Exley is rather unique in an LAPD which believes in doing whatever is necessary to bring the guilty to justice. Even if it means becoming a little guilty themselves.The movie really begins to move forward with a massacre at a coffee shop. It seems a pretty cut and dried case but initial appearances can be deceiving. Soon White, Vincennes and Exley will find themselves caught up in a maze of lies, deception and mystery. It will be a great test for these very different men as it appears they may well need each other's unique talents to solve this puzzle. And quite the elaborate puzzle it is. One important piece is Lynn Bracken, a high class call girl played by Basinger. Tying together many of this complex story's strands is gossip writer Sid Hudgens who is played with appropriate sleaziness by DeVito. And in the background the whole time is the somewhat mysterious Captain Dudley Smith, played by Cromwell. Here is a man who believes in bringing the guilty to justice by any means necessary. That's all well and good if you know who the guilty are but in L.A. Confidential you're never quite sure who to believe. The viewer is guessing right along with the investigators on the screen. And in the end it all comes together and pays off brilliantly.L.A. Confidential is first and foremost a great story, with many fascinating twists and turns along the way. The film also serves as a showcase for some of this generation's finest acting talents. Each of the main characters is wonderfully unique and each of the actors involved does a terrific job in bringing those characters to life. These are complex characters in a complex tale. It's so involved that the acting had to be stellar if this film was going to work and none of the stars disappoint. Terrific storytelling brought to life by a collection of inspired performances makes L.A. Confidential an absolute winner.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
One of the best,We've not come very far since this classic in terms of high quality cop crime dramas. Acting and direction is perfection.,9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Everything in this film is fantastic.,"L.A. Confidential is, without a doubt, the best film of the 1990s, and quite possibly one of the best films ever made.As with any great film, it all starts with the writing.  The story is riveting, the dialogue is smart and quite funny, and the characters are written in three dimensions.The acting is phenomenal.  Perhaps a bigger tragedy than L.A. Confidential's loss to Titanic in the Best Picture race is that none of the three lead actors even garnered nominations.  Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, and Kevin Spacey are absolutely phenomenal; it is their characters that drive this fascinating story about police corruption in 1950s Los Angeles.  We get to know these people, to understand who they are and why they do what they do, and to root for them to overcome their imperfections.The directing is fantastic.  Curtis Hanson doesn't shove anything in the audience's face; instead, he allows the audience to discover the film's nuances on their own.  (That makes this an excellent film for repeat viewings, you truly catch something new every time).  1950s Los Angeles is reproduced beautifully.  The editing is quick and seamless, the music is perfect for the film (Hanson should teach other directors how to do a montage effectively), and the cinematography is great.I can't find a negative thing to say about this film.  It's truly a masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Three Phenomenal Actors Give The Performances Of A Life Time,"Six years ago, a director by the name of Curtis Hansen came out with a small time film named L.A. Confidential. Though the movie garnered several big nominations at the 1997 Academy Awards, the nation had been swept up by the gigantic and romantic blockbuster, Titanic, thus shrinking the chances of this brilliant movie from garnering any real awards. 1997 completely screwed this phenomenal film, in which three brilliant actors gave the performances of their careers.Russell Crowe plays Detective Bud White, a tough L.A. cop who bends the rules in order to bring justice to the city. He is ruthless, and unforgiving of anyone, which brings him into direct conflict with Detective Lieutenant Ed Exley, played by Guy Pearce. Russell Crowe became with this role a full pledged character actor,: the cop with a steel physique, and a vulnerable heart. He becomes so believable and real to the audience, you can not help but sympathize for his character under the circumstances.  From this role, Crowe went on to garner three best actor nominations, winning for his role in Gladiator.Guy Pearce, the little known Australian body builder, became the character known as Ed Exley, a straight, uptight detective trying to live up to the legend his father created before him. Exley has so much to prove to the LAPD, trying to show them that he is just as good, maybe even better, than his father. He plays the politics in a corrupted police department very well, and is able to use these skills in solving the corrupt and mysterious case of the Night Owl murders. This film officially put Guy Pearce in the big leagues of film, making his next appearances in Memento and The Count of Monte Cristo. He is a severely underrated actor who deserves better than what he has been getting.Finally, the ever wonderful Kevin Spacey. Spacey plays Lieutenant Jack Vincenes, a cop who gives a popular LA police show, Badge of Honor, real solved cases in return for money. Jack sees his life as an ever going soap opera, until he comes across a case that somehow has a connection to the Night Owl murders. Kevin Spacey has proved time and again his abilities as an actor, and he continues with this performance.Curtis Hansen does a wonderful job bringing this story to the big screen. His talents, although recognized, have not been awarded as of yet. I can only hope that someday, someone will give this amazing director something worthy of his talents.Highly Recommended.MJR",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
The cast of a lifetime in a 1997 noir set in LA of the '50s,"One of the greatest films ever made, L.A. Confidential benefits from a great script (Brian Helgeland), great performances (Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, Kim Basinger, James Cromwell, Danny DeVito, David Straithairn), and great direction (Curtis Hanson). It's not easy to do a film noir in modern times that is set it in the past. All too often, the performances are too stylized or nonorganic, the direction is stilted -- the whole thing comes off as an attempt, and not a very good one. In this case, though, the result is brilliant.Basically, L.A. Confidential is the story of three very different kinds of police officers who become involved in the same case, the Night Owl Murders. There's Russell Crowe as Bud White, the loose cannon, a strong but vulnerable cop; Guy Pearce as Exley, the political, honest, by the book cop who incurs everyone's wrath; and Kevin Spacey as Jack Vincennes, the celebrity detective who is a consultant on a Dragnet-type TV show, Badge of Honor. He works hand in hand with a writer for Hush magazine (Danny DeVito). But they're not the only ones embroiled in the Night Owl diner slaughter. There's Dudley Smith (James Cromwell), the Chief of Police, Ellis Loew (Ron Rifkin), the bisexual D.A., the wealthy, powerful Pierce Patchett (David Straithairn); and Lynn, the Veronica Lake-lookalike call girl (Kim Basinger). And Rollo Tomassi, of course - an important name in the investigation.It's hard to single out any one performance. The film is perfectly cast. The three officers - Spacey, Crowe, and Pearce - are as brilliant as the characters they play are different. And everyone else in the cast is fantastic as well.Historically, there are some things that are not correct as far as Hollywood - The Bad and the Beautiful and Roman Holiday did not run at the same time; and the duo of Johnny Stompanato and Lana Turner came later. However, two elements of the film are based on reality or at least rumors - there was supposedly a call girl ring where the women looked like famous film stars; and ""Hush"" magazine, the cover anyway, looks like ""Whisper"" magazine from that era.L.A. Confidential is a story of twists, turns, and camaraderie that take place on the mean streets of '50s L.A., a story that winds up changing the lives of everyone involved. Filled with atmosphere and suspense, it's a not to be missed, violent, vivid portrait of a time when things at LAPD were (and still might be today) off the record, on the q.t. -- and very hush-hush.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Superb film-making,"As a fan of mysteries and thrillers and who likes a lot of the cast (such a great one on paper), expectations were high for 'LA Confidential'. And 'LA Confidential' didn't disappoint at all, it is an outstanding film on all levels and should have won the Best Picture Oscar of 1997 and won more.Visually, 'LA Confidential' looks great. The photography is both audacious and stylish, suitably the story and genre superlatively. A good music score also helps and there is an appropriately haunting one courtesy of one of the greatest film composers ever. Curtis Hansen directs superbly, it has a lot of style and how it balances everything is so cleverly done, he hasn't made a better film and to me it's the best directing of his entire career.'LA Confidental' richly deserved its Best Screenplay Oscar. No other film that year came close to the film's rich character development, complexity and its refusal to fall into cliché territory. All the characters are compelling in their realism and none of them feel stereotypical or one-sided, actually breaking the mould of good cops and bad villains. The story is gripping in its intensity and thrills, with plenty of unexpected twists and turns, and very rare a dull moment.The acting is exceptionally full-blooded and there isn't a single weak link. How Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce and Kevin Spacey weren't nominated for Oscars is unfathomable. Spacey in particular is brilliant, though Crowe is appropriately hard-nosed and Pearce has rarely been better.James Cromwell and Danny De Vito also shine. Cromwell is chillingly insidious and De Vito has never been slimier. Whether Kim Basinger deserved her Oscar win is up for debate, to me it was a very worthy win where she gives her role hard edge and charm.In conclusion, superb film-making and an outstanding film on all levels. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Will stand the test of time.........,"When a film evokes an era as well as L.A. Confidential does, people take notice. It could be argued that it is easier to replicate the recent past than the distant on film,  and in a sense this is true. Costumes, language, and the necessary absence of the modern in ""period pieces"" make them expensive and difficult to film. But couldn't it be argued that it is just as difficult to make a film about more recent periods? I have no knowledge of how a Victorian era table was set, or what a knight really spoke like; we are subject to the directors view of reality. But what if a good deal of your audience lived through the time you are portraying, as in the case of the 1950's? I can even envision my grandfather coming back from WW2 to a booming economy, and living in the world Curtis Hanson created.The real genus of this film is that it creates not only a physical world, but one with all the politics, corruption, racism and inequity of the time. As a result we feel the characters motivations and understand their faults all  the better; Bud White, Ed Exley, Lynn Bracken and Lana Turner all live here.This film, like others that make us believe we are there for two hours (and $7.50), will endure. I was thinking a  perfect double feature would be with Chinatown, another film that will stand the test of time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Hollywood Wasn`t Ready For It,"Hard to imagine now but in 1997 many of the cast in LA CONFIDENTIAL weren`t well known . Kevin Spacey had an Oscar under his belt but hadn`t appeared in many starring roles , Guy Pearce was known only to NEIGHBOURS  fans while Russell Crowe was remembered only for his powerhouse performance in ROMPER STOMPER . In fact it sounds ridiculous in 2003 but the two best known members of the cast when this was released were Danny DeVito and Kim BasingerThe real star of LA CONFIDENTIAL is the script . I`ve never read the novel but I`ve often heard it`s unfilmable . Never once did I get the feeling this was true while watching the film adaption because the only thing to strike me about the script was its intelligence , yes you`ve read that right an intelligent Hollywood script complete with violence , wit and a couple of shocking twists and turns . The only criticism about the story is the old cliche of one of the cops being a naive idealist while the other cop is a violent fascist thug .LA CONFIDENTIAL was stuffed at the Oscars by TITANIC but that`s not surprising . How many academy voters are going to love a film about corruption , vice and murder set in Hollywood ?",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"A ""Chinatown"" for the 1990s","""L.A. Confidential"" is brilliant.  The screenplay and direction are second-to-none.  The performances by the ensemble cast are also superb. Kim Basinger stands out the most with her Oscar-winning role.  Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, James Cromwell, David Strathairn, and Danny DeVito all have their moments as well.  The film deals with the seamy side of Los Angeles in the post-World War II 1950s.  Los Angeles is a place of shady dealings and police corruption.  To add to those problems is the creation of the smutty tabloid.  Multi-layered and smart, ""L.A. Confidential"" will be the greatest survivor of the films released in 1997. 5 out of 5 stars.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
This is how a proper crime story should be told!,"LA Confidential is a sprawling epic tale of crime, corruption and justice in Hollywood and the LAPD, with a cast to match. A truly gripping crime saga exposing the seedy underbelly of the City of Angels, where cops never let the truth get in the way of justice, and everyone knows everyone else's dirty secrets.Criminally overlooked at both the box office and the Academy thanks to the all-conquering and over-achieving Titanic, LA Confidential will far more likely stand the test of time to be thought of as one of the best films of the 90s, and possibly the best cop film ever.After cops give a number of inmates a beating in retaliation for two of their own being put in hospital, the career-minded Ed Exley (Guy Pearce) agrees to testify to what he saw, turning in his fellow officers. When one of the cops forced out turns up dead as a result of a shooting, Exley, hothead detective Bud White (Russell Crowe) and fame-obsessed Sergeant Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) all work to find the answers. However, as they uncover the truth, it leads to more questions, of corruption, blackmail, bribery and conspiracy.The film superbly portrays the dual nature of Hollywood; glamorous parties and beautiful people, and the seemingly ever-present crime and corruption, even in the police. Danny Devito's opening monologue perfectly sums it up - 'There's trouble in paradise'. This is not the city at the end of the rainbow, the city where dreams come true.A series of stellar performances from an all-star cast makes it impossible to pick the star, although Kim Basinger richly deserved her Best Supporting Actress. Kevin Spacey is terrific as ever, while Russell Crowe shows that Gladiator wasn't his first muscles-with-a-heart role. But the real standout is probably Guy Pearce in a career-making performance as the one officer determined to what is right and just, regardless of the potentially disastrous consequences for him. However, LA Confidential is a true ensemble piece, and everybody holds their own among the starry cast. Few will have made many better films, before or since.Curtis Hanson directs in a career-defining role, the sweeping direction echoing the sprawling nature of both the story and the city. The story is a slow-burner, gradually unraveling all the twists, but instead of clearing up the mystery, the waters become muddier as the trio of officers are forced to work together. Hanson masterfully commands the James Ellroy's source material, weaving it into a gripping multi-layered tale. The characters are extremely well developed, all three-dimensional, with no clear-cut heroes and villains. White (Crowe) in particular is the classic film noir anti-hero, the violent cop with a heart-breaking story, thinking with his muscles rather than his brain. LA Confidential is a classic 50s noir film told for the 90s, and keeps you guessing right up to the final scene as to how high the corruption goes. The two-hour running time is never felt.A superb thriller and the perfect antidote to the rash of mindless action-comedies that frequently come out of Hollywood today, LA Confidential harks back to how film-making used to be  all about telling a story. And what a story it is. One of, if not the best film of the 90s.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Tour de Force,"This is the ultimate movie on the corruptness of the police force during the 1950's.  No one is going to make a better movie than LA Confidential, the cast is perfect, the direction is superb, the screenplay is amazing, the choice of music, the graphic brutality, the not so fine line between good and evil.When I saw this in the theatres, I came out of the theatre and couldn't say anything because I was awed. And I was amazed by how wonderful Russell Crowe and Guy Pearce were, I had never heard of them before, so I didn't know what to expect, but now I have two new favorite actors.  And I couldn't believe that Russell was a New Zealander and Guy was an Aussie.  They had great American accents.

An exemplary piece of filmmaking,"What's not to love about L. A. CONFIDENTIAL, the 1997 Oscar-winning detective story about the sleazy side of seemingly glamorous '50s-era Los Angeles? It boasts an outstanding screenplay adapted from the James Ellroy novel, excellent direction from old hand Curtis Hanson, and truly tremendous performances from the entire cast.The film itself is a dense narrative mixing together multiple strands: drugs, prostitution, murder, sleaze, the media, and a massacre. Despite the lengthy running time, this film never sits still and it keeps on grabbing you and propelling you forwards until the credits finally hit. It's an exhausting, exhaustive look at its subject matter and I loved every hard-boiled second of it. The ten-minute segment that takes place around the hour mark, where the plot initially appears to have resolved itself neatly, is a mark of genius.When I think fondly of L. A. CONFIDENTIAL, though, I think mainly of the acting. Guy Pearce, sheer excellence as the by-the-book rookie, leading us through the film with a charming mannered performance. Just why hasn't he made the A-list in Hollywood after his turn here? Then there's Russell Crowe, bringing a simmering vitality to his role that's been missing ever since. Crowe is a scene stealer, and that's a difficult job when you also throw in a career-best Kevin Spacey into the mix. Kim Basinger bagged the Oscar, but Pearce, Crowe and Spacey all deserved one, too.Throw in a fine supporting cast (particularly James Cromwell and Danny DeVito), top-dollar production design, oodles of violence, moments of warmth and humour amid the carnage and you have one of the best mystery films ever made. Yes, L. A. CONFIDENTIAL really is that good!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
***** Best Film of the 90s,"Hands-down my favourite American film of the nineties. Curtis Hanson shocked the world by proving to be not only a great director but an auteur with this unbeatable adaptation of James Ellroy's terrifying novel about corruption and crime among members of the LAPD in the 1950s. The hard-boiled detective story angle is brought to life so beautifully, mostly because Jeannine Claudia Oppewall's production design recreates the dark underside of the 50s to such perfection that not even a Coke bottle label is missed. Add to that Dante Spinotti's stunning lighting that rides the fine line between artistic and believable comfortably (as all period camerawork should), Ruth Myers' costume designing and a script by Hanson and The Postman scribe Brian Helgeland (I know, I don't get it either) that pares down Ellroy's mammoth plot about a multiple murder in a local diner involving a policeman with suspicious ties without sacrificing the density of the story or the spiderweb of events involved with it, and you have the best movie of 1997, not to mention the most fascinating detective film ever made since Orson Welles' Touch of Evil. The cast is all brilliant, most notably Kim Basinger as a wordly prostitute who has not only a heart of gold but a mind of steel--Basinger is so strong in her character's every nuance you'll find yourself forgetting she's even acting--and Kevin Spacey as a Dean Martin-esque detective who not only solves an important part of the puzzle, he even discovers he possesses a soul beneath his flashy suits. I just can't get enough of this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

a masterpiece in every respect,"I can always remember ""L.A. Confidential"" as the first gritty-noirish-seedy movie that I ever saw in the theaters. And it makes me proud that this was the first one that I saw. We all can assume that movies about the inner workings of the police world are going to be gritty-noirish-seedy, but overall, it doesn't do ""L.A. Confidential"" justice to only classify it that way. Curtis Hanson created an INDESCRIBIBLY great movie here.It's 1950s Los Angeles. Tabloid writer Sid Hudgens (Danny DeVito) likes to advertise the City of Angels as paradise on Earth, where you can raise an all-American family, meet a movie star, or even become one. But before too long, we get to see the police department. Officers Bud White (Russell Crowe), Ed Exley (Guy Pearce) and Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) are the main characters. White is the type who loves to help damsels in distress, but even he has his weak points; squeaky-clean Exley is the son of a cop, carrying on his father's work; and Vincennes mainly likes his job because of all the places that he gets to visit.Following a murder one day, it's up to the three officers to investigate. But what they eventually uncover pales in comparison to what anyone would have expected. You see, some things extend farther than most people realize.Kim Basinger won a well deserved Oscar for her role as sultry prostitute Lynn Bracken. A Veronica Lake lookalike, she's the type of woman who can lead you to new evidence...or might be planning something else.I can't try to explain how good this movie is. Like ""Chinatown"", it shows the seedy underside of something usually assumed to be pure, but never gets too full of itself to the point of being silly. Why, oh why, did the Academy give ""Titanic"" Best Picture when ""L.A. Confidential"" was nominated?",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Disappointing and overrated.,"Loads of people are going to disagree with me and press the ""unhelpful"" button on this review, but I don't care. I saw ""L.A.

It recently came on television again and I thought to myself that maybe -- hopefully -- I'd like it better now and see whatever it was that I missed before.Unfortunately, my opinion remains the same. ""L.A. Confidential"" is a poor-man's ""Chinatown,"" complete with all the ""homages"" and such to the genre...The cast is top-notch and make the film worth seeing once: Guy Pearce, Danny DeVito, Kim Basinger and Kevin Spacey (delivering the best performance in the film). There's also Russell Crowe, but we don't like him, because he's a jerk and he can't act. Just kidding. But seriously, I don't think he can act.""L.A.

Great Detective Movie,"L.A. Confidential is the most classy, intriguing, thought provoking and sexiest detective movie ever to be made in the history of detective films.When you look back at it and see that Russell Crowe, Kevin Spacey and Guy Pearce actually appeared in the same film back in 97 then you wouldn't have believed it since they have all gone on to better things but before that we had L.A. Confidential which was Crowe's and Pearce's ticket into Hollywood. Spacey had already made it with his Best Supporting Actor nod for The Usual Suspects but what puzzles me is how everybody apart from Kim Basinger didn't get any acting nominations at the Oscars.   James Cromwell is the most chilled out villain you'll ever going to see in a film like this and has been criminally ignored by the Academy.   Curtis Hanson was also someone who had made some good films but no masterpieces till this came along.They all must have sold their souls to make this because when you get big cast get together to make a Hollywood film then you become a bit intrigued by it because if the cast is big then is the story any good?  In L.A. Confidential's case it had both and a lot more to say the least.I still think that this is Spacey's, Crowe's and Pearce's best film of there career.  Russell Crowe as tough guy but sentimental towards women Bud White is flawless and is quite like the real Russell Crowe which is scary.  Guy Pearce as the quick witted but dumb looking Ed Exley is someone one you either love or you hate as the annoying rookie.   Kevin Spacey is just as cool as anything that Bogart and Mitchium could have pulled off as Jack Vincennes and there is the movie along with a great script by Brain Heagland of Mystic River fame and Curtis Hanson himself who put together a great script from James Elroy's novel.Kim Basinger is as sexy as she is going to get and her acting is very good and well deserving of her Oscar if the boys were robbed.   I liked how we had three different stories and one case that all had something to do with another but were all separate anyway till the end.   It was like watching a movie with three stories based on a trio of detectives.   L.A. Confidential was a treat as far as storytelling goes because it enthrals you into the film straight away as well as it being more exciting than a night out in Vegas.We don't see Detective films like this so we should be grateful that this came along when it did.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

It's the real events behind the scenes the public will never know as that knowledge would undermine perception of the institution, leaving one wondering how many narratives the public may have been fed as the truth was too graphic for widespread consumption.The movie was quite successful, with then relatively unknown Guy Pierce and Russell Crowe making big names of themselves by shining as the main protagonists.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

I've seen very little film noir but what I have are predominately modern day attempts (Man Who Wasn't There) and I've yet to really enjoy one, as the cinematography & mood often seem more important than a plot, and that happened here to a degree.The story was really hard work to follow. Not through being complicated but that you had to focus on every word & if you missed a single second you were lost. I don't mind corruption in police storylines even though it's been flogged about for years now, but I've seen it done better & more interestingly than here.There were plusses though. Great acting from Crowe & DeVito with Spacey & Pearce in good performances. But the less said about Basinger the better. I'm staggered she won an oscar. She wasn't in it a great deal, had very few lines and when you did see her she was shagging or being slapped. You can fast forward her scenes.Once the film gets going it's one of the most realistic portrayals of a decade from a Hollywood movie, ever. There's also a few thought provoking social issues thrown up, one or two excellently done, violent scenes, a great intro and some good all round action but sadly interspersed with a handful of meaningless & dull scenes that make the plot a bit stop-start.I just couldn't ever fully connect with any of the characters to love this film, which I never seem to be able to do with the darkness of Film Noir.A low 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

What?,"I admit to being amazed at the rating for this movie, higher than many better scripted and shot films whose time, I guess, has passed. Younger viewers like the lure of sex and violence in a glittering wrapper regardless of the quality of same. Sin City is the next derivation, and the next? I doubt it will say much about the human condition and how to live better, but then Hollywood has lost the Capras and Wilders who cared. LA confidential is a less than smart story of betrayal, stupidity, corruption, greed, sex and hopelessness. What is lacking is any sense of humanity and why we should want any of these people to live or die. Who are they and what do they tell us about life? Where is beauty, tragedy, sensuality, a sense of the thrilling and ephemeral? Who cares about a comic book?",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

On of the best movies of the past 20 years.,"L.A. Confidential most likely falls into the category of one of the best movies of the past twenty years. The complex story line seemed to burst at the seams with intelligence.  I found the complexity of several different sub-plots working together challenged the intellectual part of my brain while the intense action through out the entire movie satisfied the craving of the not-so-intellectual part of my brain that enjoys seeing a good brawl followed by a good shoot-out.  Brian Helgeland and Curtis Hanson did and excellent job of combining many elements of several different kinds of films into one.  They seem to have made this movie with several different audiences in mind.  I for one, as I have mentioned, enjoyed the intellectual aspect as well as the action, while my wife enjoyed the combination of a love story with drama.  It really has something for everyone.  Bringing together all of these elements into one film sets it apart from many others. Of course the best aspect of L.A. Confidential is the way that not everything is as it seems, and then, in an instant, all of the plots are sprung like a trap and come together for a grand finale.  Overall L.A. Confidential is an exceptional film that contains something for everyone.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Three very different kind of cops working together and growing towards each other,"""LA Confidential"" (1997, Curtis Hanson) is a neo noir film that is very faithful to the noir tradition. In the beginning of the film there is a woman with a big band aid on her nose. This seems to be a film quotation of ""Chinatown"" (1974, Roman Polanski). It is true that also ""Chinatown"" is a neo noir, but this film is much less faithful to the genre conventions. It is situated in bright daylight while in ""LA Confidential"" night scenes have (as usual in the noir tradition) much more screentime.""Noir"" and ""Neo Noir"" are cynical genres, and ""LA Confidential"" is no exception. The cynicism targets in the first place Hollywood itself. The girl with the band aid on her nose turns out to be a luxury prostitute restyled with the aid of plastic surgery into the look alike of a film star, suggesting a similarity between prostitution and acting.More important however is the cynical view on the LA Police department. In a lot of crime movies there is, apart from the crime to be solved, a subplot involving the private life (for example a bad marriage) or the job ife (for example a fight for a promotion) of the cops. In ""LA Confidential"" the main plot and the sub plot seems to have been swapped.We meet three different types of cops.Jack Vincennes (Kevin Stacey) is the hustler kind of type who sells scoops to a tabloid (from which ""LA Confidential"" incidentally derives its name).Bud White (Russel Crowe) is a cop driven by a sense of justice but also very loyal to the police. He is not always good at respecting the rights of the accused person but also not willing to blow the whistle on corrupted colleagues.Ed Exley (Guy Pierce) has the most developed sense of ethics, which is however often interpreted as a lack of loyalty.The essence of the film is for me these three very different kind of cops working together on a case and growing towards each other. The character development is portrayed brilliantly by the three above mentioned actors. Due to the competition of ""Titanic"" (1997, James Cameron) they didn't earn an Oscar, bud they did earn the start of a career.Kim Basinger was the one who did won an Oscar for best actress in a supporting role. She plays Lynn Bracken a luxury prostitute looking like Veronica Lake. As such she is a colleague of the woman with a band aid on her nose from the beginning of the film. In my opinion it is not so much the acting but rather the mere presence of Basinger that fully accounts for the Oscar. In one scene in ""LA Confidential"" she gives a foot massage. This one scene is more erotic than her complere performance in ""9,5 weeks"" (1986, Adrian Lyne).",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Eisenhower Era LA,"I think that all LA Confidential needed was possibly the writing touch of someone like Raymond Chandler or Dashiell Hammett. But since those two worthy gentleman are beyond reach, this is as good as it will get for the modern cinema.Anticipating the film Crash by several years, LA Confidential is a period piece set in the Eisenhower era Los Angeles and its police department which has a history of corruption more than most. A whole lot of separate incident are tied together quite intricately as the cast's three police heroes, together and separately piece it all together.Three very different kinds of cops are portrayed here. First is the laid back Kevin Spacey who has a casual attitude towards the corruption he sees. He's also the police adviser to a Dragnet style show and enjoys a whole lot of perks that come with it.Secondly is Guy Peace who's a real boy scout, but is the son of a hero cop and also knows how to work department politics. He doesn't look the other way on corruption, he rises in rank because he turned in fellow officers and he's hated up and down the line.Finally there's Russell Crowe whose character reminds me of the big dumb son in House of Strangers played by Paul Valentine who Edward G. Robinson made a guard in his bank. Even in the days before the Miranda decision, Crowe made a specialty of getting confessions the old fashioned way. Certain higher ups, particularly Captain James Cromwell recognize his unique talents and call him in when needed. Like Valentine though he proves in the end to be quite a bit smarter than everyone gives him credit for.The beating of some Mexican prisoners, the massacre of six people at a Hollywood Diner, a call girl service where the girls are made up to look like movie stars, a bisexual actor killed at a sleazy motel, and a whole lot more are all part of an complex story that won one of two Oscars LA Confidential received, for best screenplay adapted from another source.The second Oscar went to Kim Basinger as one of the call girls who is made up like Veronica Lake. She gets all the men in this cast into maxim hormonal overdrive, especially Pearce and Crowe. Basinger won for Best Supporting Actress that year.Woven into the story are such real characters as mob boss Mickey Cohen whose arrest for tax evasion sets up a lot of the situations here, his number one enforcer Johnny Stompanato and Lana Turner who would shortly be some of the biggest tabloid fodder ever.Look also for some nice performances from Ron Rifkin as the blackmailed District Attorney and Danny DeVito as a sleazy columnist.Had LA Confidential not come along in the same year as Titanic it might have won a few more Oscars including Best Picture which it lost to Titanic. Still the success of Crash, a film with similar structure and themes may redeem LA Confidential.Not that it needs much redemption because you won't be bored for an LA minute.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Simply a wonderful film that respects it's audience,"In the gritty LA of the 1950's, stardom is the boom industry and all is about appearance and visual image.  However under the surface drug use is rife, prostitution is rampant and the police officers are violent thugs.  In the middle of this are three officers with different aims.  Ed Exley is an ambitious young officer who will do anything to climb the ranks, Bud White is a muscle man and gets the job done while Jack Vincennes is only concerned with celebrity busts and getting his face in the paper.  When the three come together on a coffee shop killing that brings in elements of cases they are following they solve it together.  However each has suspicions that something is not right.I'm sorry to say that I didn't pick up on this at the cinema and it wasn't until the Oscars brought it to my attention that I first saw it.  Since then I have seen it several times and have enjoyed it every time.  The plot is slightly complex (although maybe not by the genre's standards) and it isn't simplified for the audiences sake  it respects the audience enough to trust us to keep up with it's pace.  The film is split into three strands dictated by the characters, they are not quite distinct but are mostly intertwined the whole way through  coming together in the final hour to great effect.The pace of the telling is great; it has moments of drama, of tension and great action.  Hanson has done a great job with the direction, he has a great sense of place and time to his 50's Hollywood  whether it be the stars' lives or the black suburbs  but he directs each scene with a sense of tension and urgency that the material deserves.  The final twist is OK if not great but it is more the telling of the story that is enjoyable, not just the denouncement.The casting did a great job of getting growth names and established qualities but no one huge star who could dominate the film.  It is the Australian stars that stand out here.  Pearce is excellent with a subtly changing character but it is Crowe that sticks in the memory with a very strong character and a performance to match.  Spacey is as quality as he ever is (or at least, was for a few years either side of this film) and the support cast is as good with De Vito, Basinger, Cromwell, Rifkin, Strathairn and Guilfoyle.There is nothing I really dislike about this film.  The longer than average running time is not a problem as it easily fills it without dragging at any point.  The film oozes class and has a great tough plot from Ellroy where nothing is as simple as right/wrong and everything comes together at the end.  A real classy film with brains and brawn which continues to be one of my favourites of recent years.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Incredible Look; Incredible Plot,"""L.A. Confidential"" is the kind of film that will make you laugh; make you gaze in amazement at its appeal, and become immersed in a murder mystery with so many twists and tangles that it could make your head spin. With one of the strongest plots I've ever seen, which is executed masterfully by Curtis Hanson, also has eye candy and sex appeal. The direction really is wonderful. The art direction is fantastic and brings you right back into the 50s. The acting is very good even if it comes off as 50s styled acting proving that todays actors are far superior than the actors of the 50s. ""L. A. Confidential"" even goes as far as poking fun at the sensationalized way films were made in that time period with a hilarious sequence where a cop on a show called, ""Badge of Honor,"" interrupts a women giving him details about some crime, and he says, ""Just the facts, ma'am. Just the facts.""The tangled and twisted plot is engrossing and filled with seduction, cons, lies, betrayal, killings, and corruption. The acting is terrific from a slew of great actors including Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, and Walter Cromwell plays one of the great villains I've ever seen. All of these guys have a lot of fun with their roles, and do an excellent job. Kim Basinger plays a prostitute who tries to look like a movie a star so that her pimp, Pierce Patchett (David Stratharin), can reap the benefits since everyone wants to be with a celebrity. ""L. A. Confidential"" is as much a look at the culture of the 50s, both commercially through television and the dirty business of police officers exposed, as it is being a stylized homage piece. This is a film that's done exceptionally well with some great lines, great performances, and a plot that will force you to watch it again and again. It hardly misses a beat. This is one of the few films that can recreate the 50s with its acting and style and still hold up with todays society. It works well as a film and exceptionally well as an homage piece.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
The City of Angels has never felt so stylish,"L.A Confidential is not only a superb achievement in filmmaking, it is a lesson on taking a fresh approach at a genre that could use a revival in contemporary narrative.This production tackles corruption, loyalty and treason in an elegant, yet aggressive and sophisticated manner; at times, it would seem to exhibit the essence of a Scorsese film (minus the profanity), and that can only be a good trait. There are many themes approached in this film, making it an appropriate choice for a very wide audience as it navigates through the world of the Los Angeles Police Department and the quirks of its members and some outsiders.The story is enthralling and developed diligently throughout the events from which it unfolds. The characters are all rather captivating and all act upon strong motivations. They are forced to be true to their nature at some points in the story, and to be someone else at others, which ultimately results in rich and complex characterizations. Acting is sensational from practically every corner, especially from the leads Spacey, Crowe and Pearce.The cinematography is just gorgeous, reflecting the beauty and the beast of L.A. The editing and the pace are quite polished and the dialogue feels very natural, which only compliments an already excellent cast and a direction worthy of nothing but praise.L.A.

Thrilling and powerful,"Rewatching L.A. Confidential for the first time in 13 years, I was surprised at how much better it is than I remembered, and how much better it stood the test of time than other movies of its time, Se7en for example. It's a genre piece for sure - Curtis Hanson is not after originality, he uses every trick in the book and fills his film with genre clichés, but he does it so cleverly that those clichés seem fresh and effective like they haven't been in many years, subverting every expectation the seasoned viewer has, while never actually leaving or deconstructing the genre.As for the cast - not one of the three leads are among my favorites, but all of them are at least partly pre-fame here - Kevin Spacey after his first Oscar but before his second, Russell Crowe before Gladiator, Guy Pearce before Memento - and they all do a terrific job, especially Spacey. James Cromwell, one of my favorite character actors, is chillingly good, and Basinger and DeVito deliver too. Very few police dramas manage to work a large cast of unique and well-developed characters as well as this one, and it makes for one of the most entertaining, powerful, thrilling movies I've seen in a long time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"For me, the best film of 1997 and one of the best at the end of the millennium.","This film is an excellent cinematic tribute, paying homage, in a way, not only to the golden age of American cinema, but also to cinema noir, with a style that largely resembles the stylized and gloomy look of these films, but devoid of shadows and something dark that characterizes them. The film is now a little forgotten, or at least I haven't seen it so much on TV specialized movie channels... but the fact is that it is a remarkable work of cinema, won two Oscars (Best Actress, for Kim Basinger, and Best Adapted Screenplay) and received nominations for seven more statuettes (Best Film, Best Director, Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction, Best Editing, Best Sound and Best Soundtrack). It was, in fact, the great film of 1997, even better than ""Titanic"".The film takes place in the golden years of Hollywood: shortly after the arrest of the biggest mobster in the city, the police seem determined to prevent the formation of new crime syndicates, but gradually the rot and corruption of the police force itself becomes evident. Among them, three policemen stand out, for different reasons: the brutal Bud White, the self-centered Jack Vincennes and the determined and incorruptible Ed Exley. Each of them, alone and in his own way, finds himself investigating the same crime: the death of a policeman in a massacre that took place inside a restaurant, and his eventual relationship with a mobster who runs a deal of luxury call-girls, surgically operated to resemble cinema stars.I loved this movie, in all its engaging ways. The script is extraordinary and develops in a wonderful way, giving each of the characters the time to develop, even some that would otherwise be relegated to an amorphous background. As in a good film noir, women are not as innocent as they appear, and the police are far from being the heroes. There are no one-sided characters, they all have a rich dark core, which the script takes as much advantage as it can.The cast is truly colossal and is full of big names. Kevin Spacey achieves, with this film, one of his best works as an actor, at least for me, and the same can be said of Kim Basinger, in a somber character that reminds us of one of the most wronged and forgotten actresses of the golden age of Hollywood : Veronica Lake. Did the Oscar given to Basinger this year also end up being, indirectly, a posthumous prize for this great actress, whom Hollywood devoured, but never esteemed or honored? In addition to these two actors, the film also features an excellent work by two Australian actors, Russel Crowe and Guy Pearce, both at the best level, and a great Danny De Vito, in an amoral and delightfully hypocritical character. James Cromwell was equally excellent in his role.Technically, the film is full of value and quality, starting with grandiose cinematography, which avoids falling into the commonplace of noir films and fills the screen with color and light, capturing the Californian sun and the beauty of the city in its rich colors. The filming locations chosen for the recordings are excellent and their judicious use helped the film to fit the period and the context in an impeccable way. The sets and costumes, as well as the automobiles that were used, help a lot in creating an environment and a clear temporal notion, and are magnificent on the screen. The soundtrack, in charge of Jerry Goldsmith, is impeccable and appears at the right time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"Interesting, well made, but wildly overrated.","In 1950's LA a set of cops - good, bad and everything in-between - solve crime against the background of show biz and political sleaze.One of those movies that you almost  want to throw money against the pay-window to see and yet walk out feeling that you have been short changed. Maybe what people are praising is not the production - but the ideas and background. The age when gossip magazines threw back the covers of Hollywood (for the first time) to reveal actors and players as they really were. Sadly this just a bit of window dressing to tart up a tired old good-cop-bad-cop police drama.Forget the rave reviews: There is nothing new going on in the foreground. Indeed it works it way to a climax so utterly predictable and shop-worn that it is almost unbelievable. After having some originality and vitality it comes down to a climax that would make a B movie western writer blush!Stacey is cool, Crowe is mad as hell (and not going to take it), Pierce is the college boy that does everything by the book. The guilty and the half guilty and the guilty-by-association get mixed up, but what the hell, they only get pushed up against a wall and have dirty tricks played on them. Probably how it was way back then.Bassinger gets an Oscar for doing nothing but looking sexy. I mean what does she do by way of acting? Look like an expensive hooker? Speak like she is jaded and embittered? Sharon Stone was better in Basic Instinct (and others!) and didn't get a mention for that. Even stranger still she seems to be barely in the movie (a glorified extra even?) and had to talked in to taking the role in the first place. Talk about right place and right place!The trouble with the film is that is gets its novel ideas over too quick and all it has left is to try and bring a bit of poetic justice to a scene where poetic justice was probably very much absent.Sorry, this  a bit of a fraud on the audience, it pretends to be different, pretends to be brave, but in truth it doesn't have to courage of its own convictions.

"Pretty good crime drama...but any comparisons to ""Chinatown"" may be premature","Sordid goods in a glossy package. Crime-drama from director Curtis Hanson concerning police corruption and murder in 1953 Los Angeles is, much like its scenario, seamy stuff underneath a classy veneer. Kevin Spacey is the narcotics officer, Russell Crowe the investigating officer, Guy Pierce the new lieutenant, Danny DeVito well-cast as the gossip columnist, and Kim Basinger the hooker whose bosses figure in the crime spree and drug-trafficking. Overstuffed, overwrought, with nasty sideline details detracting from the intense narrative of cops-gone-bad. The picture certainly looks good, and keeps its momentum up despite a byzantine plot that becomes harder and harder to follow. Basinger won the Supporting Actress Oscar; the screenplay also copped statues for Hanson and Brian Helgeland, who based their script on James Ellroy's novel.

This movie successfully avoided stereotypical characters; each character had many motivations, some sympathetic, some not. Loved Kevin Spacey's performance (not unusual), and Guy Pearce was really good as Exley.

Probes the Seamy Underbelly Beneath the Surface Allure of 1950's L.A!,"Spicy and boiling-hot, the sensational noir style crime drama L.A. Confidential is a morality play disguised as pulp fiction - a sprawling saga of venality and redemption set against a flashy 1950's Los Angeles backdrop of easy money, blazing guns and cheap, illicit thrills told with a cool eye and overwhelming evil.Based on James Ellroy's 1990 novel, the movie's L.A. is a shining place where almost everybody has a guilty secret. That includes the triumvirate of LAPD cops - the flamboyant ""Hollywood Jack"" Vincennes (Kevin Spacey), the bare-knuckled brute veteran Wendell ""Bud"" White (Russell Crowe) and the straight-arrow, rich kid Ed Exley (Guy Pearce) - who are thrown together during several investigations and the scandalous tabloid journalist Hudgeons (Danny DeVito) who spews them out to the public. When a nightclub massacre leaves six dead, including a disgraced ex-cop, three black juveniles are arrested soon thereafter. But this apparently cut-and-dried case leads to more insidious developments. As our lead cops dig deeper into what at first seems a simple shootout in a downtown diner, they come to believe that the bust was a setup, the dead suspects fall guys and soon discover links to a furtive call-girl ring run by vice king Pierce Patchett (David Strathairn), whose hookers (including Lynn Bracken played by Kim Basinger) have been surgically altered to resemble famous Hollywood stars. Despite their antagonism toward each other - exacerbated by their mutual attraction to Lynn - Exley and White link up to get to the bottom of it all. Drugs, prostitution, dirty politics in high places and mob wars - everything that feeds scurrilous magazines like Hudgeon's 'Hush Hush' becomes the reality the three cops disinter. And it gets worse as they go deeper.Ingeniously adapted by Curtis Hanson and his co-writer, Brian Helgeland, L.A.Confidential is a juicy noir stew of amorality that's gives us a richly populated, self-contained little world that operates according to its own rules. That world is unsavory and grim, an un-magical kingdom of gleaming mansions and corpses rotting in basements. But Hanson and his actors make it a world we believe. The three central cops are all pungent, colorful and terrifically well-played; their combined charisma almost smashing through the screen. Spacey oozes ring-a-ding charm and is slyly hilarious as preening, showboat cop Vincennes. Crowe bristles with hair-trigger tension and exudes a unique and sexy toughness. Pearce makes a wonderful prude who perfectly catches the ""no-flies-on-me"" swagger of a rich boy on the rise. Although she's playing a stock character, Basinger exudes a chaste sultriness and is terrific as a Veronica Lake double. The large supporting cast is tops, too. It's hard to imagine a better slimy scandal-sniffer than DeVito, a colder-hearted cop than Cromwell or a smugger vice lord than Strathairn.L.A. Confidential is a movie bull's-eye: noir with an attitude, a thriller packing punches that gives up its evil secrets with a smile.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Essential Film Noir,"L.A. Confidential, one of the best pictures of the '90s (in fact, it could have won the 1997 Best Picture Oscar: it's so much better than Titanic), is the definitive proof that there is no such thing as an ""unfilmable"" book: Curtis Hanson (with the help of co-writer Brian Helgeland) has turned James Ellroy's noir masterpiece (which is 800 pages long) into a 135-minute long modern classic. It's THE noir of the '90s!The story takes place in L.A., early '50s. It's a city where everything looks perfect, where everybody goes to become a movie star. But, as Danny De Vito's opening voice-over informs us, it's not as good as it looks: the ""City of Angels"" is actually run by Al Capone-clones such as Mickey Cohen (Paul Guilfoyle, aka CSI's Brass), and the police... Well, it just so happens a lot of the LAPD is among the mob's unofficial employees. And it's in this kind of environment that we first meet the three key players: Ed Exley (Guy Pearce) is an ambitious young man who wants to be as good as his dad and do his job properly, even if that includes turning in his colleagues; Bud White (Russell Crowe) is a disillusioned cop who not only accepts violence as part of the job, but even uses it as often and much as possible in his personal crusade against wife-beating men (as his partner puts it:""You're like Santa Claus with that list, Bud, Except everyone on it's been naughty""); and Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) is the classic ""Hollywood Cop"", who gets paid by tabloids to bust coke-snorting celebrities. These three men, so different, will have to join forces when they discover their respective cases, which involve corruption, drugs, prostitution and various murders, are all linked to the Nite Owl massacre...The award-winning script's focus is on the differences and similarities that connect the three protagonists and their views on the law. Hanson has completely removed the subplots concerning Vincennes and Exley's love lives (which occupied quite a bit of the book), preferring to show us only the bond between Bud White and Lynn Bracken, a whore but also the one person who truly understands the conflict and hatred that are at the center of the brutal cop's mind and soul. She's an extraordinary person, and she's played by a great actress: Kim Basinger, who was justly given an Oscar for her performance. As for the other actors, L.A. Confidential kick-started Pearce's career, confirmed Spacey's status as Best Actor of the Decade and reminded us that James Cromwell and David Strathairn are two of the best character actors around. But it's Crowe, in his Hollywood debut, who really steals the show. Forget A Beautiful Mind, The Insider, hell, even Gladiator: this is the role that should have obtained the Academy's attention.New to the genre? This movie is a good start, alongside The Untouchables. Already a fan, and excited about Brian De Palma's upcoming adap of Ellroy's The Black Dahlia? Just keep watching L.A. Confidential in the meantime.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
City of Angels? More Like City of Demons!,"Curtis Hanson directs and co-adapts the screenplay with Brian Helgeland from legendary pulp novelist James Ellroy's novel. It stars Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, James Cromwell, Kim Basinger, Danny DeVito and David Strathairn. Music is by Jerry Goldsmith and cinematography by Dante Spinotti.It's 1950s Los Angeles and three cops of very different morals and stature are about to be entwined in crime and corruption...I admire you as a policeman, particularly your adherence to violence as a necessary adjunct to the job.Tremendous film making. Hanson takes Ellroy's labyrinthine story and pumps it with period authenticity and seamless direction, the latter of which sees him garner superlative performances from the cast. This is the side of Los Angeles nobody wants to talk about, it's awash with corpses, hookers, seedy set-ups, violence, drugs, racism and corruption a go-go. And that's just involving the politicians, the press and the coppers!Rollo Tomasi.The absence of genuine heroes on show still further keeps ""The City of Angels"" covered in dark clouds, where even as the plot twists and turns, as the mysteries unravel and brutality unfurls, the final destination of the principal characters is never clear, thus there's a continuing edge of seat pulse beat within the pic. It's also sexy and dangerous, the dialogue sharper than a serpent's tooth, and while the ending is a little too cosy as opposed to original noir wave conventions, this is pure noir in all but black and white photography.It won only two Academy Awards, Basinger for Best Actress in a Supporting Role and for Hanson and Hegeland for Best Writing - Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published. Frankly it should have won a dozen or so for it's not just one of the best films of the 1990s, but also one of the best Neo-Noirs ever produced. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Every little thing matters,"My favorite thing about this movie is that every little thing matters, there's 0 fluff, and not a second of your time is wasted. Threads that are set up earlier in the movie pay off later so beautifully. Not even talking about the amazing 50s Los Angeles setting, which is as atmospheric as any movie ever did a period piece. The movie has such great arcs for our leads too, they start the movie in one place and end in a completely different, you can really feel the impact of the events that happened to them at the end of the film. I watched this movie last night for my 4th watch I believe and I watched it all the way through with focus as if I had never seen it before, I love it when the movie even on repeat viewing just doesn't let you go and you so invested even tho you know everything that's gonna happen, you still so engaged and captive by the story and the performances.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

"Keep a Score Card Handy, but It's Worth It","Ordinarily a ""2-hour+"" movie with an equally dense storyline would give me the shudders. But I have to admit that these folks manage to bring it off in riveting style, even though the many narrative threads don't merge until the end. To that point, I was keeping a scorecard to track the characters and plot, that is, unless somebody was taking a slug to the gut, which was pretty much every few minutes.I've got to admit that this movie may have the single most stunning moment that I've experienced in 60-odd years of movie watching. I don't know anything about director Hanson, but he manages that scene, plus the whole ball of wax, in really expert style, worthy of the best of the craft.What lingers for me is what the movie says about one of the most popular TV shows of the early 1950's. In those days, Jack Webb's Dragnet pretty much took audiences, myself included, by storm, as it portrayed police work in near documentary style. More importantly the episodes were proudly set in Los Angeles with the announced cooperation of that city's police force. The movie's Vincennes (Spacey) character is clearly intended to be an adviser to that TV show. So a comment is pretty much also intended.Needless to say, the cops of Dragnet were portrayed as nothing less than professional in both attitude and behavior. As a result, police work was so defined for a whole generation of young Americans. However, if even one-tenth of this movie's script is to be believed, then what do we say about the integrity of that long-ago police drama or about the beliefs that so many of us held to. Not a pretty prospect.Anyway, the movie's a darn good neo-noir done in convincing period fashion. And for geezers like myself, it was fun seeing again the styles of my youth.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"Nail-biting, complex crime drama with all-star-cast and based on James Ellroy's novel","Three two-fisted cops (Kevin Spacey, Guy Pearce, Russell Crowe) are set on separarate paths as a mass murder in a diner proves to be a cover for something more sinister, involving a hush hush gossip columnist in the persona of Sid Hudgens (Danny DeVito) and the smooth operator (David Strathairn) of a call-ring whose hookers have been redesigned to look like film stars. And along the way, a gorgeous prostitute (Kim Basinger) falls for one of whom. All of them become involved into a bloodbath murder case, corruption and violent events. Off the record, on the QT, and very hush-hush...Everything is suspect...everyone is for sale...and nothing is what it seems!. It's a crime saga that will shock you! . It's a mystery that will keep you guessing! . It's a thriller that will keep you riveted! .A modern-day attempt at Film Noir seems to work best when set in the post-war period of its heyday. L. A. Confidential(1997) is a complex crime drama based on James Ellroy's even more complicated novel. Settings , costumes and ambience seem to place a perfect period piece. Fifties Hollywood is ripe with corruption in many forms, such as politics, police, business, gangsters, racial tensions, and journalistic sleaze and here are shown all of them . Several hard-boiled roles interweave in one of those satisfying plots replete with darkness and violence, where all the pieces fall into into place at the end. Here the cops fall out, band up , are almost coerced into killing one another and shoot it out with the bad guys form the nub of an engrossing, constantly hard-as-nails tale, conventional at heart, but crisp and atmospheric in the execution. There's a motley group of interesting characters here and there: the ruthlessly ambitious cop finely played by Guy Pearce; Kevin Spacey as Sgt Jack Vicennes who serves as an advisor to a TV cop show similar to Dragnet ; the violent, bull-in-a-china-shop police officer Bud White nimbly performed by Russell Crowe; Kim Basinger as world-weary Lynn who gets involved with the twisted plot while falls for one of the cops , a wealthy pimp/businessman played by David Strathairn; the veteran with a long police career who knows everything Dudley Smith professionally acted by James Cromwell and , of course, Danny DeVito as a greedy editor of tabloid Hush Hush; alongside a plethora of secondaries in brief appearances, such as: Ron Rifkin, Matt McCoy, Paul Guilfoyle, Paolo Seganti, Amber Smith, Simon Baker, among others.It displays a suspenseful and thrilling musical score by the great Jerry Goldsmith. As well as evocative and colorful cinematography by cameraman Dante Spinotti. The motion picture was competently directed by Curtis Hanson . He began screenwriting and directing in the early 1970s, but didn't see serious success until he directed The hand that rocks the Cradle (1992). That film, which starred Rebecca De Mornay as a revenge-seeking nanny, became a major hit. Hanson went on to direct Wild River (1994) with Meryl Streep and Kevin Bacon. Hanson also was in the director's chair for Wonder boys (2000), starring Tobey Maguire and Michael Douglas that is considered his best work by many fans and critics. His breakthrough as an acclaimed filmmaker came with L. A. Confidential (1997), which he co-wrote and directed. Hanson won a screenwriting Oscar for the film. Hanson also directed Eminem's tale of Detroit hip-hop, 8 mile (2002). Hanson went on writing, producing and directing films until his death in 2016 at 71. Rating : 7.5/10, a notable thriller with some Noir elements . See this one for Russel Crowe, Kevin Spacey, Guy Pearce's acting. Let's just say that Hanson does a masterful job tying up all the loose ends and still leaving you wanting more.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
I just can't get over the ending -- too pat.,"One of the strengths of this movie was that it was an old-fashioned film noir made without any of the constraints that the old studio system would have required.  The old studios rules were that: good always will prevail (check), there must be a romance (check, in a movie as cynical as this one the Kim Basinger - Russell Crowe romance really seems out of place) and possible redemption (check, Kevin Spacey).  This wouldn't have bothered me except the first part of the movie was so good and was moving towards a modern (complicated and unresolved) finish when it was like the studio swooped in and said ""No, we better make sure there is a happy ending so we won't offend anyone.""  Oh sure, there is plenty of profanity and a big emphasis on sex, drug use and racism to give ""L.A. Confidential"" the modern edge but where's that ""Forget it, it's Chinatown, Jake"" finish?",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Mediocre Neo-noir,"""L. A. Confidential"" is another overrated Oscar-winning film which is currently #115 on IMDB's top 250 list for some unknown reason, probably because it is so self-referential to Hollywood. However this mediocre film is nowhere to be found on my own personal Top 250 list as it offers me nothing really new for the genre or any thought-provoking ideas. Though ""Mulholland Falls"" (the prior year's film which ""L. A. Confidential"" tries to ineffectively copy or spoof) is on my list at spot #125. ""Mulholland Falls"" is a much better film and I would recommend it instead; I know that's not the consensus but that is my belief. All I could think the whole time I was watching ""L. A. Confidential"" is why aren't I just watching ""Mulholland Falls"", why bother with a cheap imitation. While ""L. A."" is well made technically, it lacks heart and depth and feels like it's too invested in spoofing or winking at Hollywood and L. A. I also didn't care much for the music, storyline, or characters.

"""Go back to Jersey, sonny. This is the City of the Angels, and you haven't got any wings.""","FILM: 10.0
It's safe to say I've been a fan of L. A. Confidential since day one, 27 years ago. From the moment I first saw it, I knew this film was something special. As an Aussie, I was instantly thrilled to see two local talents, Guy Pearce and Russell Crowe, in lead roles, and I've been a fan of both ever since. Pearce's portrayal of Ed Exley is captivating, with his character's ambition and complexity pulling me in. Between this and his role in Ravenous a couple of years later, Pearce cemented himself as one of my favourite up-and-coming actors.Crowe's Bud White is another highlight. His performance is layered, revealing a man whose moral code is shaped by brutal acts, but also a deep sense of justice when it comes to protecting women from violence. Watching these two actors spar on screen is electric, and the rest of the cast doesn't disappoint either. Kevin Spacey, James Cromwell, Kim Basinger, Danny DeVito, and David Strathairn all deliver stunning performances. Director Curtis Hanson pulls the best out of each of them, and no one puts a foot wrong.The film's script, adapted by Brian Helgeland and Hanson, is a masterpiece. I'm a big fan of James Ellroy's novel, but I find the film's ability to distill such an expansive story into a tightly crafted narrative to be flawless. The balance of classic film-noir elements with a more modern (for 1997) cinematic style makes the film feel timeless. Jerry Goldsmith's score is pitch-perfect, adding just the right amount of atmosphere.I can't help but think of how this film was overshadowed by Titanic at the Oscars. Like The Shawshank Redemption before it, L. A. Confidential deserved more recognition and the loss cemented my lack of interest in what the academy thought about cinema. Without a doubt, it's my favourite film of 1997, and I love it more with every rewatch. Perfection.FORMAT: Blu-rayVIDEO: 8.0

One of the Best of Modern Classic Noir,"Yet another in the long line of movies I have been meaning to see but putting off for some reason, ""L.A. Confidential"" might have captured my top Noir slot. Maybe it was just my laziness and lack of investigating that made me think it was going to be some boring, people talking movie but I couldn't have been more wrong.Sure it has its talky scenes but these are punctuated throughout by grisly murders, seductions, police raids, and shoot outs, and yet, it doesn't skimp on story, character, cinematography, or humor.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Cop vs. Cop,"""Come to Los Angeles. The sun shines bright, the beaches are wide and inviting, and the orange groves stretch as far as the eye can see. There are jobs aplenty, and land is cheap. Every working man can have his own house, and inside every house, a happy all-American family. You can have all this, and who knows? You can even be discovered. Become a movie star, or at least be one. Life is good in Los Angeles. It's paradise on earth . . . (laughs) . . . That's what they tell you anyway. That's because they're selling an image . . ."" So speaks Walter Winchell sound-alike Sid Hudgens (Danny DeVito) while we see sparkling images of LA life (and catch glimpses of movie stars like Marilyn, Frank Sinatra, and Deborah Kerr).Hudgens produces ""HUSH-HUSH"" magazine, a Hollywood scandal tabloid. Behind all of the glamor there is the seamy side of LA, and Hudgens continues his narrative: Mickey Cohen (by the way, a real person) had taken over the Hollywood crime rackets. His associate is Johnny Stompanato, Lana Turner's love interest (also in real life). But Cohen is soon arrested and imprisoned for income tax evasion. The control of the rackets is thus left open, and hit squads are knocking off the top lieutenants. Sarcastically pointed out are the LA police, who are not against planting evidence and grabbing a few bucks and administering beatings (and, as we soon discover, are not averse to using ethnic slurs, such as wop, jig, and spic). The focus of the movie is an exposé of the LAPD, warts and all.The tale – and it is a serpentine one – is about the intertwining paths of three separate police officers who maintain the peace by their own separate actions: Edmund Exley (Guy Pearce), Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey), and Wendell ""Bud"" White (Russell Crowe). Exley is squeaky clean, while Vincennes is compromising and likes to keep his hands unsoiled. White uses brutal methods, to say the least. Despite their differing tactics, and the fact that they may clash with each other (and how!), these three are all basically respectable policemen. At an inquest, Detective White is termed a ""thug"" by DA Ellis Loew (Ron Rifkin), who has his own demons (see what happens to him!). White's partner is Dick Stensland (Graham Beckel), a loose canon if there ever was one. Exley was first in his class (out of 123) and chose the detective bureau against the advice of Captain Dudley Smith (James Cromwell). Exley also disagrees with the stiff and sordid Smith, who uses extreme methods that are quite frankly illegal. Exley believes in following the code of honor to the letter. Meanwhile narcotics detective Vincennes works on the side as a technical adviser on ""Badge of Honor,"" a TV police show like ""Dragnet."" As a publicity guy he is also involved in publisher Hudgen's scoops, such as setting up celebrities in compromising situations.The three cops are involved with unraveling the pervasive LA corruption like peeling layers on an onion. There are a series of events that initially do not seem to be tied in. But they are all related to the twisted plot. To mention a few incidents: A parole violator beats up his wife on Christmas night, Mexican suspects are arrested and beaten in jail (they had supposedly killed a cop), White meets prostitute Lynn Bracken (Kim Basinger) at a liquor store, an ex-cop driver by the name of Leland ""Buzz"" Meeks is shaken up by White, a corpse rots in a crawl space under a porch, and homosexual actor Matt Reynolds is found dead with his throat cut. But the main occurrence that sets the ball rolling is the massacre of six people (including two waitresses) at the Nite Owl Café, where a recently dismissed cop (scapegoat?) was also murdered. Now the investigation begins in earnest. Several Negroes are conveniently implicated in the carnage; they have records (they know something about the kidnapping and continuous rape of a Mexican woman). Later Stompanato reveals to White about a missing heroin cache of 25 pounds. Meanwhile slimy rich pimp Pierce Morehouse Patchett (David Strathaim), owner of the ""Fleur-de-Lis"" prostitution ring, has ""cut girls"" (call girls who have plastic surgery to resemble the likenesses of Hollywood actresses, like Veronica Lake and Rita Hayworth). As the film progresses key characters show up dead. Then there is a shocking revelation at the one-hundredth minute mark when even a major lead is murdered (although there are red herrings). Stick with this one until its riveting climax at the Victory Motel!The atmosphere of the movie feels like it is late December 1953 or January 1954: the cars, the clothing, and the hairstyles. The film does not need popular music of the 1950s to generate the feel of the period. Note that except for Kay Starr's ""Wheel of Fortune"" (1952), most of the rather modest soundtrack comes from the 1930s and 1940s. Now one may complain that the unfurling of so many characters causes some confusion. But the story – tense and suspenseful all the way – does unfold quite neatly. And such excellent character development is often not seen enough in motion pictures. The performances of the leads are all at a high level (Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, and others) although Jack Nicholson did win the Oscar for Best Actor. Although her part was small, Kim Basinger won both the Oscar and Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress. ""L.A. Confidential"" did garner the Oscar for Best Writing and also was nominated for quite a number of other Oscars, including that of Best Picture, Director, and Cinematography. It is indeed refreshing to see a big-budget feature that delivers. Roger Ebert placed this one into his top ten films listing of 1997. Some folks believe that it just might be the best movie of that year! It is certainly one of the best features of the 1990s decade!",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Sometimes you have to become corrupt to root out the corruption.,"What a meticulously crafted crime drama. 'L.A. Confidential' doesn't only stand the test of time because of its detailed script and direction, magnificent acting or, even because of the wonderful score, but also thanks to the wonderfully created 1950' Los Angeles. Very few period pieces can create such an authentic atmosphere, that you as a viewer can feel like part of that world.'L.A. Confidential' seems to work on both levels - intelligent crime drama with complex characters, and it is also a stylish action film. The seemingly straightforward story will make many turns along the way, thus playing with the audience, and also with the characters. The characters will change with the story and no-one will stay the same. The line between right and wrong is vague it is hard to distinguish what is bad and what is good.With a movie boasting with such acting talents, one can only expect supreme performances.

Every performance perfectly supports the other.A timeless classic with timeless performances and classic tale of honor and morale.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"An abandoned cinema gem sung by many, kicked away by Titanic.","1998 should be a memorable year not only because of the 11 Oscars sweep by the monstrous Titanic, but also because of an abandoned cinema gem that comes out and went away like a gentlemen. That is L.A.Confidential.The parallel storytelling used in this movie were never so fresh and intelligent. If you notice, the 3 cops were all portrayed out of an order, in separate scenes of reconciled scenes. This perfectionist technical undertone gave this movie a perfect presentation of a good novel in every aspect. To note, the camera moves fluently and was so rich in detail that you'd need 10 or more viewings to fetch everything intended. The mystery, although entirely implied and unfolded until the very last moments, was mounted up in a most entertaining way that the director actually achieved a balance between popular entertainment and subtle/intelligent arts. All in all, the presentation itself is a miracle and worth a viewing.Unlike most crime saga, L.A.Confidential assumed the role of a watchdog, a whistle-blower and an entertainer just like the 3 roles Crowe, Spacey and Pearce had in the story. While I recommended the Dark Knight only to those 20 years and older, I recommend this to 15 years and older because it will give them some very good lessons as a person who's about to enter the society. In other words, if interpreted properly, it can be really educating. Rarely could a detective story reflect the racial problem, corruption problem and the unhappy side of a golden age so detailed and realistically. Everything has a smell of 1950's thanks to the superb art decoration.The characters, are all memorable that I could even recite their lines scene by scene. Sargeant Bud White was all women-beaters' nightmare, but he's also a cheap asset who do the muscle job and didn't ask questions--a watchdog. Sargeant Jack Vincennes was an entertainer who enjoyed his little affiliation with Hollywood and utilized every opportunity filling his own self-filled respect and honor.Sargeant Ed Exley the whistle-blower/politician had no muscle or affiliation therefore must work his own way up to the attention of his Captain, the sophisticated Dudley Smith. For each of the 3 main cops, they've got their definitive little details, expressions and moments. Their early stories were all wrapped up in an exaggerated tone told by Sid Huggins' Hush-Hush magazine, realizing their run-of-the-mill status. Later in the movie, their interactions became some of the greatest moments in the movie history. The undertone dropped to a downright reality and dynamics, giving all the threads more fun too see. Well, I still want to talk about human nature portrayed, just that would consume all your time. So enjoy it by your self.It's been 12 years since its release and it's still ranking high in Top 64 on top 250. Another 12 years will only make it even more shiny. It's not a cult classic, but it's the greatest detective movie with a lot to think about. If anyone wants to appreciate techniques and performance, one should head for French Connection or Chinatown. If one wants to appreciate techniques, performances, musics, beauties and an up-beating story which delivers a practical/positive message using the darkest context, go for L.A.Confidential. Hush-hush!

Acivement in world class,"L.A. Confidential is perhaps, one of the best and most intriguing pieces of moving picture in the past few decades. The brilliancy of the script itself, deserves a standing ovation, because it is in my opinion, one of the most thought-out and nerve wrecking of its time. The direction by Curtis Hanson gives this intense and complex movie softness and makes a gentle approach to the audience, because none of the material is forced through, but instead it rests quietly in the subconsciousness of the audience the whole time. The plot is just awesome and stands out from any of the former (and later) police/criminal movies, because we get to experience the action behind the curtain, from a passive point of view. The plot has a great balance between tossing us into the action, and gently luring us through one mystery after another, trying to find the answers. The actors give the ideas of the script and the characters faces, and gives us a chance to relate and identify with the characters involved. Each of them delivers great performances: Spacey as always smart, sly and above all believable, though he does not exceed his brilliant performance in ""The Usual Suspects"". Crowe with his, so far, best performance in my opinion, with temper and depth. Pearce with an OK performance without really reaching the top, but fills out his character nicely. Devito is amusing and cool and does everything he can to contribute to this movie. Basinger with her Oscar-winning role, plays the beautiful blond convincingly and spices up the last aspect of the movie, with splendor and depth as well.

The character of Russell crowe was so dynamic,full of life and the chemistry between the three main actors were greatly shown. There can't be a better cop movie with corruption. And as I said earlier,this movie deserves more rating.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
The best police drama ever,"One of the best if not the best movie in my personal pantheon of cinema's most precious jewels.This is the show of Kevin Spacey, who's performance is just amazing, especially when we can watch his inner personal change from slick, crooked cop to someone who try to get back his lost way.But what I love the most about this movie is Russel Crowe. I remember him from his very first movie - Roomper Stomper. Since than he create many of amazing movie characters, but his play in L.A. Confidential is just stunning. His rough, brutal character with dark history is great acted, I can almost feel his anger towards anyone who hurt woman.And even small things matters - everyone who know Rollo Tomassi, know what I am talking about...I have seen this one more than 20-30 times, lost count at some moment, but I know there are many more times to come, because I cannot get enough of good, old style police drama.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Perfect,"The best American film of the 1990s, the movie that made me believe in Hollywood again. The movie that jump-started Kiam Basinger's second chance and the movie that proved the star power of Russell Crowe. The characters played by both of them are profoundly human, flawed yet endearing, and they deliver lines that blow you away, as good as anything Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall delivered in ""The Big Sleep"". The twists and turns of the plot keep you nailed to your seat and there are scenes so suddenly surprising that the first time you see them you don't believe your eyes. Kevin Spacey shines as a cop who thinks he's cool and who can be bought for a penny, while Danny de Vito reminds us that he can be a great actor as a quick-buck pathetic journalist who makes a profit of exposing human weakness to gossip and scandal oblivious of the lives he ruins day after day. David Strathairn makes a mark with an almost invisible role, James Cromwell gives an Academuy-award giving performance and Guy Pierce breaks through as a glassy-eyed careerist who wins acclaim and loses his soul as he pushes his way up the ranks of the L.A. police force. The only way to succeed in the city of fallen angels is corruption, to follow the devil's advice and to ""lose the glasses, boyo."" To climb up in this town you need to freefall down. There's no success like failure -I'm quoting Dylan-- and failure's no success at all.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
The Fox Is Guarding the Chicken Coop!,"This is a great mood piece. It has a sense of time and place, not to mention some incredibly memorable characters. This is early Russell Crowe and he is really a movie presence. This has so many layers and yet it plays fairly. The people are multi-dimensional from James Cromwell, whom I love, to Kim Basinger, a really underrated actress. And, of course, Kevin Spacey is his solid self. I've seen so many portrayals of corrupt police forces and without a delicate touch, this could have been clichéd. It wasn't. We have a balance of show business and violence, drugs, you name it. We have an overzealous son of a cop who we start out hating and then begin to accept because he is driven in the right direction. I missed this the first time through during Titanic-mania, and I've always been turned off by the title (the tabloids of the fifties), but this doesn't fail to satisfy.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
The Good & Bad Of L.A. Confidential,"The GOOD - Interesting, start-to-finish and a real visual treat if you like to see the 1940s on film. This has the gloss of ""Chinatown,"" cinematography-wise with nice period detail. It also had the advantage of modern-day surround sound. Meanwhile, the cast does an outstanding job with such modern-day stalwarts as Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, Kim Bassinger, Danny DeVito, Guy Pearce, David Strathairn and James Cromwell. All of them played interesting characters. As a fan of the '40s Veronica Lake. I enjoyed Bassinger's impersonation of her. Veronica should have looked this good!The BAD - A sordid feel to this film almost all the way through, from the tabloid mentality-narrative by Danny DeVito through all the various creeps and corrupt cops. Speaking of the latter, I just get so tired of filmmakers' almost always making the police look bad. In this film, everyone is dirty, even the only supposed ""clean cop"" (Pearce) who compromises his integrity in the end, too. They make the cops look even worse than normal by showing them blaming a black person who is really innocent. That's fine for To Kill A Mockingbird in 1962 but by this time all it demonstrates is Hollywood Liberals playing the race card again. Also, the story is a bit too mean-edged for me, with too many usages of the Lord's name in vain.OVERALL - There is no denying this is an intriguing film, glossy and slick with just one short lull and one that keeps you involved for almost two hours. So, for the entertainment value, even with the negatives, this is worth checking out, especially if you are a fan of film noir.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Should win for the best movie at 1997,"Hanson, Helgeladn and their production crew with the unseen strike of genius. Also some of the actors doing their best work. Especially Kim Basinger and Russel Crow in his first big Hollywood role. And of course the fitting music from veteran Jerry Goldsmith. As sad in my title this picture should have taken the big award back in 1997. Too bad another really great movie Titanic was involved. But you know the Titanic is the perfect popcorn Hollywood cinema you can think of (I mean it in a GOOD way, i love the movie). And that plays a lot for academy members even today. But really I take this beautiful, stylish noir detective story even over the masterful Goodfellas. Meaning it is in my opinion the best American movie of the 90s. Definitely a blue-ray edition in every movie fan collection recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"Not that great, but love Crowe","Not that great, but love Crowe I cannot help but feel that this is more than a touch overrated. And although it is a good movie without much doubt, I just don't understand the buckets of a admiration that so many people have towards it. Yes it's well made and acted, but it's also flat, overly long, and quite a joyless watch too, while the plot is nothing that hasn't been done many times before with its good cop caught between his corrupt allies and superiors. One thing that this does do well is that it feels like an actual portrayal of the darker side of criminal life back then (although when Guy Pearce uses a handlkerchief to open the door to the night owl cafe with its two billion finger prints smothered all over it, I couldn't help but chuckle) even compared to the original movies of that period this has more guts with its swear laden script and more explicitly sleazy elements that wouldn't have ever passed through the censors back in the 40s-early 50's. This overall thanks to its better elements is worth a look, but I don't feel it's the modern classic many claim it to be.",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Brilliant,"I usually refrain from reviewing films on IMDb unless I feel very passionately about them and believe that I need to voice my opinion. This can apply to both films that I loved or despised. Either way, I see no point in reviewing a mediocre film that I forget about the second I step out of the theatre. With that having been said, L.A. Confidential is nothing short of perfection. As with any great film everything starts with the screenplay which in this case was written by Brian Helgeland and Curtis Henson, the latter of which was also the director. The script was adapted from a novel by James Ellroy that I'm ashamed to say I haven't read. However, I have heard that many believed it to be an impossible task to adapt the novel into a film. That makes the screenplay of Helgeland and Henson all the more impressive. An equally daunting task for a great film is to assemble a top notch cast. Once again, L.A. Confidential hits the mark with one of the most impressive casts in recent film history. Russell Crowe, Kevin Spacey, Kim Basinger (who received an Oscar for her role), Guy Pearce, James Cromwell, and Danny DeVito comprise the absolutely top class cast of the film. Yet in my opinion, all of the aforementioned aspects of the film are not even the best part. The best part has to be the absolutely tremendous set designs, costumes, and general recreation of 1950's Hollywood culture. I feel that this was an amazing time and place in American history, and this film takes the audience there. One of the best scenes in L.A. Confidential involves two of the main characters running into a Hollywood starlet who they believe is a fake. What I love about this scene is how subtly the director reminds us that this isn't just any place in America, this is 1950's Hollywood where huge stars like Lana Turner can be found socializing with a member of the mob at a local hot spot. That is the beauty of this film. You feel like you're watching a 1950's film noir through a 1990's camera lens.If you're taking the time to read my review, you're probably wondering why I haven't discussed the plot of the film. The answer to this question is simple, there is really no need. All you have to know is that it's a brilliant film that you should watch no matter what genre of movies you are into. This is in my opinion one of the top ten movies of the last decade and easily the best picture of 1997. Ironically, it lost the Best Picture Oscar that year to Titanic which I feel was the greatest oversight in recent Oscar history. This is a one of a kind film, the likes of which I'm afraid we won't see for a long time to come, if ever. Lastly, if you have not yet seen L.A. Confidential I hope that my review inspires you to do so. Conversely, if you have already experienced it I hope that you are reminded, if only for a brief moment, of what great film making truly is.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Flawless masterpiece that is entertaining like no other,"Just rewatched it after like 20 years (on VHS as it's not available on Prime?!) When I watch old favorites, I often downgrade my ratings (you know, there is more to love than first sights)This one I upgraded from 9/10 to 10/10. This movie is flawless. The story alone would make this a standout film: it is complex enough that it requires the viewer's full attention, with turns of events that are deeply entertaining even on repeated watching. But the movie more than just a great story: it is action packed entertainment that is long but fast paced (you may need to strain your brain to follow the full story, but it's all there, no shortcuts, plot holes or leaps of faith), and also beautifully crafted cinema (glamorously produced and shot, with great music and cast). It is also a piece of art: its characters are deep enough to engage the viewer, they evolve with the story and the acting is absolutely flawless.This is a great film no matter how you classify it: as a crime story, or an action flick, or a period gangster movie, or drama or other genres that I will not mention to avoid spoilers.

A brilliantly done detective crime thriller that is still a winner.,"L.A. Confidential is a brilliant detective crime thriller that is solidified by a terrific all star cast, an engaging story, and top notch direction. Director Curtis Hanson has certainly created a winning masterpiece.Based on the neo-noir novel by James Ellroy, L.A. Confidential is set in 1950's Los Angeles and flips the city upside down and exposes the ugly side of Los Angeles with many issues rife such as organised crime, pornography, prostitution, drug trafficking, police corruption, political corruption, and the ugly side of Hollywood. L.A. Confidential centers on three uniquely different but capable police officers. Detective Lieutenant Ed Exley (Guy Pearce) is an intelligent and ambitious police officer however his honesty and rigid adherence to policies and regulations see him as a pariah amongst fellow officers. Officer Bud White (Russell Crowe) is a brutal short-tempered thug who dispenses his own brand of justice against women beaters. Detective Sergeant Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) is a narcotics detective who moonlights as a technical adviser on the popular TV police drama series Badge of Honor based on Dragnet. He is only interested in maintaining his image on the social scene in Hollywood and boosts his own image by providing Sid Hudgens (Danny DeVito), publisher of the infamous Hush-Hush magazine, confidential tips about celebrity arrests that will attract more readers to Hush-Hush in exchange for kickbacks. The three police officers are brought together initially following the Bloody Christmas scandal which saw several Hispanic suspects beaten by a number of drunken police officers. Exley testifies against several officers which results in White suspended from duty and several police officers forced to take early retirement including White's partner Dick Stensland (Graham Beckel). While Captain Dudley Smith (James Cromwell) and District Attorney Ellis Loew (Ron Rifkin) promote Exley following his testimony, White and many fellow officers have taken a disliking to Exley seeing him as a snitch and a coward. The three police officers are later connected to an investigation of The Nite-Owl massacre which saw a number of coffee shop patrons gunned down including Dick Stensland in what appears to have been a robbery gone wrong. Though the investigation seemed to have been cut and dried by linking the murders to a group of young African-Americans discharging shotguns, all is not what it seems when Exley, White and Vincennes conduct their own investigations which uncover corruption all around them as well as a prostitution ring run by Pierce Patchett (David Strathairn) which has prostitutes altered by plastic surgery to resemble film actresses including Veronica Lake lookalike Lynn Bracken (Kim Basinger in an Academy Award winning performance for Best Supporting Actress).Kevin Spacey is faultless as the charismatic Jack Vincennes. Although he received top billing, the spotlight remains focused on Australian actors Guy Pearce and Russell Crowe. Guy Pearce is perfectly cast as the ambitious Ed Exley and Russell Crowe channels his inner angry man as Bud White who although is seen as a brutal thug actually is exposed as someone with a good heart. Kim Basinger has always been a talented and attractive actress and she finally receives the deserved recognition for L.A. Confidential. Danny DeVito rounds out the cast perfectly as Sid Hudgens, the chief publisher of Hush-Hush magazine.Keep an eye out for The Mentalist's Simon Baker (billed as Simon Baker Denny) in a small but pivotal role as actor Matt Reynolds who finds himself in trouble.Director Curtis Hanson and screenwriter Brian Helgeland have done a brilliant job bringing James Ellroy's novel to the big screen. Jerry Goldsmith's magnificent score actually brings us back to 1950's Los Angeles. Art direction is also top notch.Winner of 2 Academy Awards for Best Supporting Actress and Best Adapted Screenplay, L.A. Confidential would have netted more awards including Best Picture and Best Director had the blockbusting crowd favourite Titanic (1997) not been there. But that's the way it is.One of the few movies that gets better with multiple viewings, L.A. Confidential is a brilliantly done detective crime thriller that is still a winner in the eye of many viewers.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Oustanding Work....,"Curtis Lee Hanson's finest film as a filmmaker lies in 'L.A.Confidential'. Based on the 1990 crime fiction novel of the same title by James Ellroy, this film is a gripping tale that catches you right from the word go.A film like 'L.A.

The tension, the misunderstanding... everything is so well placed and executed, that you can't help but Stand Up and Clap when the final credits roll.

She delivers a fantastic performance and looks amazing in every frame she's in. Guy Pearce is excellent. Russell Crowe's role is meant for getting the claps and whistles, he's simply superb. Danny DeVito is effective as the journalist. James Cromwell takes charge in the second hr, he's excellent in the Kevin Spacey death scene. David Strathairn is very good; in fact, this ranks amongst his finest works.on the whole 'L.A. Confidential' is a winner all the way...

Only a few issues.,"I liked the movie in some parts for sure! I liked how angry and aggressive Russell Crowe got in some scenes and how he acted and there were some dramatic murders and interrogation scenes that served the movie well for what it was meant to be. I do feel like they underutilized Kevin Spacey though (who I normally love and who is normally given more opportunity to be quite animated with his performances) and they also had too many crime subplots going on instead of one main thing to focus on. Guy Pearce and Kim Basinger did fine, as well as Danny Devito. In the end it was slightly overrated but I'd watch it again!",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Is that all there is?,"This was just a well-photographed variation on CHINATOWN.  The story was too contrived and needlessly complicated.

His work was the highlight of the whole film.  The low point was Kim Basinger's way over-rated performance.  There was more acting done by the excellent costumes than by Ms. B.

"Off the record, on the QT and unbelievably great","""L.A. Confidential"" is what comes to mind when I think of police corruption movies, especially on the basis of pulling back the curtain of Los Angeles' star-studded image to expose its seamy underbelly. It's a world where the bad guys are vicious and the cops aren't much nicer. I do hear ""overrated"" a lot (these days) when discussing this movie, and obviously, I don't agree; but I think we can all agree that this is one hell of an ensemble cast. Even when I want to single one player out above the rest, another steps up to refute that notion. Every single person is ideal for his/her character. It's a huge part of why this movie is so damn good. That, and its flawless pacing.There are plenty of reasons to love this movie, but maybe (maybe) above all else, is the setting. This period (let's say from '45 to '55) has long been my favorite in Hollywood cinema. It's partially why I take to movies like ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"", ""Chinatown"" and ""Devil in a Blue Dress"". Between this movie's sets, locations, warm color palette, wardrobe and Goldsmith's score, it's a stunning depiction of the time and place. I mean, this is a nice-looking film. ""L.A.

"Slightly flawed, but still a film for the ages.","People have compared this film to Chinatown. That's not quite right. After viewing Chinatown, one couldn't sleep for nights. Evil triumphed, and it did so in an absolutely terrifying way. Here the ""good guys"" won a very ambiguous victory, though at a terrible price.

The wonderful montage sequence ( accompanied by Kay Starr's ""Wheel of Fortune'), and the opening narrated by Devito are superb.Finally, this will be remembered for its acting.

L.A. Confidential,"After the seemingly indiscriminate slaughter of the folks at a diner, it's the ambitious ""Exley"" (Guy Pearce) who suggests to his bosses that it's time for the LAPD to get it's act together and root out the corruption endemic within the force. To that end, he is promoted by ""Capt. Smith"" (James Cornwall) and sets about trying to assert a bit more of the rule of law rather than the rule of vengeance - that'd be the ""White"" (Russell Crowe) method, or the more venal and sleazy fashion of ""Vincennes"" (Kevin Spacey). Needless to say, nobody takes kindly to this new pure as the driven snow approach, but gradually ""Exley"" starts to make a bit of headway into the world of organised crime, and to realise just how involved the police are in covering up crimes from fraud to murder. He's also aware that someone is pulling his strings, so some sort of rapport with one of his suspicions colleagues is going to have to be forged if he is to stay alive! Each of these characters get their moment in the sun and that allows us to meet the unscrupulous red-top publisher ""Hudgens"" (an energetic Danny DeVito) and the sophisticated call-girl ""Lynn"" (Kim Basinger) who is quite often pretending to be Veronica Lake! I think my only problem with this film was that I reckoned on who was doing what really early on, so the jeopardy was a little bit compromised. That said, though, it's one of Crowe's more natural performances and Pearce shows us he can deliver gritty and bruising parts well too. I could have been doing with a little more of Basinger's quite intriguing character, just to break up the relentlessness of the story a bit more, but it's a solid adaptation of James Ellroy's uncompromising book that Curtis Hanson presents and it doesn't hang about.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Awesome Character Piece,"A movie that pretty much launched Russel Crowe and Guy Pearce, L.A. Confidential provides some of the best in character development in films post 1990. A group of Los Angeles police officers in the late 1940s find themselves unraveling and involved with a brutal mass murder. Is it the mob, led by famous LA gangster Mickey Cohen? African American hoodlums, who the police initially target? Or the cops themselves. Every cop character in this movie has a different personality, and a different motive for why he is good, bad, or both. Crowe's performance was nothing short of outstanding, as was Pearce. These were two guys who hated each other and couldn't be more opposite, but both out for doing right. Pearce's character often annoying and nerdish. Crowe, a very likable tough guy. James Cromwell, the smart, straight, but really shady captain, outstanding. Grahem Beckel as Crowe's dirty cop partner, outstanding. Kevin Spacey, a cop torn between his love for being the consultant for a Hollywood TV cop show and making a buck selling stories and following the law in important cases, outstanding. David Stratherin and Danny DeVito, outstanding. The only question. Why did Kim Bassinger win an Academy Award for this movie? There was nothing really outstanding in her performance, and the role wasn't all that important to the film. The writing, outstanding, better than outstanding, as was the direction. There were so many better performances in this film that warranted the award.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"A well-scripted, well-camouflaged whodunnit","It was a classic noir Curtis Hanson directed and was universally hailed for with this film in 1997. And although the story doesn't have anything remarkable about it - it's a classic crime story by all accounts - the film arguably arrived at the right time and hit a nerve with both audiences and critics. The story, by Brian Helgeland from a novel by James Ellroy, captures the zeitgeist of 1950s Los Angeles, which had one foot in vigilante justice and corruption and the other in a more modern procedural legal system. The film's greatest asset is the beautiful rendition of a bygone time and the characters who epitomized it: the sly, but ultimately honest Jack Vincennes, the straightforward brute Bud White, the progressive and modern Edmund Exley, and - not least - Kim Basinger's Lynn Bracken, who in many ways is caught in the crossfire of it all.

An All Around Fantastic Film,"L.A. Confidential excels in every category of the spectrum: plot, acting, directing, dialogue, cinematography, and so on. It's a shame that this movie got screwed out of Best Picture in '97, and in its stead it won an award for a non-stand out performance from Kim Basinger. While I say it's a non-stand out to me, that's not to say it was bad because it was good, but when you're competing against the likes of Guy Pearce, Russell Crowe, Kevin Spacey, and James Cromwell, it's hard to give her that kind of recognition.There was only one problem I really had with the film, but it wasn't against the film at all. I don't know if I was the only one to notice this, but I thought the people behind marketing this movie put too much emphasis on Kevin Spacey. Upon seeing the poster for the film, I was intrigued to see that one of my favorite actors, Kevin Spacey, was the leading man in the film, but he wasn't. It isn't too say that he didn't do a great job, but it's obvious that they listed his name first because he was the biggest name actor at the time. Spacey was fresh off of Se7en, and the Usual Suspects, which he won an Oscar for. His character is more of a major side character in my opinion, or the lowest of the main characters, with three or possibly four other characters filling bigger plot points in the film. This is just me nitpicking, but I thought that it was Ed Exley, Bud White, Captain Smith, and then Vincennes successively. Once again, this is purely nitpicking, but it's also purely speculation.The plot of this film is fairly complex and easily spoiled. First time watching this I was fairly lost, but no need to worry, Ed Exley gives you the full rundown at the end of the film. Without giving much away, the story takes place sometime in the mid 1900s in Los Angeles. It follows the story of the lies, deceit, and corruption within the city and its police department. The movie starts off with introducing us to Ed Exley and Bud White, two promising cops in their own ways; Exley is a by-the-book cop, doing whatever he can to serve justice while White is a brutal, dangerous cop who's willing to do whatever it takes to do what's right. The movie starts off by showing a distinction between two traits that people might think are interchangeable. The audience is meant to hate Exley early on because he decides to testify against other fellow cops when the entire station gangs up on some criminals who killed some other cops. White on the other hand seems to act on what he thinks is right, and tries to stop it at first, but then proceeds to initiate more beatings once a criminal makes a crack at White's mother. White is perceived as a good guy, who fights for just and humane reason, but Exley is perceived as a greedy capitalist who would sell his wife to the devil to get ahead. But as the film progresses, we meet more characters like Vincennes, Smith, and Bracken, and the story about the ""Night Owl Killings"" gets more and more complicated, the two characters seem to change from what they initially are written as, arcing into contradictions of the audiences original perception. The audience is made to sympathize with Exley once we learn about the motives of his decision to become a cop, in turn, making him less of a dick, and more of a guy who just was criminals behind bars. On the other hand, White becomes enraged once he learns a horrible secret (kind of would spoil film), and goes to see his girlfriend and beats her. This contradicts his former character, as someone who personally despises wife-beaters because of his backstory. Exley and White are such dynamic and interesting characters that they could each be the protagonist; however, if I had to pick one, I'd say it would be Exley because more events revolve around him in the movie and he's the one to rise in the climax, without giving anything away. All the other characters act as to support the crazy plot around them and they did a fabulous job.There was nothing I hated in the movie. It had a fascinating story with many intense plot twists that keep you guessing, memorable characters and dialogue, and great performances from these characters. Yeah I didn't say much about the movie itself, but this is one movie you need to see to believe. I highly recommend it, and would recommend multiple viewings to grasp all the plot angles.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

"Reinventing the ""Good Cop - Bad Cop"" Trope ...","You know what all neo-noir masterpieces have in common? They didn't even try to be noir, their power relied on confident directing, perfect writing and solid acting and the whole thing just looked fresh, original and possibly the best thing for a movie: to be watchable and re-watchable. This is ""L.A. Confidential"" in a nutshell, one of the best movies of the 90's.Adapted from a novel by James Ellroy, the plot is the kind of masterpiece of stylish complexity that is just too labyrinthine for the big screen, yet Curtis Hanson compresses everything into a neat episodic structure so that by the end of each act, we've progressed in the comprehension of what is going on and the changes it has on the main protagonists. As a matter of fact, the characterization matters more than the investigation, which is saying a lot because the investigation surrounding a massacre at a seedy night-club (naturally, only the tip of the iceberg), is captivating as hell.But let's get back to the characters, this is the meatiest part of the film. ""L.A. Confidential"" focuses on three cops who couldn't have been more different: Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey), Ed Exley (Guy Pearce) and Bud White (Russell Crowe).Vincennes is a consultant for a ""Dragnet""-like show called ""Badge of Honor"", which makes him a movie star by proxy. What does that mean? Simply that in the early 50's, Hollywood became the new Sodom what's with all the booze, drugs, the criminal wave following the arrest of local mobster Mickey Cohen and of course trashy star-studded tabloids' headlines covered by Hush-Hush magazine editor Sid Hudgens (Danny De Vito). Vincennes embraced the sleaziness of the city without letting its soil his nice suit, he bribes, blackmails and takes ethical shortcuts but never at the expenses of law enforcement. As his Captain smartly advises ""don't try to do the right thing, you haven't had the practice"", sill, Vincent might not be clean but he's the essence of cool, so we forgive him.Exley is the steely ambitious college-boy whose glasses and 'Holier-than-thou' attitude earns him a range of reactions that go from tacit suspicion to sheer contempt; it also earns him his first promotion thanks to a fine tactical move. Exley might not be likable but he's not despicable either because we admire a cop who'd trade popularity for principles. Finally, Bud White strikes as the anti-Exley, this is a guy who hits first and asks the questions later, he doesn't rat on his partners and is known for his particular hatred toward woman-beaters. He happens to be the right-hand man of Captain Dudley Smith (James Cromwell) and occasionally, the right-fist man when some punchy methods are required against criminals. And at the top of the pyramid, Dudley Smith makes good use of White's brutal force and Exley's by-the-book standards. He knows pretty well how to use his boys like so many pieces of a chess game and even dispose of some nuisance when comes a risk to compromise the image of LAPD.So from this gallery of original character, It all comes down to one pivotal moment where our opinions are challenged. Exley stop to be an ambitious opportunist, but a man with a personal record to settle and who knows how to be tough and bad-ass, White shows a warmer side of him notably through his interactions with a hooker named Lynn (Kim Basinger) and Vincennes also has a moment of realization, that can't be spoiled. The film is about three men who become aware of their limitations but move forward, because there's always a line you mustn't cross. Speaking of Basinger, she won her Oscar for her performance as Lynn, a hooker who screams 'femme fatale' but whispers an emotional fragility that channels Faye Dunaway in ""Chinatown"". In fact, she embodies one essential aspect of the film; nothing is exactly what it seems.This notion serves one of the film's many subplots, involving a doctor, played by David Strathairn, turning escort-girls into celebrities' lookalikes. The confusion culminates with an embarrassing but hilarious mistake committed by Excel, one. that shows how cinema, police and crime were easily interlocked, and that the city of angels couldn't do without a few devils here and there. The omnipresence of corruption is persistent in the plot and it's less a matter than realizing who is bad and who is not, but to which extent they are. And you can't get to such multi-layered level complexity without top-notch acting. It is a credit to the late Hanson to have cast the two fresh faces of Pearce and Crowe to star in an American period picture. Speaking of these two actors, one of the many delights of ""L.A. Confidential"" is to see these rivals with diverging methods realizing that they serve the same case and need to cooperate.The screenplay (second Oscar-winning category) is quite self-conscious about the way it retreads the good cop / bad cop cliché, so it uses a scene that reinvents the trope in such an inventive and brutal way, ""L.A. Confidential"" becomes immune to any comparison. When a pompous big shot ends up panting in a fetal positions, you know these guys mean business.Well, that's what ""L.A. Confidential"" in a nutshell, a movie that means business with guys who learn a thing or two in the process. It might get a little conventional during the climactic showdown but to say something that can only be applied to the best noir movies: it's not the destination that counts, but the journey.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Needs better editing,"Why does this movie feel so long? I had to check the run time nearly halfway through and thought to myself ""surely this is not a three hour long film... those were very rare in the 90's"".Although the movie is just over two hours, it feels like the story drags on and on for three or more hours.The movie has a great cast, the storyline is good enough, the acting is on point, and the characters are interesting, but the pacing is slow. Even the action scenes felt slow and drawn out.Not quite sure why there are so many high ratings. There is so much potential, just very much missing the excitement.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"The trappings, but not  the substance of greatness","This film gets a six from me, largely because of the very strong acting by everyone.The story...is a cardboard sham of story, a ""Chinatown"" wannabe, that has unsatisfactory twists and turns, painfully slow beginnings, and ridiculously stereotyped tinging. The heavy hand of ""period feel"" is everywhere, a reek of over-exertion to make it ""sound"" right, ""look"" right. But, it ""isn't"" right.A personal yutz of mine is Dudley Smith's referral in a press conference to ""DMV"". Small point perhaps, but I doubt you can return to that period and find one reference in any publication to DMV as an acronym for Division of Motor Vehicles. In a desire to ""make it feel real"", I think, they all forgot to ""keep it real.""Screenwriter Helgeland credits include Conspiracy Theory, Bloodwork, this film, A Knight's Tale, Payback, The Postman, Mystic River, and Man on Fire. Mostly good, but you can't win them all. But his purposed use of the ""F"" bomb over and over again, is, for me, out of bounds, for there is no added dramatic affect from it, and, while certainly used back in that period, wasn't used like we hear it used. Also, the constant referral to ""whores cut to look like film stars"", followed by the somewhat humorous Lana Turner gag was, for me, a huge nothing. So what? The angle that was interesting is the BLACKMAIL (which connects immediately to the DeVito character), the GANGLAND rubouts, and, of course, the MISSING HEROIN. The plastic surgery angle is a total zero.Bud White's oh, so predictable relationship with the Madam, and the Exley character's pursuit of her was unsupportable and doesn't come off. But, it has to be there, or else the Beefeater Bud White won't see red enough to accept the truth about Exley-Vincennes' findings.Chinatown is one of the best examples of a period film that seems to have got it right. Perhaps because writer Robert Towne's father-in-law was actor John Payne, who acted in Noir Films under the direction of Phil Karlson (Kansas City Confidential, for one). And, then, too, there was world-class director Roman Polanski to steer the course, who was, at that time, on top of his game and not yet a convicted sex-offender.Direction in L.A. Confidential is not obvious, and it could have used some. This film wants strong direction, needed to cut out the fat in this screenplay, which I think was about 20 minutes of unnecessary scenes that add nothing to the plot or suspense of the finale.Six. Not one for the ages, but, again, memorable performances throughout.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

If anything, each turn in the story makes the plot seem more coherent. The incredible amount of action scenes and general mayhem also makes this whole thing move at a breakneck pace, and the violence is just really overwhelming.

"Film Noir Revisited -- And Man, Is It Sweet, Daddy-O","Film noir is a style that's usually difficult to pull off.  Invariably, any movie done in the film noir style features flawed characters that are frequently unlikable; shadowy crosses, double-crosses, and triple-crosses that can make the story difficult to follow; and an unhappy ending that ultimately seems unsatisfying.  ""L.A. Confidential"", which can only be defined as a film noir mystery, meets all of the required criteria above . .. and yet it's still one hell of a compelling, fascinating movie.  ""L.A. Confidential"" takes a lot of difficult material and blends it all together seamlessly.  For that alone, the film should be noteworthy; the fact that the story is outstanding and the acting is exceptional pushes ""L.A. Confidential"" into the realms of the truly great.""L. A. Confidential"" is a gritty, stylish film patterned after the mysteries and crime drama films of the 1940s and 1950s, particularly those of Humphrey Bogart and Alan Ladd. Containing a dizzying number of plots, subplots, and enough red herrings to choke a horse, the storylines and characters are slowly woven together to create one single dark and beautiful film.  It begins with some gruesome killings -- which are dubbed by the press as ""The Nite Owl Murders"" -- and Ed Exley (Guy Pearce), a no-nonsense police detective, is assigned to the case. Ed's reluctant partner is flashy Sergeant Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey), a vain cop who sees himself more as part of the entertainment business than the police force.  After some questionably ethical police work, Vincennes believes that he has wrapped up murders, but Detective Bud White (Russell Crowe) -- a cop usually better known for his fists than for his sleuthing ability -- discovers that there may be more to the ""Nite Owl Murders"" than meets the eye, and may involve some of L.A.'s highest ranking officials.  As the case truly begins to unravel, it becomes obvious that only the unlikely teaming of White, Exley and Vincennes can hope to ever discover the truth about what really happened.Based on the James Ellroy novel of the same name, ""L.A. Confidential"" perfectly captures the look and feel of the sweaty, sleazy underbelly of 1950s Los Angeles.  Mirroring the events of the film, everything on screen has a slightly dirty look to it, as if nothing can be entirely clean or free of guilt.  Even the language used is perfect -- the presence of the character Sid Hudgens (Danny DeVito) really brings to the forefront a distinct Fifties-ish feel to things with his weekly gossip column, where everything is `on the Q-T and strictly hush-hush'.  And the stories themselves are marvelous as well, each starting out from an isolated spot in the film, but eventually winding and coiling together to form one single powerhouse of a plot.  Some of the machinations by which these stories and plot wrap together seem slightly forced; but for the most part, it's pulled off so masterfully that these minor blemishes really don't matter.Director Curtis Hanson does a terrific job of evoking the film noir feel without seeming like he's just mindlessly copying it.  The deliberate pacing of the film, the way certain shots are framed in shadow, the manner in which ominous events are foretold . . . everything helps to add to the story one way or another; there's precious little that seems like a waste of time or takes away from the film.  Equally impressive is just how the film is pieced together - there's a lot of stories and even more information for the audience to digest in `L.A. Confidential'. However, it's all laid out in a sequence that's relatively simple to understand; Hanson also knows where to let the characters tell the story, and where to let the actual visuals of the film tell the story.  `L.A. Confidential' is a film that easily could've been little more than a convoluted mess in other hands; in Curtis Hanson's hands, though, it's a gem of a film.And the acting . . . wow, where to begin?  (With the main characters, I suppose . . .) Kevin Spacey is great as Jack Vincennes, the cynical cop ""on the take"" who does a terrific job of letting the world know how much he doesn't give a damn about anything . . . but when push comes to shove, he reluctantly cares about a lot, perhaps even too much. Not many actors could pull off the part of Vincennes, but Kevin Spacey makes it look easy. Russell Crowe is equally great as detective Bud White, who for much of the movie is little more than a pit bull in human form.  However, Bud proves to be far more dangerous when he actually starts combining his mind with his muscle. Finally, Guy Pearce complements the other main characters in grand style as the arrogant, self-righteous, by-the-book Lieutenant Ed Exley. It's a nice touch in the film that he only starts to become likeable -- and a better cop -- when he starts bending the rules and becoming more unethical in his approach to policework; it's also interesting to notice that as he becomes less and less moral, Vincennes and White start becoming more and more moral. Exley's a little more subtle than the other two main characters, but he's equally as good as they are, and Guy Pearce deserves a lot of credit for his work in this film.Even the minor characters are great; however, the most impressive minor character is James Cromwell as Captain Dudley Smith.  This man is EVIL. Ruthless and cold, Cromwell effortlessly turns in a tour du force performance as a despicable, cold-hearted villain.  I'll admit I was shocked to see him pull off the role so well; I had a mental picture of Mr. Cromwell as the gentle farmer in ""Babe"" before watching ""L.A. Confidential"". . . . wow.  James Cromwell definitely has incredible talent and range.`L.A. Confidential' has a distinct dark side to it; it's certainly not a film for everyone.  It is, however, an undeniably sharp, clever, and stylish film, one that won't easily be forgotten . . . and will probably demand being watched more than once.  One of the best films of 1997.

Very good...but the BEST of 1997?,"Yes, ""Titanic"" may have been a movie about a sappy love story that takes place during a famous event....but it was still a good movie, and worthy enough of being considered the best movie of 1997.  ""L.A. Confidential"" is a thoroughly good movie.  The script is excellent, and the plot takes really interesting (and unexpected) twists.  It's a remarkable and unpredictable murder mystery movie--it reminds me of ""Chinatown"".  I really enjoyed this movie. I'd recommend it to anyone, particularly because of its absorbing story.  I had to see this movie twice to notice some things I had missed the first time around--mainly to notice some plot elements, but also to observe the performances better.Now about the performances...just about all of the performances are very impressive.  Russell Crowe, Guy Pierce, and James Cromwell give powerful performances.  Of course, Kevin Spacey also gives a great performance (as he usually does, in just about every movie he's in).  All four of those performances were award-worthy.  I don't understand why Kim Basinger won several awards for her performance in this movie.  There was nothing award-worthy about her performance.  So she plays a prostitute--a ""hooker with a heart of gold"".  Gee, as if we've never seen that before.  As much as I like seeing Kim Basinger act in movies (and she did look even more beautiful as a Veronica Lake look-alike), there was nothing spectacular about her performance in this movie.

LA Confidential puts Titanic to shame.,"Without a doubt,the best movie of 1997.  Why this did not receive more Oscar consideration is beyond me.  Russell Crowe definitely should have been nominated for Best Actor.  He portrays the sense of having bottled rage that can explode at any minute better than any other actor I have seen on the screen.  Kevin Spacey gave another monumental performance yet received no Oscar nomination.  I guess having back to back to back great performances will do that to you.  You cannot find a better trio to play these three cops.  White(Crowe) is the veteran cop who loves to use violence to get the job done.  Exley(Pearce) is the straight as an arrow rookie who prefers to use his smarts and mind games in place of violence.  He is kniving and has no reservations to stab you in the back to ahead.  These two characters are perfect because they are complete opposites of each other. Vincennes(Spacey) is a medium of the two.  He used to be like White but is what Exley is striving to become.  His transformation throughout the film to amend his wrong actions give his character in this film the most credibility.  The one thing I did not agree with was Kim Basinger's win of Best Supporting Actress.  She seemed quite dull and did not give half the performance as Crowe or Spacey.

"Intelligent, well crafted thriller","It is funny how ignored this movie is today. Most of the time it just isn't mentioned. But I feel it is one of the best movies in the film noir genre(not that I am an expert in this genre!). It is not just a thriller. It is in fact a movie which portrays the 1950's effectively in such a way that we are transported to that 1950's era of race relations, gender relations and the general corruption in society. It is a battle of personalities and attitudes.The story is quite complex and it took me some time to figure it all out. Murders at the Nite Owl, a bar in Los Angeles, are the focus of the story. There are many disparate events that happen in the movie which are somehow connected. They are joined together at the end in an effective manner which doesn't defy logic. That is quite rare in movies today. It moves like a classic whodunit(one of my favourite genres) and is generally the kind of movie I like. The character development is of high priority here and the characters are neatly fleshed out before the actual story begins. Each scene is important here and each little point is important to the resolution of the mystery. I think repeated viewings might bring out some more details that I missed the first time. The story also involves a prostitute who falls in love with one of the characters. She has a very important role in this movie.The main characters are three detectives named Ed Exley(Guy Pearce), Bud White(Russell Crowe) and Jack Vincennes(Kevin Spacey). Their conflicting ideals and attitude to life are perfectly portrayed. My favourite character in this movie is Ed Exley with his pacifist and intelligent attitude to police work. My favourite line in the movie ""Is that how you ran the good cop bad cop"" after an intense scene has now become one of my favourite lines. His steadfast devotion to his ideals and standing up to the ""system"" was pleasing to watch. I personally believe that this performance was better than his Memento performance because of the complexity and likability of his character. Russell Crowe as Bud White gives a sterling performance as the tough cop who is not amused with Exley's approach to law enforcement. It may be a clichéd performance as the tough guy with a softer side but he does a good job. Kevin Spacey, as usual, is great in this role as the cop, Jack Vincennes, who loves publicity and glamour. He is more complex than he initially appears in this movie. Kim Basinger as the prostitute named Lynn Bracken also has a good part where she looks sexy as ever(hard to believe she is 40 in this). She gives a worthy performance and she is one of the pivotal characters in this movie.The best thing about the movie is the dialogue. It has a clever style reminiscent of 1940's film noir classics. The movie has a relaxed style throughout with flashes of violence which erupt suddenly. Some of the scenes can stun you as they suddenly come out of nowhere. The relaxed style is what makes the violent scenes seem even more violent. The newer filmmakers must learn from this in the new era where they try to shock people with more violence upon violence. The music is another factor that gives it a 1950's feel. The viewer sometimes may feel helpless at the racism and the police officers attitude towards Exley(at least I did). It is not just a cold lifeless murder mystery but instead it is a vibrant look at the dark seedy underbelly of Los Angeles and the helplessness of a man who holds tightly to his ideals. The scene where he tries to hold back the other officers in the police station brawl is a great example.Overall, highly recommended to people who like detective stories and people who like film noir. But even others who just love good stories with complex characters should enjoy this movie.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
A solid modern noir,"L. A. Confidential is a solid, entertaining neo-noir that manages to be engaging and gripping for its entire runtime. The core of Spacey, Crowe and Pearce work together with three distinct personalities, each of them offering something unique and interesting. I didn't really enjoy the last third when it becomes action-heavy and mindless (to a degree), but until then I was fully on board with the direction it took.I'm not sure if this film deserves a classic status, but I'd recommend it to all noir lovers like myself who would be in need of a reliable fix. You'd wish there were more films like this one: A modern noir that's not a lazy reproduction of the genre's classics.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Neo-noir masterpiece,"L.A Confidential is an excellent neo-noir detective film. Set in the 50's heyday of the original noirs, it is able to recall the past while updating it for the 90's. The fantastic production design oozes period detail perfectly and captures both the Hollywood glamour but also the dark underbelly of L.A. The look and feel is one of its chief pleasures, creating an atmosphere and mood all of its own. The story is a typically convoluted murder mystery with the influence of the hard-boiled detective novels that inspired the original film-noirs. It's a very well controlled narrative which keeps the mystery enticing while introducing the characters brilliantly. They are a typical array of types you would expect to see in such films, such as the femme fatale and the cynical cop. But the beauty of the film is that it gives us the ingredients we are used to and want but fleshes them out in ways that makes it all feel very fresh.The performances by the key players are hugely instrumental here. Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce and Kevin Spacey are the three very different policemen involved in the case and all give exemplary work. While Kim Basinger and James Cromwell impress in important support roles. It's a real ensemble film. And with a very written script you have the final piece in the jigsaw, making this a film that works as a mystery and dramatically; a film that mixes the glamour with the darkness. In this sense it resembles a 90's Chinatown (1974) and you don't get much better than that.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"This is the City of Angels, and you don't have your wings!","LA Confidential is a modern- noir crime film set in- you guessed it- LA. In true noir fashion, the film consists of detectives, women, violence, drugs, and a weaving plot tying them all together. 'Confidential' is a well-made and well executed film.Despite what the posters, half-covered by Kim Basinger, would make you think, LA Confidential is a film about men. 3 men, three personalities. Kevin Spacey is Jack, the pretty boy cop who works with a tabloid newspaper for information exchange. Russell Crowe is Bud White, the bad cop who sees justice through, and is no stranger to violence. And Guy Pearce is Ed Exley, the golden boy on the straight and narrow, who only wants the truth... and recognition. These three are the show, and all are more deserving of an Oscar than Basinger. Especially Crowe.The setting and atmosphere works for LA Confidential. However the city is never really exposed, we're only given a name as a backdrop. Other than a short scene about a freeway and an image if an LA landmark tower, Confidential could take place in any city.The plot, in true noir fashion, makes little sense. It's excellent, but you won't understand what happens. With multiple perspectives, the information you learn will go over your head. Watch it again, and things will fall into place. The complexity and twist in LA Confidential is one of it's biggest strengths.A beacon of noir in modern cinema, LA Condiential is a very well directed and well thought film. Its depth is impressive, its performances stellar, and ending fitting. You should see this if you like noir, history, or great American crime/drama movies. 8.4/10",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Typical Hollywood,"I think this movie deserves at least one negative comment. This movie is so much Hollywood, it follows the template just fine. It's predictable; during the action scenes it's easy to tell who's going to survive, who's going to get a scratch, and who's going to fall. I have seen it before and it seems like I have to see it again. The script and acting during the first hour is not realistic, but standard Hollywood; so common everybody else finds it natural. I didn't find convincing, though I liked some scenes, I wasn't hooked all through. A mere 5/10.",4.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Entertaining mystery film,"L.A. Confidential (1997) is a crime drama/mystery film that has gone down in cinema history as one of the best films ever made. It is a great film, that's for damn sure. They did so many things right with it, from the acting to the clever dialogue.The acting and the cast is probably my favorite thing about this film. Russell Crowe, one of my favorite actors, gives a fine performance here as Sgt. White. His character has depth and is interesting, thanks to the writing and Crowe's skills with acting. Guy Pearce is great here, playing a hated cop, who has just been promoted to lieutenant. I loved how he played his character and the dynamic between him and the other characters. Kim Basinger gives what is probably her best performance. This was Academy Award win for best supporting actress, a win that she so deserved. I can feel her raw emotion in every single moment of her beautiful performance.The writing is great too, I was intrigued by the dialogue, especially when it involved Basinger's character. Very smart and quick, kept things interesting. I hate a film with poorly written dialogue, it's sloppy and you wills surely lose the audiences attention. Thank god this writer knew what he was doing.

Come Back Hoppy Seems We Still Need You....,"I'm treading on thin ice here as this movie is a ""Crowd Pleaser"" so most viewers tend to like it. It has all the elements of a commercial hit; Stylish direction and photography, smart story, slick screenplay adaptation, savvy performances, big budget production details, sex, brutality + violence with coarse language laid on - what more could you want?... Well, dare I ask for a little more credibility?. This script is perhaps at times a bit too smart for its own good.Ex Golf Caddie and original story writer James Ellroy often refers to himself as 'the best crime writer of all time' (that's a high calling for a writer to hang on himself!). Ellroy's a heavy drinker, Benzedrex abuser and gun lobbyist (he owns over 30 firearms!) so, his characters use guns more often than not. His writings also owe more than a passing nod to Dashiell Hammett, Raymond Chandler and Jack Webb. The screenplay adaption by writer Brian Helgland and director Curtis Hanson hones several layers off Ellroy's original but remains highly complex (Ellroy had mixed feelings about the end result). Tough cop Bud White (an outright thug) played by Crowe - retains some of Ellroy's own personal life characteristics (mother raped and murdered in his youth) so he has a vicious agenda all his own - but when it suits he's a 'nice' guy at heart - well, sometimes...Director Hanson seems to enjoy violence so lays it on thick - that's OK if it's believable - but, here our 'hero's' (etall) are subjected to brutal bashings of the type that you just don't get up and walk away from (let alone able to speak all that well for a day or two) but somehow they manage to front up next day with a little face rouge and not even a slight limp. Some even take several direct point-blank gunshot hits to the body only to re-appear with a few bandages. Ahh Hollywood at it's best. If discretion of speech is more than eloquence - then the on screen language is about as bad as it gets. Most of the above won't bother too many modern movie fans who've become so desensitized not many will make overly intelligent observations of these over-the-top details. The complexities of the story had the potential to be equally as interesting with half the heavy handedness and could've perhaps appealed to a larger cross section of the public.Friends told me they saw this as an 'in-flight' movie back when airlines used to screen special (softer) versions of films - they enjoyed it - but were disappointed when they went to the Cinema for a second look. It's interesting that this movie had enough going for it without all the ultra 'realism'.Italian born Director of photography Dante Spinotti manages to capture all the action without getting in the way of the story. Award winning composer Gerry Golsmith's sultry music score seems to owe quite a bit to Leonard Bernstein's main title for ""On The Waterfront"" - coincidence or design?. As for Kim Basinger's Academy Award winning performance, well...Action and blood 'n gore crime fans will love it - most general viewers may also but, perhaps with more than a little compromise.Not 'fully' sure why the addition of a clip featuring the man in black (William 'Hopalong' Boyd) on his white horse has been inserted into the end credits - symbolic or just a reference to the era...?",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Extremely boring,"I'm sorry to say this, but this movie lost me after 10-20 minutes, and it never caught my attention again. I see alot of ppl like this movie, but I found it really boring. For me it didn't have anything. It didn't have good action scenes, interesting story, and besides I don't like the 1950-style. If it only had some underlying symbolism or something like that... I think that symbolism in a movie should strike u clearly; u shall feel there is something more. But no, it didn't have a striking symbolism either. Just a straight forward story about some dirty cops catching some very dirty cops (all the cops in this movie I would say was dirty).The only reason I watched the whole movie, and didn't stop watching after 10-20 minutes, was that a pal of mine told me that it was not a movie with ""brainless action"" that one should stop watching after merely 20 minutes just because I didn't like it. So i had a real boring time forcing me to watch it almost to the end. I skipped the last 10 minutes; it was not like anything supprising would happen that made up for the past 2 hours of bordome.I would give this movie 1.5 on a scale from 0 to 10.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Still thrilling cinema 18 years on,"Curtis Hanson's L.A. Confidential is a now long-established movie classic, regularly featuring in the various Top 100 lists drummed up by magazines and websites. But despite the impeccable performances from the film's three leads and writers Hanson and Brian Hengeland's firm grip on the labyrinthine plot, something about the film has never quite sat right with me. Don't get me wrong, I still think this is fantastic cinema and I've adored the few James Ellroy novels I've read (L.A. Confidential is adapted from the third book of his 'L.A. Quartet'), but some corny dialogue and flat cinematography weigh down what is ultimately an absorbing character piece.There are a million stories in the city and it is the job of Sid Hudgens (Danny DeVito), the editor of trashy magazine Hush-Hush, to find them. Celebrity cop Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) works on the side as 'technical adviser' for cop show Badge of Honor and is paid by Hudgens to bust celebrities in all sorts of compromising situations. It's Christmas, and Bud White (Russell Crowe) is buying liquor for the station when he stops by a house and beats on a man for doing the same to his wife. At the station, ambitious young cop Ed Exley (Guy Pearce) is determined to live up to his father's reputation and refuses to be drawn in to the various exploits of his corrupt colleagues. When a group of Mexicans are brought in for assaulting two officers, the drunken officers assault them and the story hits the newspapers.It's difficult to summarise the plot as the film is always moving forward, putting many pieces into play to the point where you struggle to figure out how it will all link together. The main crux of the film lies with a massacre at a diner called the Nite Owl, where many are killed along with White's ex-partner Dick Stensland (Graham Beckel) and a girl White met at Christmas. She looked beaten up, but Lynn Bracken (Kim Basinger) assured him it wasn't what he thought. Also, with her at Christmas was Pierce Patchett (David Strathairn), a millionaire who runs an agency of hookers made to look like movie stars by plastic surgery. After the incident with the Mexicans, Exley becomes despised by his colleagues for testifying against those involved, particularly angering White after Stensland was shown the door, and forcing Vincennes to testify by threatening his work on Badge of Honor.Acting out almost like vignettes, the various pieces of the puzzle stay apart for the majority of the film, and it's difficult to figure out what the plot actually is. But the way all these elements ingeniously blend together at the end is the film's main strength. Somehow, Hanson also manages to retain his grasp on the film's trio of complex leads, who are all heavily conflicted and psychologically scarred in some manner. Even Exley, who is a determined straight- arrow, concludes that circumstances often call for one's dark side to be embraced. It's a film noir more invested in the driving force at the core of its central characters than any crime committed, and a crime story more focused on the politicking of the higher-ups and the corruption that comes with it. Despite the occasional wobble, L.A. Confidential is still thrilling cinema 18 years on.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"""L.A. Confidential"" introduces us to a wonderful dirty, complex and tense world populated by complex characters in divergent stories that converge effortlessly","Written by Hanson himself alongside Brian Helgeland and based on a book by James Ellroy, ""L. A. Confidential"" takes place in the 1950s and follows the daily life of the police after the arrest of the head of local organized crime. On a night known as ""Bloody Christmas"", several police officers attack some Mexican prisoners and end up caught by the press, generating an investigation that leads police officer Ed Exley (Guy Pearce) to be promoted, precisely for ratting out his fellow professionals. Thus, police officer Bud White (Russell Crowe) and detective Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) end up away from their duties, but they will all have their paths crossed in an investigation that will involve high-ranking police - among them, Captain Dudley (James Cromwell) - and important people linked to a prostitution ring in which the women look like movie stars - among them the beautiful Lynn (Kim Basinger).Emerging as a true modern noir in its first minutes, ""L. A. Confidential"" brings practically all the main characteristics of the genre. Thus, we have the crime moving the narrative, the predominantly nocturnal scenes, the ambiguous characters and the fatal blonde. And even though Dante Spinotti's photography has warm colors and daytime scenes, especially in its second act, this color palette is always desaturated, creating a look that not only pays homage to the genre but also refers to the era in which the narrative takes place with precision. This sensation is also reinforced by the great production design by Jeannine Oppewall, who recreates Los Angeles in the 50s with precision through the cars that circulate through the streets, the decoration of the environments and the weapons used by the police, in addition, of course, to the excellent soundtrack. By Jerry Goldsmith, full of Jazz and typical California music, but also with dark instrumental compositions that punctuate certain scenes well, like when Ed arrives at the Nite Owl and walks through the place after the massacre - and here it is worth noting how Hanson's subjective camera it builds up the suspense considerably.But the fact is that a large part of the narrative takes place predominantly at night, which allows the director to create a dark look that directly refers to the dark universe of those characters. Usually dressed in sober suits (Ruth Myers costumes), the police officers try to maintain a good image before the population, but, as in all good noir, not everything in ""L. A. Confidential"" is exactly what it seems to be. The merit, in this case, is also the excellent script that works perfectly both in its structure and in the development of the characters, which become even more interesting thanks to the good overall performance of the cast.Catching the viewer's attention from its efficient introduction, the film reveals its narrative efficiency in the very next scene, when we are quickly introduced to the characters Bud, Jack and Ed and, clearly, we know some of their main characteristics. Obviously, the fluidity of the narrative is also due to Peter Honess's agile editing, which gives an exciting pace to that intriguing and unpredictable investigation. However, this agility does not prevent Hanson from being careful to create a little suspense in Lynn's presentation, taking a few seconds to reveal the excellent makeup that transforms Kim Basinger into a Veronica Lake look-alike. Prostitutes who look like famous Hollywood actresses, by the way, guarantee one of the rare moments of comic relief through the excellent joke involving Lara Turner (Brenda Bakke). In the same way, Hanson works very well with some themes addressed by the feature, relying on the ambiguity of the characters and their attitudes to raise interesting questions. Note, for example, how police corruption becomes a much denser and more complex problem when we observe that police officers can act in similar ways in different situations and induce us to agree or disagree with their actions. If in an instant police officer plants evidence to justify the arrest of someone who is notoriously guilty, this sense of justice completely loses its meaning when we see other police officers using the same ruse for their own benefit. However, the bureaucracy of justice can lead to a feeling of impunity and lead us to the error of thinking that some attitudes are justifiable and others are not. Ultimately, the question is: Is it possible to always be right?At first, Ed Exley seems to think so. Guided by a sense of justice that even leads him to go over the feeling of camaraderie so valued among police officers, Guy Pearce composes Ed as a character determined to clean up the mess of the police department, which leads him to rise in his career in the same proportion that he gains enemies within the work environment. The reasons for this behavior are still based on his childhood, but Ed is forced to re-evaluate concepts as the narrative progresses - and a close-up of his face after he finally shoots some criminals indicates the moment when he starts to change of behavior. Already calloused and far from the feeling that led him to become a police officer, the cynical Jack Vincennes takes advantage of the situation to gain projection, but slowly he also presents his other side, in a transition that the great Kevin Spacey demonstrates very well when, regretful, he leaves the 50 dollars he received in a bar and tries to prevent a young actor from going out with a local promoter, but arrives too late and finds the boy already murdered - the expression of disappointment on his face is striking at this point.Traumatized by his mother's violent death, Russell Crowe's Bud is the tough cop who solves everything at the base of the blow, but like the other characters, he also doesn't boil down to this superficial assessment, showing discontent in the face of this situation and an enormous will. To prove that you are also smart. Exploring his physical stature without forgetting his dramatic talent, Russell Crowe draws attention to the way he balances his performance between explosive reactions and sensitive moments such as when, embarrassed, he avoids Ed's gaze after a police officer informs him that someone had beaten Lynn. Interestingly, it is precisely he who lives the most sensitive relationship in ""Los Angeles"", showing interest in the beautiful Lynn from the first moment, which does not prevent him from acting irrationally when he discovers that she had slept with Ed. Lynn and Bud become confidants, and the empathy between Crowe and Basinger is essential in this process. Closing the highlights of the cast, James Cromwell lives the intelligent and experienced Captain Dudley, a profound connoisseur of the environment in which he is inserted who reveals his other facet in the surprising and impactful death of Jack, while the voice of Danny DeVito falls very well on the reporter Sid Hudgens, who also functions as a kind of narrator who, as he belongs to the diegetic environment, appears organically and avoids the common artificiality of this type of narrative artifice.The screenplay by Hanson and Brian Helgeland is extremely well crafted. The atmosphere of tension grows little by little, as we get to know the protagonists of the story and come to understand the motivations behind the actions of each one of them. This isn't one of those shallow ""good cop and bad cop"" movies. No, here everyone is good and bad. And it's precisely the fact that they all look so ""human"" that makes the viewer really care about the fate of each one of them. The electrifying twists and turns of ""Los Angeles"" are very organic, starting with the tense interrogation sequence of suspects Sugar Ray (Jeremiah Birkett), Ty Jones (Karreem Washington) and Louis (Salim Grant), in which we follow Bud slowly losing control through of his hands pressing down on a chair until he finally explodes and forcibly wrests the information from his subjects. As the narrative progresses, the mysteries of the cohesive script are resolved and the hidden layers of the characters are revealed, leading to seemingly unlikely partnerships between Ed and Jack and, later, between Ed and Bud. But it is really the brilliant insight involving ""Rollo Tomasi"" that confirms the excellent work of Hanson and Helgeland, informing a lot in an economical way and also explaining the origin of Ed's obstinacy for justice. Watch carefully the conduct of the scene and notice that only Ed and Jack are in the room when he tells the story of his father's death. Thus, when Dudley asks Ed to investigate who ""Rollo Tomasi"" is, both the character and the spectator suffer the impact of the revelation (in a script device known as a clue and reward that works very well here), since these were exactly the last words of Jack Vincennes. Great.Plunged into the shadows, the climax at Victory Motel is sensational, not only because it confronts the characters with their innermost demons but also because it gives the viewer a breathtaking shootout, in which we can also note the exceptional sound design that allows us to hear every step, shot and sudden movement with clarity. After being considered the hero of the night, Ed claims to be aware of his situation (""They use me and I use them""), in a perfect and coherent conclusion with the character. Knowing how to behave in that environment is essential for their survival. Without the same wit (or the same stomach), Bud prefers to take another path. In Lynn's words: ""Some men are born to conquer the world, others to run off to Arizona with a wh**re.""And it is in this complexity of the characters that lies the greatest asset of ""L. A. Confidential"", an exceptional masterpiece that only proves how no genre will go out of fashion as long as there are people competent and intelligent enough to explore it. It is a cinematic gem that defies its 90s temporality and introduces us to a wonderful dirty, complex and tense world.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Best picture of 1997,"Russell Crowe, Kevin Spacey, Guy Pearce and James Cromwell turn in excellent performances as warped-out cops in LA-LA land, 1950's style. Each of these actors deserved an Oscar for his performance. At least the academy gave an Oscar to Kim Basinger for best supporting actress for her superb performance as a high-priced Hollywood hooker.There are a lot of great reviews on this movie, so I'm not going to rehash the story. Suffice it to say that the story is well crafted and all of the characters are completely believable.There is a lot of violence in this movie, on-screen and off, but none of it is gratuitous.IMHO Kim Basinger's beauty was pretty much ""past peak"" by the time this movie was made. Even so, she is deliciously gorgeous in the flick, and perfect for the part. There isn't any actual sex in this movie. Most pervs would agree that there could have been more soft-core action, but I for one believe it would've taken away from the super-fast action of the movie.Russell Crowe's Bud White grabs EVERY scene by the cojones.Guy Pearce's Edmund Exley is like that guy you used to give a wedgie to during recess every day back in junior high. The next day he'd come back for more, feisty as ever, like a darned banty rooster. Eventually, once you got to know him, you decided he wasn't such a bad guy after all, and maybe you were wrong to pull the elastic from his underwear clean over his head.Kevin Spacey's Jack Vincennes scene with the Captain is unforgettable. Vincennes' mention of ""Rollo Tomasi"" is reminiscent of his ""Keyser Soze"" from the ""The Usual Suspects.""James Cromwell plays LA Police Captain Dudly Smith in such convincing fashion that he had to play Farmer Hoggett in ""Babe, Pig in the City"" in order to avoid being permanently typecast in the role. Still, while watching ""Babe, Pig in the City,"" I kept thinking there was going to be a plot twist, and Farmer Hoggett was going to set Babe up or something worse.It's almost ten years now and I still enjoy watching LA Confidential at least once per year.

Spectacular Cop Drama That Rivals CHINATOWN...,"This stylish, action-filled cop story is maze-like in plot and looks absolutely incredible. Not only is there an Oscar winning performance by Kim Basinger, but a discovery of 2 fine Australian actors, Russell Crowe and Guy Pearce. They seem as American as apple pie on-screen, bringing to life the main protagonists of James Ellroy's novel. The hard-boiled script by director Curtis Hanson and Brian Helgeland brilliantly follows through with the evolution of these seemingly one dimensional characters, both on opposite sides of a police officer's moral code, who find they have a lot more in common than first glimpsed. Sure, its a recollection of film-noir, but it is without a doubt a 90's film. The 1950's are relived with great nostalgia and period set-ups, however, it is not the showcase of the film. Its plot and acting are what is so great.Kevin Spacey headlines the troupe, playing slick Detective Jack Vincennes, a consultant to ""Badge of Honor"", a fictional TV show based on Dragnet I guess. There are many nuances to real-life people and events, not the least being Lana Turner in a hilarious scene, or Johnny Stompanato, her mob bodyguard boyfriend who was later shot to death by Turner's own daughter (not in the movie). Spacey is the cop who ""busted Mitchum"" which he takes great pride in. Crowe is such a presence as the brutish enforcer who has a soft spot for abused women for a very good reason. This is where Basinger, a Veronica Lake look-alike (and noir film fixture), is able to come across as a hooker with a mind and ambition beyond what she does. It's a good performance, maybe not Oscar-worthy, but noteworthy, nonetheless. Pearce plays the stodgy, son of a cop lieutenant, who along with Crowe, realizes there is more at stake here than a simple murder/robbery.To get into any more plot aspects or characterizations would be ridiculous. Just view the film and see how unique and important it is. This is not your usual police squad period portrait. Most importantly is L.A. CONFIDENTIAL's ending, which consists of a shootout, something that would usually turn movie buffs away. 9 out of 10 cop dramas end this way uneffectively. Here, we see a revelation. A shootout that holds you in a trance and surprises with each blow. It is to climactic shootouts what FRENCH CONNECTION was to car chases. As far as comparison to CHINATOWN, there really is none. This is not to say they do not belong in the same league. They even have the same Musical composer, Jerry Goldsmith, who again utilizes the trumpet to resonate corruption and deception. These are 2 distinctly different visions of Los Angeles cop warfare. CHINATOWN was more of a character study and had more to say on some pretty deep issues. It took place pre-WWII and was a direct homage to the dark noir pix of the 40's and 50's. L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, while deep in substance in its own right, is more action oriented and simpler. Both will always stand as a testament to old-style police melodrama.NOTE: Like CHINATOWN, see it in its 2.35:1 aspect ration, the widest of Widescreen images.RATING: 10 of 10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
A beautiful love letter to classic crime cinema,"Director Curtis Hanson, according to Arnon Milchan in the L.A. Confidential DVD supplement, was the perfect choice to adapt (along with Brian Helgeland) James Ellroy's novel.  It certainly shows.  Favoring rich characterizations over strict plotting, the movie retains many of the novel's key set pieces and enough twists and turns to keep even hard-boiled audiences happy. Pearce, Crowe, Spacey, and Basinger all shine in roles seemingly tailor-made for them -- another credit to Hanson's canny sensibility about the material. Period detail is delicious, with stunning set design, costumes and wonderful tunes by the likes of Johnny Mercer, Chet Baker, and Dean Martin. Some critics complained that the film was ""overlong,"" but repeated viewings reveal the opposite -- a tightly crafted picture among the best of its kind.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Boulevard of Broken Dreams,"I knew I liked ""L. A. Confidential"" but it has been a while since I last saw it and it wasn't until this recent viewing that I realised quite what an outstanding film it is and that, despite two Oscar wins, it's still not as appreciated as it should be.Son of a famous officer, Edmond Exley (Guy Pierce) makes his own reputation in the LAPD with arrest and interrogation of three men for a mass shooting at the NiteOwl Café, the victims of which included a former officer Dick Stensland (Graham Beckel). Stensland former partner Bud White (Russell Crowe) has violent tendencies, utilised by Captain Dudley Smith (James Cromwell) to stop the mob from moving to the city, but is underestimated for his instincts. 'Hollywood' Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) keeps a high profile as technical advisor on 'Badge of Honor' and orchestrating drug busts with Sid Hudgens (Danny Devito), editor of the salacious 'Hush Hush' magazine.What a cast the film has, aside from those mentioned above Kim Basinger would win the best supporting actress Oscar for her pivotal role in the film. You've got David Strathairn and Ron Rifkin in key characters and a young Simon Baker in the cast too. Performances are great, even if occasionally both Spacey and Cromwell add a bit of inconsistent Irish to their performances.The cast is not the films real strength though, it's the writing. Without ever losing the focus on its characters it tells it's noiry story perfectly, setting the scene with Sid Hudgens' lurid voice over open and then revolving around these three cops and their shifting morals. It's quite the complicated story, but it manages, without resorting to too many flashbacks to successfully get the various plot strands across.I knew it was good, but I didn't appreciate until this viewing just how good it truly is, a proper, world class, top ten film that still doesn't get the viewing that it deserves.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"It's hip, It's cool... it's also totally boring","LA Confidential is a good satire on the Glamorous Hollywood/California image, if that's what it's meant to be. But although I liked some old film noir, nothing in this movie appealed to me except making fun of what is seemed so ""glamorous"" about these places in California. Especially at the end, it goes from bearable to horrible. It turns into one of those movies where everyone dies instantly from one gunshot except the main characters who get shot multiple times and take forever to die, if they do at all. Suddenly someone has to satirize the satire.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Starts slow but really picks up,"Any film rated higher than a 8 out of 10 on this site I am skeptical, not sure why, but I always have that thing that makes me think it's overrated. Luckily, I can confirm that this film is not overrated and it fantastic.So the positives. Why is this a great movie?
1: characters and acting. The main characters that you see are so much more than just officers. They all have such unique qualities and it's acted so well by everyone.
2: the plot. About an hour in I wasn't massively feeling it. I had no real idea about where the plot was heading, I felt intrigued about what's going on, but I had no idea beyond that. But it seriously picks up and you start admiring the characters and you start understanding what's going on and where the direction is heading and it's a brilliantly made story.
3: just the overall enjoyment factor. It's just a fun film to watch, I was entertained and hugely intrigued throughout and also really enjoyed the ending, which was done well with no loose ends.I fully recommend watching this if you haven't already.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
L.A. Confidential (1997),"People seem to feel the need to compare this remarkable film with the film noir genre as well as with the time honored classic Chinatown. Although they are not wrong in their comparisons, LA Confidential should be taken as a great film in its own right. A movie like this has a plot so well woven, with acting to support, and a cast that will blow you away, that it can't help but stand out. Everything from the great acting to the fantastic direction to the remarkable screenplay (which contains some truly great lines... ""Go back to Jersey...""), is so perfectly executed that I find it amazing how studios consistently release such mediocre junk these days when they could elect to finance films like this. Gritty homage to film noir about three detectives, Spacey, a big hotshot T.V. police adviser, Crowe, a defender of women against abusers and Pearce, an ambitious yet naive detective are involved in a complex case of sex, scandal, and murder. Strange, fascinating mystery in the best Hammett/Chandler tradition is vivid and atmospheric, all thanks to the superb cast including Bassinger, who richly won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar as the Veronica Lake-ish fem me fatale who's surrounded by her Oscar-worthy costars including Cromwell as the police captain who's more important than you think. Directed by Hanson, who with Brian Helgeland won a well deserving Best Adapted Screeplay Oscar. A modern masterpiece of film-making based on James Ellroy's novel. The movie plays out like a series of events that seem to be separate but is eerily connected, and a plot like that holds the most commendment I can award a film with. This movie totally kicks Titanic's butt! This should have won best picture (just my personal view). It had an excellent story, acting, and set design. All in all it has something for everybody, action, romance, comedy, suspense, mystery, crime, drama and anything you name it.My Rating 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"Off the record, on the QT and very ""hush hush"".","When I got the attention of L. A. Confidential, I immediately realise that it's directed by Curtis Hanson, the same guy who directed The Hand That Rocks the Cradle. It had some big stars in this like Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, Kim Basinger and Danny DeVito. It had a good story about three police officers and detectives investigating the ""Nite Owl case"" and other stuff. Kevin Spacey is Det. Sgt. Jack Vincennes who moonlights as a technical advisor on Badge of Honor, a popular TV police drama series. He is also providing Sid Hudgens, publisher of the Hush-Hush tabloid magazine. Russell Crowe is Officer Wendell ""Bud"" White who is in love with Lynn Bracken and he investigates the Nite Owl case where his partner is killed. Guy Pearce is Det. Lt. Edmund ""Ed"" Exley who is investigating the Nite Owl case. His father is murdered by a man who Exley nicknames ""Rollo Tomasi"". I kinda like the part where the police and criminals are fighting at ""Bloody Christmas"". The story is great and well written and it is faithful to the novel which is based on by James Ellroy. Kim Basinger is really good as Lynn Bracken, the directing style is immense when something goes wrong and the police are on the crime investigation and the cinematography is great. I know I say that quite a lot but what can I say? They immense. As much I loved it for it's story, directing, editing, art design and cinematography and everything about this. L. A. Confidential is a impeccable neo-noir crime film filled with characters, mystery and beautifully crafted set pieces. If you guys haven't seen it then I would definitely recommend you watch it.

Probably the best crime drama film noir since Chinatown.,"Probably the best crime drama film noir since Chinatown.  Chock-a-block full of marquee talent, the story that starts off slow and escalates in a frightening spiral.Set in the early 1950's, a supposed golden age of American history.  World War II was a memory, and the Korean War was behind us.  There was nothing on the horizon but prosperity and peace.  Los Angeles sat on the verge of becoming the city it was destined to be, and is no more, and everything was right with the world.If it were only true.  A corrupt police force is almost indistinguishable from the organized criminals they oppose.  To make it even more apropos, one of L.A.'s finest is an advisor to a Dragnetish show and has quite a side business selling news scoops to a loathsome gossip columnist delightfully played by Danny DeVito.Kevin Spacey is the most consistent actor in the business, and his performance doesn't disappoint.  James Cromwell and David Strathairn are similarly sharp.  But the real gems are Guy Pearce, trying desperately to shed his Priscilla, Queen of the Desert past as the oh so anal Lt. Exley, and Russell Crowe, whose star potential was just being recognized by American audiences.  His brooding Bud White is the stuff of cinema legends, which Crowe will surely become.Then there is Kim Basinger, who won a well-deserved Oscar.  She plays a hooker with astonishing elegance and grace, hallmarks of all Basinger's roles.  The stars don't produce as much chemistry between as around one another.  They seem to smolder with private fires that burn slightly out of reach of one another.  But it's still hot!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

The first time that I watched this movie, I was hooked on right from the get go, and ""L.A. Confidential"" packs more tension and suspense than Roman Polanksi's ""Chinatown"".  Even the dialogue has little doses of humor that would leave you giggling with delight.The three leads here (Spacey, Pearce, and Crowe) remarkably hold their ground here as does the supporting cast (Danny DeVito, Kim Basinger, James Cromwell, David Straithairn, etc.).

I can't believe the acclaim,"Just got round to watching this film, and my god it is BAD.There is almost NOTHING to like about LA Confidential.There are too many characters, and they're all completely unlikeable and underdeveloped archetypes. Guy Pearce's character is laughably bad.The dialogue is atrocious - It's completely unnatural with too much exposition, uses every crime drama cliché in the book, it feels like a robot watched every noir film and churned out its best attempt at putting them all together - and the result is horrendous.The so-called story is just plain boring, yet somehow extremely overcomplicated. For me, it was impossible to follow - and no I'm not a Transformers fan who can't watch anything ""cerebral"" - I just appreciate a coherent narrative, that's told economically and efficiently. A murder happens I guess? Then there's some violence? A weird sequence with a prostitute? I don't know.As for the apparent 'style' - this is one of the least stylish films I've ever seen. The colour palette is horrible and murky - everything looks... beige... - and the lighting is bland.To say this film can't hold a candle to American noir classics like Double Indemnity would be an understatement.

A fantastic take on the Noir/Crime genre that pleases and surprises,"L.A. Confidential is an excellent film that immerses the viewer with an excellent grasp on atmosphere, music, and characters, which helps fill the movie with very satisfying feel. While the movie's pace may come in to question for some, I felt that the exponential growth in pacing was more than appropriate for this kind of film, few films in the modern era are able to capture the magic of the genre that is Noir, and even fewer seem to do it while still remaining in it's investigator story style roots, The actors are apparently well aware of the role the are seeking to fill and that knowledge is another amazing aspect of L.A.

LA Confidential is a Masterpiece,"LA Confidential is a great film, based on a great book of the same name by James Ellroy.

All the actors in LA Confidential are excellent and the three leading men all went on to star in their own great films after this. Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, and Guy Pearce. LA confidential on paper sounds boring, but give it a chance and you will be caught up in its deep and intriguing plot as it unfolds. Special mention to Kin Basinger who puts in a Oscar winning performance as Lyn Brackett. Supporting roles for the always great Danny Devito, and James Cromwell.

Witty and Sharp,"This is the absolute gold standard for noir. The film is snappy and sharp; the plot moves quickly but gives just enough clues to follow. The acting is phenomenal by each of the main characters and the slimy corrupt world of Los Angeles comes alive.The plot is smart and believable, although slightly too fast for my liking. This is exacerbated by the copious usage of 1950s slang and show business jargon. There is a lot more to be gained from the film by pausing every now and then to pick up exactly what the characters say and what exactly happened.However with that said, the rest of the film is simply fantastic. The set and costume design is outstanding, and the leads do exactly what they are cast to do.Layered and nuanced, the film uncovers the filthy underbelly of public and private life in the city of the angels.

In common with all great films...,"It's distinction is its lack of a bad scene. This is one of those films that is great to watch and familiarise yourself with and then comeback to later on. The film itself is made exceptional by a cast that you the viewer seem unable to take your eyes off as the film progresses.In this film there are a number of great performances but three in particular are exceptional. Guy Pearce as Lt. Exley is perfectly cast as the ambitious young cop anxious to prove himself better than even his father's fearsome reputation, with Kevin Spacey in equally fine fettle as the movie star of cops, Jack Vincennes, using every ounce of charm to create a Dino-esquire portrayal that's perfect in this period piece. But the tour-De-force of performances comes from a man so chilling in his ability to switch from hostile to psychopathic in seconds is Russell Crowe as Bud White. Before seeing this film I had never seen Crowe in anything and wondered where the hell he had come from and who he was, as his portrayal of White is one of the best I have ever seen, so complete is his immersion in the skin of this viscous detective.Through the eyes of these cops we see a town where, as the poster says, everything is for sale, everyone has a price and nothing is what it seems.For anyone thinking of giving this film a try who may have missed it the first time round it is well worthy of a viewing.Nuff said.Em",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Flawless,"I love movies. I've seen thousands of them over the years. Many entertain me, some make me laugh, some make me cry, some give me new ideas on how to handle or live life. Some I know are kind of bad, but I love them for the atmosphere(Sliver for instance), some are good, but I don't love them(Shawshank Redemptions). And very few are absolutely perfect for me.Here on IMDb, I rated less than two hand full of movies 10/10. L.A. Confidential is one of them. I've seen it 5 or 6 times now and I try not to be too biased, I try to see if maybe I give it a 10/10 because I like it so much that I overlook some flaws. But I just can't find any.The cast is brilliant, down to the smallest role! Guy Pearce, Russell Crowe, Kevin Spacey...they all would have deserved an Oscar for this one! This seems to be the kind of movie that would make even average actors look good. Maybe that's why this was Kim Basinger's only Oscar? I really can't remember her being very memorable in any other movie but this one. And compared to the male cast, she doesn't even shine that much to me(even though she did a great job).The sets...oh, how I love the sets. I often wonder how they managed to pull off such an amazing L.A. of the 50's, but in the 90's. The cars, the suits, every small detail seems to fit perfectly. I think the only other movie I saw that managed to make L.A. look so beautiful is ""Heat""(another 10/10).The soundtrack is amazing as well. Many say L.A. Confidential is the China Town of the 90's, so it makes sense that they got Jerry Goldsmith to do the soundtrack(since he did it for China Town).It's such a shame that no one seems interested to make movies like this one these days. It's all CGI, all some young actors I never heard of(and don't really want to either) and a lame excuse of a story. It seems like film makers in the US forgot that a good movie should have a good story.I heard that they used China Town as an example on how to write a good story for movies in the 80s and afterwards. They should do that nowadays with L.A. Confidential. No matter how often I see this movie, I never get tired of it. It has such a great atmosphere and I think it's the atmosphere that can make a movie a true classic.Heat, China Town, Blade Runner...all movies with atmosphere, all movies we consider classics.

My only gripe is the totally over-rated performance of Kim Basinger. Anyone could have played that part.  I always think that in order to win an Oscar there should be at least a moment of something approaching  memorable...where you can see why that person won...not in this case.  She added nothing to this movie; I thought hers was the worse performance in the movie (other than Danny DeVito, who was in another movie entirely).

Masterpiece,"This incredible piece of work is my favorite film of all time, but no matter who you ask it ranks up there with the greatest. Hanson did a spectacular job adapting James Ellroy's novel, a complex detective yarn that is character (as opposed to plot) driven.  Presenting characters with such depth is truly an amazing feat...most screenwriters and directors would have botched any attempt to put this story on the big screen. Kim Basinger received an Oscar for her portrayal of Lynn, and while she delivers a solid performance, it's probably the least impressive in the film.  Everyone does a fantastic job, but Basinger was the only superstar at the time of release and was rewarded for choosing to participate in such an intelligent project.  The movie really launched the careers of Pierce and Crowe, and while Spacey's career had already been established, it was this role that cemented his place as one of the best contemporary American actors. Every single aspect of this noir film fits together perfectly, from the wonderful performances, the beautiful cinematography, the magnificent, amazingly complimentary soundtrack, the intriguing web-like storyline, and the expert timing and directing.  The movie explodes out of its genre, replacing the expected smoky, dingy backrooms with vivid colors.  The film brings an era to life that is normally dulled in our collective memory like an aging black-and-white photograph with an impressive effort made for authenticity.  The contrast between the deep dark depths of the human soul and the broad daylight imagery is pure brilliance. There is not a single traditional ""good guy"" in the entire movie, and yet it won't leave the observer apathetic about the outcome.  L.A. Confidential manages to evoke a range of emotions, exploring in depth the complex, dual human nature of many of its characters. This is a movie you can see over and over and get something new out of it every time.  If you've only seen parts of this movie, or don't remember it, go sit down with a bag of popcorn in a dark room and watch the whole thing start to finish.  And pay attention.

A hidden gem of a movie filled with fantastic characters and moments.,"There are police dramas, and then there are police dramas set in Los Angeles. Something about this town makes the crimes that much more interesting. Maybe it's the intersection of fame and criminal activity. Perhaps it's that the crimes are so much more grandiose due to the wealth of the area. Whatever the reason, L.A. Confidential (1997) is a fantastic film that manages to show different perspectives of the seedy underbelly of the glamor and glitz that makes the town so successful. If it weren't up against Titanic (1997), it probably would have won a lot more awards than it did.It's almost surprising how many famous actors are in this film. Sure, some of them were unknowns at the time. Even within three years, we'd see Guy Pearce in Memento (2000) and Russell Crowe in Gladiator (2000), both rising into their stardom. This is not to mention the fantastic performances by Kevin Spacey, James Cromwell, Danny DeVito, and Ron Rifkin. I'd be amiss to leave out Kim Basinger's Oscar-winning performance as well. Of course, with so many great actors in this film, it can be a little challenging to determine what storyline to focus on. This is my only qualm.Maybe these stars made the 1950s L.A. drama more entertaining, or perhaps the whole mystery and corruption surrounding the police department were enough to drive this movie forward. The twists were foreshadowed a bit, but were still shocking and made absolute sense. I particularly enjoyed the action sequence at the end. The three police officers involved with this case (Pearce, Crowe, and Spacey) had different perspectives about how to serve the community, and the epic conclusion brought these disparate views together in a satisfying way.A hidden gem of a movie filled with fantastic characters and moments, I give L.A.

Disappointing on re-watch,Watching this decades later. I know i liked it when it first came out but it doesn't hold up in my opinion.It doesn't have the atmosphere of real noir.

Less would have been more in this case.I wonder if the characters' roles were inflated due to their star power. There are too many of them and the underlying story is just ho-hum.

Read the book instead,"It started out well enough. The idea of Danny DeVito as Sid Hudgens providing exposition by way of narration was a good one. But it seems they gave up on that idea too soon. It was also true to the book for a while (Bloody Christmas), but this could not continue. There is no way that the novel could be compressed into even a long movie. Problem is, they kept in the wrong parts, and left out the true motivitions of Exley (the expecations of his father, an act of cowardice in war) and Vincennes (the drunken killing of innocents). They also left out the original crime that ties the whole sotry together in the end.Kevin Spacey was horribly miscast. A great actor, but not nearly the character in the book, and decidely not a noir figure.And where the hell was LA? If not for a few oil derricks and shots of city hall, we could have been anywhere. A greivous error in direction and cinematography.It seems they started with a hollywood ending (I know! Let's have a heroic shootout that wraps up the whole story!) and worked backwards from there. Very unfortunate.Elroy's novels are about corruption, power, and how power is wielded. They also describe the dark underbelly of the places they occur, and use anti-heroes as the protagonists. These are the components of great noir.In the end, while the movie fails as a noir, it does ultimately succeed as a better than average detective mystery.

And although it is a good movie without much doubt, I just don't understand the buckets of a admiration that so many people have towards it. Yes it's well made and acted, but it's also flat, overly long, and quite a joyless watch too, while the plot is nothing that hasn't been done many times before with its good cop caught between his corrupt allies and superiors. One thing that this does do well is that it feels like an actual portrayal of the darker side of criminal life back then (although when Guy Pearce uses a handlkerchief to open the door to the night owl cafe with its two billion finger prints smothered all over it, I couldn't help but chuckle) even compared to the original movies of that period this has more guts with its swear laden script and more explicitly sleazy elements that wouldn't have ever passed through the censors back in the 40s-early 50's.

Like a good wine,"This film is like a good wine - it matures with age. Every time that I've watched this movie I've liked it more and I liked it a lot to begin with.The story follows three cops with a totally different outlook on life and MO. Very much like real life these cops are not model citizens. Bud White (Russell Crowe) dishes out his own punishment without the need for intervention of the courts. Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) is not averse to making a bit of profit from newspaper hacks whilst arresting people. Ed Exley (Guy Pearce) is quite happy to grass on his partners to further his career. The three cops may not be particularly well matched, but they work together to solve the Nite Owl murder and find something altogether more sinister.The acting from the three leads is outstanding and what makes this movie stand out even more is the excellent support from the rest of the cast. Kim Basinger, James Cromwell and Danny DeVito are all worthy of mention as is the script and the direction by Curtis Hanson. The only minor disappointment is the finish which was a little too Hollywood. A modern masterpiece 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Crime and Justice in the City of Angels - One of the All-Time Greats,"Bud White and Ed Exley are two police officers who couldn't be more different from each other. One is a hot-tempered muscle for hire who gets the job done with his fists, the other is a cool calculating ambitious straight-arrow who alienates and antagonizes colleagues as much as he delivers in his job. Inevitably the two are at loggerheads on a personal and professional level. A sudden twist of fate and a flurry of events find the two men bonding and assisting each other in ways they would never have dreamed of. Perfect casting, accomplished direction and flawless acting make this one of the classics of the silver screen. Russell Crowe and Guy Pearce lead this masterpiece with fellow co-stars Kevin Spacey, James Cromwell, Danny DeVito and Kim Bassinger rounding it up to near perfection. Shortly after this release Russell Crowe and Kevin Spacey would go on to superstardom with ""Gladiator"" and ""American Beauty"" respectively. An outstanding work of art which proves Hollywood's incomparable mastery of film when it gets it right, this is cinema at its peak.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
L.A. Confidential is noir crime executed to the highest standard.,"Well, I wasn't expecting that! I went in thinking it would be an overlong stylised drama with one or two scenes of detective work. Quite the reverse actually, it's entirety was an unsolved case. Three separate officers, each with their own motives, investigate separate aspects to a case which eventually interlink with each other. Let me just whip out the old crime checklist: Shootouts? Check. Detective work? Check. Corruption? Check. A plethora of twists and turns? Most definitely. The latter is what truly separates this from other similar crime stories, there are so many twists that are naturally executed. There isn't one moment where I thought ""Oh, that was a coincidence!"". All of these characters are fleshed out, each with a contrasting personality, where any decisions that are made just feel right. A serious straight rookie quickly climbing the ranks utilising his intellect. A tempered brute using his physicality to progress with the case. Then you have the suave experienced officer who uses his connections to get answers. Individually they work excellently, but as a unit? Even better. It plays out brilliantly because of Hanson's direction. Refreshingly switching between these officers and showcasing the 1950's L.A. lifestyle, he managed to create an environment that lives and breathes crime. One of the best casts I've seen from a 90's film. Crowe, Spacey, Cromwell and Pearce (arguably my favourite role of his) all brought grit and emotional captivation to their roles. The script is densely compact with development and taut pacing, although occasionally does dip. I did find Strathairn's character underused and didn't add much to the story. However, the focus is on the case, naturally including character development and thrills to make an outstanding crime thriller. I suspect this will eventually gain the perfect rating.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Perhaps the definitive film of the nineties,"Another nice nostalgia, police procedural flick of the nineties. This one stars (at the time) little known Aussie actors Guy Pearce and Russel Crowe, alongside accomplished character actors Kevin Spacey, James Cromwell, Kim Basinger and Danny Devito. It's a crime drama in the mold of Kiss of Death, I wake up screaming, or the Big Sleep. Some gritty underworld figures are slowly being eliminated, their are new cops on the beat in Los Angeles, the Department seeks a new reputation as a friendlier organization, but the seedier sides of the city are tearing away at that fragile facade. Some of L.A.'s finest are ca-noodling with high priced hookers cut to look like the famous starlets of the day (Veronica Lake to name but one), others are in bed (figuratively with the local gossip rag), but despite all the flaws of the three main police officers involved in the main course of the movie, they all share a desire to break free of their less than savory ways and become honestly decent cops. The mystery of the film revolves around a shooting at a Hollywood diner, that once delved into, becomes a complex maze of who's who in the criminal world. The difference between right and wrong, good and bad is severely tested, and more than a few won't survive. If you've never viewed a forties style gangster flick, or police procedural, check out this film for a taste of what they were like.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Well acted,"L.A. Confidential is that sort of crime/corruption film that I've grown accustomed to, and the one I tend to like enough but not quite love as so many other people do. Still, it's pretty good, and it delivers enough thrills and turns to entertain for its entire running time. It's pulpy and campy in its own sort of way, but never so much that it doesn't take itself seriously. It's sort of fun knowing that both Pierce and Crowe were unknown at this time. The latter is just so perfect in his ""sensitive bad boy"" portrayal, and so gosh darn dreamy (yes, I'm guilty). Overall, this isn't anything too deep, but it gets the job done, and I still wish it had beaten Titanic.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

A promising crime drama with few shortcomings..,"Short Review :-Watched LA Confidential (1997)A promising crime drama that has a few shortcomings. Not a complete thriller nor a complete drama yet grips the scenario with lot of conflicts and then shortfalls to it's own content. Let me see what i liked, Outstanding performances by Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce and hot as hell Kim Basinger, the screenplay with a pace, director's conviction to get the story to the end. The things didn't work for me are, The Prostitution angle and the love story made on it, The overall conclusion on corruption and mainly those cops covering up thier troubles for the sake of the image in public. Maybe, this is not something i expected especially towards the end when you just don't get enough thrills and realise all this drama and backdrop hunt was made to destroy a simple Porn-chain. Ain't it just too less for a Film that has been loved by critics and audiences? I could be the only one to dislike the film that much but yes i have my own views. I could be wrong or i could be right, i don't know, i better fall for a film with a better and strong climax that should really inspire Cops and help them to fight against corruption. Overall, LA Confidential is a promising crime drama with some deficiencies in it's content and we have seen so many better and Cult films in this genre.

A very good film which doesn't quite hit the maximum,"I like this film and I watch the DVD infrequently. I know how good it is and for once I am not entirely sure why it works which for somebody who has not seen it is not very helpful but suffice to say it is enjoyable to watch. All those involved in the making of this film deserve a collective pat on the back for producing a very good and entertaining piece of work. I cannot give it full marks though because no matter how many times I watch it there is something in the film which doesn't add up and so far I have not been able to suss out what it is. Maybe its just me who is looking for something which just isn't there, but its just slightly annoying not being able to enunciate what the missing thing is. Anyway whatever it is apart, this film requires your attention because the subtleties are numerous and the interactions are superb at times. It seems there is a lot of hype surrounding this film and I would suggest anyone who has not seen it just watch the film and do not pay attention to any of it good or bad.

"Decent movie, lousy adaptation","'LA Confidential' the movie has very little in common with Ellroy's book. The plot has been altered, the character's motivation has changed and a Hollywood ending has been tacked on. A very intriguing story about passion, obsession and loyalty has been dumbed down to a level of an ordinary TV cop show. Screenwriter Helgeland did even worse things to Michael Connelly's 'Blood Work', but I am still shocked that this adaptation Ellroy's book won an Oscar. Still, the movie has great performances, good direction, but lacks a decent plot, character development and suspense. If you liked the movie, do yourself a favor and read Ellroy's novel. You'll be amazed how mercilessly the book was butchered. This could have been a great movie if the makers would realize that not everybody has the attention span of a goldfish and that some people can actually follow a complicated plot.

Hardboiled melodrama of crime and corruption amid 1950s Hollywood...,"One of the most hard-hitting, compulsively watchable movies of the '90s is this complex story of crime and police corruption amid lavish life-styles in and around the Hollywood of the 1950s. Never read the James Ellroy novel but I understand it's even more complex and contains even more sub-plots than the film--so you have to admire the screenplay that manages to dovetail all the main details together in a way that leads to a smashing climax. Russell Crowe and Kevin Spacey do standout jobs in the leads--and Guy Pearce is riveting as the intensely ambitious man who eventually joins forces with Crowe to solve the crime. James Cromwell is chilling as the Chief of Detectives, as is Danny DeVito as a tabloid journalist. Kim Basinger is good as the Veronica Lake look-alike--but did she really deserve an Oscar for this? This kind of hard-hitting shoot-em-up melodrama is a throwback to the Cagney and Robinson crime epics of the '30s--but the gore is more graphic and the sadism more intense. Not one for the kiddies--but mature audiences should find this a knockout.And yes, nice use of old pop hits--but ""Accentuate the Positive"" belongs to the early 1940s, as does Veronica Lake's peek-a-boo hairdo. The story is set in the early '50s, but by 1952 that Johnny Mercer hit was ancient history and Lake was no longer using that style.And one more minor quibble: the Lana Turner look-alike did not in any way resemble the real LT. I'm sure all of Lana's fans would agree on that one! Lana had a much classier look and finer features.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"Good, thrilling and with action on many levels","Los Angeles in the 1950's. A classic crime story. Three LAPD detectives does their own investigations of a mass murder at a diner. Turns out it all runs deeper than at first sight. This is a classic film-noir kind of crime story. It has the elements, but a bit different wrapping. A good wrapping that is and a good story.The script is good. You have one main character, Exley, and two other part main characters Vincennes and White. There are no pointed out villain, witch sets your own mind to work, trying to figure out who the bad guy is. You get to know all three characters. You get their background and you realize why they act like they do. There are a lot of work put down in all the characters and they all work well independently, but the chemistry between them is great! The story and plot is also good. It may be a little complicated at times, but nothing you can't handle. There are always something happening and the story is always twisting. It keeps you on your toes at all times.The actors are great. There are some arsenal they've got and they use it wisely. Kevin Spacey does a really good cool, classic, Hollywood-style cop and Guy Pearce is great as the 2nd generation by-the-book-cop. Russell Crowe delivers and so does James Cromwell while Kim Basinger makes a elegant femme-fatal. Danny DeVito, you know, is Danny DeVito.Jerry Goldsmith did it for Chinatown and does it again for this one. The score is great. It sets the mood and the era and builds up the action just as it should. It's cool and classic detective style. Much the same style as in Chinatown.The cinematography is nice. The lightening and composition is good and it captures the mood very well. The decorations, sets and costumes are really 50's style and good looking. The over all look of the film is just very good.L.A. Confidential is a nice film-noir style of movie, yet it is so in it's own way. It does things it's own ways and don't end up being a bad copy.

Triple homicide at the Nite Owl,"The finest Los Angeles film noir to ever come out of Hollywood, Curtis Hanson's L.A. Confidential is a serpentine wonder, a two and a half hour parade of hard boiled detectives, sultry dames and shady dealings, all wrapped up in a multiple murder story that kicks everyone's arc into gear, taking you places you didn't think you'd see some of these people go. 'Triple homicide at the nite owl', barks the headline of a gossip rag run by a sleazy Danny Devito, and indeed the crime scene has everyone buzzing, from the shirt tuckers in the highest ranks of the LAPD, to the burly brass knuckle wearers on the brutish task force. Something is amiss with the case, and Sgt. Edmund Exley (Guy Pearce) is a dogged straight arrow with a nose for corruption. He isn't quite the formidable force needed to barge down certain doors or break certain bones though, and that's where Det. Bud White (Russell Crowe) comes into play. The two are initially at each other's throats following a cleanse of many of the department's corrupt officers, spurred by Exley himself. It soon becomes clear that they have no choice but to work together, in order to smoke out the evil source of the crime, which may be closer to home than anyone thought. Crowe and Pearce were not the stars they are now back then, but came up from the farm league in sensational style, barging onto the Hollywood scene in shotgun toting, sh$&t kicking style. Kim Basinger won an Oscar for her poised, complex turn as a call girl who works for a pimp named Pierce Patchett (a glib David Strathairn), an eccentric who pays surgeons to deck his girls out to look like movie starlets. My favourite performance in the film comes from a diabolical James Cromwell as Captain Dudley, a dangerous rogue who you don't want to cross for fear of his unpredictability. Kevin Spacey is all style and self loathing as Jack Vincennes, a media mogul of a cop who advises on TV shows and hogs the press limelight like a boorish politician. The supporting cast is all across the board, including work from Simon Baker, Graham Beckel, Tomas Arana, Ron Rifkin, Brenda Bakke, Jack Conley and an amusing cameo from Paul Guilfoyle as Mickey Cohen. Adapting a novel by the great undisputed king of LA noir, James Ellroy, Hanson weaves a deadly web of sensation, intrigue and steamy goings on that never follows a readily discernible pattern of narrative, and constantly has tricks up it's sleeves.

A Masterfully Spun Web of Corruption,"""L.A. Confidential"" is one of the most masterfully spun conspiracy movies in history of cinema. It's also one of the darkest and most violent film noir's i've ever seen.

Jack is a hollywood cop. He lives for his role as technical advisor on the Dragnet-like show Badge of Honor. He also gets payed by journalist Sid Hudgeons(Danny DeVito, Twins) to give Sid info on busts of celebrities. Bud White is a thug of a cop. He lives to beat confessions out of suspects and to punish woman beaters. Ed Exley is a politician cop. He lives to rise in the ranks of the LAPD and doesn't even care if the whole station despises him.Add to the mix Captain Dudley Smith(James Cromwell, Babe), callgirl Lynn Bracket(Kim Basinger, The Marrying Man), pornographer Pierce Patchett(David Strathairn, The Firm) and dirty District Attorney Ellis Loew(Ron Rifkin, The Negotiator) and you have a web of corruption, cops, porn and Los Angeles that makes for the most entertaining and best movie of 1997.This is the movie which should of swept the 1997 oscars not Titanic.

Will this review put me on the QT?  How about Hush-Hush?,"In 1997, five films were up for the category of best picture  of those ""LA Confidential"" was a contender. It was an up and down year for the Academy, having the highest grossing picture on the ticket doesn't really allow room for small independent features to see the light of day. Thankfully, ""Good Will Hunting"" proved that wrong, and allowed the comedian Robin Williams to receive the credit he deserved. None the less, ""LA Confidential"" was in the gambit that year, boasting hot new talent, an awe-inspiring image of the golden years of Hollywood, and the grittiness that only James Ellroy could imagine. So, with so many high marks  why didn't this film win? To be honest, my friends, this isn't a very good movie. As other reviews have claimed, and I agree, it is a popcorn film. It has gloss, it has catchy music, and it has veneer, but it lacks the soul to be an award winner. ""LA Confidential"" is a motion picture. In the gambit of releases, it requires one viewing to see where both Russell Crowe and Guy Pierce first found their Hollywood USA footing, but outside of that  it only demonstrates one thing  Kim Basinger didn't need to put her best foot forward to win an award.Wow. Isn't that opening paragraph grouchy? My initial feelings for this film were not as negative as I may sound, it does require one viewing, but alas, this was my second time around and frustration has set in due to the missing hours I cannot get back. ""LA Confidential"" is a film that boasts truths (i.e. there was a club that had women cut like movie-stars for men), or the dirty cops, but ultimately lacks that punch to make it feel  well, real. Let me explain. Upon watching this film a second time, one could notice places where the actor's voices were not synchronized to their lips; one would feel as if they were on a soundstage instead of the actual location, and finally, perhaps the largest downfall, the secondary actors not quite fitting their respected roles. I don't mean to tear apart an award winner, the people have spoken and it has already won, but it should go under scrutiny just like anything else Hollywood recycles. ""LA Confidential"" needed to be darker, it needed further development into our main characters, and it needed more blood  more truth, more honest, more detail. Boasting speaking parts of over 80 people is great, but when there wasn't a strong enough story to support them, it just falls apart at the seam.With so much distress, I must admit, there were parts I enjoyed. I loved the costumes, the fantasy of this missing Hollywood. The freedom during the time seemed stronger than ever, and Hanson captured this greatly. The music countered the film greatly, focusing our attention on the time with upbeat songs and jingles. Finally, I did like where Russell Crowe went with his character. His was the only one that I believed, and trusted to portray a cop still fighting the struggle with his past. He was the darkness that we needed for this film; his character alone represented what ""LA Confidential"" should have been. He was worth watching and should have been presented with his first Oscar, but I digress. Alas, this is all I can say  the rest seemed like a downward scramble into the pit of despair.Overall, I wasn't happy with this film. ""LA Confidential"" could have been the small film that knocked Titanic off its shelf, but because it was so glossed over, because it lacked the grittiness, it just felt like a Hollywood-churned product. It duped the audiences. It promised this dark world of corrupt cops and staunch criminals, but did not deliver. I wanted this to be a great noir film, a great feature to the likes of ""The Untouchables"", but this comes nowhere close. Hanson tries to stay mainstream with this film, but could have succeeded by bringing his own image to the table. I cannot stress this enough, this is a Hollywood film. It is everything Hollywood represents from predictable plots, to friends finding roles for other friends (see DeVito and Basinger), and bloodless shootouts. Even with all the production value going into it, we still couldn't get Crowe's voice to match his lips. Pathetic.One viewing  that is all you will need. I promise.Grade: * out of *****",2.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
A superb thriller in every sense,"LA Confidential is as brilliant as you perhaps expect it is. From the thrilling screenplay to the aesthetically pleasing cinematography, there is a lot to like about this 90's noir showpieceThe performances from all involved are brilliant. I particularly enjoyed Russell Crowe's intense and ferocious portrayal of Bud White, while Guy Pearce provided the intelligent and calculated base to play Edmund Exley, and finally Kevin Spacey brought the sly and wise humour that embodies his character Jack Vincessens. These are all heavyweight actors who all produce a career best performance, they all bring something richly different to a heavy narrative that requires attention. Couple these with the psychotic nature of Cromwell's character, Dudley Smith, and this film has about just everything a detective narrative needs. Kim Basinger's performance alone is greatThe screenplay from Brian Hegeland and Curtis Hanson is perfect, a very precisely told neo-noir story that has its twists and turns placed brilliantly.This is an essential noir film to watch, it's paced very well too meaning the runtime rarely drags, a brilliant film from Curtis Hanson.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Confidential.  This is how you make a perfect film.  Even the character names are great.  Pierce Patchet, Lynn Bracken, Bud White.  The scene between Bud and Lynn when he first shows up at her apartment rivals any Bogart/Bacall scene.This is also an amazing guy movie.  You have three representatives of the male, the slick smooth talker, the book worm, and the tough guy.  Almost every man can make himself fit into one of those roles and see the film through their eyes.  He also wishes, at various times, the he could be the other two.If it wasn't for Titanic this film would of AND should of swept every Oscar it was nominated for.  It hits every single target that it aims at.  As it stands it is the best film of the decade and in 20 years it will be regarded as one of the top 10 films of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Top Notch Thriller,"This is one of those films that may pass you by if you chose to watch it when other distractions are around. Along with the Usual Suspects and Pulp Fiction, i made several attempts to begin watching this movie, only find myself switching it off after 1/2 an hour or so due to distraction or lack of attention. Don't miss interpret what am i saying, this not a sign of a poor movie, in fact quite the opposite; it is merely a warning that films such as these require our undivided attention, and without it they may seem to be less than they are.L.A. Confidential is a terrific thriller set in the 50's, with very realistic characters and an accurate depiction of the corruption and issues of the period.The cast includes Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, Kim Bassinger and Danny Devito, and every one of them delivers a top notch performance, and i have to say Guy Pearce was surprisingly the one that shone the most.Not to be missed 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Couldn't Ask for a Better Movie,"Now I would like to say, it is not very often that I give a 10. Russell Crowe, Kevin Spacey, Guy Pearce, James Cromwell, Kim Basinger, and Danny DeVito, a terrific cast all in a single movie. It is a movie that I doubt will ever fall from the top movie list. It is a Detective Movie basically with the three main characters, Officer Bud White (Crowe), Sgt. Jack Vincennes (Spacey), and Det. Lt. Ed Exley (Pierce), they are all in different divisions of the LAPD and they are all working on the same case from different ends, finally they all get together and the pieces begin to fall into place. There are so many twists in this movie that it keeps you guessing until the end. So with an all star cast, an all star script, the acting was top notch, which makes for an awesome movie. In the end, a 10 out of 10. And for all of you people out there that like good detective movies, and think that you can solve mysteries right away...

One Of The Greatest Movies Ever!,"I'd seen the end of this movie once, and I'd seen the start another time, but I'd never watched the whole thing from beginning to end.  Last night I finally did after buying it on DVD.  I wasn't disappointed.The plot centres on three cops, Bud White (Crowe), Ed Exley (Pearce) and Jack Vincennes (Spacey) as they try to uncover the truth behind a mass murder incident at the Nite Owl diner.Jack Vincennes, known as Hollywood Jack, is the technical advisor for a hit TV police drama, and the closest thing to a celebrity in the LAPD.  He receives bribes to arrest celebrities while crooked photographer Sid Hudgeons (DeVito) takes their photo for Hush-Hush, his sleazy tabloid dirtsheet.  Kevin Spacey is perfect in the role, cool and slick on the exterior, yet showing Jack's hidden self-loathing perfectly.Bud White is an officer who is a success in the LAPD for brawn more than brains, often resorting to violence.  He has a deep hatred for woman-beaters due to the fact that his father abused his mother.  He is a loose cannon who appears set to go off at any given time.  Forget Gladiator, this is Russell Crowe at his career best.Guy Pearce is equally mesmerising in his performance as LAPD golden-boy Ed Exley.  We dislike him enormously at first, when he snitches on all his partners and becomes despised within the force.  However, he rises to the role of protaganist as the unforgettable climax looms closer.James Cromwell impresses in the thankless role of Captain Dudley Smith, the Chief Of Detectives who acts as a father-figure of sorts to Exley and White. It's not until the last hour or so that we can really appreciate Cromwell's performance.Danny Devito is suitably slimy as Sid Hudgeons, hte sleazy tabloid reporter. Devito's stature really adds to that poison dwarf character of Hudgeons, and even his voice is perfect.Ironically, Kim Basigner, the only one of the six to get recognised with an Oscar, impresses least.  She plays Lynn Bracken, a prostitute in business solely because she looks like Veronica Lake.  It's not that she's bad that she impresses least, it's just because everybody else is so good.Overall, this movie is a masterpiece, and while Jack Nicholson deserved the Oscar for Best Actor in 1997, no way in hell did ""Titanic"" deserve Best Movie when LA Confidential was nominated.  It might be quite daunting with its labyrinthine plot, and imposing length, but don't let that put you off. This is one of those movies that I think everyone has to see.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

How is it the people that are part of the criminal storyline get less billing than clerks and coroners?

And it never established a real period feel. By the way, having Danny Devito in this movie made it a total joke. We're supposed to take The Penguin seriously as a character in a major film?

Best of 97,"A beautiful film in so many ways, and a huge surprise coming from a Hollywood studio and not being directed by Scorsese or Spielberg.The story is great.  A wonderful distillation of James Ellroy's novel.  It clarifies and simplifies a hugely complex story and still keeps its spirit intact.  It also happens to have the funniest moment in cinema last year. And that moment has historical accuracy.  Take that, Titanic.  Terrific dialogue and an insightful look at issues pertenant today such as tabloid journalism and celebrity worship.The look is dead on and beautiful, costumes lighting etc...  The locations used were great.The acting is wonderful.  Russell Crowe gave my favorite performance of last year.  Kevin Spacey was very close in his finest work yet.  No one else can be complained about.A wonderful throwback to the Hollywood that did things right and it seems to be doing is more consistently.  Primary Colors and The Truman Show being good examples.If you liked it, I would suggest going to your classics sections and picking up The Big Sleep and Touch of Evil.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Decent movie but no classic,"First off, although Kim Basinger adds some depth to her character as the film proceeds, it boggles my mind how she was nominated for a best supporting Oscar, let alone win it.  It simply shows how a little buzz from a few people can get a steamroller going.  On the other hand, Guy Pearce and Russell Crowe were robbed of nominations, both (especially Pearce) give terrific performances.  This is a story of corruption in the LA police force, and the period atmosphere and byzantine plot make this a modern film noir to be reckoned with.  The body count becomes ridiculously high and this theme has been done much better (see Chinatown) but the end result is a satisfying film.Kevin Spacey, Danny Devito and James Cromwell all add to the enjoyment with their roles.  I still think this film is hugely overrated though, #36 of all time on IMDB is way too high.

What a huge turn of events 8/10,"L. A. Confidential is a great movie. From the ensemble cast to the story, from the music and style of the 50's to the revelations happening throughout the film.The story surrounds a bribery and scheme case happening in the LAPD, we're followed by three officers, each one different from the other. Investigating the case and revealing dark secrets.Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe and Guy Pierce are the leading stars of the film. Followed by Kim Basinger and Danny DeVito.What the movie centers around mostly is the corruption of the police and the minority of men who still have a little sense of duty towards their role. Guy Pierce's character is the only one who represents the good working cop who does his job properly. Kevin Spacey and Russell Crowe are also good men but there not the best representation, nor the not the type of people you would want near you.What I love in particular is the turn of events happening throughout the film, every few moments there are more details being revealed, details that both the characters and the audience learn about that cause a huge turn of events. Leading to the climax and New Equilibrium (The 22nd step in the 22 steps of telling a story, as said in John Truby's book ""The Anatomy of Story"").Overall I enjoyed the film and in general I love old cop stories focusing on scheme cases and cops facing conflicts evolving thrust and distrust.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

The actors all did great, some of the casting has aged badly but the performances are all good. Guy Pearce works really well as the buy the books cop, Russel Crowe is a convincing tough guy and Kevin Spacey actually got me to like him for a couple of minutes. I loved the noir story but I also thought the cinematography and score were really well done too. I do have a few issues with the film, I think the ending, without giving any spoilers, felt cheap and sort of ruined the message of the film, I also thought that at one point Ed Exley (Pearce) made a decision regarding a woman that was completely out of character and was only made to progress the plot.

Riveting character drama & killer plot,"L.A. Confidential restored my faith in the possibilities of movie-making. (I periodically need that.) It succeeded in so many ways that I can't really imagine how it could have been better. The motivations and actions of the characters are so coherent that they seem like real people, and the movie gets better with each viewing (on the third viewing I was still catching details I had missed previously).The truth behind the Nite Owl killings is entertainingly slow to come to light, but my favorite element of the movie was the psychological complexity of the characters, particularly Ed Exley and Bud White. You can feel Exley being tempted to become what he hates and the outcome is in doubt every step of the way. But for me Bud White is the most compelling person in the film, simmering with angry purpose but far more aware than people take him to be. If I cared at all about the Oscars I would say that Russell Crowe deserved a best actor award for this role, but since I don't I will merely say he's absolutely wonderful and everyone should see this film.Someone else mentioned watching this film with Chinatown as a double bill. I did just that last weekend and found that Chinatown seemed flat in comparison. Though I had to respect it for going for a more obviously grim ending than L.A.

"A Very Uneven Film, though it holds your attention through the rough moments","L.A. Confidential is an uneven film, but does succeed on many other levels. The first 20 minutes of the film are very strong, you'll be thinking your in for a good ride. Suddenly, for the next half hour of the film it's uninteresting. It becomes boring with too many characters jumping from crime to crime, character to character, story to story. They just tried to jam pack too much stuff in there. After it hits the 1 hour mark, it's back in top form and draws you quickly in again, making you become invested in the story at hand. It's when the film slows down from its hyperactivity, and strings the many story lines together into one big one.The big problem here is the pace of that 30 minute mark to 60 minute mark. It's not bad (its actually kind of fun), just makes the project weaker in that time. A lot happens and it's very ""talkie"", and the film doesn't give the audience a second to breathe and comprehend what's going on.The dialogue makes it a little confusing. It also seems like there is crime after crime after crime, I thought to myself ""Why should I care?"" Though, I must say it's the only flaw.After that ridiculous second half-hour, it makes a complete 180 back to where it was in the beginning. The rest of the film was compelling, smart, unpredictable, and thrilling. The audience also becomes even mesmerized into the rest of the film. I must say, the twist and turns are very surprising, like knock you back in your seat surprising.L.A. Confidential has an excellent ensemble. Is ensemble the right word? Many people consider it an ""ensemble piece"". Meaning every character is a supporting character, such as movies like Crash, The Air I Breathe, Inglourious Basterds, etc. I'd beg to differ. The three cops that we follow, I feel would be the leading roles (Spacey, Crowe, Pierce), and everyone else would be supporting. Either way the film has excellent support from it's actors.Kevin Spacey, Im about to call him the Best Actor of the '90s, he is Oscar-Worthy in everything he does. He's so relaxed in the role and charming and cocky. He's the stand-out here. Kim Basinger won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for her work here. Is it deserved? Very. She's great here. Her character is full of mystery and all that makes you more interested in her. Basinger's nuanced performance deserves every positive recognition it got.This was one of Russell Crowe's first performances and to be honest, it's a great breakout. His solid effort avoids the cliché his character was dripping in. Guy Pierce even warms up to you though the duration. Danny DeVito has a small, but memorable role and is as every bit as good as any cast member. So quirky an fun.The tech side of the things doesn't slouch either. The film is beautifully photographed, has lovely costumes, nice sets--especially Kim Basinger's home. It's silky and slinky; beautiful. The score keeps you on the edge of your seat and sets the mood.InThe end chase shootout is nail-biting. You also get to see touching couples scenes throughout. L.A. Confidential also has a humor about itself, which makes it a rockin time. There's a gag with Spacey and Pierce with Lana Turner which is hilarious. Great entertainment! Though there may be one bug rough patch, it doesn't ruin the entire film which is technically astonishing, has a suspenseful story, and is well-acted; 8.5",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Probably a 7.7. Not quite an 8. But a very slick flick,"A brilliant story with lots of great characters and a solid story line. It doesn't get an 8 because it was a little predictable. Not in the understanding the details of the outcome. But I found myself identifying the end positioning of some of the characters who contributed to the plot and this for me slightly took the shine off it. The style is great and the cast is equally well drilled. With all offering believable and emotive performances. Basinger was made to play a film noir dame and Russell Crowe who I find a little tedious to be honest, delivers in my opinion the performance of his career. Danny Devito plays the unscrupulous editor of hush hush magazine to perfection and Spacey delivers yet another flawless performance.

Corruption in Los Angeles,"LA Confidential is more than a drama or a thriller, it is probably a material showing the existing level of corruption in LA during the 50-60s. This time I saw the film carefully, and certainly its main actors, Spacey, Crowe and Guy Pearce did an excellent work as policemen and detectives also corrupted or each with his own ambitions. I cannot assert that everything shown there is real, but some facts may have encouraged James Ellroy to write the novel and Curtis Hanson to make such a film. The plot is a bit complicated to be told by me here, but I may assert that it is a very well done film, with all necessary ingredients. However, I must also say that although Kim Basinger acted very well, I did not find her acting worth of an OSCAR as the best supporting actress.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Well then, forget the movie and read the book! I sat dumbfounded watching this movie trying to figure if the characters on the screen were supposed to be the same ones  adapted from the book.

An instant classic.,"L.A. Confidential has one of the best screenplay's ever written, which is complimented by excellent castingwhich produced some top-notch performances from some virtual unknowns at the time. Guy Pearce, Russel Crowe, Kevin Spacey, and James Cromwell were all perfectly cast for this film. Kim Basinger won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for her role, although some of her fellow cast members were more deserving of an award. Had the Hype-tanic not been released the same year, this film would have completely swept the Oscars. Damn undeserving Titanic. Oh well. That just goes to show that the Academy doesn't necessarily reflect respect where it's deserved. Even though this film scored a few, the Titanic swept the 1997 awards, including Best Picture. My heart will go onNO!Even without the compliment of an A-grade screenplay, the acting performances are truly worth recognition. This was the first movie I had the pleasure of watching Guy Pearce in and I was blown away. He really seems to fit his part in this film and you really feel the emotions that the other characters have towards him. Russell Crowe and Kevin Spacey also fit right in and provide excellent performances. Spacey easily pulls off being the smart ass showboat, and Crowe is very convincing as the reactionary, muscle-bound ""bad"" cop. James Cromwell also plays the chief of detectives flawlessly. And although Kim Basinger won Best Supporting Actress, I must assume that her competition was laughable at best. She plays a hooker, wow. Not that she didn't do it well, I just didn't feel it was all that deserving of an Oscar. I mean, how hard is it to play a tramp? But that's not her fault, or anyone else's involved in the picture....and it certainly doesn't take away from anything here.Curtis Hanson really shows everyone how it's done with this one, pulling off truly masterful directing techniques in every aspect. There isn't any area where I feel he could have improved. Everything flows perfectly and evenly, and the moods and pace are controlled very well. The general noir feeling he was going for was done nothing short of impeccable. The story itself is extremely entertaining and has a great ending, but I won't comment on that....you can see for yourself. I will simply say that the story is one of the best I've come across in a long time. Overall, simply perfect in every way and will easily become a classic.Definitely a great addition to anyone's collection. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Masterpiece is an understatement,"L.A. Confidential is three movies in one. Every time you watch it, you enjoy it more and more. And the third time you can only give it the maximum 10/10 quote on IMDb. The acting is phenomenal. Don't forget that Russell Crowe was not nominated for an Oscar but in 2001 got one for ""Gladiator"", Best Actor in a Leading Role and nominated for 2 more (""The insider"" and ""A beautiful mind""). One year earlier Kevin Spacey won his Oscar (Best Actor in a Supporting Role) in ""The Usual Suspects"", another favorite movie of mine and also Top Rated. In this movie he was also not nominated. But in 2000 took the Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role in ""American Beauty"". And the same applies to Guy Pearce who also outperformed in L.A. Confidential and also not nominated. But with ""Memento"", another Top Rated movie (again one of my all-time favorite movies) got 2 Oscars (or at least the Nolan Brothers). So we have a top cast with actors who already made it, or who made it a bit later and shined so bright here that you'd have to have wear sunglasses to watch the movie. Another example, Simon Baker, who plays Matt Reynolds. The scene where Vincennes meets with Sid Hudgens to arrange a sexual encounter with Matt Reynolds takes only 2 minutes. But you can see that Simon Baker has all it takes to become a great actor (and featured in ""The mentalist"" later – not to compare with this movie, but strictly seen from an acting point of view). These are just four great actors but it's the whole cast. To my humble opinion all of them outperformed, Kim Basinger, Danny DeVito, Paul Guilfoyle and so on. Combine this with a plot that's unbeatable, perfect directing (Curtis Hanson – ""Bad Influence"", ""Too big to fail"" etc) and you have an explosive combination that can only lead to a true masterpiece.Try to find something negative about this movie (apart from the fact that it missed out on the Oscars) and let me know.

"Finally, a movie with a story","Recently, I finally had a chance to view this movie, having missed it a couple of times before. Man, am I glad that I finally got to see it!With the current Hollywood climate, where special effects seem to be far more important than story line or dialogues, it's refreshing to finally see a movie that actually has a deep and sensible story, as well as believable characters and good acting.Sure, the three main characters (Spacey, Pierce and Crowe) are sort of stereotypical and don't really show that much character development, but they at least feel like real persons with real shortcomings. Acting is superb all over (with even Danny DeVito in a serious role), with the possible exception of Kim Basinger. Yes, I know she got an Oscar for it, but all she has to do is look pretty and that's about it.The real winner here is the story, though. It keeps you on the edge of your seat, and is pretty complex without ever becoming overwhelming. Most importantly, it all makes sense and doesn't contain any huge plot holes I could find.Add to this a number of gritty and realistic action sequences, and you have a real winner.

Kudos to Hanson for a brilliant film,"As an avid film buff I'm surprised this movie slipped through the cracks for me until just recently. It caught my eye in the video store and I had heard good reviews, so I checked it out. I was simply amazed by this film. I've tried very hard not to grow cynical in this age dominated by Battlefield Earth's and teen film puke, and this movie gracefully redeems its entire decade. Wonderful performances all around the board, terrific script, and intelligent directing and cinematography. I've so missed the classic films of the earlier eras, and I love that L.A. Confidential was able to recapture the cinematic genius of that time. A film for those who truly love films.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Righteous Detectives Against Corruption!,"Crime suspense set in Los Angeles in 1953. LAPD detective Bud White finds Lynn, a prostitute in a prostitution ring, as he investigates the brutal murder of 6 people, including a former detective. Meanwhile, ambitious Ed Exley, whose father was a detective killed in the line of duty, and Jack Vincennes, an adviser on TV detective shows, have their own agendas. They clash, but eventually join forces to confront corruption within the police.First and foremost, the film is an excellent depiction of the conflict and growth between Russell Crowe's character, Bud White, and Guy Pearce's character, Ed Exley. Bud is a misfit and disobeys orders. Ed, on the other hand, is an honors graduate of the police academy. They have very different personalities, but their common sense of justice gradually brings them together.The direction is superb. The dark visuals and tense scenes that beautifully recreate the atmosphere of 1950s Los Angeles took my breath away.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
one of the best film of the decade,"first of all i read in this page some people being confused over the fact if L.A Confidential was Film Noir or not ,Answer to that question is it'e a Neo noir . It is a very self aware, One of the the best of it's kind it's in the same league as The ChinaTown .The performance are excellent , starting from Russel crowe to Danny devito. This movie once again proved the unfairness of Oscars since none of the male leads were nominated for the awards.The story is very good .Everything about this movie is just awesome . if you haven't watched yet just go ahead and watch it , i can assure you that it would be one of you're best movie watching experience . enjoy",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Very Fun Crime Movie with Great Acting and Pacing,"Super fun crime story that I don't regret watching. It's not one of those movies with the most unexpected plot or twists, it comes very little closer to Tarantino's style, and the actors play their roles perfectly. Guy Pearce is phenomenal. Not just him de, but he got in my head the most it seems :)I recommend it to everyone - there's a bit of everything in this film. It's maybe a bit brutal at times, but that brutality somehow passes and is easy to watch. The pacing of the film is top notch, I have no quibbles with it.So if you get a chance - watch it; super chilled out and interesting. Not the greatest masterpiece, but definitely something to see :)Final score: 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Keep it confidential and never tell me.,"When I first saw the commercial for this movie, I was interested to see it. When people were buzzing about how good it was, I was really interested.After seeing it, I simply shrugged. I thought it was very boring and I didn't think Kim Basinger was that great. Although I liked Crowe and Spacey in this, I didn't like any of the others like Divito and Guy Pearce. After all the oscar stuff, I even saw it again and still nothing.To this day I still can't think what is so great about it or remember any scenes that really stick out.

A true modern classic,"This great throwback to cop/gangster flicks of the golden age is a wonderfully realised treat for fans of the genre and all movie lovers, featuring a gang of top stars on blistering form, working from a brilliant script under very classy direction. Shades of noir classic Touch of Evil hang over this cracking thriller (check out the oil pumps pounding away in the background in the finales of both films), dealing with moral and political shenanigans in the LAPD and the movie-star-and-drug-baron milieu of Marlowe and Sam Spade. Spacey, Crowe and Guy Pearce head a brilliant cast that includes great turns from Danny DeVito, Kim Basinger and James Cromwell, all caught up in a fantastically complex web of corruption and crime that unravels itself beautifully as the film builds to its pounding climax. At heart though this is a moral picture looking at the pursuit of justice in an ethically complex world, and a buddy picture about tough men overcoming their differences to pull together towards a common goal of good over evil. A great soundtrack of period tunes and a few deft touches of humour put the finishing touches on a film that comes pretty near perfection.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Realistically Mysterious..!!,"L.A. Confidential uncovers the bitter truth behind the Los Angeles glamour. The story and script are so powerful that its hard to move away from the screen. Casting is perfect, and the direction is extra- ordinary. Although its a crime mystery movie which means the movie depends more on the story, but acting is too perfect to be ignored. The movie starts with the introduction to crime in LA which is a larger view, then sticks to the characters and ends with a broader view again.

Terrific noir,"This film is a great noir film that hits all the right notes. The setting is brought to life with extensive details and celebrity culture. The acting is great and all the characters have emotional depth. The plot is full of mystery, twists and turns. What starts out as a diner shootout turns into something much deeper where nobody knows what is really going on and who is responsible. The best part of this film is how it weaves together so many threads and characters together in a slick way that is easy to follow, raises the stakes and becomes clear by the end.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Brilliant.,"I'm not going to launch into an in-depth analysis of the film (Lord knows I had to do enough of that to get an A-level in Media) Suffice to say this is one of the best films the 90's has produced; an achievement made all the more remarkable considering the complex source material. I admire Hanson and Helgeland for fashioning a taut and relatively easy to understand thriller without sacrificing too many of the nuances that make Ellroy's books great (Incidentally, if you're into good reading, I recommend ""The Black Dahlia"") I had to watch this film multiple times daily for a year and not once did I get sick of it. That's a high recommendation!Oh, BTW, Helgeland also wrote the screenplay for one of the massively inferior ""Elm Street"" sequels.

The best Neo-Noir ever made!!!,"I'm a major fan of film noir I love everything about the mood , the dim lighting, the dark colors and the dark story but I'm here to tell you that this film has none of those qualities. You see this film is what you call a neo-noir it's not exactly a film noir but it also is at the same time. L.A. Confidential is what you call a masterpiece among crime films it's so perfect, so well done and so well acted to the point you don't even realize that your watching a film, you see when you watch L.A. your living a film which is something of very extreme rarity and pleasure.When this film was released in 1997 nobody was interested in it and from it's box office opening it showed. But after just a week in theaters this film started to rack up the dough although it could have made allot more than what it did L.A. Confidential was a moderate box office success but it's popularity didn't stop, no this films fame and didn't end with it's theatrical run it soon became an instant Saturday night favorite and a landmark film effectively jump starting the ""Neo-Noir"" genre and ushering in a whole new era of crime films, many films have tried to copy this style and many have failed( actually all have failed.) but this film has been so widely acclaimed by critics and fans alike that even if you could copy it's style, even if you could mimics it's appeal, even if you could copy the sense of humor and the sense of justice and brilliance that it had you would never be able to capture the awe and glamor that this film has it's so grand and beautiful that if your a filmmaker at heart you'll almost want to cry.L.A. Confidential is perfect in every way imaginable there isn't a single flaw or a single clique that exist in this film and let me say that I thoroughly enjoyed this film so much and if you have the heart for a period piece crime drama then look no further, this is the film.

"Hard hitting, complex, and suitably dark, L.A. Confidential is among the greatest cop movies ever made","Three very different LA cops, a grisly murder at an all-night diner, and a conspiracy that stretches farther and deeper than anyone could know; these are the materials from which great cop movies are mad. And make no mistake; LA Confidential is a great cop movie. Entertaining and surprisingly complex, this is not only a good movie in its own right, but a nostalgic tribute to cop shows and film noirs of old.The plot of this film is first rate, which should come as no surprise seeing as the screenplay is adapted on the bestselling novel of the same name by James Ellroy. The story it tells of corruption, murder, and LA's seedy underbelly contains more twists, turns, and revelations than any other cop movie in recent memory. This is one of those films where for every answer there's another question, and every time a break is made, it only reveals another layer of mystery. Fortunately, it's still fairly easy to follow, thanks to screenwriter Brian Helgeland's decision to cut out large sections of the novel, leaving only material that directly relate to the three main characters.This is also a wise choice because as important and well done as the story is, it's the characters that really drive LA Confidential. Bud White (Russell Crowe) is a hardworking, foul tempered patrol cop whose greatest pleasure in life is tearing into wife beaters. His physique, temperament, and recent involvement in the Bloody Christmas brutality scandal make him the department's go to guy for quietly roughing up suspects. He doesn't give a damn about things like rules and proper procedure, and after the murder of his partner, he's out for blood.His opposite in nearly every respect, Edward Exley (Guy Pearce) is young, ambitious, and a master of department politics. He's one of the brightest men on the force, but he's also a stickler for the rules, and something of a self righteous prick, whose fixation on advancing his own career and willingness to testify against his fellow officers does little to endear him to old hands like White.Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) is very much the public face of the LAPD. As the golden boy of the narcotics department, technical adviser to the hit TV series Badge of Honor, and number one inside source for Hush-Hush magazine, he relishes the fame and attention his job brings him. Now, stuck on the vice beat after being caught up in the Bloody Christmas scandal, he's desperate to make the big break that will get him back in the spotlight. The three don't have much in common, and don't particularly like each other, but as their cases begin to intertwine into something much larger, they form an unlikely alliance.LA Confidential is unique among cop movies for how far it delves into each character's personality and motivations. From the beginning, we learn what makes these three tick. The film explores in great depth their differing philosophies of law enforcement, their relations with their fellow officers, their reasons for becoming cops in the first place, and their growing dissatisfaction and disillusionment with their jobs. It also probes just what it means to be a good cop. Is it the number of arrests an officer makes and the prestige that he brings to the department that makes him a good officer? His dedication to his duty and unwavering resolve not to compromise himself? Or is it his willingness to do whatever it takes to see justice done? I also admired the attention paid to the dichotomy between the contemporary image of Los Angeles and the reality that lay beneath it. Nowhere is this better captured than in the opining narration by Danny DeVito, which starts out like one of those sappy promotional real estate videos from the fifties, then effortlessly pivots into a delicious take on muckraking tabloid journalism. Come to think of it, that's a pretty good description of DeVito's character, Hush Hush Magazine publisher Sid Hudgens. Cynical, amoral, and with an uncanny ability to sense a juicy story from a mile away, he has contacts throughout the department, and isn't above manufacturing a scandal when none presents itself. He's as sleazy as they come, and right from the start I couldn't help liking him.The period touches were also done well, capturing the look and feel of 1950's Los Angeles and adding an occasionally humorous subtext without becoming distracting or overpowering. And of course there's a good deal of violence, all done with a gritty realism that evokes the noirs of old. Another parallel to classic noir is the film's moral ambiguity. Both Bud White and Jack Vincennes engage in behavior that is clearly illegal, but neither man is portrayed as dirty or corrupt for doing so. The movie's female lead (Kim Basinger) is a prostitute, yet she is perhaps the person viewers will feel the most sympathy for. And at the end, one of the main players makes a decision that is entirely contrary to the ideals he held at the beginning of the film, but which based on the results is undoubtedly the right thing to do.LA Confidential is not a film that places its narrative in a simple frame of black and white. Nor is it a mindless celebration of blazing guns and blaring sirens. Rather it's a movie that embraces depth, complexity, and character development without slowing or losing its focus. It's hard hitting, exciting, often cerebral, and very dark. I feel justified in saying that LA Confidential is to the cop movie what Chinatown is to the private eye film; an homage to the genre, and a truly great movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
As good as the previews,"I wish I had seen this on the big screen. I made the mistake of listening to a couple of reviews, which made it out to be an overblown melodramatic adaptation of a contrived James Ellroy novel. Having read some Ellroy, I could imagine how bad that was.The strange thing is, that isn't far from the truth, but the movie is  far better than it implies. This is an excellent film-noir / thriller, superbly acted, and credible in the way only an Ellroy novel can make outrageous situations credible. Not one, but three excellent leading actors as cops (Crowe, Spacey, Pearce) working against / with each other in unexpected ways, each true to a very different vision of police work. Pearce (Ed Exley) especially does a superb job; he initially comes across as a weasel, and yet earns respect without changing his nature. And Kim Basinger is wonderful. I don't think she has ever been better.The melodramatic touches oddly add to the credibility, and whether or not this reflects '50's LA, it certainly reflects a believable version of the gloss, allure and seediness we expect of LA.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"By far the best film of the nineties, and perhaps ever.","Unfortunately, many people have never seen this superlative film.  ...LA confidential excels where other films try to.  It carefully combines drama, action, and romance into one convoluted and twisted package.This is one of the few films that demands a re-viewing.  The acting is top notch, Spacey, Crowe, Pierce, and Bassinger are all excellent.  Kevin spacey's portrayal of Jack Vincennes, a Hollywood cop, is performed expertly, as is Pierce's role as Ed Exley.  Each of the three main characters grow and change, and in the end, we don't know who to feel sorry for.  Few movies can pull this off with this many central characters.  LA Confidential pulls it off without losing speed.  However it would be easy to say that Bassinger and Crowe steal the show.  Crowe's skilled juxtaposition of strength, anger, and frailty is definitely his defining role.The plot is thick, twisting, and engrossing, although at times it gets just a little too tangled.  The screenplay, as expected, is also top notch, and a good many of the lines are taken directly from James Ellroy's novel, a must read, by the way.For those that crave action, there's plenty of it, including a riveting final gunfight.  Musically and visually, the film puts you in Hollywood LA in the 1950s, the total immersion in a glamorous but corrupt city is spectacular.Unlike many adaptations of books, LA Confidential stands on its own as one of the most compelling and well made movies of the past decade.

Neo-Noir for the Nineties,"The last of the classic films noirs were made in the late fifties or early sixties, but there have been later films which, while dispensing with the characteristic, moody, black-and-white look of film noir, attempt to capture something of its spirit, a development which has been called ""neo-noir"". Perhaps the best-known neo-noir was Polanski's ""Chinatown"" from the seventies, and ""L.A. Confidential"" can be seen as a ""Chinatown"" for the nineties. Both films are period pieces, set some forty years before they were made. Both are set in the Los Angeles area, as were many of the classic noirs. Both are in colour rather than black-and-white, but both have a typically complex noir plot, involving widespread corruption and wrongdoing.""L.A. Confidential"" is set in the Los Angeles of the 1950s. The heroes are three officers of the city's police force, with very different characters. The classic films noirs generally took a cynical view of human nature, and neo-noir has followed this tradition. All three men can be seen as flawed heroes. Bud White is a man of action, with a violent, unpredictable streak, not above beating up suspects he believes to be guilty or planting evidence on them to secure a conviction. Bud's particular anger is reserved for men who use violence against women; at the root of this lie bitter memories of his own childhood, when his mother was murdered by his father.Like Bud, Edmund Exley has lost a parent to violence; his father, himself a police officer, was murdered by a criminal. In other respects, however, he seems to be Bud's exact opposite. Exley is a quiet, calm officer who insists on doing everything by the book, refusing to use Bud's methods to obtain a conviction, even when encouraged to do so by his cynical superior Captain Dudley Smith. When a group of officers bring the force into disrepute by beating up a number of Mexican detainees, Exley is prepared to earn the hatred of his colleagues by naming names. Exley's flaw is that he seems too good to be true. His sense of integrity can coincide too neatly with his own advantage; we sense that he informs on his colleagues not because he cares for justice for the Mexicans but in order to advance his own career.Jack Vincennes also leaves us with the impression that he is uninterested in justice. Indeed, he does not seem very interested in police work at all. His main interest is his lucrative sideline as adviser to a TV cop show which enables him to mix with actors and other glamorous celebrities. Vincennes also has a corrupt deal with Sid Hudgens, the editor of a scandal-mongering magazine called ""Hush-Hush"", whereby he will, in exchange for money, provide Hudgens with information about which celebrities are about to be arrested on drugs or vice charges.The three are brought together by the investigation into the shooting of a number of patrons of a diner called ""The Night Owl"". At first it seems that the killings were carried out in the course of a robbery, but it emerges that the suspected robbers arrested in connection with the crime are in fact innocent. As inquiries proceed, the three officers begin to uncover an increasingly complex web of corruption and crime, involving Hudgens's magazine, a businessman who runs a brothel where the prostitutes have had plastic surgery to look like famous film stars, the police themselves, and the struggle to inherit the empire once controlled by the city's now-imprisoned gangland boss. The three have never been friends- indeed Exley and White hate one another, partly because White was one of the men fingered by Exley, partly because of rivalry over Lynn, the beautiful Veronica Lake look-alike from the brothel. Nevertheless, they find that they must work together in order to survive.Unlike some, I was not too concerned that this film did not win the ""Best Picture"" Oscar, as ""Titanic"", although a very different film, is nevertheless a good one in its own right. I was, however, surprised that there was not a single ""Best Actor"" nomination for the male leads, Russell Crowe as White, Guy Pearce as Exley and Kevin Spacey as Vincennes, as all three are excellent, with equally good support from Danny de Vito as Hudgens and James Cromwell as Captain Smith. (This was the film that first brought Crowe and Pearce, both Antipodeans, to public notice). I was delighted by Kim Basinger's ""Best Supporting Actress"" award, as this confirmed what I had long suspected, namely that she is a major talent as well as a major-league beauty. She brings a touching freshness and innocence to the role of Lynn, even though she was already in her mid-forties at the time.The success of this film is due as much to the direction as to the acting. Curtis Hanson had made some good films before this one, notably ""The Hand that Rocks the Cradle"" and ""The River Wild"", but those were both in the standard thriller mould. ""L.A. Confidential"" is something more than that. Like the films noirs that served as Hanson's model, it effectively conjures up an atmosphere of decadence and sleaze, touching upon the darker side of human nature. One of the best crime films of the nineties. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Modern classic -- and perhaps best film of 1997,"After watching Hollywood virtually incapable of producing a convincing period piece during the stultifyingly self-conscious '80s, what a relief to see that the 1990s didn't have the same problem.LA CONFIDENTIAL is a splashy, game cinematic display of slime, corruption and intrigue set to the backdrop of 1950s showbiz-obsessed Los Angeles and its infamously dirty police department. With Jerry Goldsmith's CHINATOWNesque score adding immeasurably to the thing.Oh, I suppose it's not perfect. But darn near close to it.Don't be turned off by (as a result of expecting too much from) Kim Basinger's Oscar'd performance: she's okay and certainly acceptable given the role, but her award-winning stature was largely over-hyped because, as 1997 was the year of horrid TITANIC (which was guaranteed an Oscar sweep due to block voting from two studios) the much-superior LA CONFIDENTIAL was thrown a conciliatory bone which landed in Kim's lap... Again, she's just fine, but don't sit down to watch this thinking she's going to be the main attraction; she's really a lesser light in the picture.Anyway, it's interesting how rarely Tinseltown has ever managed to do a really captivatingly gossipy, warts-and-all (if fictionalized) expose on itself. But LA CONFIDENTIAL has succeeded in doing exactly that.I have essentially no complaints.Except, perhaps, for the Lana Turner scene: Turner was far too famous not to hire a model who more closely resembled her; as a result of not doing so, the moment is nowhere near as funny as it could've been.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
So THAT'S who Rollo Tomassi is!,"""L. A. Confidential"" was pretty good. A long time ago, some apartment neighbors loaned me their VHS copy of it for me to watch it because they were huge fans of it. I never did. As you can tell from the video format I brought up, it's taken me a long time for me to get around to viewing the thing.Worth it? Very much so. It's a big story with lots of big-time actors, so I like the ambition. But one has to remember that while Kevin Spacey, Danny DeVito, and Kim Basinger were movie stars in 1997, actors like the two leads, Russell Crowe and Guy Pearce, were not. There were a couple of noticeable inconsistencies in the production value that threw me off, like the outline of a squib visible on someone's forehead BEFORE they were shot in the head in one scene, but the whole thing moved well enough for me to overlook those errors. The acting also helped in allowing me to fall back into the story.I might want to see it again, now that I know what eventually the outcome will be, just so I can have more clarity on who did what and why. I believe this is of the noir genre, but I'm not sure. I just remember that this movie had a lot of attention on it the year it came out, while I was 19 years old and wowed by other movies like Good Will Hunting, Men in Black, and The Fifth Element.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
My first negative review,I normally write reviews for many movies... recently a lot of Korean cinema... simply because the score doesn't reflect the genius of the movie etc etc.With this however I am disappointed...it's a solid 7 and simply has a great cast...it grew on me but I was never blown away as I thought I would be after never getting around to watching it in my youth I am going back to those classic movies...I am not sure if I was won over by this...Maybe because I literally watched the negotiator (Samuel L Jackson) before and was disappointed with the low rating as it was a great thriller...I'm not sure but I just wasn't own away at all with this movie..,7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"Sexism, Police Brutality and Toxic Masculinity","Unfortunately this movie does not hold up and can't be considered a classic. It glamourizes sexism, objectification of women, police brutality towards black American men, gun violence and toxic masculinity through the male cop characters and more.Although the actors and acting is good, there are plenty of other crime/neo-noir films/scripts out there that are truly entertaining and not discomforting.

The story is multi layered and full of interlocking subplots that flow and play out with such clarity, you are almost depressed when the movie ends, because you simply don't want it to end!

The perfect film.,"You know how Wes Bentley's character is watching the drifting bag from video with Thora Birch in American Beauty? And he speaks of life and world being sometimes so beautiful, that he feels he can't take it. I get that feeling with watching L.A. Confidential. This is a beautiful movie. It really takes you to the 50's and gives you a warm feeling of film noir. I have to admit never reading the book, but actually that takes me to a better position to rate this film as a film and not a book adaptation. And it works. My god, how it works. The characters are so far from being boring, that you'd be thrilled if they actually could jump from the screen to real life.. hell, even the bad guys. Curtis Hanson finally showed us his real potential as a filmmaker, after the likes of The Hand That Rocks the Cradle and The River Wild. Those films were not bad (actually quite good), but in the end they were just ordinary thrillers. L.A. Confidential explores deeper. The plot is not one-dimensional and I really didn't see the twists coming a mile away. Throughout the film, every character is perfectly cast and they all should have been up for Oscars. Looking for an intelligent film? Look no further.***** / *****",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Basically, everyone is well cast and does a great job, I don't think that Kim Basinger was the best, although she was the only one to get an award. Of course, that's because it was up for awards the same year as Titanic, and thus it had no chance, even though it is such a better movie, it almost makes me retch to compare the two.

One of the best films of the '90s,"""L.A. Confidential"" is a great movie. This complex mystery-thriller set in 1950s Los Angeles has great acting, great directing, great writing, great just about everything. Here is one of those rare films that pulls you into the story and never lets go. I love it when a movie does that. The main storyline of ""L.A. Confidential"" is about a gruesome mass murder in a nearby diner that has connections with the corrupt L.A. police department. One of the men killed in the slaughter was an L.A. cop. The movie follows two different detectives who try to find who committed the crime and who is connected to it. Russell Crowe, and Guy Pearce portray the two detectives, both very different from each other. Crowe is Bud White, the really serious tough cop who doesn't mess around; Pearce is Ed Exley, the self-righteous cop who thinks he can rise above the sleaze in the department. Kevin Spacey also stars as another detective who works with a publisher of a sleazy tabloid played by Danny DeVito. James Cromwell is on hand as the detectives' police captain, and Kim Basinger gives an Oscar-winning performance as Lynn Bracken, the Veronica Lake look-alike call girl who becomes attached to the Crowe character. All these actors are superb here. Director Curtis Hanson does an outstanding job with the way he put this movie together. I was able to follow where this movie was going, and the Oscar-winning adapted screenplay (by Hanson and Brian Helgeland based on James Ellroy's novel) is compelling and brilliantly detailed. The sets and production design is another plus. The movie really looks like 1950s L.A. The cinematography, editing, and music score (by the great Jerry Goldsmith) are all first-rate (not to mention some good old classic songs). I loved everything about ""L.A. Confidential"". I think it's one of the top 10 best films of the 1990s.**** (out of four)",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
A cop drama that doesn't rely on car chases?!?!,"Yep, it's true. LAC is a good old fashioned cop drama/whodunnit with excellent performances from all the cast. It's difficult to imagine how such a great cast was assembled, but I'm glad they managed it. Though Crowe and Pearce were hardly superstars then, this film certainly did their respective careers no end of good.Things which make this a great cop film:1/ Eddie Murphy isn't in it.2/ There's no stupid ass wisecracks.3/ The acting is first rate from ALL the cast.4/ The plot is engaging.5/ It HAS a plot!To say much about the movie would tend to give away too much of the plot, so suffice to say its worth watching if you want your brain cells stimulated a little. One or two plot elements are a bit obvious, but as with any good film, this becomes something you wait for eagerly to confirm your suspicions, not something you just shake your head at sadly.Although there are no car chases, there is a first rate shootout towards the end of the movie which alone is worth watching the movie for. Add in the plot and great cast and you have a fantastic movie, well deserving of its place in the IMDb top 50.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
One of the Best Crime Films of the 90's. A classic Action Drama!,"I have watched this movie several times before today, and every time I watch it I just realize again how great this film is. This is actually a pretty famous movie, but somehow people don't really take notice of it. It's one of those movies you watched with your father years ago on VHS. You remember it being a good movie, but forgot how great it actually is until you watch it again years later. I really recommend this movie! Especially if you like movies about Organized Crime, Police Corruption & the Good Cop Bad Cop routine.LA Confidential is about three detectives of the corrupt LAPD (Big Surprise). Set in the 50s, they all use their own unique methods to uncover a conspiracy of a massacre that took place in an all night diner. What follows is a story with several twists and turns to expose who is behind this mysterious crime.The Cast also has a cool as hell, with Guy Pearce, Russell Crowe & Kevin Spacey playing the main detectives. Probably the coolest role Russell Crowe has ever played – A tough LA Cop who doesn't f**k around and beats the s**t out of anyone not playing by his rules.Kevin Spacey is awesome as always and even Guy Pearce (Momento, Ravenous) showed his acting skills & talents. He plays the good honest cop that wants justice and will always follow the correct procedures to get this. He and Russell then make the perfect Good Cop-Bad Cop team! The only lame part of this movie is Kim Basinger. I don't like her! She can't act and has an irritating face.But apart from this, it's a Classic Film. May be a tad long for some people (over 2 hours), but if you haven't seen this, it's a great film to watch of you are in the mood for a Crime Classic.I give it a 8.5 of out 10 just because the film's elements mix together so well.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"Could have been greater with a more credible, shorter story. Still a great detective, but has got the smell of a copycat of the brilliant ""Chinatown""...","Definitely worthwhile watching, but it aint a masterpiece. It's decently acted though. It is a dirty cop movie, that could have been greater if only it werent for some pretty lame, unbelievable plot turns.The good: the setting of this movie takes place in the fifties in LA, at the time of the big Hollywood glamour stars. The settings and scenery of the fifties in LA are being portrayed quite beautiful. More good: the actors are good. Simply straight good. And the story is quite suspenseful, fascinating and even thrilling at moments.The bad: it is basically a copycat of the brilliant seventies classic ""Chinatown"" with Jack Nicholson. That classic though is way better than this movie and the cheap smell of a copycat lingers in many scenes. A good copy of another movie is not a bad thing, but the script is lacking credibility in plot turns. And it simply lasts a bit too long. That's killing for a suspenseful movie, when you get bored..., but only at some moments, the majority of the movie is quite entertaining.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Stop calling every movie a masterpiece,"Is there any movie in the world IMDB crowd doesn't call a masterpiece? By calling every movie a masterpiece you guys cheapen the meaning of the word. Masterpieces are very rare and this movie is absolutely NOT a masterpiece. It's a pretty poor effort actually. This movie is only 2 hours long but it's so dragged and poorly constructed that you will feel like you've watched a 6-hour long movie when you are finished.The storytelling is so poor. Apart from the fact that the storyline is super cliched and already been done like 1000 times before, the story jumps all over the place, not to mention tons of plot holes, logical errors and inconsistencies that make turn the story into a cartoon. The movie tries too hard to look smart but it makes the opposite effect when it jumps all over the place and fails to tell its story. There is a difference between telling a complex story and jumping all over the place to a point where people can't even follow your story because it's simply incoherent. This movie falls in the latter category.And everyone seems to praise the acting but even that's pretty weak. Who came up with the idea that characters would be mumbling half the time? It's not good acting. It makes the whole movie unwatchable.

Not as great as it used to be,"L. A. Confidential opens with a pitch-perfect voice over narration by Danny DeVito, continues by showcasing the colorful, golden streets of L. A. in the mid 50's with terrific attention to detail in buildings, cars, hairstyle, costumes, interiors, etc., then continues with a terrific story that involves three policemen with very different backgrounds that are all involved in the same case. The case is the Night Owl Cafe murders where a giant bloodbath seems to have happened inside the cafe. One is in it because his partner was one of the dead bodies, another because he took the call and was first on the scene after the murders happened, the last because a blonde bombshell who has information is part of the other officer's case with this sleazy hitman who turns women into prostitutes. In addition, there's a love triangle between the blonde, the hard hitting cop who's partner was murdered and the young rookie cop who took the call. These parts drag to me. The scenes with Crowe and Basinger don't have much interest. I also don't know why the ending credits have black and white footage of a crime show called Badge of Honor which is discussed in the movie, but doesn't need added scenes during the credits.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Excellent,"This film is great from start to absolute finish. The interesting thing is that it is obviously set in Los Angeles; and I personally hate Los Angeles (I live here), but this is Los Angeles in a supernatural reality. There's nothing overtly fantastical about this movie, but its almost as if you imagine every villain in this movie to be a demon (and the villains aren't always cut and dried, even the ""heroes"" are suffering from some type of pathos). In terms of my favorite Russell Crowe movie, this is it. I can't remember if they actually describe him in the movie as being all brawn and no brain; but that exactly describes his character. This is the first movie that I ever saw Guy Pearce in, and I fell in love with his acting ability. Kim Basinger is great too, and her acting is ironically understated.

Hollywood in the best sense,"This is a Hollywood film in the best sense of the word, and in almost every sense of the word.  This is a triumph of taste, intelligence, craftsmanship, writing, direction, music, acting, design, in short, pretty much everything. There is not one bad thing I can say about this film.  Curtis Hanson and co-writer Brian Helgeland deserve a lot of credit for taking a complex novel and making it work on the screen, even though they had to cut a lot of good stuff out.  Hanson also pushes himself in the big leagues with his directing, because he really feels close to the material, whereas in his previous films, you just got the sense of a competent craftsman.  The acting is also sensational, and though I wasn't rooting for her to get the Oscar (I would have voted for Julianne Moore with BOOGIE NIGHTS), Kim Basinger gave an excellent performance, no matter what the negative comments here have said.  The standout, however, is Russell Crowe, who not only is frightening when Bud White blows up, but shows vulnerability without going maudlin.

Great 'western style' shootout in a good detective thriller!,"Even after twenty years the movie holds up well. It's entertaining with lots of action and the usual necessary plot twists. Russell Crowe and Kevin Spacey deliver outstanding performances well suited to their acting personas. As do Guy Pearce (Ed Exley) and James Cromwell (Captain Dudley Smith).The movie starts off slow and threatens to become just a glamorous 'film noire.' However, make it through the first hour and the plot develops well with plenty of action to keep one interested. (Yes, it's a long movie with a running time of two hours and twenty minutes!)Through a well crafted plot the film touches upon racism, corruption, politics and even gender issues. Characters develop well along with the plot; none can be judged on first impressions.If for no other reason, the movie is watchable simply for the shootout scene which comes late in the film.

Danny De Vito effectively reprises his slime-ball act from Taxi (TV series), and the supporting players are consistently great.The plot is cleverly-constructed and paced, and it's not until relatively close to the end that you get the final twist.

I also get incredibly frustrated by injustice and have done since my parents believed every word my sister said when we were kids and I was always unjustly blamed and punished for things I didn't do. But Exley's (Guy Pearce) determination to do the right thing makes this easier to watch. His desire to rid the force of corruption is admirable and I can get behind a character like that, so it's also weird that I found myself backing Bud White (Russell Crowe) too. He is not the most upstanding cop, but he does seem to have a desire for justice, if he deals with it in a different way.The story is very good, but I felt it could have been slower a bit and dumbed down for the likes of me that want to understand, in detail, what's going on. I can understand that it was probably already very long already.It's also produced well although the vocal soundtrack, as seems to be the norm these days, was very quiet, which doesn't help when they all whisper so much.All of the actors give a great performance.

There's plenty of action and it's intellectual without being in-your-face. And with acting by can't fail actors Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, Kevin Spacey... wow!!

The set pieces and cinematography effectively evoke the period. It recalls the great film noirs of the 1940s.

The L.A police Department has the head of the organized crime task force Capt.Dudley, James Cromwell, given the assignment to keep the city from having another Mickey Cohen take over the mob. Capt. Dudley does it with both ""swift and merciless"" justice in many cases not caring a lick about the law ,that he was sworn to uphold, to do it.Hard and brutal movie about a brutal time post-war L.A. With the city trying to clean up it's shoddy image by having, among other things, a Dragnet-like TV show ""Badge of Honor"" with L.A cop Det. Sgt. Jack Vincennes, Kevin Spacey, as the shows technical adviser. ""Badge of Honor"" shows how efficient and honest the city's cops are where at the same time in real life L.A has one of the worst records of police corruption of all the major cities in the United States. An epidemic of corruption that reaches into the very highest echelons of the city government and the District Attorneys office.Straight as an arrow cop, one of the very few on the force, Det. Ed Exley, Guy Pearnce, gets a call at the local precinct about a robbery at the Nite Owl Diner. With no one available he answers the call himself by driving over to see what he could do. What Exley didn't know at the time was that he would get caught up in not only a mass murder but a cover up of the killings. That cover up would go straight up to the LAPD office that's in charge of combating organized crime headed by the very highly decorated and greatly admired Capt. Dudley.The film ""L.A Confidential"" has both the clean cut and soft spoken Det. Exley and his rival on the force the brutal and Neanderthal-like Officer Bud White, Russell Crowe, end up working together to crack the Nite Owl murder case. This even after it was solved with Det. Exley getting all the credit and a promotion in solving it. White and Exley who had no use or love for each other slowly came to the realization that they were both being manipulated by forces beyond their control. With big time pimp and highly successful L.A businessman Pirice Patchett, David Stratharin, being one of those pulling the strings.Patchett running a high-class call girl operation called Fleur-de-lis has his hookers made to look like movie stars. One of them ended up among those murdered at the Nite Owl a Rita Heyworth-look alike named Susan Lefferts, Amber Smith. Also among the dead at the now-infamous eatery was Det.Sgt. Dick Stensland, Graham Beckel. Sgt. Stensland used to be Officer White's partner before he was drummed out of the department for abusing prisoners in his custody.Pinning the Nite Owl killings on a trio of inner city hoodlum Sugar Ray Cullins, Jeremiah Birkett, and his two partners in crime Louis Fontaine & Ty Jones, Salim Grant & Kareem Washington, had the case just about solved. Later with the three accused murderers escaping from the precinct lock-up and ending up shot and killed by the perusing cops, which included the now promoted Det.Let Exley, just about iced the case.It's then that strange things started to happen, with a number of former Mickey Cohen associates getting rubbed out, that Det. Sgt Vincennes began to check out the deceased and disgraced Det. Sgt. Slensland's record. Vincennes finds a number of cases that he was on back in 1939-41 that has him linked to Capt. Dudly and another drummed out of the department corrupt cop Leland ""Buzz"" Meeks,Darrell Sandeen. These decade old cases had to do with getting paid off by the Cohen mob to look the other way on their criminal activities. All this investigating on Det. Sgt. Vinceenes' part eventually lead to his murder.Everything started to crystallized before the Det. Sgt. Vincennes eyes in the mob-LAPD connection that now involves a massive and secret attempt to take over Mickey Cohen's criminal empire. An empire of gambling drugs prostitution and murder for hire,or Murder Inc, by non-other then elements in the LAPD itself! The crooked L.A cops used, when murder would blow their cover, the sleazy and powerful Pierce Patchett and equally squalid Hush-Hush magazine editor Sid Hodges, Danny DeVito, to do their dirty work. This involved Patchett's Fleur-de-lis call girls getting involved, and being photographed,with anyone who's a threat to the corrupt cops operations. One of those blackmail was non-other then the L.A District Attorney Ellis Loew, Ron Rifkin.Penetrating and powerful film with the beautiful Kim Besinger as Veronica Lake-Look alike Lynn Bracken getting involved with both Officer White and Det. Let. Exley. Both cops end up pooling their talents, of brute force and keen brains, to try to break the reign of terror and corruption that infiltrated the LAPD.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"A Thrilling Noire Thriller That Starts Off A Little Slow, But Fully Makes Up For It At The End","Pros:
1. The set and costume design are fantastic and thus create the 1950's setting superbly.
2. The action sequences are bloody, intense as well as having an appropriate noire feeling.
3. Russell Crowe (Bud White), Guy Pearce (Ed Exley) and Kevin Spacey (Jack Vincennes) deliver amazing performances.
4. The heart-palpitating score does an incredible job at increasing the tension and suspense.
5. The gore is really visceral, gritty and well-designed.
6. The comedy is placed appropriately and is able to produce laughs without becoming distracting.
7. The final shoot-out scene is mesmerising, brutal and serves as a fitting end to the story.
8. Dudley Smith (James Cromwell) is on the receiving end of a satisfying and ironic death.Cons:
1. During the close-up on Matt Reynolds' (Simon Baker) face after his throat got cut quite clearly shows him move.
2. The first act is a little too slow-paced and convoluted.
3. Somehow Bud White survives a should-be fatal shooting at the end.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Character Driven-great piece,"Hollywood is not known for great cinema like this. They could have ruined it, by casting more marketable names, but they didn't. They could have dumbed it, by explain everything that happened in every single scene, but they didn't. This is a wonderful piece driven by the characters. Hanson and Helgeland achieved a manageable story from a book that could never have been adapted in the wrong hands. The acting is just superb. I am still stewing about all the people upset or surprised that Leonardo DiCaprio did not get nominated, what about the lead male cast members of LA Confidential? Kevin Spacey was sublime, as usual. I mean, can this man give a bad performance? Methinks not! Russell Crowe was really impressive as the troubled Bud White (the only character with redeeming features in Ellroy's book). And, of course, Guy Pierce. He was excellent as the political animal, Ed Exley. I ranted and raved for months when Titanic beat LAC for the best picture Oscar! But an aside to Mr Cameron: ever heard of Character Development? Enough said! Best movie of the past 10 years, easy!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
A fine modern noir,"A fine modern entry in the film noir genre, served up good and dark. The plot has twists but it's understandable, and the moral shades of gray in three detectives shift nicely over the story, so if you're looking for something gritty, this may be your film. Police corruption, politicking, and brutality are all front and center, with my only complaint being that strongarm tactics to those being interrogated were embraced just a little too much. The script is otherwise very entertaining and tight, even managing to get a little humor tossed in. Unfortunately the femme fatale was replaced here with the old ""hooker with a heart of gold"" trope, underwritten for sure, and moreover Kim Basinger resembled Veronica Lake in hairdo only (similarly for the appearance of ""Lana Turner,"" though it was a funny moment). There is still a lot to love in the male roles though (Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, Kevin Spacey, and let's not forget James Cromwell), which are all complicated roles because of the way the investigations go, and each actor turns in a fine performance. Lots of fun with this, and considered a higher rating.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Does the book more than justice. Absolute Justice.,"Despite loving the film to bits, I was afraid that reading the book would leave me with the usual bitter aftertaste of having wasted a good written story to a decent series of images. Instead my infatuation with L.A.C. was confirmed page by page. The cast was almost perfect (if only a little too 'good' when compared with the original paper versions), the story simplified and made easier to follow without taking anything away from its dark, underworld charme, glamour and seediness alive and creepy as in J.Ellroy's novel.

Jam-packed with all the best crime drama elements,"""L.A. Confidential"" has it all: rebel cops, corrupt cops, two-faced killers, seductive women, drug-runners, prostitution, murder, set-ups, mystery, gun fights, suspense, brain-teasing twists and turns...the works. If that seems like too much crime drama stereotype for one film, let me assure you that it all works and it works well. That's why ""L.A. Confidential"" is hailed as one of the best films of the 1990s, though it should be seen as the precedent- setter for the crime drama-obsessed decade that followed it.The plot is too intricate to summarize briefly, but after LAPD cops and detectives beat up on several jailed Mexicans because the Mexicans had allegedly been responsible for the beating of two other cops, the bad press for the LAPD sets into motion a sequence of events that become further worsened when a massacre occurs at a coffee shop. Bud White (Crowe), Jack Vicennes (Spacey) and Ed Exley (Pearce) are all very different cops who go about investigating the case differently but end up closer to each other than they realize.""LAC"" can be viewed in two separate halves. The first hour feels like a film in itself and the second hour feels totally different until the ending ties the two together. The feeling you get is the film is long, especially because mystery-wise your brain has been working in overdrive if you like to try and figure things out. It's a wild ride, albeit a very good one.The acting is all phenomenal. Everyone plays terrific characters. The film was just the beginning for Crowe's leading roles, Spacey works his lovably hateable charm and Pearce really adds a different dimension to the cast as highly moral justice-driven cop. Even Kim Basinger as a woman involved with and caught up in this mystery seems to steal every scene that she's in with her beauty and poise.The only thing going against the film is at times it does feel over-the-top with all the plot lines going on, especially at the end, but at that point you're so caught up in the well-developed characters and their subsequent motives, as well as the mystery, that the feeling is easy to block out. Had it not been the first, it may not have been one of the best crime dramas of all time, but it certainly was and it deserves kudos for it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Simply of no interest,"I had a bad feeling about this one. Something told me I wasn't going to like it. And after 60 seconds it started my feelings were right. The movie starts with a narration. There is narrator speaking and I didn't understand anything. After 40 minutes I still had no idea what was going on. That is bad. It is not my fault if the storyline isn't well exposed. Ask Martin Scorsese how to keep a viewer glued to his seat with a narration (CASINO). So the story is either weak or non-existing. I hate movies that take place during the fifties because the actors in their swanky suits feel authorized to overact. I said actors? Who are they? How much charisma do they have?

A Noir Masterpiece That Still Stuns,"Going into L. A. Confidential, I was apprehensive. James Ellroy's novel is a sprawling, intricate masterpiece, and I worried that the film adaptation would inevitably fall short. Boy, was I wrong.Curtis Hanson's film is a stunning achievement, a gritty and unflinching dive into the underbelly of 1950s Los Angeles that captures the essence of Ellroy's novel while forging its own cinematic identity.The performances are simply breathtaking. Guy Pearce is mesmerizing as Ed Exley, perfectly capturing the character's internal conflict and simmering ambition. Russell Crowe is a force of nature as Bud White, raw and volatile yet strangely sympathetic. And Kevin Spacey, in one of his finest roles, embodies the cynical and jaded Jack Vincennes with chilling accuracy.But it's more than just the acting. The film is a visual masterpiece, with stunning cinematography that perfectly captures the seedy underbelly of 1950s Los Angeles. The screenplay is sharp and witty, capturing the essence of Ellroy's dialogue while maintaining its own cinematic flow.This is a film that stays with you long after the credits roll. It's a testament to the power of cinematic adaptation and a reminder that sometimes, a film can even surpass the book that inspired it.Rating: 9 out of 10 starsRecommendation: An absolute must-see for any fan of film noir.

Awesome,"I saw this movie on HBO because I thought nothing else was on. I was reluctant to see it because I usually don't watch cop movies. (I'm under 18, what can I say.  They don't market them for my age group) I couldn't have been more wrong. L.A. Confidential was awesome, very high on my list of good movies, because it was so well done.  The Los Angeles aspect was so distinct, which I appreciated even though I don't know anything about the 50s that isn't on Nick at Nite.  The acting was awesome too, enough that it should have been more recognized at the Oscars.  Everyone gives kudos to Spacey and he was great but I didn't consider him the main part of the film.  I thought that the acting of Guy Pearce and especially of Russell Crowe, stood out.  I thought Crowe had a stronger prescence then Pearce, but they were both good and I really wish that this movie would have been a jumping off point for their careers.  I really want to see more of them! Basinger was good too, worthy of her awards and worthy of a comeback.  I don't think this role was cliche for her because this time she played a blond with intelligence and motives and dimension. The script was great, with a few things that disturbed me and I accepted as part of the story.  The racism, characteristic of that era, and the corruption were effective enough to make me yell at the T.V. I thought people were kicking in doors too much, and shooting first/asking questions later. Lastly, the soundtrack was awesome.  The jazz sounds that played continuously throughout the film accented the story the way a soundtrack is supposed too. Many people compare this movie to films like CHINATOWN. I can't offer the same comparison because I haven't seen CHINATOWN and I don't know what it's about. But I think L.A. Confidential is a great movie without attaching it to a genre.

I feel like you could watch it a dozen times and would still pick up new things every time. The story gets quite complex and can be little overwhelming on first viewing I found. It doesn't take away from the film, but once you had a grip on where everyone is at and what their motives are then I think you could sit back and enjoy the nuances a lot better.

Elroy delivers: crisp characters and a classic noir plot,"L.A. Confidential is my top pick among American films of 1997, rating second only to Roberto Benigni's Life Is Beautiful.  Both movies can attribute their success to one person's efforts; in the case of L.A. Confidential, practically everything is owed to the story's original writer, James Elroy.Elroy crafted a sharp story around four excellent main characters and several notable multi-dimensional sub-characters.  Of the main characters, three protagonists and a central villain, each one had become a policeman for a different reason, each one was markedly different from the other (brought together only by crafty writing) and, with one exception, each steps disturbingly out of character at some point in the story.  It is by their stepping out that this movie is a classic film noir and not just another cop and gangster flick.I give the movie a 9 overall: 10 for the writing and 8's and 7's for everything else.  The director, partly as a co-screenwriter, commendably captured the era and added visual crispness to Elroy's story, but I will need to see more from him before I take notice of his own merit.  Likewise, the actors stepped neatly into their characters but do not especially stand out: Spacey's good, but better in Usual Suspects; Bassinger's surprisingly good, and most of the other actors were unremarkable. The writing, though, speaks for itself.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Possibly one of the best crime dramas ever made,"LA Confidential is simply a great movie.  It yeilds an award winning cast, superb plot, great action, and masterful art direction.  By art direction I mean the way that the movie really does seem to take place in 1953.  The costumes and hairstyles, the car models and years, the intense Los Angeles background, etc.  It all comes out to make the movie have a great and unique image.  Many compare the image of LA Confidential to that of The Untouchables.  One major flaw: LA Confidential was a serious picture with great charcaters while Untouchables had those charcaters who had that whole comical image about them, like the bookman at the end, or Capone's cliched groupies who pretty much seemed like they came directly from an old Dick Tracy cartoon clip.  Besides the sincere and successful image, the plot is absolutely superb, nearly perfect.  It combines deep and confusing mystery with a great dramatic story of cops.  Besides the plot, the cast is great too.  Kevin Spacey, one of my favorite actors, functions very well as the fame hungry and funny cop Jack ""Big V"" Vincennes.  Guy Pearce, featured in the great thriller Memento, is a very good newcomer who plays the by the book Ed Exely.  Also, Russel Crowe is great as the violent but principled cop Wendell ""Bud"" White.Altogether, LA Confidential is a great movie.  It is definitely one of the best movies made in the 90's and possibly the best ploce drama ever.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Simple and the truth,"In a crazy hollywood world of special effects and huge budgets which normally overrun, this film looks so effortlessly made that it brings us an amazing slice of real(even though its in the past) life. All the performances in my opinion were oscar worthy especially that of an exciting new actor called Russell Crowe as he was virtually unknown when this film came out. The plot and relevant subplots are intertwined so well you wont notice them until the film has finished and you realise that the true evil has been staring you in the face. The ability to control so many mini plots at once without losing the audience is an amazing gift that is on display as all are equally interesting and equally important to the main story. when the film finishes you will stare at the screen and simply say wow!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Classy,"L.A. Confidential is a very impressive movie, indeed. Based on a marvellous novel by the great James Ellroy, this film establishes an incredibly convincing atmosphere and environment which in itself is an achievement. But this film doesn´t stop with that, like many other 40´s gangster-films do.

"cool, concise and brilliantly crafted","This is one of my favourite films of all time; the best detective movie ever! Russel crowe, Kevin spacey and James Cromwell play the coolest cops ever and Guy Pearce does an equally fantastic job as the uptight 'to the book' cop. The film starts off by showing each of the cops specific techniques of dealing with problems; Bud white (Crowe) has a major dislike for women abusers and believes they should be punished severely. Ed Exley (Pearce)is an uptight man who wears glasses, very unpopular amongst the police. As the film is set in the 1950's at the time of rising film/ t.v. stars there is the 'commericial' cop; Jack vincennes (Spacey) perhaps the best character. And the Legendary James Cromwell as Lt.Dudley Smith the boss, I won't say more. After a mass shooting in a diner (the nite owl) possible leads shoot off in every direction as the 3 detectives search for the rest of the pieces to the puzzle. As the story builds a look a like call girl (Kim Basinger) falls into the plot and so too does talkative press man and friend of Jack vincennes (Danny Devito, who also narrates). The screenplay has both clever plot twists and; flash dialogue, characters and setting. The plot twists and characterisation is on par with the usual suspects but with one difference; L.A. confidential is always; 'Off the record, on the QT and very Hush Hush'",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Although I get the impression it wasn't a huge stretch.Basinger (the films lone acting Oscar nominee/winner) showed range we didn't know she had. This was her best performance.Spacey played his usual great role. He seems to adapt to any role perfectly.Strathairn did an excellent job too. A quiet support.Pearce had his best role here too. He looked a little too 'goody-goody' though.Crowe gave his all, but I think Michael Madsen (the original choice for Bud White) would have been better.

Kevin Spacey too gives a performance which warrants his being taken more seriously in the future - his demise is one of the high points containing as it does the clue that leads to the denouement so pay attention as it happens because it is a shocker.

Aussie boys done good!,"As an Australian I waited with baited breath to see LA Confidential.Russell Crowe is one of my favourite actors in spite of the fact that he has made only one or two decent films.  I refer to Proof and now, LA Confidential.Guy Pierce was also going to be an interesting prospect.  Apart from the awful soap opera Neighbors, he has only ever done one major motion picture and that was ""...Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"".  A truly dreadful film that must surely be an embarrassment for both drag queens and Australians (in general) alike.Well, how good were they!?  Truly excellent!  I walked out of the cinema feeling as if I'd just watched the greatest film of all time.  You can appreciate how I feel.  These two Australian boys are the STARS of a classic American cop drama.  I expected them to be supporting players so imagine how stunned I was when I realised that they were the heros!Kevin Spacey was excellent (surprise us!) and James Cromwell again proved that he has been in hiding for far too long.  Incidentally, the other night I saw a very young James Cromwell on an old Barney Miller rerun!LA Confidential is a great film, a classic of the nineties.  Having subsequently read the book I can honestly say that Curtis Hanson's achievement in bringing this sprawling epic to the screen is nothing short of amazing!  They cut out enough material for three more movies but retained the distilled essence of the book.Honestly, I could talk for hours about this film.  I won't, though.  You can go now.  I'm going to watch the video and wave a little Australian flag during the toilet bowl/window/DA scene.  On second thoughts, no.

"""...And very hush-hush!""","Among other things, what most amazes me about ""L.A. Confidential"" is that the film is just as relevant today as it was ten years ago. I don't know if the filmmaker's objective was to make a statement, but the piece, set in the 50's makes one that still bothers people everyday: the lack of justice in this unfair world. It does it with some clichéd moments and with the necessary amount of action; but with an intelligence uncommonly used these days.""You have to think while watching this film"", my friend Matias said to me; angry, stopping me every time I said something. Actually, you don't really have to pay close attention during ""L.A. Confidential"", because it's such a kind film that it expertly explains everything in a couple of crucial moments; but if you choose to follow it step by step, it will be a tough ride for you, viewer.David Fincher's ""Zodiac"" premiered this year and it is, ten years later, a classy version of Curtis Hanson's violent and rough way of presenting his film. Yes, it's not the same story and Fincher's movie is set in San Francisco, but what ""L.A. Confidential"" essentially shares with it is the genre connection (besides the closeness in periods of time). If you watch ""Zodiac"" and afterwards ""L.A. Confidential"", you'll notice the elegance of the first and the less careful conditions of the second; where the streets are predominant and the rules don't matter so much.Only one guy follows them closely. He is Edmund Exley (Guy Pearce), an ascending policeman who plays it by the book and would even tolerate the rejection of his colleagues to get where he wants. Bud White (Russel Crowe) is the opposite, with 'brutality' as a second name and a weakness for abused women; and Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) stands in the middle, resolving cases but getting paid for it by a reporter (Danny DeVito) who wants to be the first to know every scoop; in a time where fifty dollars meant a lot of money.These three men (with names presented in big letters and that we never forget) are tangled up together in the resolution of a case in which nothing is what it seems. Of course that the men as I sort of stereotypically describe them, are not what they seem either; as almost everything in this Los Angeles where you ""can't live if you're born without wings"". This phrases and other are found in Curtis Hanson and Brian Helgeland's beautiful screenplay, based on the novel by James Ellroy.I think what makes ""L.A. Confidential"" such an effective movie in the way that you are filled with adrenaline and excitement can be explained in two parts. The first one: the combination between Helgeland, one of the most talented and versatile writers of contemporary cinema; and Hanson, a versatile director who's proved to be committed with every kind of genre. This decade, he's made a real-life tale (""Wonder Boys""), a family story (""In her Shoes""), a music underdog tale with rapper Eminen (""8 Mile"") and a rom-com (""Lucky You""). The first three are very good pieces, the fourth I still have to watch it. This combination of versatility paved a way for something original and fresh.We don't get movies like ""L.A. Confidential"" today. At least not in that genre, with that intelligence and with those performancesThe character actor Kevin Spacey; so convincing, so powerful and relaxed, so intense, so himself. Would you pay attention to his face? Please, it's unique. Guy Pearce, also so full of character and unique as well; and Russell Crowe, I haven't written about him but he's great and I'll write more when I write about ""Gladiator"" someday.There are some more actors that I haven't mentioned, but I believe pleasure in cinema arrives when you watch things you don't previously know or expectTry to make of ""L.A. Confidential"" one of those movies, because it was for me; and it was great.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"Brilliant, powerful, gripping","A top-notch dark drama of crime and corruption, ""LA Confidential"" is one of the most memorable films of the 1990s, thanks to an intelligent and cliche-free script, good direction, and superb acting.  I'd have to single out Kevin Spacey, who is great in everything (he even redeems ""Outbreak"" from total mediocrity, overshadowing Dustin Hoffman).  Here, he truly shines as Jack Vincennes, an urbane, charming, cynical, somewhat corrupt cop struggling with his conscience.  Almost as outstanding is Danny DeVito as the sleazy tabloid journalist Sid Hudgins.  Kim Basinger gives her subtlest and most nuanced performance ever as Lynn, the call girl made to look like Veronica Lake.  Russell Crowe is excellent as Bud White, the brutish but good-hearted cop, and Guy Pearce gives an utterly convincing and often mesmerizing performance as Edmund Exley, the police officer who starts out as a self-righteous, priggish, ice-cold careerist and then becomes a man of true moral conviction who also has humanity and compassion.  In a lesser but crucial role, James Cromwell is very good as Captain Dudley Smith.The plot was somewhat convoluted, and sometimes it was hard to understand how the characters grasped connections between things that weren't so readily apparent.  However, the film remained suspenseful throughout.  (In a key moment, the identity of the villain is revealed in an act so swift and unexpected that you're guaranteed to jump!) The suspense is well balanced by humor.  What is also impressive about ""LA Confidential"" is the character development.  Exley, White, and Vincennes really grow as human beings in the course of the film, and these changes are conveyed not only through the dialogue and through their actions but also, particularly in Exley's case, through body language and demeanor.  (I don't understand why Guy Pearce isn't getting more good roles!)Truly a wonderful film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Spacey again delivers a brillant performance in a postmodern film noir genre. The storyline shocks everybody but follows the conventions right to the wire.

Brotherhood of cops noir,"Sometimes Cops can thing they are above the law and thus comes about police brutality. But this movie shows up is the limit and what is right and wrong in order to get the job done and taking down the bad guys. This is noir done right with some great storytelling. It really does get down to the dirty aspect to the police force back in the early 50's and has enough grime and grit to intrigue most audiences that is into this type of genre. Even if your not into this types of genre, it's still a movie that should be watched by anyone at least once. The story revolves around 3 police offices one who is a smart and yet not willing to bend when it comes to the law no matter what and is a bit of a snitch. Also sometimes he comes off as a character that cares about the image he thinks up for himself than actual integrity. The second is a hot tempered cop that is willing to get his hands a bit dirty in order to get the job done and unleashes his own person justice. The third is a selfish cop that only care about himself and nothing really matters as long as he reaps the benefits and there is a payoff. The movie will have the audiences attention because it's entertaining with it's intelligent investigation and put together well without it being way too convoluted, the way it's all connected is integrated in a way where you can't help but pay attention to what is going on. And the audiences are going to have to pay close attention to the investigation to get the most out of this movie. The dialogue is also sharp and the acting performances are the same as well. I was looking forward to seeing how every piece of the of puzzle is gonna be made at the end. And the ending is good and the puzzle to the investigation is put together almost brilliantly.

Sometimes betrayal is the only option.,"As a film of an unfilmable novel this is somewhat of an achievement. As a film per se it is very nearly a masterpiece. When I read ""L.A. Confidential"" it was my first venture into Mr James Ellroy's seriously weird world where much of the enjoyment is in the idiosyncratic writing style.I never imagined a movie could be made of the book and,of course,it hasn't been.What we have is the title,some of the characters and a severely pared down plot that bears a resemblance to the novel but fails to capture Mr Ellroy's bizarre voyage to the distant shores of obsessive sexuality.""The book is mine....the movie is theirs"",he said when invited to comment on the screen adaptation. So forget the novel then and watch ""L.A. Confidential"" THE cop movie of the 1990s.Set in the early fifties when cops were tough and the third degree was commonplace it depicts an LAPD that had become judge and jury in its own bailiwick.It's a story of loyalty and betrayal involving cops,reporters,lawyers and crooks.It's a film of extreme violence,much of it played out in the unnaturally bright and sunny L.A. hills. Mr Kevin Spacey has been lauded for his rather flashy role as Sgt Jack Vincennes but for me the performance of the movie is Mr Russell Crowe's as Bud White the not very bright but shrewd thuggish detective. He is easy meat for the manipulative Dudley Smith (Mr James Cromwell) but his Achilles Heel is a sympathy for abused women,and at the same time it is his salvation.Of all the actors in the movie only Mr Crowe looks as if he belongs in his character's clothes.Bud's sports jacket and casual trousers look suits Mr Crowe as to the manner born while the rest of the cast appear too conscious of the fact that they are wearing ""1950s clothes"" rather than simply clothes. There is a lot of good period detail including an appearance by Gerry Mulligan and Chet Baker(the coolest of the cool) lookalikes. Everyone involved is eventually confronted with a dilemma concerning loyalty.How these interlock and how they are resolved is the key to this movie.In the end it all comes down to one question.Is betrayal ever an acceptable option?""L.A.

"Off the record, on the QT, and very. Hush hush.","That sums up the epitome of L.A. Confidential. It presents to us the sordid realism of the early 50's, in the way we haven't seen it. Most of us are used to the sugary `Gene Kelly/ Rock Hudson' sunshine utopia that was, in the MGM `Golden Age'. L.A. Confidential shows us the gritty, seedy underworld of this period. And a brilliant job it does aswell. This deft, elegant portrait succeeds on every level.The stars are well suited to their roles and present their own unique styles. Guy Pearce is brilliant as the smart, thinking detective while Russell Crowe delivers equal oomph as the polar opposite to this; the tough no nonsense brood. Kim Basinger won an Oscar for her performance and rightfully so. She not only resembles but also mimics the `50's slut' to great effect. The only person who didn't stand out was Kevin Spacey. He didn't do much with his role, was highly unmemorable and gave a very vague performance. He's more of a decoration than the main star. Danny Devito is short and annoying in the usual `seedy journalist' style, but still very convincing.The opening documented narrative sequence establishes the film's unique style and slick dissection of life. The film's direction is never less than superb. The editing, settings and cinematography are top notch. Add on to this a great script and you have a classic. Perhaps it is a bit overrated, but it is also undeniably compelling.Overall, `L.A. Confidential' is a brilliant film. 8.3/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Some good things that I recall right now about this movie......Excellent character interactions....very good character build-ups especially of Guy Pearce........The bloody Christmas scene was greatly done by camera(I think it was a challenge for the camera to find the perfect spots in that narrow passage). Russell Crowe was just perfect character. Each crime scene had very good camera introduction. ""Rollo Tomasi"" was probably an original concept, because I never saw this particular verbal identification of such type of criminals in any other movies.

I love it!,"In the riveting narrative of the Nite Owl coffee shop mass murder, three distinct law enforcement officers find themselves on an inevitable collision course with the pervasive corruption their investigation exposes, as well as with each other.Bud White (Russell Crowe), characterized by his volatile nature, readily resorts to physical force, a reflection of his lack of faith in his own intellect. Edmund Exley (Guy Pearce), a principled do-gooder, strictly adheres to the rulebook, regardless of the unpopularity it brings among his fellow officers. Meanwhile, Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey), a high-rolling consultant on a television show, revels more in the prestige of his position than in the actual pursuit of police work.As the layers of the mystery unravel, their collaboration becomes increasingly imperative for solving the case. The ensemble cast, including Danny Devito as the sleazy tabloid figure Sid Hudgens, David Straithairn as the unscrupulous pornographer Pierce Morehouse Patchett, and Kim Basinger as the tough-edged love interest Lynn Bracken, adds an extra layer of brilliance to this compelling tale.I must say that this was one of my all-time favorites. The pacing is exceptional, and the mystery at the core of the plot is satisfyingly resolved. The top-tier acting and great cast make it all the more enjoyable.

Blown away by this movie!,"For some reason I resisted seeing this movie when it was originally released.  I'm not a fan of crime drama or movies about policemen, police departments, detectives.... you get the picture.  So I had no desire to see it.The only reason I bought L.A. Confidential is because it starred Russell Crowe not because it was on anyone's Top Ten list.   ( I could watch Russell Crowe reading the label of a cereal box and be perfectly content).Wow!  What a splendid surprise.  This movie has it all - intricate plot twists, a love story, more than a touch of comedy, a ""whodunnit"" theme throughout the story, fantastic fight scenes and shoot-outs (Bruce Willis, eat your heart out).Crowe and Spacey are outstanding in this movie as is Guy Pearce.    As sleazy as these three were - each in his own unique sleazy way - I ended up caring immensely about them.Three scenes stand out:The ""Lana Turner"" scene with Spacey is a classic.   I love Spacey's facial expressions.  He doesn't have to say a word....just look at the face. Loved it!Russell Crowe's scene where he's standing in the rain crying - convincing! Very convincing.  Don't know any other actor who could have pulled that off. Oh Russell!  You are marvelous in every way.Guy Pearce's scene where the Captain says ""Rollo Tomasi"" is the third scene that I watched again and again.

One of the top 20 films of the 90's,"""Rollo Tamasi is the reason I became a cop. I wanted to catch the guys who thought they could get away with it. It's supposed to be about justice.""L.A. Confidential was a very pleasant surprise. I had been waiting a long time for a crime drama like this one and somehow I had never been able to see this classic film from 1997. They don't make crime dramas like they used to in the 90's anymore. L.A. Confidential belongs in the same rank as Se7en, The Usual Suspects, and Heat in my opinion. Unfortunately, in the last decade this genre has faded away. This is director Curtis Hanson's best film and despite directing many more movies in the last decade they have been decent or misses. None of his films compare to the set and mood he's established here with LA Confidential. The film is full of suspense, thrills, and has several twists along the way. This is just the kind of film I love to see. The performances were also all really strong thanks to a spectacular cast and a fabulous adapted screenplay written by Hanson and Brian Helgeland (42, Man on Fire, Mystic River). The script was adapted from James Ellroy's crime novel and it incorporates several true events from the 1950's crime world in L.A. Fans of film noir and crime thrillers will be in for a treat here because this is a really special movie and it deserves all the awards it has received because this is a very satisfying film. The last hour of this thriller is really intense and will leave you at the edge of your seat. The build up is also very satisfying because the characters and events are all well developed.The film takes place in LA during the early 50's right after the arrest of the well known gangster, Mickey Cohen. The LA police department is as popular as ever thanks to this arrest and a TV drama glorifying them. They are prepared now to face the war over the control of the drug trade that Cohen's arrest has provoked. Among the best men in the department we have the hot headed cop, Bud White (Russell Crowe) who is willing to do what it takes as long as the guilty pay for their crimes. He's extremely sensitive towards abused females and is ready to punish the criminals. Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) on the other hand is always looking for fame considering he's a consultant for the cop TV show. Jack has close ties with Sid Hudgens (Danny DeVito) a magazine editor who makes deals with him to cover some high profile arrests after setting up their victims. Then there is the promising young officer Edmund Exley (Guy Pearce) who does things by the books and has impressed the DA and high officials for his smarts. Exley is ambitious and is looking for a big arrest in order to climb the ranks. These three men despite being very different from each other will have to join forces if they want to solve the brutal crime that has just taken place near a local cafe. Their main suspect is the millionaire, Pierce Patchett (David Strathairn), who runs a sort of high profile prostitution net involving Hollywood star look a like hookers. One of these hookers, Lynn Bracken, is played by Kim Bassinger and begins to be romantically involved with Bud. James Cromwell plays a supporting role as one of the Sergeant's in the police department.This film received 9 Academy Award nominations including best picture and director, but only won two (Kim Bassinger for best supporting actress and Hanson for best adapted screenplay). There is something unique about this film despite the fact that the subject matter has been dealt with before a million times (corrupt cops and gangsters) and I think it has to do with the fact that there is no main character here. All three officers have the same amount of screen time and they all kind of play out like anti heroes. They are not your usual heroic cops, instead they are all flawed but easy for the viewer to identify with and root for. I was interested in what was going to happen to each one of the characters in this film. There are good enough twists for the audience to enjoy this film based on the action alone, but the performances from Spacey, Pierce, and Crowe are all so good that they just elevate this film and take it to an entire other level. Basinger is really good here as well, but I don't think she was better than the male actors in this film. L.A. Confidential is one of the best crime dramas I've seen thanks to a great script, some incredible performances, memorable characters, and a lot of thrills. This film is a must see.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Great film,"I've heard of this film for many years of course, and now I watched it finally I can't believe it took me so long to get around to it. It really is a classic. Great actors, great plot. The characters are widely different and compliment each other to an extraordinary level. I don't know if I'd say the plot has twists and turns but gee it certainly develops as the movie progresses on; perhaps I'd say it evolves into something just awesome. There were a very many characters and names in the film, and at times I had to concentrate to follow who was who and did what, but a small price to pay. I'd say each and every actor were perfect for the role they played. Anyway, no hints or spoilers about the film, I barely read up on it and it was worth the watch.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Modern classic,"One of my favorite films of the last 20 years. No more than one or two weak notes in the whole film. Crowe's performance was, I think vastly underappreciated--he makes his character's animalistic ferocity something terrible to behold. Pearce is solid, Spacey is great as always, and Cromwell was terrific. Danny DeVito provides some comic relief. And of course, Basinger was beautiful, in a role perhaps somewhat overrated. The script crackles, the scenery and background music pitch perfect. A movie that improves upon repeated viewings.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Fabulous casting,"As an Australian there was nothing more pleasing than watching L.A. Confidential and seeing two fine Australian actors doing their best. Russel Crowe has been around for ages and has played a neo-nazi skinhead in Romper Stomper (the movie that was the inspiration for the recent American History X), a jackeroo(something similar to a cowboy), a gay builder, also the pyscho computer creation in Virtuosity. It shows he has a huge range and is capable of the tough guy and also the soft guy both of these talents which were utilized superbly in this movie, in fact not being biased in any way I thought he gave easily the best performance of the movie and was unlucky not to see more recognition for this.There was also Guy Pearce who greatly shocked me in this movie, his acting credits include the soapie Neighbours and then a dud movie Dating the Enemy, as well as his role in The Adventures of Priscilla Queen of the Desert. Up until L.A. I had been less than impressed by his acting but in this movie he just blew me away. In particular the interrogation scene which was one of the highlights of the movie.The reason why I enjoyed this movie is that they chose actors who suited their roles from the book, and did not change them to make a star vehicle (for example the gross corruption of the book Just Cause when turned into a movie which was destroyed by grave casting errors as well as some terrible direction), it gave this film an integrity that is so lacking from most Hollywood movies",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
One of the best crime films of the 90s,"L.A Confidential is a film full with great performances as one might well expect from such a brilliant ensemble cast. Kevin Spacey, Guy Pearce and Russell Crowe are all terrific as three very different L.A. cops. Exley (Pearce) is the college graduate who truly believes in doing good and that there is a right way to act as a police officer, Vincennes (Spacey) is almost a celebrity cop with a job as an adviser on a fictional TV cop show and an arrangement with Sid Hudgens (Danny De Vito)of Hush-Hush magazine who will frequently be there to take pictures of Vincennes arresting a film star for drug possession. Finally there is Bud White (Russell Crowe) who is the tough guy, who gets his results by strong arming suspects.Director Curtis Hanson recreates 1940s Los Angeles very believably and the film is consistently well shot. Its pacing is also pitch perfect, there is hardly a line wasted, every scene moves the plot along. To say that Hanson paces the film perfectly is no small complement, having adapted the story from a fairly long novel by James Ellroy which has a complex plot with many characters and yet after just over two hours the film ends and there is no sense that anything has been left out or that the film is anyway incomplete. L.A. Confidential will hold your attention from start to finish.The plot itself has some basis in real events such as the acts of police brutality in the holding cells on Christmas Eve and the murders of a group of people at the Nite Owl. To say any more about the story would be to spoil it but suffice to say you'd do really well to see where it's going.The characters of the three police officers all undergo some transformation as the film progresses and all three actors handle it brilliantly with special kudos going to Pearce in the main role as Exley learns a great many tough lessons, including some about himself. No review of this film would be complete without at least a mention of Kim Basinger's performance, she easily holds her own in her scenes with Crowe and Pearce and that Oscar is well deserved.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
good cops take on bad cops,"This is one of the best films I've ever seen because it was so good. It was based on an old story, but was done differently from all the others. The picture followed 3 policemen as they went about their duties; one by the book, the other 2 somewhat sordidly. All became involved with a cadre of rogue cops who were using the police force as a cover for criminal behavior. An unforgettable and well choreographed shoot-out capped this excellent movie. 5 stars.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
The Last Great American Film,"If not for a film about a ship hitting an iceberg and going down L.A. Confidential would have been a sure-fire Academy Award Best Picture winner. The best part of the movie is Kim Basinger winning a Best Supporting Actress for her role as a Veronica Lake lookalike hooker and Russell Crowe as a fearsome cop who finds a surprising capacity for love.The genius of the film is the three inter-related stories (hookers cut to resemble movie stars, missing heroin and a murder investigation) in LA of the early 1950's. Cops, hookers, corrupt politicians and gangsters all touch each others lives and in the tabloid press in surprising ways.The acting is terrific with James Cromwell, Kevin Spacey, Guy Pierce and Danny DeVito all selling their souls for ambition - and the price to be paid; deserved or not. The costumes and set design are first rate. If you like film noir, or just love well-crafted movies you'll have to look hard to find a better film.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

A truly classic film,"When i first saw L.A. Confidential, i was simply blown away by it. Nothing about this movie is less than perfect. The cast is terrific, particularly Russell Crowe and Guy Pearce. Curtis Hanson's direction is masterful as is his Oscar-winning script co-written by Brian Helgeland. The story, based on James Ellroy's novel is multi-layered and very engrossing, involving crime and corruption in 1950s L.A. This movie captures perfectly the look and mood of that time and place. From the opening scene to the very end, i sat there glued to the screen. I can't recall ever getting as lost in a film as I did with this one. I have watched it many times and it never gets tired. L.A. Confidential is certainly one of the greatest films ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
An excellent modern crime movie,"L. A. Confidential is one of the greatest modern movies about corruption and crime. It was very violent at its time, and even with the ramped-up sensationalism during the past twenty-five years, it's still violent by today's standards. It still has twists and turns you won't see coming (if you're watching it for the first time), and Curtis Hanson's dark direction still blends modern with old-fashioned noirs. Even if you're watching it for the fifteenth time, there's still a lot to notice and appreciate.There was a blend of established stars (Kevin Spacey, Kim Basinger, Danny DeVito, and James Cromwell) to balance the almost entirely new leading men, Guy Pearce and Russell Crowe. The meat of the story obviously appealed to men, with the violent subject matter, and the only female in the cast being a prostitute. But when the young Australian hunks on the screen dazzled American ladies for the first time, there was an awful lot of appeal to the female audience as well. Whether you prefer the volatile Russell whose temper sometimes protects and sometimes harms, or the disciplined, intelligent, righteous Guy with a ridiculously strong jaw, you'll have plenty of eye candy. It's tough to decide! I wound up dating someone who looked just like Guy (even down to the glasses), so naturally, I'll be on Team Russell forever.But back to the movie: with an unsettling (though not exactly original) theme by Jerry Goldsmith, a script that moves quickly and forces you to use your brain, and messages that resonate during the 1950s, 1990s, or now, it's an excellent film that belongs at the top of every list.Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to violence, I wouldn't let my kids watch it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"L.A. Confidential is up there with Chinatown of the best neo-noir films, an interesting story with well written characters","L.A. Confidential is a neo-noir crime film directed, produced and co-written by Curtis Hanson. It's based on a critical acclaimed novel with the same name, and the story follows a group of LAPD officers in 1953 as they investigate a series of murders with their own brand of justice, also its police corruption and city is a major part of the movie. The film leans heavily into the noir aspect, and stays true to the era with authenticity and a realistic tone.
Curtis Hanson's work shows as the directing and visual storytelling along with the screenplay its simply amazing. The cinematography and producing design too.The ensemble cast has actors like Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, Kim Basinger, James Cromwell and Danny DeVito. Everyone brought their best, and phenomenal acting performances came out of it.Jerry Goldsmith's musical score is a phenomenal and memorable soundtrack that hits just right, edited right to make the scenes even more exciting and keeps it mysterious.The movie was nominated for nine Academy Awards, including Best Picture. It won one for Best Supporting Actress (Basinger) and another for Best Adapted Screenplay. It should have gotten more wins but that's only my opinion, it's simply a fantastic film and among the best crime films I have seen and is up there with Chinatown of best neo-noir films. It does everything right in that genre, and it's re-watchable.
L.A. Confidential to me is a film everyone should watch at least once because of how well made it is, from the way it looks to how it's written, everything is superb. Curtis Hanson's Magnum Opus.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Great Script,"I love this movie. it has a very, very good script. There is a wonderful Set-ups and pay off. I didn't read the novel, and I don't feel i should do, the movie is just fine. I liked the most is the three main characters in the movie, We almost know everything about them in a few scenes. I noticed the way they changes step by step so the ending would be understandable easily. i was amazed by the craft and the way the screenplay was written. I still watch this movie to learn a lot about the screenplay. Very Good indeed. i think we should treat this movie as a new-noir, and we can notice that from the mood of the movie, the characters, the mix of right and wrong in them. i think there is a link between this movie and ""Chinatown"", it contain the same theme, and i mean the same city, the small crimes that leads to BIG crimes.

Rollo Tomasi!!,"Basically, the plot goes like this ... 3 cops, one shoot-out and a lot of twisted side plots that had me completely and utterly confused.That said, I did actually like this film, and actually understood it at the end.

However, I still have no idea why Kim Basinger won the Oscar ... her role wasn't very significant and she didn't play it that well.I think that Guy Pearce or Kevin Spacey should have been nominated instead - Guy Pearce played the goody goody snitch who was always bullied by the other cops [altogether now - aaaaaaaaw] and Kevin Spacey played the ""celebrity"" cop, who I thought was just so damn cool that he should have been in the movie a lot more. And he was the only cop who was nice to Guy Pearce!The only thing that really did spoil the movie was the fact that there were too many different plots all interwoven and only tied up at the end - such as the prostitution, the Nite Owl killings, the drugs etc. But it was a whole lot better than Titanic.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
No question...brilliant!!!,"Well LA CONFIDENTIAL is a suspense tornado of lies and deceit that revolves around three very different police officer personalities. Officer Bud White is the brutish personality who doesn't feel he is very smart, so he forces the hand of whoever stands in his way. Sgt. Jack Vincennes is all Hollywood. Mr. Showbiz. He doesn't even dress like a police officer. Lastly, there's Sgt. Ed Exley, a clean cut college educated character looking for promotions. Exley understands the politics of police work in Los Angeles. I must say that L.A. Confidential is better than TITANIC(I think it is).If you haven't seen the film, and wonder, is it really that good, the answer is simply YES. This could be the best cop movie ever.

One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made. A Classic Crime Drama/Film-Noir/Thriller/Mystery.,"L.A Confidential is one of the best films ever made that mixes great direction,wonderful characters and a excellent screenplay. It's not only one of the best films of the 90s,but of all-time,a classic of Film-Noir and Crime Drama and one of my favorite movies.Based on James Ellroy's novel and set in Los Angeles,California in the early 1950s,L.A Confidential tells the story of three L.A.P.D cops Jack Vincennes(Kevin Spacey),Wendell ""Bud"" White(Russell Crowe)and Edmund J. Exley(Guy Pierce)who are all different kinds of police officers and had nothing in common. Jack does it for the fame,Bud does it for fear and brutality and Edmund does it to rise above the ranks and live up to his legendary Father who was also a cop. But when one of their own is murdered in a coffee shop robbery,the three cops must come together and solve the case that's filled with twists and turns.L.A Confidential is a brilliant,classic film that was kind of overlooked and underrated in 1997. Despite doing well at the box-office,receiving critical acclaim and being nominated for 8 Oscars and winning two L.A Confidential was overshadowed by James Cameron's blockbuster Titanic. But thankfully L.A Confidential's reputation has grown and the film has become a classic and rightfully so because this film is one of those movies is that if you watch it on television or DVD you never turn it off and you are glued to the screen. One of the many reasons L.A Confidential is a great film is because of the way the film shows Los Angeles in the early 1950s,because when people think of L.A in the 50s they think movie stars,palm trees,beaches and sunny skies. But L.A.C gives viewers a dark world filled with intrigue and Mystery where L.A is surrounded by a dark and bleak underbelly of violence,sex,drugs and police corruption,selling a false and fake image of L.A as a beautiful paradise,but the L.A in this film is far from a paradise showing 1950s Los Angeles and how it really was the way people in L.A knew about but people outside of L.A didn't really know of. L.A.C is a Film-Noir in the truest since with the characters actions that are harsh and sometimes brutal where the characters defined by their actions just as much as their words and every character is not black and white but in shades of gray a Film-Noir in where nothing is what it seems and no one is who they say they are and there is plenty of twists and turns on every corner. And while L.A.C is in the great style and genre of Film-Noir it is not film in the classic style of Film-Noir:black and white photography,dark shadows and harsh and surreal lighting,but natural lighting. Dante Spinotti's beautiful photography and lighting is more natural and realistic where the sunlight is shown in the way it is in the real world and not in the movies. While the film is 2 1/2 hours the movie moves at such fast pace you feel like you the movie is 90 minutes instead of 137 minutes. There are many characters in the film but everyone gets enough screen time and no role,character or dialog is wasted. The screenplay by Curtis Hansen and Brian Helgeland is just excellent and memorable,with Hansen and Helgeland taking James Ellroy's gritty and tough dialog,the characters from the book and makes situations and moments feel real and just come to life. And while the film doesn't necessary follow the storyline exactly like the book,the spirit of Ellroy's style and writing is still felt throughout the film. The movie's three main characters Jack,Bud and Ed are great characters who fit in the style of Film-Noir and are really well-developed because in the beginning of the film you do not always like them or the things that they do but as the film goes along you begin like them and relate to the three characters in different ways and discover their complex personalities and who they are Although L.A.C isn't an Action film there are a few great Action scenes in the film that are filled with great suspense and surprises during the Action scenes. The final 15-20 minutes of the film is Crime Drama and Film-Noir at it's best and will have you glued to the screen with it's Action and great suspense. A great ending.The whole cast is brilliant in their roles. Kevin Spacey is excellent as Sgt. Jack Vincennes,with Spacey bringing a calm and cool feeling to the performance. Russell Crowe is brilliant and at his best as Wendell Bud White,with Russell bringing anger and intensity to the role. Guy Pearce is fantastic as Ed Exley,with Pearce conveying intelligence and cleverness with the performance. Great character actor James Cromwell is terrific and memorable as cop Dudley Smith. Kim Basinger is wonderful and beautiful as Lynn Bracken,a hooker with a heart of gold and Bud's love interest. Danny DeVito is great as slimy tabloid reporter Sid Hudgens. The Underrated David Strathaim is fabulous and smooth as Pierce Moorehouse Patchett,Lynn's pimp. Ron Rifkin(D.A Ellis Loew),Simon Baker(Matt Reynolds),Graham Beckel(Dick Stensland)and Plalo Seganti(Johnny Stompanato)give fine performances as well.The direction by Curtis Hanson is excellent,with Hanson always moving the camera and keeping the film moving at a tight pace with a great visual style while also doing well with the Action scenes. Great direction by Hanson.The score by Jerry Goldsmith is intense,brooding,excellent and fits in with film's Film-Noir tone. I also loved Goldsmith's homage to his classic score from Chinatown in one of the scenes. Great score from Goldsmith. The film also has great songs on the soundtrack from Dean Martin(The Christmas Blues,Powder Your Face with Sunshine),Kay Starr(Wheel Of Fortune),Jonny Mercer(Hit The Road To Dreamland)and more.In final word,if you love Crime Dramas,Film-Noir,Mystery,James Ellroy or films in general I highly suggest you see L.A Confidential,an absolute classic of cinema that you can watch again and again and never get tired of. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Best film of the 90s,"Every so often, all the elements come together to create a truly memorable viewing experience.  LA Confidential is such a movie.From the taut, clever (and often funny) script to the outstanding casting, from the exceptional production design to the inspired direction, this film has everything going for it and easily bears repeated viewing.The story of three very different policemen and the manner in which their lives intersect is handled with skill and intelligence by all involved and, as the story unfolds, the twists and turns leave the viewer engrossed.  Bud White (Russell Crowe), Jack Vincennes(Kevin Spacey) and Edmund Exley (Guy Pearce) represent three different types of men all searching for a form of salvation - the ambitious and prim Exley to be released  from the shadow of his father's murder, the vain and showy Vincennes for validation through a quasi-fame and the abusing and abused White for love. How these men change as events force them to confront their demons is the film's emotional core.All the major players are excellent (Guy Pearce and James Cromwell being the standouts for me) but it is the minor players who really hold the film together. Think of Mrs Lefferts and her sad, little life or the slimy, morally bankrupt DA.  The casting of all the characters is exceptional and a major contributor to the film's success.The script is intelligent and does justice to James Ellroy's book and the cinematography, costuming and design evoke the feel of LA in the 50s.Curtis Hanson has fashioned a film noir for the 90s which was criminally overlooked at the Academy Awards in favour of the risible Titanic.  The three main leads could all have won Best Actor (and should have all been nominated) and Cromwell should have won Best Supporting Actor.If you enjoy intelligent, compelling film-making, then this is the film for you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"""The best crime drama made since Chinatown?'"" I don't think so.","I hadn't seen this film when it had come out in the cinemas, but telling from the general reception that the picture received, I assumed that this was going to something special. Its premise seemed good enough; a violent, entertaining and cleverly plotted crime thriller based on a novel by acclaimed writer James Ellroy. Its large amount of Oscar nominations, especially considering the fact that it was contending against the enormously successful film of that year, ""Titanic,"" which may not have been awful but was too greatly rewarded. However, this is not a great movie, and it certainly does not deserve a firm position in so many lists of the Top 100 films made of all time.It must be said that the film is a reasonably well made, quite watchable and an often entertaining movie. I just want to clear up any suspicion saying that I believe this is absolute trash, in fact I must admit that the film is at least as good as the more successful ""Titanic."" It's just that in the wake of the Cameron-directed box-office smash, this film was much too highly regarded by many of the rightful rebels of mainstream Hollywood cinema. People were then drawn into believing that this was a superb film due more to the film's making and background, rather than actually analysing the quality of the film itself.""LA Confidential"" is a very complicated and clearly adapted film set in the darker aspects of Los Angeles in the 1950's, the huge amounts of violent crimes, trading narcotics and police corruption contrasting against the city's then-glamorous image. The story deals with a mass homicide at an all-night diner, into which Police Lt. Ed Exley (Guy Pearce) investigates. He finds that one the murder's victims is the former suspended partner of policeman Bud White (Russel Crowe). The police force then investigates into the case, soon resulting into a complicated plot involving the false arrest and killings of three negro suspects, richman Pierce Patchett (David Straithairn), his high class pornography trade and Officer White's involvement with one of his prostitutes (Veronica Lake lookalike Kim Basinger), the partnership of detective Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) and crime-news writer Sid Hudgeons (Danny DeVito) and their involvement in the investigation of trading in narcotics and the movies, Police Captain Dudley Smith (James Cromwell) and young officer Ed Exley's problems with his popularity in the police force.Seems like a bit of a mouthful? Let me assure you, it is. I had to see it three times before I could fully understand the plot, and I don't think the exposition of the storyline is handled all that well. Some of the lines (especially Basinger's) are as pretentious and detestable as in any crappy Hollywood movie, and most of the film is quite uninvolving in both characterisation and storyline. Acting is fine, considering the lines the actors have, and some performances are a whole lot better than others. Also, the film's adaptation from a modern crime novel is often too obvious.I'm that there are some who absolutely despise this movie, and I can understand them. I, myself don't hate the film, nor do I think it very poor, I just think that these so-called experienced critics should not be so blind, ignorant and have such a ""go-with-the-flow"" attitude as they have clearly had with this film. Don't go seeing this expecting an absolutely brilliant film, for I assure you, it is not.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Glitzy Crime Mystery Drama,"My immediate thoughts about ""L. A. Confidential"" were: ""Mulholland Falls."" Both are crime, mystery, drama films about mid-20th century Los Angeles and are centered around the LAPD which is brutish in its methods. There's also an issue of photos of an important man and a high-priced hooker.Those were the similarities. Well, that and the fact they both had all star casts.The two movies diverged after that which didn't make one better than the other. Neither film moved me.""L. A. Confidential"" centered around three cops: Wendell ""Bud"" White (Russell Crowe), Sgt. Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey), and Lt. Ed Exley (Guy Pearce). The only thing about them that was the same was that they were all LAPD.Bud White was a heavy-handed, extremely violent cop who particularly loved to dole out pain to women-beaters. We were made to believe that his type of justice was necessary and that somehow he was a good guy because of his rage dressed as chivalry.Jack Vincennes was a media hog on the take. He would get kickbacks from the local tabloid reporter Sid Hudgens (Danny DeVito). Sid would feed Jack the info about an impending crime that was good for headlines and Jack would make the bust garnering dollars and press coverage.Ed Exley was straight laced to the point he would even rat on his own police brothers. Ed was a rarity to say the least. When he was willing to testify against his fellow officers for beating up some Mexican detainees he was made to seem like a bad guy: a weasely politician type willing to step on anyone to get to the top. God forbid he told the truth because it was the right thing to do. No. He was doing the right thing for the wrong reasons.The three of them were made into unlikely bedfellows because they all were looking for the source of a rash of crimes in Los Angeles; with one particular crime being the most pressing. Someone killed several patrons of a diner in what looked like a bloody robbery. Amongst the patrons killed was a cop and a prostitute Bud White came across. Three unlucky Black men would pay the price for this crime though we know that they were just fall guys.To get to the real killers it would take Bud White's fists, Jack Vincennes connections, and Ed Exley's conscience. To me it was a glitzy whodunnit. You strip away the names: Russell Crowe, Kevin Spacey, Danny DeVito, James Cromwell, Kim Basinger, David Strathairn, Guy Pearce---and it's not a crime mystery any better than other crime mysteries.",4.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

What a Classic!!,"Curtis Hanson directed the 1997 nostalgic film ""L.A. Confidential"" and boy did he ever hit nail on the head with classic. This was probably one of the best acted films of 1997 (The Ice Storm and The Wings of the Dove were the others!!).  This film kept you in suspense throughout the whole movie.  It was too bad that this nostalgic masterpiece didn't get more recognition by the Academy for this piece of art. The acting was superb!  Guy Pearce should've been nominated for Best Actor for his role of a by-the-book cop who tries to crack a very complex case this role was a very big stretch for this Austrailian Actor.  Kevin Spacey once again shows us his talents with another spot-on performance and is probably the best character-actors of the 90's and was spotless in this movie!!  James Cromwell was every bit as good as he was in ""Babe"" by playing the villainous cop in this movie and was outstanding here in L.A Confiential.  Russel Crowe did an excellent job playing the role as a hot-tempered cop and should've been nominated for Best Supporting Actor for this movie!!  Of course, no L.A. Confidential critique would be fulfilled without talking about Kim Basinger's stylish and outstanding performace by playing the Lana Turner-like hooker Lyn Braken.  Kim Basinger deserved to win for her performace and after years of heartbreak for this talented actress she finally gets her crowning glory and it was a well-deserved win for her. I believe that this movie deserved the Oscars for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Supporting Actress and probably should've won more.  I believe that this movie was a work of art and Curtis Hanson got some well-deserved recognition for his wonderful work.  I would definitely recommend you rent this movie as soon as possible!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Close but no fedora,"I discovered James Ellroy's L.A. Quartet series of novels, The Black Dahlia (1987), The Big Nowhere (1988), L.A. Confidential (1990), and White Jazz (1992) while living in Montana after a sort of cold turkey I experienced when I had devoured all of the Dashiell Hammett's, James M. Cain's, Ross MacDonald's, and Raymond Chandler's I could at that time get my hands on. They were all great reads, but unfortunately, this was before I really began to appreciate Film Noir and get a stylistic visual from those series of films of the world Ellroy was depicting.Of course I had seen ""The Maltese Falcon"", ""The Big Sleep"", ""Double Indemnity"" and ""Murder My Sweet"" but they were made before the neo- realistic phase of the Noir series so they didn't really count. L.A. Confidential according to Curtis Hanson was an attempt to depict '50's LA but not in a stylistically noir way, ""no long shadows"" so they consciously decided to show the '50's looking forward towards the future rather than highlight Film Noir. He needn't have bothered, the widescreen alone effectively negates the claustrophobic noir stylistic. Noirs were mostly about urban alienation and obsession, the majority of urban topography is vertical which suited the 3:4 aspect ratio well.But, what L..A Confidential does is incorporate Los Angeles' overall elongated horizontal urban structure into an effective neo noir. A plus is that the film even incorporates more actual 50's LA locations and interiors than for example the film Chinatown (story line circa 1930's) did, though this could be for the simple fact that way less 30's LA was still extant in 1973 than 50's LA in 1996. What locations they didn't have they reconstructed and the blend is seamless. The film looks that good.whats not to like:However one glaring WTF omission is what I like to call the ""romance of the fedora"" aside from the DeVitos' character Sid Hudgens and James Cromwell's Dudley Smith, fedoras are absent, missing in action. It just doesn't feel quite right, it would be sort of on par with making a Western without cowboy hats, the characters look naked. -1OK I can understand somewhat where Hanson is coming from in a commentary he states that he wanted to make a film that didn't feel like a period piece because he was concerned about getting funding, but you could at least have had 1/4 of the cast wear fedoras and one of the leads. The Author James Ellroy on his commentary on the DVD for Crime Wave ""Sterling Hayden-- That is my Bud White. That is my Bud White! ""F"" Russell Crowe in 'L A Confidential.' I mean he was okay, but he's a shrimpy little sh-t Bud White as Bud Whites go. Sterling Hayden is the real deal. Look at this! He's not even acting. Look at that hat!"" 'nuff said.""The Lynn Bracken/Bud White romance wasn't all that convincing didn't seem to be any chemistry there it needed more time to get fleshed out at least.If this film really wanted to be a neo noir masterpiece it didn't have confidence or the nerve to push that envelope, Hanson's reluctance to embrace Noir and go with the safe money gives us at the denouement the happy Hollywood ending. The bad guys are all dead and 2/3 of the good guys live. -1 final score 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Not all that impressed...,"I must say this movie is vastly overrated. It is merely typical film-noir and doesn't real develop much past that narrow definition. It has some big name stars who give mediocre performances and a plot that is predictable and unexciting.

Slightly better than Jaws 4,"LA CONFIDENTIAL 1997 (KEVIN SPACEY, RUSSELL CROWE, KIM BASINGER) DIRECTED BY CURTIS HANSON ~ THE RUNDOWN: Apart from a juiced-up cast and a slick image, there is absolutely nothing worthwhile about this vastly overrated movie. ~ Okay, I saw LA Confidential right around the same time I saw Jaws: The Revenge, and I can honestly say without joking that this wasn't much better. To back up my outrageous opinion on this movie, I have comprised a list that I will present of why this movie sucks the big one. ~ 1) The premise of the movie is just plain dull! The basic story/concept is ridiculously stupid, boring and pointless, with almost no imagination whatsoever. Nothing of what we are offered draws us in therefore making the act of watching the movie a chore. 2) The script, like the basic story is just bland. Nothing in it has any redeeming value for the viewer; no wit or humor, not enough violence to make a stink; stale, washed-up dialogue...nothing that even begins to entertain. It is very muddled, however, and does succeed at purposely confusing us to try and hide up its retarded, brain-dead story until everything falls oh-so nicely into place for the breathtaking finale...ha, yeah right! 3) There's no originality here, and once you get down to it, this is really just another Tarantino/Pulp Fiction rip-off, not even a good one that. Except, of course, there's no Tarantino! Nope, instead you get the blazing originality of Curtis Hanson, Mr. Lifetime Movie himself. 4) Not an ounce of style is to be found anywhere in the general proximity of this movie. None. That's right, none. So what if it looks good visually? It doesn't even begin to innovate in story or otherwise. Sure, it tries embarrassingly hard to set itself apart with the whole Film-Noir B.S., but the only real category it falls into is your average, commercialized, Hollywood trash category. If you think there's style to be found here, maybe you have a sixth sense for it because I couldn't detect any. 5) For this fifth point, I will draw a comparison between the movie's cast and a baseball player named Barry Bonds...they're both on steroids. Yeah, basically, the overblown acting ensemble of the movie (Spacey, Basinger, Crowe, Devito, Straithairn, Pearce) is absolutely wasted. There are great actors in this movie but their skills are wasted and not challenged at all, making their performances meaningless. The roles that they play are generic and turn these fine actors into robots for the entire length of the movie. 6) Kim Basinger is effin weird. ~ In the IMDb.COM trivia section it says how this was supposed to be a TV show starring Kiefer Sutherland. Ha. Well, I am quite confident this particular episode of pointlessness and boredom would not have made the greatest hits compilation.",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Kevin Spacey, James Cromwell, Guy Pearce and especially Russell Crowe are all outstanding, Remarkable that Australian actors absolutely nailed the LAPD attitude.

Recommended but read the book.,"I'm a big Ellroy fan so I'm probably not the best person to comment on this film. The book is better and I'm glad I'd read it before I saw the film, which I found a little confusing, but then perhaps that was because I'd read the book.Excellent performances by Guy Pearce, who is very under-rated in my view, and Russell Crowe, not then the mega star he is now. I found Spacey a little bland and uninteresting. How fit is Kim Basinger? She was wonderful!

If you like good movies this is for you,"I'm not worthy to review this film.  However, I need to write some sort of glowing praise of this masterpiece though just to satisfy myself.  Wow! What a movie.  Fast paced, very tight, well written story, superb acting by all.  Russel Crowe seemed to play a typical role, but very well.  Kevin Spacey is always excellent.  I'm sure Kim Basinger's acting was marvelous as well but I was so distracted by how gorgeous she was I could hardly pay attention.  The plot ranks up there, probably above The Usual Suspects.  I think the twist at the end of Usual Suspects was better, but everything in LA Confidential is brilliant.  The characters are all so well developed. My only complaint is that Guy Pearce's character seemed too easily accepted after his ratting out other officers.  Not downplay Guy Pearce's performance which was also quite good.  I can't believe I hadn't heard more about this movie before.  This movie is to film and the 1950's LA scene what The Great Gatsby was to literature and the 1920's Jazz Age, but much more entertaining than the Great Gatsby.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

a masterpiece!,"After having seen the movie some time ago I decided to watch it a second time and the only thing I can say is, that this movie has it all!!!

You don't get enough from this film because Curtis Hanson had the sensibility to chose for a perfect cast that gives the book of James Ellroy what it actually is: a dark and brutal story of Los Angeles in the early fifties that only knows losers in all kinds of varieties. There is no good vs. bad. The good guys are bad, too and if you watch the development of the main characters played by Pierce, Spacey and Crowe along the movie you are very confused of not having one person in this movie you can really identify with.

Justice Deconstructed,"What is the meaning of the word 'justice'? This is a question that Curtis Hanson's ""L.A. Confidential"" compels its audience to ask numerous times. The film, which is based on James Ellroy's novel offers two vastly differing views on the meaning of justice, explicated in the varying styles of police work that the characters perform. Each man represents a different and opposing discourse within the police department. There is much ""dialogic"" between each of the discourses. For example, the commander, Dudley says ""the department needs smart men (political men) like Exley and direct men like White"". The differences between these characters will be discussed later on. At first each discourse exists in its own realm, in terms of binary oppositions. But later on, the characters realize that they cannot do their jobs to the utmost of their ability when they are stuck solely in their own methodology of police work, and therefore the story begins to deconstruct the various binary oppositions.BUD WHITE (Russell Crowe) - White is an officer who is ready at any moment to break the rules, taking the law into his own hands to ensure that justice is served, however he is barely able to keep his raging violence under control. In fact, he adhere's to violence as a necessary adjunct to the job. He has no problem being called upon to do dirty work such as beating confessions out of criminals. White is man, whose driving force seems to be that of seeking revenge for his dead mother (killed by his father). One of the interesting things about him is that he never hesitates to beat a man who inflicts harm to a woman.ED EXLEY (Guy Pierce) - Exley is the golden boy of the police force, and will do almost anything to get ahead, except sell out by breaking the rules of conduct. He is a straight-laced, strictly by the book officer, who shows his desire to get ahead by his willingness to speak out against other officers when he feels that they do something wrong. ""Are you truly prepared to be despised within the department"", Dudley asks. ""Yes sir, I am"", Exley replies. Dudley also asks him if he would be able to beat a confession out of a man he knew to be guilty, plant evidence on a man he knew to be guilty or shoot a man in the back in order to be sure that some hot shot lawyer would not be able to get him off. Of course, Exley's reply to all of these questions is ""no"".JACK VINCENNES (Kevin Spacey) - Vincennes has a different agenda altogether, and it does not have much to do with justice at all, but nevertheless, his style marks a specific discourse within this particular police department, the LAPD. He wants the spotlight on television and the headlines in the newspaper. He is even the technical advisor for a T.V. show called ""Badge of Honor"". In one brilliant scene Vincennes goes to a house to make an arrest for narcotics abuse and he wants a movie premier in the background of the picture taken by the press.Each of these three men represent different ways (or discourses) of conducting police work. At first, all of these discourses are depicted as separate, but constantly conversing and conflicting with one another.In the course of the film, the Night Owl massacre takes place where a number of patrons are killed as well as White's partner, Stenzland. As the film progresses, the men begin to realize that nothing is black and white and they must work together to solve the crime. Exley suspects that White is up to wrong-doing and thus needs a way of keeping tabs on him. Vincennes agrees to help Exley as long as Exley will help him with another case. The men who were before always displaying conflict are now working with each other. White and Exley are now the true opposing forces within the department and the two come to a violent confrontation when White finds out that they have both been sleeping with the same woman. But despite their differences and perhaps their hate for one another, the men are put in the position of having to put aside their differences and unite their ways in order to solve the case, as Exley has found evidence that another man in the department (that I will not mention) may be the mastermind behind the massacre.At this point it is evident that no one police discourse is going to be enough to solve this crime; both men realize it and accept it. This is exhibited most convincingly in the climax of the film when Exley has the mastermind at gunpoint. The man asks Exley, ""Are you going to shoot me or arrest me""? We of course believe that Exley will make the arrest and further his reputation as the 'golden-boy'. We know this primarily from the earlier conversations between Dudley and Exley. But at the last possible moment, just before all of the backup arrives, Exley seemingly goes against himself and does something that neither he nor Dudley thought he was capable of doing. But the real question is; does he really go against himself? He may seemingly go against his own methodology, but does his view of justice really change or does he come to a higher realization of the essence of justice? I always find myself asking this question as the film ends.**** out of ****",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Each time I see him on the screen, I just start laughing, even when he hasn't said a word yet. Kim Basinger does not only look perfect, she gives a wonderful acting performance as well. She should take good roles more often. Finally there was Guy Pearce.

My brief review of the film,"Overall, there is no doubt that this is a good film, and the final half hour is very thrilling, with an excellent conclusion. It unfortunately takes quite a while to reach this point, and in the meantime the film fails to do anything particularly special. On the positive side, it is intriguing, with a complex web of events, the editing gives the film an appropriately exciting style, and the sound recording, whether it be office noises or gunshots, is always on the mark. A couple of things that the film failed to do for me were setting up a feel for the 1950s (the film looks too modern, and there are few indicators of the time period) and maintaining dramatic tension. James Cromwell looks so goofy in his role, and some parts of the film towards the beginning seemed to indicate comedy, in particular with Danny DeVito's character. Guy Pearce is the best of the cast, though perhaps the only one who pulls off a great performance. Kim Basinger won an Oscar, but perhaps for the film's reputation more than anything else. Other than looking a lot like Veronica Lake, there is little else to her role. The violence in the film does not work either. It is too graphic for it to be any dedication to noir, and it is so over-the-top at times that it is as goofy James Cromwell's character is. Perhaps the big problem though is working at what it is trying to say as a film. It is a study of the police force: corruption and working one's way to the top, but these ideas are only really fleshed out towards the end. The film's insight into detective work is good nevertheless, and at the least the film is able to end solidly. So yes, it is a good film with a great conclusion, but the path to getting there could have been improved upon perhaps. I have not read the novel, so maybe that is another thing? Some say that it is a rather good adaptation. Either way, the film is worth a go.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"Corruption, betrayal, and scandal. But a fight for purity and Kim Basinger giving the best performance of her career support claim to the best film of 1997 and perhaps the 90's decade.","Based on a James Ellroy novel in Los Angeles during the 1950's L.A. Confidential delivers a knockout. Though the first time you watch L.A. Confidential you feel the intensity and high drama to find surprise after surprise in the complex and hidden plot. Then after many viewings and you already know how the story unfolds you still enjoy the great acting and admire James Ellroy for having such a fine script. So well written and directed you find yourself glued from start to finish you can't take your eyes off of it. Corruption runs amok in the L.A. police department only to be exposed by a eager young cop Ed Exley (Guy Pearce). Bud White (Russell Crowe) breaks away from the corruption to help Exley after he learns the third cop in the trio and sidekick Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) is killed by the corrupt force. I must say Kevin Spacey is one of the best actors in Hollywood today I love watching any movie he plays in. The best supporting element of this entire film is Kim Basinger as Hollywood glamour call girl (Lynn Bracken). She did indeed deserve her Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. Kim gave a performance that just brightens up the film her beauty is touching. That's the best Kim has ever looked everything from her bold blond hair and body you just name it. L.A. Confidential gives a message to me that we should all search and try to experience some purity from time to time. With corruption as found in this film and many other places hope for more honesty and truth can be experienced more. I like the way Pearce, Basinger, and Crowe beat corruption.

The plot revolves around three police officers (Russell Crowe, Kevin Spacey, Guy Pearce) working on different cases that coincide, set in early 1950's LA. You feel as if you're really experiencing the debauchery, the sleaze and the glamour; walking amongst film sirens, downtrodden actors and corrupt cops. The storyline is set at a good pace and I didn't feel bored at all during the film, as the action is spliced with interesting subplots that will eventually all make sense at the end.The acting by Spacey and Pearce is exceptional (Crowe didn't actually have to act much apart from his scenes with his love interest) with the latter pulling off the perfect ambitious backstabber. This movie is for those who enjoy the crime genre, obviously, although there is quite a large firefight at the end it concentrates more on the characters and their investigations. There is also solid backup from Kim Basinger, James Cromwell, (and my favourite character) Danny Devito as the amoral trash reporter.An extremely well-made movie, definitely in my top ten. The only possible bad thing about LA Confidential that I can see is that some people just despised the film because of Guy Pearce's character's actions at the end of it. I actually found it refreshing, because it remains to his character and we're given no traditional Hollywood morality lessons. Anyway, 9 out of 10 from me.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Couldn't have made it any better.,"Often when I'm watching movies, I'll say to myself during the course of the film ""this could have been so much better if the director only did _______.""I didn't do this at all when I first watched L.A. Confidential in a packed theater in Toronto. I must have seen it a half dozen times since then and I still haven't done it. I honestly can't see how Curtis Hanson (the most unlikely of all writer-directors) could have possibly created a more perfect film. Everything from the great acting to the fantastic direction to the remarkable screenplay (which contains some truly great lines... ""Go back to Jersey...""), is so perfectly executed that I find it amazing how studios consistently release such mediocre junk these days when they could elect to finance films like this. I mean, seriously, will society as a whole really benefit that greatly from another Home Alone movie? Or how about those ultra-lame teen-oriented comedies written by a bunch of married 30-somethings and staring a bunch of talentless 20-somethings? (the answer is no, by the way)L.A. Confidential is definitely one of the all time great film noirs, ranking with (if not surpassing) such other landmarks of the genre such as The Big Sleep, Chinatown & The Maltese Falcon.If nothing else (certainly not winning Academy Awards), L.A. Confidential proves that great films can still come out of Hollywood.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Film Noir Brilliance,"L.A Confidential is a classic crime noir film with an outstanding cast who give an excellent performance. The intriguing story is set in 1950s Los Angeles where three cops supposed to work together with very different views of the law go about dispensing their own versions of justice.The cast is brilliant with some of the best acting talent of the 90s. Crowe plays the aggressive Bud White. Spacey is Jack Vincennes, a man who enjoys his work as an adviser to a police drama more than his actual police work and Pearce who plays Edmund Exley, a new up and coming officer who tries to play things by the book in a police force that has long since abandoned any such notions.All three are soon caught up in a web of lies and deceit as the audience attempts to figure out what happened right along with them. But looks can be deceiving and who do you believe when everyone seems to have something to hide?Overall an enjoyable crime noir with more than it's fair share of twists and turns in this complex tale full of believable characters.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
A great film noir,"Yes, it is still possible to make a great film noir.  Superb acting, directing, dialogue, make-up, and score combine to cast a magical spell.

A Rare Hollywood Outing,"This is probably a little late in coming but better late than never. Like many, I'm still not sure how Titanic managed to win 11 Oscars and get ahead this film. L.A. Confidential is easily one of the best films made by Hollywood in a very long time. A tight script and all-round stellar performances by the cast. As an Australian, I was particularly heartened by the performances of Guy Pearce and Russell Crowe. They were truly outstanding and it is a sad reflection of film industry politics that they were not even recognised for their magnificent efforts. It is a film worth getting your teeth into.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
The best major studio release of the 90s.,"Just to claim a title. Usually (not in all cases) the ´big´ Hollywood films are technically superior, but suffer from flat characters, an uninteresting story and overall dumbness (to say it in a simplistic and maybe overly harsh way). L.A. Confidential is different AND technically flawless. The screenwriters, among them director Hanson, did a very good job to translate Ellroys masterpiece to the screen. The book is better, the characters deeper, their stories darker and the whole thing is more convincing, but this would`nt fit into a 10 hour movie at all. L.A. Confidential proves that there is hope for Hollywood. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

"LAPD, the crime and the press: three policemen in a harsh Los Angeles","A great police movie about the investigation of a multiple homicide in Los Angeles in the 50's by three aware but very different policemen: Ed Exley, Bud White and Jack Vincennes, each one with his own idiosyncrasies, concerns and methods. The movie explores well the bonds between police, crime and press. LA Police Department is corrupt, vicious, corporatist, racist, and one who wants to make things according the law, such as Exley, will certainly face problems there. Organized crime controls luxury prostitution (Lynn Bracken is a core character here), drug traffic, and kills a lot. The press (represented by Sid Hudgens) schemes in order to produce scandals and sells newspapers. The movie has style (neo-noir), good art direction, is well directed and acted, with great characters and a high quality script. It was very nice to watch it again after 25 years.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"Kevin Spacey, once again, deals with ""The Usual Suspects""","A mass murder occurs at the Night Owl Cafe one night in 1953 Los Angeles, including an officer who had just been dismissed from the LAPD for misconduct earlier that day, Dick Stensland. It looks like a robbery gone wrong from the crime scene. Captain Dudley Smith (James Cromwell) announces that the chief suspects are three black men who were seen shooting off shotguns at a park earlier in the evening.Three black men are arrested when three shotguns are found in the back of their car. When they are brought in for questioning it is determined they do have records and that they did kidnap and rape a Mexican girl. They escape, and are killed resisting recapture. The guns in the backseat of their car match the bullets in the Night Owl Cafe victims. It looks like the case is closed, but then three of the cops involved in the case - Bud White (Russell Crowe), Ed Exley (Guy Pierce), and Jack Vincinnes (Kevin Spacey) separately conclude that there is something just not right about this case. So they join forces to look into matters, regardless of the consequences. Complications ensue.This film is cleverly constructed. First, a yellow journalist, Sid Hudgins (Danny DeVito) narrates an introduction about ""sunny California"" in 1953. How there is so much room, how everything is cheap, how it's a paradise for the ""all-American family"". This gets the audience adjusted to the place and time and its conventions.Next the three main characters - the three cops - are introduced via a melee of violence conducted against some Mexican suspects when one suspect insults a cop. You get a feel for what drives each of the three through the fallout of the disciplinary action that follows.Next is the Night Owl Cafe massacre and its aftermath, and at exactly one hour into the film, it looks like things are wrapping up, showing each cop going on with their life. But then the doubts, and the fateful investigation into what really happened.There are so many layers of complexity in this last part with so many plot twists, that some people might get lost. Thus, at the end of the film, one of the cops is in a position to be interrogated about what has happened, and that is used as an opportunity to summarize this last part of the plot, just in case anyone is confused. It all works so very well.I just can't rave enough about this movie -The Hollywood ""golden era"" crime ridden backdrop, the hard-boiled neo-noir atmosphere, the layering of storyline with some devastating twists, the palpable chemistry between a young and gorgeous Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, and Kim Basinger (who won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress), an impressive supporting cast of colorful characters including the wonderful actor, James Cromwell, and last but not least, the moody but also exhilarating score by Jerry Goldsmith.I'd argue that this was probably the best picture of 1997 versus Titanic. But that would be like arguing in favor of Mr. Smith Goes to Washington versus Gone With the Wind for Best Picture of 1939. The Academy always goes for the well-made visual spectacle when it hands out its biggest award.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

L.A. Confidential gives us all the goods...in a tasteful and original way.,"L.A. Confidential is a diamond in the rough. Slicing through the haze of contemporary Hollywood, Curtis Hanson presents a moral tale within the guise of a ""trashy,"" noirish crime mystery. This film sparkles because it satisfies the movie-lover (action sequences that are both exciting and original; heart-felt romance; the portrayal of strong but not infallible heroes) while it also plays out as a powerful morality tale. L.A. Confidential casts light on the sins of Hollywood and of all Americans: greed, lust, ambition, selfishness. The semantic elements of the film, notably the noirish atmosphere and obligatory gun-fights, reinforce the nostalgic feel of the film. We are taken back to the Classical Era of Hollywood, before the evolution of the big blockbuster. Like Grease, L.A. Confidential satisfies our yearning for a simpler time.Yet the film's narrative is by no means simple, even though it feels so accessible to the true film-lover. For this reason, L.A. Confidential avoids cliches and refuses to draw the line between good and evil for the viewer. Rather, the viewer must observe events, weigh evidence, and play detective along with a perfectly-cast triumvirate of Russell Crowe, Kevin Spacey, and Guy Pierce. L.A. Confidential draws the audience in and never lets go until the climactic finale. Crowe and Spacey are as deserving of Oscars for this film as for Gladiator and American Beauty, if not more so.Perhaps my own nostalgia shapes my opinions today. In a way, it is nostalgia for a year, 1997, that could produce a movie like L.A. Confidential that, faced with the likes of Shawshank Redemption and Titanic, would not even win Best Picture. How much could possibly have changed in five years? Just look at the weak film crops of 2000 and 2001 and one realizes that L.A. Confidential would make any movie today pale in comparison. However, it is not enough to say that L.A. Confidential is the best of what's available. Somehow, someway, Curtis Hanson and his cast put together all the tangibles and intangibles to create a movie that ""has everything"" - action, romance, mystery, suspense, superb writing, breathtaking acting....and the list goes on. Hanson has done more than infuse new life into the crime genre; he has created a cinematic masterpiece with life lessons waiting to discovered beneath its surface.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
An absolutely superb film noir crime drama.,"Everything about this film is superb.  The story, direction, characters, acting and settings are all crisp and stunning.  The performances by Russell Crowe, Guy Pierce, Kevin Spacey, James Cromwell, Kim Basinger, Danny DeVito and David Strathairn are all excellent.  Brian Helgelands's violent script adapted from James Ellroy's amazing novel is brilliant.  And the direction by Curtis Hanson is stylish and brutal.  Academy Awards deserved to be spread around the board for this one, but unfortunately, Helgeland's script and Basinger's performance were the only aspect awarded.  (Two of the only awards Titanic didn't win that year).  This film is unfairly compared to ""Chinatown"", but the only similarities between the two are the atmosphere and genre.  ""Chinatown"" contains more complexities in thought and action while ""LA Confidential"" is dense in plot and character action.  ""LA Confidential"" is a superbly well made motion picture and is a must-see for fans of crime drama.  One of the elite in this genre.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

A classic in its own time!,"A classic in its own time!  L.A. Confidential is one of the most remarkable films ever created.  We follow the lives of three policemen in 1950's Los Angeles-Wendal ""Bud"" White, Edmund Exley, and Jack Vincennes. The police department is trying to clean up its image while staying in a corrupt town in a corrupt time.  Their reputation is however trashed once more in an internal drunken riot termed ""Bloody Christmas."" That's just the beginning, the spawn of the immense story, plot twists, and character development.  Each character in the film is drastically changed by his or her experiences.  The editing is always smooth and fast paced, and the cinematography always affixes the right mood.  The set pieces are distinct eye candy.  The soundtrack to this movie is a fine complement to the visuals.  It mixes authentic fifties music with a beautifully orchestrated score that keeps audiences on the edges of their seats. The acting performances for this movie are collectively some of the best ever produced for the silver screen.  The last time I've been this convinced of Characters was in ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.""  Russell Crowe, Guy Pierce, Kevin Spacey, and Kim Basinger (Best Supporting Actress - 1997) give especially standout performances. Overall, L.A. Confidential is the total package.  It's superb at every angle.  It has been voted the third best film of the nineties by one critic's association, and it is my personal favorite.

Pulp Friction,"Curtis Hanson brilliantly and luridly brings James Elroy's novel to life in this stylish combination film noir - police procedural. Harder-boiled than an eleven minute egg it crackles to life right from the start when Russell Crowe's brawny, no-nonsense L. A. detective Bud White forcibly interrupts a case of domestic abuse only to happen on what he suspects is another when he encounters a Rita Hayworth look-a-like with a broken nose in the limo of a super-slick millionaire. This is Pierce Patchett, played with elan by David Strathairn, who has a finger in many pies, the most lucrative of which is a call-girl ring where his girls are transformed into the image of leading Hollywood stars to create the perfect fantasy for those willing and able to pay.From there the story spins out to the internal dynamics of the LA PD where we're introduced to James Cromwell's patrician captain and principally his detectives who include Crowe, Kevin Spacey's flash-harry Jack Vincennes and Guy Pearce's by-the-book go-getter Ed Exley. On the outside looking in, literally, is Danny De Vito's Weegee-type scandal-sheet photographer Sid Hudgens while the quintessential femme-fatale is Kim Basinger's Veronica Lake-wannabe Lynn Bracken.Could it have worked even better if filmed in black and white, well perhaps but it's nevertheless so tightly-scripted, intricately plotted and played with relish by pretty much the whole cast, it effortlessly captures the sleazy but edgy decadence of the era. I particularly liked the way it cleverly overlaid indirectly or even directly, references to real-life characters of the time, none better than the amusing drop-in by Lana Turner and her infamous, ill-fated boyfriend Johnny Stompanato.There may be one or two narrative mis-steps, such as Pearce's taking advantage of Basinger and the final quasi-happy-ending scene and all the women are treated appallingly throughout, but on the whole thanks to razor-sharp direction and excellent cinematography depicting the era, after watching this you so feel as if you've just dipped into a True Crime magazine of the day, you should be checking your fingers afterwards for ink-stains.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

The Best of the Good Cop/Bad Cop Theme,"This movie was great. I didn't know what to expect when I rented this but I was pleased with the result. Lets start with acting. Russell Crowe exceeded my expectations and played one of the toughest, roughest cops I've seen. Guy as the nerdy simple cop was annoying at times but towards the end you start to like the guy. Kim Basinger played a surprisingly good performance with her smooth conversational lines and great scene presence. Spacey...although his time was limited did play the role of the wisecrack cop perfectly......spitting out hilarious laid back lines to add comedy to this drama. The character development in this movie is what I liked the most. Every character starts off with a simple label but as they get entwined in the mystery they start changing their attitudes...most of the time it was done so they can get to bottom of the mystery. You'll be surprised as to who is running this crooked cop gang........at least I was. The plot twists were amazing and just when you thought the case was solved they added in reasonable twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat. I'll admit the beginning was good.but towards the middle I started to get confused and bored but at the end.....they kick it up a notch and finish it all off with secrets revealed, puzzles put together, and a great gunfight.

But Danny DeVito's work was phenomenal as was the actor who played the Captain. It was as if each actor helped lift the others up to new levels. And I have not even mentioned the writing.

How detective movies should be made,"First of all, I wasn't expecting so much about this movie. It had a pretty high rating at IMDb and it's praised all over the place, but I just wasn't so interested of it. Well, it turned out to be an excellent movie. The movie tells a story happening in Los Angeles in the 1950's and it tells about a corruption occurring all over the police force and a committed murder, which three different polices start to investigate in their own unique ways. Ed Exley, the golden boy of the police force, smart and the one obeying the law. Bud White, a rough man ready to break the law to seek justice. Then there's Jack Vincennes, a celebrity detective being the one who does the job for publicity and press photos, but still managing something with his smart, yet somewhat crooked ways.There are two things about this movie which make it so magnificent; The storyline and the cast. The storyline is filled with excitement and it keeps on going all the way through. After the first hour the movie kind of stops a little bit and it seems like it starts to stumble, or that's at least what you think. There are these scenes which seem like irrelevant, but they eventually get important for the whole plot in a genius way. This movie is a perfect example of how to make a real crime/detective movie, there's the crime in the beginning and after that there's just this fantastic progression of the whole investigation from the very beginning till the very end, detectives finding interesting and also very surprising clues during the progress. Then there's the amazing cast; Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, James Cromwell, Kim Basinger, David Strathairn, Danny DeVito.. Honestly, can you think of any better? Great indeed.This leads up myself to the acting the movie has to offer. The role performances are all in all fantastic. Ed Exley is played by Guy Pearce and I really haven't seen Pearce in a role like Exley before, but I am happy to say that he is great in it. Then there's the always superb Russell Crowe playing Bud White, the real bad ass cop. If someone can play a bad ass and look so furious it's Crowe without a doubt. He's just so frightening. Finally there is Kevin Spacey as Jack Vincennes and as I've watched more than a few Spacey movies recently I'm starting to like him more and more and he is starting to be one of my favourite actors. In this movie he still is as excellent as you can pretty much expect from him. Pearce, Crowe and Spacey shine with astonishing role performances and they are the best thing the cast has to offer. I'm not underestimating the rest of the cast at all though, as there is the fierce James Cromwell, the beautiful Kim Basinger, the somewhat charismatic and cool David Stathairn and then there's the tiny but incredible Danny DeVito, who I haven't really seen in a more fitting role and he does some damn fine job in it too. Cromwell is enjoyable as usual, Basinger does what she does best and Strathairn is the coolness itself, though in my opinion he was better in ""Good Night, and Good Luck."" Still a great achievement though.""L.A. Confidential"" offers you a great movie experience. It sets mark on how detective movies should be made and how the whole crime investigation process should be progressing. It's exciting and it's interesting, doing that all the way through. It includes fantastic role performances and brilliant characters which all in their vivid personalities will most certainly not disappoint the viewer. It doesn't get messy in any part so the viewer won't be missing anything and won't get lost, so the film is also easy for your eyes. Directed by Curtis Hanson who captures the real essence of 1950's through images and music and based on the novel by James Ellroy which is translated to a magnificent screenplay in the hands of Brian Helgeland and the director Hanson himself, it just doesn't go wrong. I'm recommending this movie to everyone; The pleasure was all mine when watching it and I hope it will be yours as well.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
