Frustratingly Entertaining,"Law and Order: Special Victims Unit is one of my favorite television shows, even though its gone a bit downhill lately. Is it the cast? No, because they are mostly intact. What is actually happening is that each of the main characters, known for their superb chemistry amongst each other, are suddenly spending less screen time with each other and more time to themselves. This story actually has a point. On Stranger Tides suffers the same fate: fantastic cast that don't spend as much time with each other as we hope. Add some pointless plot lines, a calmer first-third of the flick, and you have yourself the fourth installment of Pirates of the Caribbean.That being said, its still quite entertaining. On Stranger Tides follows a variety of people searching for the fabled Fountain of Youth. Unfortunately for us, its not just Jack Sparrow. We have Blackbeard, the Spanish, the British (led by Barbossa), Angelica, and more doing the same thing. Subplots pertaining to this quest include Jack's past with Angelica, Barbossa's questionable change in character, some random guy falling for some random girl (I am serious, this part was totally pointless), and the pointless Spanish people that flock in and out of the movie.This is by far the weakest part of the movie, the script. For some odd reason, they borrowed far too much from the novel (whose pacing and themes far differ that of the Pirates brand) and forgot that sometimes simplicity is best---which is what made Curse of the Black Pearl such a great film. It was the easiest to follow, and On Stranger Tides didn't learn from the previous two installments. To add to that, the script utterly separated everyone, even those with the best on-screen chemistry. Barbossa was barely with Jack Sparrow, Sparrow was rarely with his ex-lover, and worst of all reliable Gibbs spent minimal time with Sparrow. When they are together, the humor, the banter, tension, and the charm works well. When they aren't, well, the movie drags a bit.Thank goodness the cast is still on their game. Johnny Depp once again breathes life into the pirate movie with his smart, unpredictable, and hilarious portrayal of Jack Sparrow. Despite what the reviews say, Jack Sparrow's shtick isn't getting old as he is still a delight to watch. Geoffrey Rush once again shines as Jack's best rival Barbossa, as his quiet intentions resemble that of Sparrow in earlier films. Penelope Cruz adds a layer of sexuality that we definitely did not have with the other Pirates of the Caribbeans--it's just a shame she didn't have much time with Sparrow. Director Rob Marshall was able to shell out good performances from everyone in the cast, but he definitely wasn't the man for this job.Almost all the chase scenes or action sequences were done with very low-lighting and poor camera angles. With the exception of the mesmerizing and chilling mermaid sequence and the opening chase, all the action moments were missing that special touch. While the bizarreness of Gore Verbinski will not be totally missed (although his style worked perfectly in Rango), his ability to crank out excellent stuntwork and fights was sorely missing here. At least we got to see plenty of it, from the opening chase to the final dramatic (and short) showdown. Say whatever you want, but there has yet to be anything that can top the infamous three-way sword fight/old mill showdown from Dead Man's Chest.Bottom Line: Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides is a mix of frustration and fun. There was plenty of potential that wasn't met because of questionable plot lines, pointless moments, lack of chemistry (once again: writer's fault. Good going Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio), and uneven direction. All that banter aside, Pirates is also plenty fun with several delightful moments, funny lines, and much more action than the last Pirates flick. Johnny Depp, Penelope Cruz and company keep the movie afloat, and prevent it from being a pure bore. But I think the franchise works better when Verbinski is behind the camera. On Stranger Tides is decent summer entertainment, but doesn't have the inescapable magic and charm of the first two.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I don't get why this one wasn't liked by the majority?,"Yes, there's no Bloom or Knightley in this one, and it might not be as action-packed as the others, but it's far from a bad film. Depp, Rush and McShane did a fantastic job at carrying the franchise to its fourth installment. There's plenty of laughs, some well choreographed action sequences, and it's a nice little tale of the search for the Fountain of Youth. This one is definitely up there with the first three films for me.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Imperfect but worthy instalment,"As far as the Pirates of the Caribbean movies go, On Stranger Tides may be lacking in the rollicking fun of Curse of the Black Pearl, which I absolutely loved, though it's closer in spirit to it than those of the two movies before, but I think it is better than Dead Man's Chest, which had great effects and a brilliant Bill Nighy but felt overlong and ferentic sometimes, and At World's End, which had the cast giving their all, great visuals, score and final battle but rather convoluted and bloated on the whole.On Stranger Tides isn't perfect. I did feel it did have perhaps have too many moments of exposition and clich√©s, though the story if slightly rickety in places here is less bloated noticeably and better paced than the film released before it which is a good thing. I also felt the romantic subplot(s) felt underdeveloped and forced, and while there are some droll, bizarre and witty quips particularly with Depp, Rush and Cruz there is a bit of filler that could have been excised.However, despite these complaints, On Stranger Tides is a worthy instalment. Once again, the production values are impeccable, the cinematography is skillful, the costumes, sets and period recreation is authentic and the effects are superb. The opening twenty minutes is an example of the writing being at its funniest and wittiest, and the scenes with the mermaids are beautifully shot and intriguing.While not perhaps original, and not among his best, I did very much like Hans Zimmer's score, which was rousing and brought some much-needed energy. The characters are not the best developed, but they are fun and there aren't too many of them to interrupt the flow of the story, a big problem I found with At World's End, while the action sequences are both exciting and nail-biting on the whole.I wasn't so sure about Rob Marshall as director, but he does a far better job than expected, and the film is livelier in pace than Dead Man's Chest and At World's End. The acting is good enough for what it was. Johnny Depp plays lovable rogue Jack Sparrow with a voluptuous swagger and sly humour and nails it again, while the idea to omit Kiera Knightley and Orlando Bloom here proved a good one, without them for my money the whole adventure carried less of a dead weight.Instead we have Penelope Cruz, who proves a perfect match for Depp. She is feisty, beautiful, foxy and sexy, and also likable and fun. I was wondering what they would do for villains without Bill Nighy, but I needn't have worried. Ian McShane is a worthy addition as Blackbeard, who is charming in a grizzly way while committing acts of great evil. Geoffrey Rush is underused in a way, but he does have some great lines and a fun presence so he isn't a complete waste.In conclusion, On Stranger Tides is not a perfect film, but as an instalment to a decent enough franchise it is a more than worthy one. And you know, what I've said about this movie was not something I thought I would be saying, because judging by what I'd seen of the advertising/trailers, it looked as though it was going be the worst of the series, but actually for me it wasn't. 7.5/10 Bethany Cox",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
New Ships,"The franchise has shifted. The 'first trilogy' was visually-centered. It was quite literally a ride, allowing Depp room to creatively be silly. Some of the cinematic stretch was significant, and I still remember the Shackleford reference fondly.This is something entirely different. Sure, it has busy sequences and characters from the same universe. But now we have something story- centric. Images are pasted onto the story rather than the other way around.There's even an excess of story and excess within story with the excess being a character itself.There are at least three love stories, one of them tender and conventional, all of them centered on Catalonian women.There is something of an overarching battle between Christianity and the supernatural. The extreme irony is that the Spaniards are the token of the faith. In actual life, they were the ones who invented the notions of supernatural evil, the first continental faith-based genocide and New World slavery.There is a nice little revenge story that references Moby Dick. And at the end two Peter Pan like affirmations of the (pirate's) life of adventure.I liked it. I liked the gush and mix of narrative. I liked the appropriation of Almodovarian values. But I have to say that no one knew how to leverage Penelope the way Pedro can. She is not inventive like Johnny and Geoffrey. She is a vessel, a vulnerable vessel that can be filled with female assets. But she has to gather that from the environment. Making her into something even Geena Davis and her lover could not do is a sacrilege.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Same old ""Pirates"" with a new simpler focus and more Capt. Jack","After a four-year hiatus to regroup and determine the future of the franchise, Disney and what was once its surprise mega-hit ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" series have returned in ""On Stranger Tides."" Hard to believe that this franchise evolved from the once-lambasted concept of a theme park ride being turned into a successful motion-picture blockbuster. After exhausting the ""Pirates"" world with two back-to-back sequels of titanic and rather disappointing proportion in 2006 and 2007, a break in the action to recalibrate Captain Jack Sparrow's compass was much-needed. The ""new"" course set by ""On Stranger Tides"" uses worn sails, but with a fresh wind of characters and more importantly, a more direct purpose.As promised in the end of ""At World's End,"" Jack's looking for the Fountain of Youth if for nothing more than ships and giggles. First, however, he must take a side trip to London to rescue his old pal Gibbs (Kevin McNally) and subsequently the palace of King George (Richard Griffiths in a lovely cameo). There, he learns that his old pal Barbossa (Rush) has lost The Black Pearl as well as his leg and sold out to His Majesty's Royal Navy. He is to help the English find the Fountain before the Spaniards do. Jack, of course, knows the way there, thus continuing his ongoing role as an indispensable pestilence.After a familiar improvised escape, he crosses paths with an old lover, Angelica (Penelope Cruz), who he once deflowered before she was to take her vows at a convent. She mentions she has a ship he can borrow, only it turns out that it's her father's ship, the Queen Anne's Revenge, captained by none other than Blackbeard the Pirate (Ian McShane), a feared and soulless scourge with a minor in black magic. So much for smooth sailing.As overdone and clich√© as the Fountain of Youth may be, it's perfect for the ""Pirates"" franchise and helps keep things very simple, something the last installment had more than a fair deal of trouble with. Only a few character subplots threaten to convolute the story, but all motivations lead to the Fountain regardless the reason. In fact, ""On Stranger Tides"" marks the first film to truly focus on Captain Jack. With Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley's characters out of the way, the franchise can keep the spotlight on the reason it's gotten four films deep. Depp has nothing new in store for us as the true center of attention, but by continuing to underplay the trademark quirks and mannerisms, he continues to prolong the deterioration of the Capt. Jack act. Some might disagree, but it depends how much you liked him the first place.In terms of new faces, Ian McShane is impeccable as Blackbeard. Rush gave a wonderfully theatrical performance as the main villain in the first film, but McShane introduces the first true quantifiable force of evil the franchise has seen. Although his voodoo abilities and reputation for killing his men and bringing them back from the dead to serve as his zombie slaves are never entirely realized, he's the merciless villain this film needed. He never fully crosses into scare-your-children evil, but he could've at any instant and that feeling radiates from his performance. In general, this film aligns itself more with fantasy and traditional folklore than the supernatural like the previous film.Among other new faces, Rob Marshall as the franchise's new director does serviceable work. The ""Chicago"" filmmaker chews the scenery well and creates effective moods and tones, but the action could have been a bit more inspired, especially considering the series' reputation for sword-fighting ingenuity.Marshall's best work and the film's best sequence deals with mermaids, not the singing and seashell bra type, but seduce you with their looks and then try and devour you with fangs type. Quiet, suspenseful and culminating in a full-on action sequence, the mermaids constitute the one completely fresh element of the film. Their cove is the lone stop on the journey as well, so it's the only aspect of the plot that creates that classic seafaring adventure feeling akin to Homer's ""The Odyssey.""Not much else deviates from the formula, so those hoping for a resurgence in the series or something as good as the first film, ""The Curse of the Black Pearl,"" will remain wishful thinkers once again. It's hard to imagine where the series could go next without retreading over old ground or just introducing new characters for the sake of it, but Captain Jack Sparrow remains one of the few reliable comforts of blockbuster cinema, and any adventure with him at the wheel will struggle to be a total waste of time. ""On Stranger Tides"" makes just enough adjustments to the series to make for a successful installment.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Captain Jack is back...,"I saw an advanced screening of this movie last night at the El Capitan theatre in Hollywood. I don't want to give away any spoilers, so all I'll say is that it was pretty darn good. By not having Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom in it, the film didn't feel like just a rehash of all the other PotC films. Penelope Cruz and Ian McShane really added a lot to the film, and I loved Sam Claflin's performance. But of course you have to have Johnny Depp, because it wouldn't be PotC without him, and Geoffrey Rush was spectacular as always. All in all, this has everything you'd expect from PotC: swashbuckling, sea creatures, sword-fighting, and lots of great comedy; but the new cast members keep it feeling fresh.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Pirates of the Caribbean:  On Stranger Tides is another enjoyable romp with Johnny Depp and Penelope Cruz,"I had previously enjoyed the first and third of the Johnny Depp pirate movies though I was confused by some of the sequences. This one that I just watched with my movie theatre-working friend, I understood a bit more and, as a result, I enjoyed a little more especially with the addition of the beautiful Penelope Cruz as a former paramour who may or may not be on his side. There's also some good sequences with some mermaids that positively floored me with how they operate here. And the return of Geoffrey Rush as the one-legged crew member was also a treat here. Plenty of witty lines from Depp and some good swashbuckling sequences here and there were also good under new director Rob Marshall. So on that note, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides is highly recommended.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Our favorite pirate is back!,"Firstly, this review does not contain any spoilers whatsoever so read on. I had the privilege to watch this in the El Capitan theater advanced screening. Johnny Depp, the goofy pirate that we have grown to love, returns to his iconic role of Captain Jack Sparrow in an action-packed tale of truth, betrayal, youth and demise.The plot is when Jack crosses paths with a woman from his past (Penelope Cruz), he's not sure if it's love‚Äîor if she's a ruthless con artist who's using him to find the fabled Fountain of Youth. When she forces him aboard the Queen Anne's Revenge, the ship of the formidable pirate Blackbeard (Ian McShane), Jack finds himself on an unexpected adventure in which he doesn't know who to fear more: Blackbeard or the woman from his past.By being a fan this franchise, I can happily confirm that YES, it is as good as the first one! Be ready for an adventure and half! Brings everything from the classic bizarre comedy to the nail biting action scenes.The marketing for the movie have been intelligently subliminal like some other great film releases, like Avatar, or Blair Witch (the real vs fake) and the recent awesome film production The Artifice (the-artifice.com) and so on.This is not a film to miss, does not matter if you are a die hard fan of Pirates, or new to the series! I might be in trouble for writing a review of the movie this early, so please click Yes on the ""is this review useful"" as a thank you ;)",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Pirate's Life for Me,"Greetings again from the darkness. I will make no apology for being a fan of the ""Pirates"" series. This is the fourth film and the best since the first. Though I liked them enough, I felt the second and third depended too much on special effects and the need to overwhelm, whereas this one concentrates more on the colorful characters. This latest entry is also directed by Rob Marshall (""Chicago"") rather than Gore Verbinski, who directed the first three.Of course, what really matters is that Johnny Depp is back as Captain Jack Sparrow. And in fine form, I might add. He comes across more clever, witty and less buffoonish than in the previous two. His character is much better as a worthy adversary than a clown prince. In this one, he alternates between matching wits and swords with no less than three characters. First, Geoffrey Rush is back as Barbossa. Only this time, he seems to have gone legit with the King's navy. Next we have Sparrow's long-lost love from Seville played by Penelope Cruz. They also match wits and swords (and facial hair). Lastly, we have the legendary pirate Blackbeard, played with full force by Ian McShane. Were it not a Disney movie, McShane could have made his Blackbeard one of the most frightening characters ever seen on screen. Even with the limitations, he performs exceedingly well.The ""plot"" of the film involves the search for Ponce de Leon's ship and the much desired Fountain of Youth. The race is on between Sparrow, Blackbeard, the Spainiards and Barbossa who is acting on behalf of King George (a wonderful Richard Griffiths). As always, it's not always easy to tell which characters are partners and which are adversaries. That's half the fun! An interesting twist is that in order to have the desired results from the infamous fountain, one must drink from a specific chalice and include a single mermaid tear. Of course, everlasting youth shouldn't be too easy to achieve. The mermaid sequences are fascinating, though we really only get to know one of them - Syrena played with soulful eyes by Astrid Berges-Frisbey.Thankfully, two long time characters are absent from this film - Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley. Both were dead-weight that caused major drag in the two most recent Pirates films. Cruz and McShane are infinitely more interesting and entertaining and play off of Captain Jack much better.Speaking of Depp's Jack Sparrow, I would make the argument that this character has entered the rarefied air of film comedy icon. I would put him at or near the level of the all-time best recurring comic characters: Inspector Clouseau (Peter Sellers, NOT Steve Martin), Austin Powers (Mike Myers) and the Little Tramp (Charlie Chaplin). Of course, there are loads of others that have made a name for themselves but are a step below: Ernest (Jim Varney), Fletch (Chevy Chase), Wayne and Garth (Wayne's World), Riggs and Murtaugh (Lethal Weapon), etc. I could go on and on, but you get the idea.As I have stated many times, comedy is such a personal choice that it's always difficult to review. What sets the Pirate's films apart (especially one and four) are the characters combined with action and witty banter. No, it's not for everyone, but if you like this style, it's difficult to beat.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Back to the spirit of the Black Pearl,"These Pirates films are all about entertainment and thankfully this latest adventure with Captain Jack Sparrow at the helm is back to basics, reminding me of the formula that made the very first one, Curse of the Black pearl so great. Don't worry I won't give anything away here but be aware that the opening 20 minutes is one funny sequence and quirky one liner after another. There is also a couple of hilarious cameos, one may be familiar but the other was a right royal shock. Depp walks through his lethargic swaying pirate character with ultimate ease, while new high seas bad boy Blackbeard is exceptional, but not as cool as Sparrows former flame played by Cruz. She is foxy, feisty and funny. The action is elevated by some wonderful 3D effects but I am sure the film would be just as rocking without it. Finally, the highlight is the Mermaid scenes. As dark as they are, they take the viewer into their web of intrigue. Australian Gemma Ward even sings during an evocative moment. Remember to stay on after the credits for an EXTRA scene. After the last two installments left me crying with disappointment, I Loved it.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A boring lackluster installment to a series that fell off the world's end.,"So after a 4 year hiatus Disney decides to bring back Captain Jack Sparrow. A huge fan of the first one and moderately enjoyed the second one and confused by the third one I was ready to see a fresh crew for the this new installment.The films opening scene was fantastic. It was fun and creative and really captured the essence of the Jack Sparrow that we love. It kept going for a bit. The first 20 minutes of the movie were the most exciting and fun parts of the movie except for one scene which I feel may be second best scene in all the Pirates films.The infamous addition of mermaids was the best part in the entire film. It was very reminiscent of the powerful underwater march of the dead from the first film.Lets move onto the acting. Most of it was decently solid but Ian McShane as the villain, Black Beard stole the show. He actually seemed like the only one who cared to make the film interesting. Another newcomer to the series was Penelope Cruz. She was nothing fantastic but completely necessary to bring in a much needed sex appeal to the film. Geoffrey Rush returned as Barbosa, I felt he was very confused as to if he was a bad guy or good guy which caused his acting to seem very indifferent. There were a few scenes that you knew he was having fun but otherwise he was just a drag. And of course Johnny Depp reprized his role as the witty fun loving Captain Jack Sparrow. Again he had his moments just like Barbosa that were fun and creative but he even came up a little lackluster in certain scenes.The story was super simple, which I guess is understandable considering the convoluted mess of 2 and 3.There was an unnecessary sub plot that never got resolved, which I wish they spent a little more time on and made it a little darker. I am not going to spoil anything though, but you will see what I am talking about when you see the film. As you wait for the scene after the credits you want it to be the conclusion to this sub plot but nope. The climax could have been a bit more climatic and more exciting, but I guess they did what they could. Most of the action happens in the dark so I would not recommend the 3D transfer of it. I saw it in 2D and I thought the 3D wouldn't be worth it.Marshall did a mediocre job directing. It was nothing special and definitely not Gore Verbinski. The way the film turned out, it looked like the director was even bored while shooting.Positively though it is a summer blockbuster where your brain needs to be left at home and will be enjoyed by lovers of the series. It may not stay with you but for an hour and half of the movie out of the 2+ running time you will be enjoying yourself which I guess is not too bad.On initial reaction to the film I gave it a 7/10 because at the time it was enjoyable. Then I thought about it and the reason I almost fell asleep twice was not because it was late, it was because the story was boring and nothing was really happening in this lengthy piece of work. Therefore on second reaction it gets a 5/10.If they continue the series, which I am sure they will seeing as how this film will make bank over the weekend, they need to trim out the unnecessary sub plots that do nothing for the story except let it drag on and if anything bring back the gorgeous and creepy mermaids. Also have a little faith in the audience, you can make the plot a little bit more thought provoking instead of laying all the pieces in front of us and then watching you put them together after we already know how to do the puzzle in our head.Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides 5/10 via The Reel KingFollow The Reel King on Tumblr for more reviews",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Pirates Lite,"With ""On Stranger Tides,"" the Pirates franchise gets to concentrate more on the character of Capt. Jack Sparrow. Johnny Depp really has this character down pat, and obviously has fun with it. Old characters are still there, such as Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), Gibbs and Jack's father, who are as we know them. But we also get to meet a woman from his past in the person of Angelica, who may or may not be Blackbeard's daughter. Honestly, I thought Penelope Cruz could not possibly be convincing as a pirate, but I was glad to be wrong. She could swashbuckle with the rest of them pirates.While the relationship between Sparrow and Angelica was more on the comedy level, a new romantic pair was also introduced in the characters of the compassionate missionary Philip (Sam Claflin) and the mysterious Syrena (Astrid Berges-Frisbey). While I read a lot of criticism about how useless this angle was to the film, I actually felt the scenes of these new characters were well-executed by new director Rob Marshall. I do not think they bog the storyline down at all.""On Stranger Tides"" features a race to the Fountain of Youth which was a great concept. We watched in 3D and I was glad to see that these were not mere post-production effects, and they lasted the whole movie. The 3D was certainly not a rip-off in this one! Those fight and chase scenes in the palace of the mad King George were amazingly shot. The special effects of the pirates encounter with mermaids contribute well to the eerie and menace of those scenes.This was the first Pirates movie that my two boys watched with me. After watching, I felt that indeed this film was the best way to introduce the Pirates to kids. It is shorter, lighter and faster-paced than the first three more ""serious"" films, which are more adult in orientation. This is not to mean that ""Tides"" is a lesser film quality though. I would think it could launch a trilogy of its own for its new fans.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Probably better than it should have been,"In movies, as in marriage, the fourth go-around can get a little tricky. As the fourth round approaches there's an apprehension of what has come before and what is new that is left to be discovered. Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, the third sequel in Disney's highly-successful series, is not a movie that I went into with much anticipation. Yet, as I always do, I allowed myself to be open minded (you never know when a movie will surprise you) and I found the movie quite enjoyable.My apprehension comes from the experience of the previous films, which I complained were too long and so overwritten as to become convoluted. That's not good for what should be a simple pirate movie. Having left behind many of the familiar characters (Orlando Bloom, Kiera Knightly and Jonathan Price are absent this time), the movie is free to find new characters and a new arena to play in. With that, this is a kind of trimmed down POTC movie.The movie finds the ever-plucky sea-going rascal Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) once again in trouble with the King's court and about to be executed. That is, until one of his crew produces a map to the fabled Fountain of Youth, rumored to have been found 200 years before by the Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de Le√≥n. Jack makes a spectacular escape and the race is on race to find the fountain, which is headed off first by the Spanish fleet and then by the British fleet. Trailing them are Jack and his nemesis Captain Barbossa (Oscar-winner Geoffrey Rush), who is a privateer under the orders of King George II (Richard Griffiths). Then there is Angelica (Oscar winner Penelope Cruz), who is first mate on the ship captained by Blackbeard (Ian McShane) - whose beard is actually gray, but never mind.The plot to get to the fountain of youth is probably more complicated than it needs to be. Getting to the fountain is easy enough, but then we learn that it is not a simple matter of taking a dip and becoming younger, no. First, Jack learns, you must first get two goblets belonging to Ponce de Le√≥n, then you have to mix it with the tears of a mermaid, then (I think I have this right), one person has to drink from one cup to become younger and then another person has to drink from the other and they will die. Something along those lines. As I said, it is more complicated than it needs to be.The plot, as in the previous installments, is somewhat superfluous. There really isn't a need to get to the fountain of youth. There probably wasn't any need for mermaids that can suck your blood, nor, all that stuff about voodoo and shrinking massive ships until you can fit them into bottles. Yet, what I have learned about this series is that the plot really doesn't matter. These films are constructed more as a series of set pieces rather than a narrative plot. I appreciated the mermaids but, this being a Disney film, the all-out boob-fest that should have ensued sadly never materializes.What keeps this series popular is quality control. Johnny Depp maintains the same swagger and slurry charm that he had in the previous films. He keeps from taking the film too seriously but avoids the temptation to make fun of the character. The first film got him his first Oscar nomination, and justifiably so. Eight years, and three sequels later, Depp maintains the fun spirit of the character and doesn't allow it to grow routine. Neither does Geoffrey Rush, in his third go-around as Captain Barbossa, which he plays with an evil wink and a pirate accent that he practically chews on. Penelope Cruz gives a nice performance here and proves - to me at least - that she should have been the female protagonist of the series all along instead of Kiera Knightly. Yet, I was surprisingly underwhelmed by Ian McShane's performance as Blackbeard. McShane is a wonderful actor but somehow Blackbeard seems subdued. He is pure evil, right down to the buckles on his boots but the character doesn't leap out with the lip-smacking vileness that I had hoped. The movie pins the character down as if they are introducing him to be in a future movie.""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides"" is probably the best of the series since the first one. That is thanks to a leaner script and, mercifully, a shorter running time (it is actually an hour shorter than the last one). I could complain about it all day long, but I would rather confess that I was more entertained by this film than I was by the previous two.Disney has found a gold mine with this series. Convoluted as these movies are, they do have an audience and I am glad to see anything that gets movie fans excited. Yet, there is a feeling that this series may be wrapping up. Johnny Depp has said that he is growing tired of playing Jack Sparrow (although it does not come out in his performance) and that may bring about an end to this ""Pirates"" series. With that, I started thinking that maybe Disney would do well to move on to something else, maybe Treasure Island, Captain Blood, The Sea Hawk, Moby Dick. Maybe the same fun-loving spirit that made this series so popular could be given to those classics as well.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Better than the third,"POTC-OST is not the best of the series, but it is a step in the right direction. If you, like me, were very disappointed with the third Pirates movie then I do not blame you for wanting to skip out on this one. In fact I was considering not seeing this one myself, especially when the critics reviews came out. I decided to give it a chance, primarily because I had seen the other ones. I was pleasantly surprised and ending up liking the movie. One of the major differences between this and the other Pirates movies (and it is one everyone is going to notice right off the bat) is that Orlando Bloom and Kiera Knightely are not in this movie. I am not too disappointed, there story overtook the third Pirates movie, which is part of the reason I did not like it. I was also sick of Knightely terrible speech scenes (if you saw the third you know exactly what I mean). Furthermore a few other pirates who were franchise regulars were missing in this one. What is left from the original three is Jack, Barbosa, Gibbs and the monkey makes two brief cameo appearances.There was a number of things wrong with the third Pirates movie, among them was the fact that it was long, or it felt long at least. This movie is the shortest of the Pirates films and it moves at a brisk pace. The third Pirates slowed down considerably in the middle, to the point it was almost unbearable to watch. This movie does not make that mistake. This movie is almost all action and because of this it did not feel long, at least in my opinion.As usual the effects were great. The action is almost nonstop and when there is no action there is enough going on to keep the audience interested. There is also plenty of signature Jack Sparrow humor. Since the previous two (especially the third) were focused almost entirely on the story of Will and Elizabeth Jack was almost forgotten. Another reason the third suffered. It was great to have that story out of the way, because this movie is focused on Jack and that is a strength.Despite the fact that it improved on a number of the things that made the third bad, this one still is not up to par with the original.

A Nutshell Review: On Stranger Tides,"I thought this film would never have happened, since the first three films wrapped themselves up pretty nicely as a trilogy, but I suppose studios never say no to profits there for the taking, especially if the point man in Johnny Depp is game to don his eyeliner and pirates garb one more time, and possible more films lined up since the final scenes and the coda after the end credits blatantly teases and flirts with its audience and fan base.Captain Jack Sparrow (Depp) is back to charm one and all with this swagger and wit, and this time sans his Black Pearl as he goes on a mission, or at least it's one of those self fulfilling rumours, that he's assembling a crew to set sail on a quest to locate the proverbial Fountain of Youth. As with what's characteristic of a Pirates of the Caribbean movie, there are always more than one party interested in either joining in or serving as competition, and here we have an English royalty keen on recruiting Jack amongst their ranks to led by Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), now an English privateer, the Spanish Inquisition team who are narratively the weakest of the lot save for one pivotal scene, and a true blue pirates outfit led by the villainous Blackbeard (Ian McShane) aboard his Queen Anne's Revenge ship, with his daughter Angelica (Penelope Cruz) as his first mate and one time ex-fling of Jack's tasked with luring the latter out and joining their quest rather reluctantly.But everyone has ulterior motives, and in true Jack Sparrow fashion, the character relationships all play out like the reality game show Survivor as in previous films, where deals are cut, some allegiances are strongly forged while others being temporarily serving mutual self-interests of the moment. Part of the fun is to witness how Sparrow navigates through sticky situations and almost always come up tops, with the nagging suspicion that Fate smiles on his side consistently, seemingly having no plan at all when he embarks on various mini quests in gathering artifacts all geared toward the primary mission, from the capture of mermaids (and they're of the nasty in attitude variety) to chalices all part of a strange ritual required to get to the secret fountain everyone is craving for.Joining the fray this time round are old hands such as Geoffrey Rush in bringing a lot more to the Barbossa character, and Gibbs (Kevin McNally) as Jack Sparrow's loyal and trusty first mate. Penelope Cruz becomes one of two token female characters here, although her real life pregnancy created some complications during the shoot, and the credits had to thank her sister Monica Cruz for standing in for the long shots so that there wouldn't be a need to hide that bulge in the tummy - it's quite obvious which scenes these were as her character's hat had to be tipped downwards. You can also tell that the presence of Sam Claflin and Astrid Berges-Frisbey as a priest and mermaid respectively were to counterbalance the loss of Orlando Bloom's Will Turner and Keira Knightley's Elizabbeth Swann as the film's requisite lovebirds, which developed too fast too soon, and left it hanging, possibly to be explored in greater detail in subsequent films.As an action adventure, the action sequences if compared to the previous installments, have all been toned down, and are the same old routine often seen in other action adventures. Do we need another escape on a chariot, or yet another big brawled sword fight sans blood (this is a Disney film after all) with nary a vulgar word spoken as they are cut off at the right moment? Too many one on one swordfights amongst various characters also made this quite repetitive to sit through, and I'd secretly enjoyed more of the dramatic wheelings and dealings more than the action in this film, despite the middle portion sagging under its own talkie weight.Gore Verbinski had given up the director's chair to allow for new blood to take over the helm and steer the franchise into a new direction, so enter Rob Marshall, whom I'd say has the unenviable task of continuing a very well loved, and profitable series of films. While the direction may be new and the storyline necessary to be branching off from where it left off, somehow On Stranger Tides failed to recreate the entire adventurous spirit that the original trilogy possessed. Perhaps it's the cutting down on funding that made the action sequences quite dull, also having to shoot those scenes in 2D before undergoing 3D conversion to keep costs down.Sure the storyline is an adventure film for fans to follow up on the exploits of Jack Sparrow, but it sure felt more of the same with that air of familiarity not broken. Should another film be made, let's hope it has some of the swashbuckling cavalier feel to it rather than just another exercise of routine.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A solid addition to the fleet.,"Stranger Tides brings tidings from strangers in this extension of a  1-part turned 3-part franchise, now pitted to carry on into its sixth  instalment of the saga. Rob Marshall steps in to take the helm as  director, as Johnny Depp continues his reign as the titular Jack  Sparrow. No longer legend for his captaincy, we find Sparrow in London  amidst the largest collection of known British actors outside of Harry  Potter. After rescuing first mate Gibbs (he's the one who slept with  the pigs) from hanging under Sparrow's name, our swaggering  swashbuckler discovers there's a new Jack in town.  Meanwhile an arms race is taking place between the Brits (led by  Geoffrey Rush's now peg- legged Barbossa), the Spaniards, and big ol'  Blackbeard to find the Fountain of Youth. Pretty self-explanatory,  their motives and maps are laid out in a series of hops back and forth  from exposition to rehashed sword-fight and chase sequences through the  streets of London. While Jack's runaways are more Austin Powers than  Bond, the swift swish of metal is far preferable to Verbinski's  interminable distraction with ship battles in parts 2 and 3. It takes a  long time to get to the captain crossover and corrupt bargaining that  the first film did so well, with a race to the finish opposed to a  tactical playoff. But, warming up to a reunion between Sparrow and  Barbossa, it's the archival camaraderies that bring out the best in the  remaining key characters. It's in this unlikely union you'll find most  of the laughs.  Penelope Cruz and Ian McShane team up as Sparrow's ex-lover Angelica  and evil buccaneer Blackbeard, though her needy deception and his  one-note barbarism don't liven up proceedings as much as Will and  Elizabeth's foolish frivolities have in prequels past. In a despairing  attempt to plug the gap, too much is made of an attraction between a  random mercenary and mermaid - by the by, a depiction of the mythical  creatures is too close to a Lynx advert for comfort, and the key to a  center-piece so pointless that it's almost a relief that CG was  similarly cut and plugged with slow-searing 3D effects.  Hingeing heavily on Sparrow's well-documented improvisation, many of  the set-pieces are fun and nimble, though frustratingly hampered by  needless 3D which knocks the pace of the action sequences. Hans  Zimmer's ever-excellent score pulls together all the rogue threads,  keeping well within the range of the first film and injecting a  vigorous dose of fun. Restrained and keeping convention, Pirates 4 is  far from heading up the franchise, but remains a solid addition to the  fleet.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Captain Jack is back and helps this pirate move float.,"I was not expecting this one to be quite as good as it turned out mainly because of the review I read of it that made it seem really bad. I have to disagree with that review, however, as I found it a good movie, better than the second and third installments of this film, but not as good as the still best first one. This one sort of picks up after the third one in that the object of everyone's desire is the fountain of youth as the pirate Blackbeard, the English and the Spaniards are after this most magical of places. For the waters of youth to work one most first get two silver chalices and a mermaids tears. Jack at the moment is in England, but he shall get around quite a lot in this one. His old nemesis and sometimes partner Barbossa is also back this time seemingly in league with the English. The action in this one is rather good and Captain Jack Sparrow is once again the best character, only this time he is the main guy with no others taking time away from him in bunches like the previous two installments. The scenery in areas of the film is just really gorgeous once they get to the area of the fountain of youth. There is also a very nice mermaid scene to be seen as well, just enjoyed most of the film. Granted there are questions one has while watching this film such as Blackbeard's mysterious powers that are not really explained and if it was I missed it, however I had questions like this one for all three of the other movies too. So a good movie, better than Pirates 2 and 3 for me and a nice ending to boot. I do not know this one just flowed better than the previous two pirate movies. At least for me, the one review made this film sound very slow and not all that entertaining aside from a couple of scenes. I guess I just enjoyed seeing Captain Jack Sparrow back sans Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly who I feel had to much screen time in parts two and three.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The best since the original Pirates,"I would like to begin by saying that I very rarely review films anymore, but after reading many reviews for this film by various critics I felt compelled to give my own verdict. Purely because every review I have read has been unnecessarily venomous, and simply seemed to trash the film and its two predecessors at every given opportunity. I am a fan of the Pirates trilogy, the original is by far the best, and three may have some problems with its convoluted storyline, but there is nothing wrong with Dead Man's Chest and as a trilogy they all worked very well. This fourth instalment like the others is great fun, the storyline may not be Oscar worthy stuff but neither was the storyline in the others. It is an entertaining fantasy flick that you can sit back, relax and enjoy. The idea that Johnny Depp has become bored of the character of Jack Sparrow and plays him in this film as a shadow of his former self, is simply ludicrous. Depp is on top form in this movie, brilliant for me considering following the awful performance in Alice in Wonderland I had begun doubting him somewhat. On Stranger Tides is easily the best movie since the original, and I would be more than happy to sit through another two films.Now onto the performances. As previously mentioned Depp is simply outstanding as Jack Sparrow. By putting him to the forefront means we get to spend more time with him, though thankfully the writers hold back on having him on screen too much. His one liners, especially one involving a Spanish Convent had me in stitches. His relationship with Angelica (Penelope Cruz) really adds that extra bit of spice to the film. It also helps that Cruz and Depp have outstanding chemistry together. While the character of Angelica can be a bit complicated at times, her motives are vague at best, this can be overshadowed by the fact Cruz plays her with some real gusto. Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa for me really stole the show, and it seems the writers gave him quite a bit more storyline this time as well. The idea of moving him to the kings navy really played off, and his scenes for me were definitely a highlight of the film. Ian McShane is a great villain, while not as good as Davey Jones or Barbossa for that matter, he still has a great storyline and some really menacing moments to make him a worthy adversary.My one major issue with this movie would be the storyline of the missionary and the mermaid. While thankfully it isn't given enough screen time to be a really annoyance, I do question its point in the first place. Keira Knightly and Orlando Bloom are not remotely missed, so why try a romance replacement which just isn't that good. The mermaid action scene however is a thing to behold. As said the storyline is not amazing, the quest for the fountain of youth is entertaining and it has less betrayals than the far too long At World's End, but it isn't a story that will be winning awards. Nevertheless it maintains your interest and never feels like an excuse to get to the next action scene as it was in something like Transformers 2. The fact it is a one story arc is also a nice breath of fresh air following the second and third movies. Overall this is a great Summer movie, the kids will love it, and if you're a pirates fan you will also love it. The trashing of this film to me is slightly irritating as this is genuinely a very good film that deserves recognition. I will stand by the Pirates films until I genuinely see one that is rubbish, this film is a great Summer blockbuster and anyone that looks at it otherwise must either be deluded or trashing on it because they no longer see Pirates as ""cool"". I cannot recommend this film quite enough, just go out, watch it and have a great laugh, I know I did.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Worth the Watch But Not Amazing,"I have to say I was really looking forward to Pirates of the Caribbean 4, I really enjoyed Curse of the Black Pearl.Then Dead Man's Chest and At World's End were good, but there was room for improvement.POTC: On Stranger Tides was full of action. The beginning is quite good but I struggled to get to grips with where we were since the last film. I soon got into it and it was good to see familiar faces! Depp and Rush were amazing as always and there's some pretty good new faces too! However - I did feel there were too many action sequences, and there's so many different groups of people going after the Fountain of Youth it becomes very confusing. I also felt it was difficult to understand why each person/group of people were going after the fountain? It also lacked the humour of The Curse of the Black Pearl.On the positive side again - we learn a lot more about Jack's character. But I perhaps feel he wasn't involved enough...But I would advise watching it. I will definitely buy the DVD and am looking forward to POTC 5!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Washed Up Franchise,"In London, Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) escapes from the soldiers that are chasing him and learns that an impostor is recruiting a crew and a vessel using his name. He meets the impersonator and finds that she actually is Angelica (Pen√©lope Cruz), a woman that he had seduced in a convent in Seville. Jack is abducted and when he awakes aboard, the ship is sailing, Angelica tells him that her father, the pirate Blackbeard (Ian McShane), is cursed and he needs to find the legendary Ponce de Leon's Fountain of Youth to save his life. They force Jack, who knows the location of the fountain, to guide them.Meanwhile, Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) is hired by King George to lead the British crew and dispute against the Spaniards and Blackbeard who arrives first in the fountain. But along their dangerous quest, they need to find first two chalices that belonged to Ponce de Leon and a tear of mermaid.""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides"" is a disappointed adventure of a washed up franchise. I have just watched this film with my wife and son on DVD and we three had taken naps along the 136 minutes running time. The film has good cast but without Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom; top-notch special effects but the problem is the boring and weak story. I hope the producers have the decency to stop this franchise.

Pirates of the Carribbean 4 3D is simple-minded and fun,"I must say I enjoyed Gore's Pirates of the Carribbean trilogy very much. Although the third one is crammed with many characters and confusing story plots, I still had a great time watching ships being wrecked apart. When a forth movie is announced, I was wary of it as I thought Gore has already concluded his vision. I did not actually show much interest in watching it until I heard it is shot in 3D and I am a big 3D fan. Pirates of the Carribbean: On Stranger Tides is an entertaining ride and much more simpler than the bloated At World's End.The story: Johnny Depp returns to his famous role, witty Captain Jack. His friend, Gibbs is back. Barbossa returns too. And these are the only characters that are back for a forth outing. Jack is still as witty as ever. Characters wise is okay. Some characters are under-used like the mermaids. Those action fans who expect Gore's visual and epic battles scenes will be a little bit disappointed in here. Rob Marshall goes for smaller yet still thrilling action set pieces. On the note of ships wrecking, there is none here. Story wise is alright. The pace moves decently. Critics and audience who complained that the previous movie is too bloated now do not need to wreck their brains with characters and confusing/long-winded side plots. Hans Zimmer is top-notch here again with the famous Pirates of the Caribbean music. As a 3D fan, I was a little disappointed with its usage of 3D. Shots of scenery are good but when it comes to the action, it lacks of the visual effects it is supposed to have and in your face moments. I have to admit that this is a bit too long for a 3D movie, struggling to keep the 3D glasses on top of my glasses and craning my neck like in Avatar.Overall: It is another Pirates and blockbuster movie to whet movie-goers's appetite. Of course, it is not like the Gore's movies or even as big as his but this still stand up with Rob's different directions. This might start up another series as this will no doubt earn a lot in box office.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good and enjoyable,"I expected more spectacular and impressive film. Movie is good and enjoyable, is also completed, unlike other parts. Many helps 3D effect. The best moments are collected in advertising the film. However, it should be seen, one of the mandatory. Penelope stood not particularly well. Interestingly, once again, Depp is not presented as a leader, but the entire film rests on Depp. I do not see how the movie will be extended without losing the magic. In my opinion, should be scored another strong character. Depp to present itself as an adult who instructs his grandson Charlie Sheen:). The new target of the pirates may be to find Atlantis and come into collision with pirates from other planets.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Welcome back Pirates of the Caribbean!,"I thought the first Pirates film was excellent, the second one started to confuse me a little however I still very much enjoyed it while the third film was so confusing and I was beginning to fear the worst...however the reason I say welcome back was that after the third film it had seemed there would be no return for the franchise, however now with a much simpler story than the third and still maintaining the action, humour and still an intense storyline this franchise has well and truly taken off once more.The return of Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush with Penelope Cruz and Ian McShane added to the cast creates an experience not to be missed. With much more focus on Captain Jack Sparrow you know the film was heading in the right direction, the film grips the audience from start to finish (I was lucky enough to go see the first seeing in the cinema) and while it was first thing in the afternoon the turnout was still good.I throughly enjoyed the film and I suggest everyone who thinks this will be the same as the third one IT IS NOT!

"It's great, even the 3D effects!","This film is about Captain Jack Sparrow and his coerced voyage to find the fountain of youth that is heavily sought after by various individuals and even countries.People in Hong Kong are lucky to get ""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides"" earlier than the United States, and even luckier is that most cinemas here already have evening shows the day before its official release.""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides"" has very good 3D effects. I have not watched a lot of 3D movies, but this is easily the best I have seen. Instead of the layered 2D effects that they call 3D, ""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides"" has real 3D that gives you the feeling that you really are there at the scene, watching events unfold.The plot is easily understandable, straightforward but very engaging. It's more action and adventure this time than previous instalments. It's also more funny, even adult humour finds its way into this Disney production (involving a comment on the viewpoint of a missionary). The mermaids are visually stunning, and I really thought the first mermaid is Amanda Seyfried, but it's a woman called Gemma Ward.Of course, the ending paves way for a sequel.

If you like the other films you'll be happy with this one,"Captain Jack Sparrow(Johnny Depp) is at it again in this grandiose pirate adventure in a quest to find the fabled fountain of youth. Barbossa(Geoffrey Rush) is back too minus a leg. He has given up his pirate ways and is now in the pay of the British Navy as a privateer in the hopes that they will beat the Spanish to the fountain. Whilst this race is going on Captain Jack meets up with old flame Angelica(Pen√©lope Cruz) hot as ever and is taken captive on her father Blackbeard's(Ian McShane) boat who is also on the hunt for said fountain.This story is back to a basic plot after the more complicated 2&3 of the series and this has been a good move. Depp is as good as ever in what is now his most famous character and Rush is back in flying form. Gibbs, Captain Jack's crew master is back too and helps maintain the feel of the series. McShane is wonderfully cast as the villainous blackbeard and one is reminded of his character in 'Deadwood'.If you enjoyed the rest of the series you will be happy with this one and if you felt the 2nd and 3rd of the series got bogged down a bit with overcomplicated plots you will find this a refreshing change back to the form of the original.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Captain Jack is Back!,"Crossing paths with the enigmatic Angelica, Captain Jack Sparrow is not sure if it's love-or if she's a ruthless con artist who's using him to find the fabled Fountain of Youth. When she forces him aboard the ""Queen Anne's Revenge,"" the ship of the legendary pirate Blackbeard, Jack finds himself on an unexpected adventure in which he doesn't know whom to fear more: Blackbeard or Angelica, with whom he shares a mysterious past. -- (C) DisneyPOTC4 is not better than POTC and POTC2, which goes without saying. However, I'm happy to say that it is easily better than the overlong and overbloated POTC3. On top of the fact that this is essentially a reboot of the series (you'll be hearing that a lot this year), POTC4 is quite enjoyable than one might expect in what seems to be a tired and prolonged series! Even though Gore Verbinski is out of the director's chair, Rob Marshall keeps the film consistent with the previous films in terms of style and returning characters, including the great Captain Jack Sparrow. However, even though it is the shortest film in the series, it still felt very bloated like the previous films. 30 minutes could have been easily cut out in the film's first hour, which unfortunately dragged quite a bit. However, once the mermaids come in, everything starts to pick up fairly quickly, and the film ends up being a really enjoyable action-adventure, a feeling which was absent in POTC3.And speaking of mermaids, they are one of the best and most unique parts of the film so much so that I wish they were in the story much longer than one 10-minute sequence. Still, the film doesn't suffer once they are gone. In fact, the second half of the film is just as entertaining with a climax that's just plain fun. Johnny Depp returns, playing the role that he's probably most well known for. Even the fourth time around, I still enjoy his antics and clever, funny lines. I don't think it'll ever get old. Geoffrey Rush also returns as Barbossa, although he seemed a little tired and old in here. There are some new members in the cast, most notably Pen√©lope Cruz and Ian McShane. I thought Cruz brought some life in the film, and she made the story a little more interesting. I didn't find McShane to be any special, but he wasn't bad either. There's also Sam Claflin and Astrid Berges- Frisbey, who I thought had a sweet (albeit unnecessary) romance subplot.As with any Pirates film, POTC4 has some great set pieces, although the action seems to happen in a much smaller scale than the previous films, which didn't bother me. The effects for the mermaids are really great as well. Hans Zimmer's soundtrack is as loud and bombastic as ever, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. It just wasn't different or new. Overall, although POTC4 isn't the great return to form everyone was hoping for, it's still a huge improvement over POT3. The addition of Cruz is also a huge plus and seeing her and Depp's interplay is pretty great. If you wanna have a fun time at the theater, you can do a lot worse. Also, wait until the scene after the end credits if you want to see the inevitable open ending to POTC5. 6.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Exceeds low expectations,"Let's face it. The Pirates of the Caribbean movies aren't really awful, but they are no longer the ground-breaking spectacle that the original was. So it was with lowered expectations that I watched the latest effort, and I can gladly say that the movie exceeded those low expectations. Damning with faint praise? Yes.This time around, we've lost the characters of Will and Elizabeth, which is a good thing. I don't know about the rest of you, but I was getting tired of the triangle they formed with Jack Sparrow. The two characters were just getting annoying and in the way of Johnny Depp, so when their stories were pretty definitively ended at the conclusion of the third movie, I was happy. Taking Elizabeth's place as the story's heroine is Angelica, daughter of Blackbeard and played by the luminous Penelope Cruz. Like Elizabeth Swan, Angelica can kick butt and take names; the difference is that Cruz is far more convincing in the role than Keira Knightley ever was in her. Cruz's presence gives the franchise a much-needed jolt of fiery Latin temper, to use a clich√© that happens to fit nicely here.As for the character of Will Scarlett, the noble Everyman/blacksmith played by Orlando Bloom, his replacement would probably be the clergyman who finds himself in the service of Blackbeard, trying valiantly to ""save"" him. As the movie progressed, I began to sense that Philip the Good would somehow let slip the bonds of his faith and fall for someone. I knew that someone wouldn't be Angelica the daughter of Blackbeard, and a quick glance at the trailer showed me his eventual target. So, like Scarlett before him, Philip finds love where he never thought he'd find it. Trouble is, that relationship was starkly uninteresting to me. I'm not sure if Sam Claflin, who played the character, or the screenwriters, is to blame, but boy and howdy was that part of the plot a giant bore. If there's a Pirates 5 ‚Äì and who are we kidding, of course there must be ‚Äì I hope Philip and his new love don't make an appearance.So what made this one palatable, anyway? You minus the two more wearisome characters from the last one and add a temptress, and you're good to go. Plus you add in Ian McShane as the diabolical Blackbeard, and he's an actual bad guy, unlike Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), who's jumped sides about as often as Jack Sparrow himself ‚Äì and here begins the movie in the employ of the British King.The stunts are well staged as usual, and good use was made of the location shooting on Oahu and Puerto Rico. Never let it be said that a Pirates movie wasn't fun to look AT. But an added benefit for me was that I watched the movie in 2D, even though it was also available in 3D. Why, you ask? Well, I'm glad you asked, Imaginary Reader. You see, when a movie is shot in 3D, the 3D process absorbs some of the light; therefore, if a movie features scenes in darkened environs ‚Äì like caves, the ocean blue, underwater, jungles ‚Äì then it'll be so dark that one will have a lot of trouble seeing what's going on. And for this you'd pay an extra few dollars. Ain't worth it. So if you do see this in 3D, you may want dial this rating down a notch.Overall, the movie ‚Äì and the franchise ‚Äì owes quite a bit to Mr. Depp. Yes, he IS Jack Sparrow, and it's impossible to imagine the movie without him. And even though this is his fourth go-round as Sparrow, Johnny Depp's enthusiasm doesn't seem to flag a bit; he sells the character wholeheartedly and joyfully. He is, as usual, a lot of fun to watch.Oh, yes, the plot. Nutshell: Barbossa (with the British), the Spanish, and Blackbeard (with zombies on his crew, of course) are all trying to find the Fountain of Youth. Sparrow had the map, Mr. Gibbs ‚Äì Sparrow's first mate all these movies ‚Äì memorized it and burned it, and there you go. And there's a prophecy about a one-legged man, and there are mermaids. It's like Harry Potter without house elves.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
On Better Tides,"If in 2007 Pirates of the Caribbean 'At Worlds End' left you at your 'wits end', then it's understandable that you may have reservations about seeing the fourth instalment of this hugely popular franchise.The aptly named 'On Stranger Tides' certainly is in uncharted waters, as this chapter is the first Pirate movie not to star Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley and the first not to be Directed by Gore Verbinski also known for directing such films as 'The Ring' and more recently; 'Rango'.The film starts with Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) in London on a mission to save the always entertaining Gibbs (Kevin McNally) from an appointment with the gallows. Whilst there Jack crosses paths with a woman from his past (Penelope Cruz), who ends up trapping him aboard the Queen Anne's Revenge, ship of the most feared pirate 'Blackbeard' (Ian McShane) on a quest to locate the Fountain of Youth.Unfortunately the notorious Blackbeard is very badly portrayed by McShane with no real terror brought to the character like the previous Davy Jones; and with a 'mystic' zombie sidekick that is as pointless to the movie as the witch in Robin Hood ‚Äì Prince of Thieves; the film should really be walking the plank very early on.However, thanks to the star performer Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow, this movie is surprisingly good. Sure the movie doesn't have the best plot compared to the first two movies, but with the introduction of Penelope Cruz as the beautiful Angelica; Sam Claflin as Philip the hunky clergyman; and Stephen Graham providing the comedy effect as Scrum; this movie will have audiences won over.This movie is certainly one for all the family, and having just reached a staggering $256 million in its opening week, this franchise will probably return to continue another trilogy.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A fascinating and amusing pirates film set in 17th century with a lot of fun , and better than precedent sequels , the original ¬®Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003)¬® dealing with our sympathetic protagonists joining forces with the aim to free them of a damned spell , and it was inspired by the Walt Disney theme park ride and this ""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides (2011)"" being a decently made sequel . In this new outing Captain Jack is back undertaking breathtaking and dangerous feats , as Sparrow takes an unstopped race all around the world in a dangerous quest for the Youth Fountain .

The movie there is a homage to the pirates' films , paying tribute to classic pirate movies , adding lots of state-of-art computer generator special effects or CGI . The motion picture mingles adventures , action-packed , thrills , humor with tongue-in-cheek , rip-roaring , romance and results to be bemusing enough . The film runtime is overlong : two hours and some , but is neither boring , nor tiring but entertaining . The action is messy and repetitive and there's a slew of duels, rousing fencing and betrayals . As part of a franchise based on a theme park ride , this installment lives up to its heritage ordinary bouts of heart-pumping espectacle . As usual , Johnny Depp is the real star , he invests this overfed , action-tractioned swashbuckler with a voluptuous wit and fantasy enough . Johnny Depp plays Sparrow as a purring East End dandy by providing the necessary hilarious touches . Likewise , well starred by Penelop√© Cruz , she gives exuberance enough for her pirate queen role . Her villainous father is nicely played by veteran Ian MacShane as the scurvy elderly pirate who wants to take the Fountain at whatever cost and he won't stop at nothing to obtain it . They are finely accompanied by a good support cast , along with some habitual roles , such as : Kevin McNally, Sam Claflin , Astrid Berg√®s-Frisbey , Stephen Graham , Keith Richards , Richard Griffiths , Greg Ellis , Damian O'Hare , Anton Lesser , Roger Allam , √ìscar Jaenada , and of course , Geoffrey Rush as the formidable pirate Barbossa , and Judi Dench's brief cameo as a society lady .It displays colorful, glamorous cinematography by Dariuz Wolski and lavish production by Jerry Bruckheimer . Hans Zimmer's musical score as well as direction by Rob Marshall are well made . The Pirates of the Caribbean franchise is the tenth highest grossing franchise ever including similar actors and technicians . It is formed by the following ones : ¬®The Curse of Black pearl (2003)¬® by Gore Verbinski ; ¬®Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest¬®(2006) by Verbinski ; ¬®Pirates of the Caribbean : At World's End¬® (2007) by Verbinski ; ¬®Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides¬® (2011) by Rob Marshall ; ¬®Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales¬® (2017) by Joachim R√∏nning, Espen Sandberg.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Another Enjoyable Romp,"""The Pirates of the Caribbean"" series has now elevated itself into rarefied company where the story itself is of lesser importance than the star turn and adherence to the conventions which the story embodies. It has become a Piratical James Bond. ""On Stranger Tides"" proves to be an enjoyable and entertaining instalment in this series without ever troubling classic status.Johnny Depp IS Captain Jack Sparrow and without Orlando Bloom or Keira Knightley the focus is even more upon him this time. Neither of the latter two are missed, Penelope Cruz is an excellent new love interest as Angelica Malon, the only criticism is that we do not see enough of her, in both senses of the phrase. Her pregnancy during filming probably explains this.The opening 15 minutes in London is by far the strongest sequence as Captain jack impersonates a Judge, is arrested himself, inevitably escapes and then tries to round up a crew and a ship to search for the Fountain of Eternal Youth. Richard Griffiths plays a wonderfully louche King George, and when Jack encounters his Dad, Captain Teague played by Keith Richards in an Inn, you are just begging one or the other to pick up a mandolin from one of the musicians! Geoffrey Rush has a rewarding part as Barbossa gone straight with a letter of Marque from the King, Ian McShane is a little reserved as Blackbeard. The CGI sequences are used more sparingly this time around, and the film is all the better for it, a ""mermaid attack"" being the highlight. Directed by Rob Marshall of ""nine"" fame this is the first instalment not directed by Gore Verbinski, and he acquits himself well.The climax, the race for the Fountain of Youth, is for me a bit of an anti-climax and lacks dramatic tension, and the running time at 2hr 20min is a little long, but Depp's performance keeps things alive and leaves us wanting more ‚Äì as if there won't be!",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"The worst pirates yet, and really isn't a good movie in any way","The Pirates of the Caribbean is (was) a great series. The first movie was ingenious in the way it mixed humor with serious threats and interesting characters. The second movie was a lot more epic, had a giant kraken, more CGI, and really lived up to the first. The third movie dragged out way too long and had so much going on that it was hard to follow. Well the fourth is here and everyone is expecting something epic and... it fails.From the moment I heard the director of Chicago was making this movie I cringed, because I had no idea how this movie would turn out. The first rule about comedies, or any movie with a humorous main character is that you need a straight man (meaning serious, this has nothing to do with sexuality) but since Will Turner is not in this movie it is just Jack... and Jack alone doesn't really work. Jack was always our favorite character, but without a serious character to carry the plot Jack just feels off. To compensate for the lack of a straight character, Jack has to play a straight man and the comedian... at the same time. Also, Jack Sparrow in this movie doesn't seem as witty or clever as in the other movies, and the villain in this movie was laughable.Black Beard is the main antagonist in this movie, and he utterly fails as a villain compared to Barbossa, or to Davy Jones. Black Beard doesn't really seem all that threatening, all he has is a ship that he can control, and when he controls his ship with his sword it actually looks kind of stupid. One of the problems in this movie is that everyone's character is changed. Barbossa is now sort of a good guy which really doesn't make sense at all, and Jack Sparrow actually cringes when he sees people dying. There is one scene that seemed rather silly where black beard kills someone by using flamethrowers on his ship, and Jack Sparrow and everyone act like they have never seen someone die. In all of the other movies Jack Sparrow couldn't care less if he let people die, in the second movie he was willing to sell 100 souls to Davy Jones. Either way all of the characters seems off.There is this stupid love plot between a missionary and a mermaid which had absolutely, I MEAN ABSOLUTELY, nothing to do with the plot. It was just there and it made no sense. The missionary and the mermaid seemed to be there just for the sake of adding romance, but there is already some of that between Jack and Black Beard's daughter.Another problem with the movie is that action. This movie cannot compare to any of the other movies, and what made the other movies enjoyable were its humorous and unique battles. This movie has none, and there is this whole mermaid battle thing which seemed pretty weird. One of the biggest issues I had is that mermaid sunk a ship. THEY SUNK A SHIP! And they sunk it not by firepower, but by sheer weight... does anybody see a problem with that? There are no witty fights in this movie which is what we have come to expect from a pirates movie. Blackbeard has some zombie henchmen which have nothing to do with the story. Blackbeard also can apparently store ships in a bottle, and he has the black pearl... this makes no sense at all also, and it just seemed like it was thrown in at the last second. Besides wasn't the black pearl taken by Davy Jones, even though Davy Jones is dead.All in all this movie is only enjoyable for the sake of seeing a few of the pirates characters... actually that would be only three. Jack's dad, Jack, and Barbossa oh and Gibbs. Other than that you do no have the original cast. This movie was a waste of a good franchise, and hopefully no more pirates movies will be made unless they actually know what they are doing... oh yeah this movie was filmed in Hawaii and it is pretty obvious because the scenery looks so off. And a slight problem for some people is that this movie portrays real historical figures but fictionalizing them... that's not a big complaint but it is a little odd seeing as how Black Beard was a real person.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Back to basics and a smart choice. Could it be studios are wising up?,"I will say that I am a fan of all the PotC movies, the second one is probably my favourite...but my reasons for liking sequels to action films or comic book movies is usually that while the first one is usually the best, it sets up the characters, they all meet, develop relationships, etc. so the second film leaves more room for action and advancing stories. Which is the case for PotC. The first one is definitely the best executed, but I enjoyed the second one for its action, effects, humour, etc. My complaints about Pirates 2 and 3 were that they became so complex and ridiculous that they were just wayyyy out there. I had no trouble following the plot but I couldn't help but think that younger audience members wouldn't know what the hell was going on at all. Also, in the first film we're not entirely sure if Jack Sparrow is trying to screw people over to secure his own gains, or if he's helping himself by helping others. It's clearly stated by the end of the film that he's actually a good man. Yet in Pirates 2 and 3 he's blatantly trying to screw people over who had helped save him previously.So when I heard that a fourth pirates movie was in production, I wasn't thrilled. My main thought was ""Whatever, we'll see."" Once it was released I decided to go see it at the theatre and I was pleasantly surprised. The plot was straightforward, they're trying to find the fountain of youth and they list the steps needed to complete this. Jack is back to being the honestly dishonest (honestly) pirate we all came to love. There are mermaids, zombies (sort of) and of course the fountain of youth. But the plot never gets too complicated or completely ridiculous. My complaint about the film was the main villain Blackbeard wasn't fleshed out enough. He shows up fairly late into the film and he's never really shown to be the scariest pirate to sail the sea. Davy Jones and his crew were much more menacing.All in all, if the series continues with this pattern of keeping the movies simple and fun then I'm all for more of them being made.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Magic's still there.....,"In this fourth instalment in the POTC franchise, we see Captain Barbossa and Captain Jack Sparrow trying to locate the 'Fountain of Youth'. Barbossa's agenda is merely to recover the 2 chalices in order to appease his king. Captain Blackbeard (Ian McShane)also wants to discover the 'Fountain of Youth', but his agenda is to give himself eternal life. Along for the ride is Angelica Teach (Penelope Cruz) who is Blackbeard's daughter and an old flame of Sparrow's who also wants to get to the 'Fountain of Youth' to give herself life preserving qualities.One thing I really liked about this entry is that it is well and truly back on track. We have more Jack Sparrow, plenty of fun and we also don't have the overly complicated plotting which we saw in the third film. This entry packs plenty of energy and some stellar performances (once again Depp and Rush don't disappoint and are clearly the best elements of not only this film, but of the entire franchise). Kevin McNally was also really good in the role of Gibbs and both him and Depp played off really well against each other - the scenes between Depp and McNally were probably the best in the film. Cruz was OK, but she was not in the same league as Depp or Rush (but she's so hot so I can forgive her for her average acting performance). It was also nice to see Stephen Graham in a minor role - I personally feel that he is an excellent actor and a massively underrated one at that.One thing that's notable in this film is that there is virtually no CGI or special effects - this is not a criticism, in fact I welcomed it. It just goes to prove that these type of films don't need to rely on special effects to make a decent film. There seemed to be a lot of focus on the story and this entry (in terms of plotting and story structure) was much more cohesive than the third film.The only thing that really bothered me about this film was the silly sub plot involving the mermaid Syrena and that bloke from Blackbeard's gang (sorry can't remember his name, but there again his acting was fairly forgettable as well). The romance was not only totally unbelievable (not to mention contrived), but it was also uninteresting and ultimately went nowhere. I really wish this pathetic sub plot had not been included in an otherwise excellent film.In summary, this is an excellent entry in the franchise and is my second favourite film in the franchise (Curse of the Black Pearl is my favourite, but this comes in at a close second). I really enjoyed this film and I'm looking forward to the next entry in the franchise",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
My second favorite,"No devils, ghosts, or Davy Jones locker stuff to cheapen it. There are mermaids (which are awesome) and a better portion of the movie is somewhat realistic compared to the others. Sparrow isn't as funny... still is, but just not as. But that's okay because at least he's not drunk or completely useless like in one of the other movies. He has a role in the movie that MATTERS, and isn't just a stage prop. The story actually revolves around him (finally). Some may think it's a bad idea to make him star... but I think it's pretty fair. After all, for who else do we watch Pirates of the Caribbean?",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Jack Sparrow is back...but On Duller Tides I'm Afraid,"Just came back from a preview screening in London.I love the first 2 movies, and I even like the overly ambitious messy third one. I thought this film will try go back to the more witty grass roots that made the first film so enjoyable. Well the story is not as incoherent as the last 2 films but sadly, it is mostly unexciting, dull and pointless. The dialogue lacks the wit of previous entries and the narrative lacked focus. There were sparks of fun here and there but these moments are all too few. It all seemed too trying and stale. The supporting characters were even more dull, apart from Shane's Blackbeard. The action scenes were uninspiring but for some flashes of invention.Depp's Jack Sparrow has lost some magic but still maintains the spirit of the character that we love and is really the only thing that saves this movie.One more thing, this movie is darkly lit most of the time, so I strongly advise you not to see this in 3D. It made my experience of watching the movie even worse as it darkens the visuals further, robbing us of what I suspect to be some fine visuals. Furthermore, the action scenes become blurred. It felt like I was watching a really bad pirate video. So this is what cinema has succumbed to? What a painful death for my number one destination for escapism.Come to think of it, the atrocious 3D may have made me more cynical. Had I seen this in its 2D form, I might have enjoyed it more all round. So please consider watching in 2D so you are not put into a more cynical mood. I will watch it again in 2D and add a post edit to this review.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
What A Waste of a Good Novel,"I enjoyed Tim Powers' novel ""On Stranger Tides,"" and was hoping that Disney Studios would find a way to turn it into an decent ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" film. I was horrendously disappointed. They scarcely used anything at all from the novel. The film had no virtually no plot (and for those of you who may confuse plot with action, they are NOT the same thing), no rooting interest, and the least chemistry between the two leads that I have ever seen in a film in my entire life. It wasn't just that Depp's character and Lopez's characters did not seem to care about each other, they barely seemed to have met. They managed to make Blackbeard the pirate dull and nonthreatening. They made the life of a pirate slightly less thrilling than the life of a certified public accountant.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Jack Is Back.....,"I can imagine that many has been sitting with a feeling if the Pirates concept is going too far(Specially after POC nr.3) but thanks to a tight script this fourths installment of POC is definitely worth a watch.I personally didn't like the 3rd one cause of too much talk and confusion, but this one lives up to the first two.Jack Sparow and captain Barbosa are the scene stealer s, their chemistry is Top-Notch.

Background score is awesome and as usual...As my personal opinion , it is better than its immediate prequel (I didn't liked it much)...Finally a perfect movie from perfect franchise.....What else do you want from a perfect movie?Watch it for Depp's performance....

Sinking ship,"It's a funny thing about Johnny Depp. Perhaps more so than any other contemporary actor, people often view his presence in a movie as something of a mark of quality. I know many people who will see a film simply because he is the star, and until recently I might have understood why, even if I wouldn't go quite that far myself. However, since around the time of the first Pirates of the Caribbean film (2002's The Curse of the Black Pearl), I've found myself less and less impressed, or even interested at all, in almost anything he's done. I'm always willing to give a talented actor, particularly one with as many great performances under his belt as Depp, a chance to surprise me, and win back some credibility, and it was with this mindset that I went into On Stranger Tides. Unfortunately, but perhaps unsurprisingly, the latest entry in Disney's swashbuckling franchise is by far the worst yet, and my personal admiration for Johnny Depp has reached a new low.There's no denying that the success of the first POTC film came as something of a shock to many people, both critically and commercially. Before it's release, the idea of adapting a theme-park ride to film was seen as a creative death knell by an admittedly cynical part of the movie-going public (myself included), but the film defied critics to become one of the more memorable action-adventure blockbusters of the new millennium, and introduced Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow, one of modern cinema's most charming and appealing characters. On Stranger Tides works hard from the beginning to maintain the style and tone of the initial trilogy (all directed by Gore Verbinski), while simultaneously making it clear that this is a new story, albeit with a handful returning characters. The problem however, is that the new story is just too overloaded with new characters, vacuous action, and unnecessary, tedious subplots.It's very hard to gauge Captain Jack's motives in this film. He swings wildly between the selfish yet lovable rogue from the earlier stories, to a newly considerate and almost emotional hero which doesn't seem to fit at all. Jack was always the best element of the POTC franchise, and the unfortunate use of his character harms the movie irreparably. Geoffrey Rush returns also as Barbossa, alongside new characters Angelica (Penelope Cruz) and Blackbeard (Ian McShane), all talented actors who do their best with the poorly written dialogue, with McShane in particular standing out as a worthwhile addition to the cast. And then, there's newcomers Sam Claflin and Astrid Berges-Frisbey as the missionary Philip and mermaid Syrena. Where do I start with these two¬Ö..I guess there's a feeling in Hollywood that every story needs a romantic element to reach a wider audience, and indeed Verbinski's POTC films had the Will Turner/Elizabeth Swann thread successfully placed at the forefront of the narrative. Regrettably, new director Rob Marshall's (Chicago, Memoirs of a Geisha) attempt to replace Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley with these new young lovers is On Stranger Tides' greatest flaw, and any time attention is paid to their story, what little amount of fun and humour the film has is sucked completely away. The story progression grinds to a halt as we're subjected to this highly implausible and somewhat disturbing (beastiality anyone?) romantic plot between two characters who have no significant ties to Captain Jack, only one of which has any purpose in the movie at all. It's all simply a ploy to appeal to the mythical 'four quadrant' audience, and in this case it is unforgivable.That this movie will go on to make huge profits for Disney I have no doubt, and while there is a somewhat ambiguous ending in terms of further sequel prospects, I find it hard to believe that they will make the smart choice and retire Captain Jack and the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise before further damage is done. This film is of such low quality that it has actually changed how I feel about the series as a whole, and the first film in particular (which I previously loved), but the most unfortunate casualty for me is Depp's reputation. Hopefully he'll think twice before applying the makeup and donning the dreadlocks again, and abandon this sinking ship.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Weak Link,"Stranger Tides seemed tired. Johnny Depp seemed tired. The storyline seemed tired.Okay, you get the point. The movie as a stand alone may have got a slightly higher score from me, but it must be compared to its brilliant predecessors. In the end, Stranger Tides failed to carry on the swashbuckling enjoyment of the previous episodes.This movie seems to be made for profit only. Alright, all movies are made for profit, but I really got the feeling that they knew no matter what, this movie would make them money.The cast was good, but not excellent. For the first time, I felt the story was forced.A good movie, but not as good as what came before.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Long with little suspense.,"What i missed in this motion picture is story and of course the Pearle. They should have kept with the pirates and the old characters. I'm a nostalgic and love to see the good old guys show up, it gives me a more secure feeling about the movie. Jack was more of a fetish for the lady's and Penelope tried to hard to be one for the male audience. The only guy i felt safe with was Barbossa and he developed a good curve in his story and was by far the most interesting one. What johnny was doing in the first two Pirates of The Caribbean was to make Jack like a drunk pirate who was always in the wrong place to the right time, now he was just a guy walking around doing obvious thing and predictable.The 3D effects was mildly good, unfortunately i was put one third to the side of the theater so i did not feel the 3D as good as i would from the center. But it did not live up to my favorite 3D movies like ""How to Train Your Dragon"" or ""TRON:LEGACY"".Short summary:I was not satisfied by this movie, far from it. The most disappointing was Jack Sparrow, i put eight hours in a marathon this weekend to charge mi pirate mood. I missed the many fun and good characters but left with a good hope for the next part of this epic franchise.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Captain Sparrow has lost his ""muchness""","Well, it seems that IMDb limits these reviews to only a 1000 characters and there's just no way I can say ALL that needs to be said about this movie in that short of a review. I will say that if you're considering the IMAX 3D version, don't waste your money...if you -have- to see Pirates 4, just see the traditional theater version instead as the 3D effects are pretty much non-existent (at least with the IMAX version).The movie itself is also rather lacking...it's not a complete waste of time and there is -some- entertainment value there however this latest incarnation of Pirates is just really lacking compared with the past 3 movies...very bland to say the least (and that's about all I can write here...the least). There is some good action, the traditional special effects are up to par with the previous movies and even the story line seems plausible for a Pirates flick, but this one just lacks the punch of the previous three.If you're not a POTC fan, then you'll likely enjoy this movie to some degree but if you already enjoy the off-beat swashbuckling adventures of Captain Jack Sparrow, then prepare to be disappointed with this one.For more info, please see my full review at; http://www.facebook.com/note.php?saved&&note_id=10150206918086861",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Better than the first 3,"First of all, I'm not going to give anything away. Second, if you're a ""Will & Elizabeth"" fan, you may not like this one cause it's a WHOLE new storyline. They aren't even mentioned. No offense, get over it. They didn't want to continue the Pirate movies so their story ended at ""At World's End"" if you didn't know that, do some research. It's all about CAPTAIN JACK SPARROW anyways :) Third, This movie is, in my opinion, better than the first!!! The mermaids ROCK!! The 3D is amazing!! It's NOT just the background in this one. I had stolen a peek and saw that even the REAL LIFE characters were in 3D. Fourth, Johnny Depp, Ian McShane and Geoffrey Rush were amazing!!As I said in ""third"" it's my opinion. See it for yourself and it's a promise you will like it and tell yourself it was worth the money.Only thing I didn't like was Pen√©lope Cruz, never been a fan of her movies unless with Mr. Depp; but even I have to eat my 2cents. She was good in this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
What happened to this movie?,"Johnny Depp, Geoffrey Rush and Penelope Cruz as actors, Terry Rossio and Ted Elliott as screenwriters, Hans Zimmer as a composer, a book that is said to be totally okay as a base - what can go wrong in a movie like this? Well... everything. There was not a single moment at which I really connected with either the story or any of the characters. While I went out of ""At world's end"" after three hours feeling like it had been at most one and a half, I started looking at my watch twenty minutes into this movie, thinking ""When will this get really started?""This film was clearly aimed at a younger audience than the previous ones, and so were most of the jokes. All in all there's a definite feeling of having seen it all before, with a predictable plot and soulless acting. What hurt only a little in comparison to everything else: the secret heroine of the previous movies, the Black Pearl, almost didn't appear at all.I was also disappointed by the music. Well, Hans Zimmer is always above average, but there's nothing new at all to this score, unlike in parts 2 and 3 that got new themes each.In my opinion, if you liked the previous films, stick to Gore Verbinski rather than the Pirates of the Caribbean. It seems to be only about the money now.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Visually stunning, but a messy and boring story.","I didn't expect this to be the greatest of the series, because Dead man's chest was already showing signs of story stretching, but I hoped they would've been able to squeeze one more decent episode out of the franchise before all ideas about pirates and ships ran out.But it seems it was already too late. The movie started with a short introduction to the basic plot, but quickly moved onto a chain of action sequences with short interruptions, most of which weren't even relevant to the story. That's what this movie leans on heavily: lots of action, not so much a well written story. Most of the things that happen are very random, as if the script was actually thrown together from a handful of brainstorm session blurts. The worst part is that Jack Sparrow hardly has any decent lines, or antics, while his character is what makes this series so great.This means that even while the movie has loads of action, it's actually very boring. What kept me going was the eye candy, because it was definitely beautifully shot. Practically every scene was art, that's what kept the movie interesting for me, but that's it.All in all it's beautiful, but disappointing final episode of a great series. That is, assuming part 5 is actually canceled, which I think was a wise choice.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

There was no screen chemistry between his co stars, Cruz just ran around like a headless chicken, looking as if she had no idea what she was doing!The storyline itself was much to be desired, felt like I wanted to fall asleep, in fact I had to nudge my hubby a couple of times as he actually did nod off during it! If you have a bad case of insomnia, this is the movie for you!If there is to be another one, then it had better be better, otherwise somebody should lock it away in Davey Jones' locker forever!I grudgingly have given this 2/10 only because I cannot do one and a half.....",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
And Really Bad Eggs....,"Upon hearing the announcement for Pirates of the Caribbean, I had to ask myself: ""Is this a way to milk the franchise some more or was it to redeem themselves for the horrid At World's End?"" After much pondering, I'm going to say both. Does the fourth one make up for their last abomination or has the cow's udder had finally fallen off?First and foremost, the Pirates is about fun and what imagination is brought to the screen. This time, the imagination is bent on finding the Fountain of Youth. It's apparent right from the very first frame, and we are constantly reminded about the Fountain Youth from Scene 1 to Scene End. It's said in every sentence of dialogue between characters. I have expected a narrator to say in every scene, ""And so our heroes search for the Fountain of Youth..."" in case we the stupid audience has forgotten about what they were after.The film pits Captain Jack Sparrow pretty much forced to find the Fountain of Youth against his will by his ex-girlfriend Angelica and her father Captain Blackbeard (played by Ian McShane, and I enjoyed every scene he was in), and meanwhile, Captain Barbosa (once again played by Geoffrey Rush in his memorable performance) and his crew. I'm not really sure what their motivations are for finding the Fountain of Youth. Captain Jack just wants his Black Pearl back, and the rest, well, I guess they just want eternal youth.Along the way there is swashbuckling, mermaids who kill people, zombies, bad people, and banters between Captain Jack and Captain Blackbeard. I must say the actions sequences this time around are creative, and I would be lying if I said that they weren't thrilling. The first half of the film kinda dragged, but it picks up once they find the mermaids. However, it's like a trek through the jungle, and nobody really gets lost and they just happen to stumble onto the Fountain of Youth later on. As a friend of mine pointed out, that at least in At World's End, their journey seemed to be more deadly. They nearly froze to death and almost doomed. The stakes didn't seem to high on this one, other than being attacked by fish and Spaniards.Another problem I had with this one is the direction. For a summer blockbuster, the scenes just felt a little slow moving, and the establishing of each scene almost made me not care of what the scene was going to be. The writing was good, and I think that's what saved it.So why did I like this one? I just enjoy Johnny Depp's performance of Captain Jack Sparrow this time, and Rush's performance as Barbosa. I also really enjoyed Captain Blackbeard. The action scenes (though sometimes just come out of nowhere) kept me from falling asleep at the slow parts, and at least the film didn't feel like it was all over the place like its two predecessors. It has a clear focus, at least, and I liked how it doesn't stray far from that other than the needless romantic subplot between the clergyman and the mermaid.If you are a fan of the franchise, then you are going to see this anyway. I'm not sure if the film will make more fans or not, but it's enough excitement to warrant my butt in the multiplex in the next installment whenever that comes out, savvy.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fanaticalaboutfilms Review: Pirates Of The Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,"The swashbuckling pirates return in their latest adventure as Disney tries to cash in on older once successful ideas rather than conjure up some new material for our viewing pleasure. On Stranger Tides sees us return to a time after that of the first three films. No longer is the focus on Will Turner and Elizabeth Swan who aren't included in the cast (neither is the prison dog!!) and whose story is considered to be finished in the third instalment, At World's End. Instead the story follows Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) in his race to find the Fountain of Youth along with several other interested parties.Jack is joined in this race by Barbossa- (Geoffrey Rush) now a profiteer working for the British Crown, Blackbeard- (Ian McShane) the most feared pirate on the seas along with his first mate Angelica (Pen√©lope Cruz) and the Spanish armada who all want the power of the fountain for themselves. Throughout the quest they overcome challenges, encounter each other, run into mermaids and generally do as pirates do.The movie gives out a bit of a 'same old same old' vibe with Jack elaborately escaping from captivity once again and fighting whilst balancing on wooden beams (distinctly familiar). It may have impressed in the first few films and despite being well executed is becoming decidedly stale as a concept in this one. I also felt that the inclusion of some sub-plots didn't add anything to the story (the priest/mermaid plot?) but rather detracted from it instead.Despite this, those who are fans of Captain Jack Sparrow will not be disappointed as it certainly is better than the second and third instalments. Despite this one running it closer, it's a shame that they've never lived up to the original all the while being impervious to becoming box office flops.The acting was mostly very good with Depp obviously returning to steal the show with his eccentric Sparrow creation but Rush, McShane and even Cruz put in their fair share to make the story believable. Both the set and clothing design departments show off their talents with impressive visuals to lap up and Zimmer's score does just enough to keep the movie flowing forward.Overall this will keep you entertained with some good action scenes, comedy and a couple of strong performances but I'm still waiting for the series to return back to the heights of the first film which I don't think it ever will. There is guaranteed to be a fifth film (with or without Depp) but I feel that this should finally be laid to Davy Jones' locker while it can still escape with some credibility. Savvy? Ps. Once again I stuck to 2D and the general consensus I've got seems to suggest 3D is not quite worth extra pennies yet.For further reviews feel free to check out: http://www.fanaticalaboutfilms.com",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Spoiler Free Review,"Ahoy, and so here we are in 2011 with another Pirate's adventure on the horizon. An adventure that contains fresh humor, intrigue, mystery and visuals, yet reminds us what we love so much about the original.Many critics complained that P2 and P3 were bogged down with sub plots, interweaving stories, and that it became to heavy for some to handle. Well, if thats how you felt, then you are going to love On Stranger Tides. It is a return to form in a sense, without feeling rehashed. Jack is forever brilliant as he goes on his search for the fountain of youth. However, Jack isn't alone. Penelope is brilliant as well, her charm and wit fit in perfectly to the Pirate's world. Less not forget the menacing foe, Blackbeard, who's retchidness is so vile that not once do you think to yourself ""oh thats just Ian McShane"".The Pirates themselves aren't only thing propelling this franchise to the next level. The visuals themselves are absolutely stunning. The water shots are a site to behold and the jungle scenes are lush and vibrant. These guys did 3D right! So, if you're looking for an adventure thats fresh and doesn't carry any of the same complaints as the last two, while still seeming charmingly similar, this should be your pick this summer!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"pirates of the Caribbean :on stranger tides-""Amazing"" backgrounds....a whole new beginning.","out of the rest of the pirates movie , this one lacked a little bit of sudden turn of events which made the movie a little slow....Still the story was amazing creating a last moment of forthcoming thrill and interest with jack with ""his pearl"" and and his own fleet of ships.The role of Barbossa was amazing with gradual display of his usual deception and pride of a ""Pirate"".Not much to go with Blackbeard.cast taken together is also good with the breath taking and beautiful Penelope Cruz to give them the boost(although she was showing in some places which strengthened the story ending)Too predictable with the thing with the switch of the chalices. Most of the parts of the movie were predictable,very predictable.But for those who haven't watched the previous pirates movie 100 times before,the new one would be an absolute delight and a treat.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Jack is sharp, the story is flat","VERY glad that the Captain Sparrow is back front and center! POC 3 was a disappointment because of the lack of screen time for Mr. Depp. This time the magic was in Jack performing sleight-of-hand (or foot, actually) rather than the grand cg illusions of POC 3. The escape from the palace and through the London streets was vintage Pirates--fast funny and thrilling.Too bad the story was slow, witless and dull. It was a mistake to try to mix ""real"" history (the story of Blackbeard) with the Pirates' wonderfully weird mythos of pirates and their laws and customs.Mr. Bloom's swordplay was sorely missed. The hand-to-hand combat scenes were slow and clumsy. Once again, Mr. Depp's footwork in the palm trees almost saved the day.He so elegantly threw away the funniest lines, as usual. Especially nice were his ""counting names and naming fingers,"" and quip about the Spanish convent. The rest of the cast, especially Ms. Cruz, should take a few lessons. Even Mr. Rush telegraphs most of his amusing lines.Captain Sparrow is back in form, but the story and supporting cast were not shipshape. And where was that most important player--the dog?",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Pirates are saved by the Mermaids.,"PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: ON STRANGER TIDES ‚Äì CATCH IT ( B+ ) Pirates of the Caribbean returns with another Jack Sparrow's mystical venture. It introduces some interesting new characters and stories, the characters are enjoyable but the screenplay is loose. The best thing about the Pirates4 is the Mermaids, the entrance of the Mermaids has to be one of the best scenes in the entire Pirates Franchise. The first time someone decided to present the scary still beautiful side of the mermaids. Johnny Depp is drunken funny himself, we are kind of use to it. Geoffrey Rush is repetitive as well. Penelope Cruz is good but she didn't look as athletic as the character was. Though, chemistry between Johnny Depp and Penelope Cruz is really interesting. Among the new batch we Sam Claflin as the charming kind of priest religious guy and Astrid Berg√®s-Frisbey as the captured Mermaid is serene. The weird thing was that they were supposed to be the new Orlando Blood and Keira Knightely but sadly they didn't get many dialogues or scene separately to shine. Gemma Ward as first emerging Mermaid is absolutely gorgeous, her entry and enchanting voice will be engraved in my head for long. Overall, Pirates are saved by the Mermaids. The Mermaids are the most fascinating part of the Stranger's Tides. I defiantly would like to see more parts as promised because it was enjoyable and there is lot of things can be done with these characters.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
OK Film!,"The infamous addition of mermaids was the best part in the entire film. It was very reminiscent of the powerful underwater march of the dead from the first film.Lets move onto the acting. Most of it was decently solid but Ian McShane as the villain, Black Beard stole the show. He actually seemed like the only one who cared to make the film interesting. Another newcomer to the series was Penelope Cruz. She was nothing fantastic but completely necessary to bring in a much needed sex appeal to the film. Geoffrey Rush returned as Barbosa, I felt he was very confused as to if he was a bad guy or good guy which caused his acting to seem very indifferent. There were a few scenes that you knew he was having fun but otherwise he was just a drag. And of course Johnny Depp reprized his role as the witty fun loving Captain Jack Sparrow. Again he had his moments just like Barbosa that were fun and creative but he even came up a little lackluster in certain scenes.The story was super simple, which I guess is understandable considering the convoluted mess of 2 and 3.There was an unnecessary sub plot that never got resolved, which I wish they spent a little more time on and made it a little darker. I am not going to spoil anything though, but you will see what I am talking about when you see the film. As you wait for the scene after the credits you want it to be the conclusion to this sub plot but nope. The climax could have been a bit more climatic and more exciting, but I guess they did what they could. Most of the action happens in the dark so I would not recommend the 3D transfer of it. I saw it in 2D and I thought the 3D wouldn't be worth it.Marshall did a decent job directing. It was nothing special and definitely not Gore Verbinski. The way the film turned out, it looked like the director was even bored while shooting.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It's Jack's show.,"My expectations were low and I was surprisingly pleased by this movie. It's all about Jack. He interrupts in the most important moments with his wacky sense of humor.The movie is overall entertaining and funny. My beef with it was some dumb character decisions, and solving important events with improvisations. But well it's Jack's style.Jack Sparrow carries the whole film on his back. Penelope Cruz was a great addition as her character is fierce, beautiful, and very angry towards Jack. Barbossa returns and wants to seek revenge against Blackbeard. So character wise, the movie is great.The f/x are excellent although the 3D isn't at any point necessary but that's my opinion.The score is also fantastic.The production values are superb, the story gets you interested most of the time, the action sequences were just good (left something to desire); and the humor is fine. The highlights for me were the mermaids attack, the opening sequence, and the final match between Barbossa and Blackbeard.Overall it's a popcorn movie that should please fans of the series. .",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Going downhill,"The first one was fantastic. No doubt about that. But through each film, it felt that it was lacking something. Each one did nothing to further the character/plot development of the last film. And when the novelty of the first film wears out, it all just seems mediocre in the end. But if this is the first one you watch, though its not the best, it'll at least be a decent watch.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Strange Tide,"I got a chance by a friend to watch this movie at the premier. And I am glad i did. On stranger Tides was just as good as the other pirates. Maybe even the best one yet.One thing that you will Understand early in the film, is that it is very different compared to the others. at the start it may seem a bit slow, but as you go further into the film it gets better and better by the minute. Johnny Depp is as good as always. i can NOT imagine anyone else playing this Role but him, he truly nailed it as always.A very good thing about this film is that there aren't many CG scenes, like At the world's End. it makes the films look and feel very natural. the performance by Geoffrey Rush and Pen√©lope Cruz Are fantastic and would be very good if we see them in the future films. They are really lucky that the movie was rated PG-13. There are some mild Violence scenes which we never had in the pirates series. but I am not referring to that as a weakness. The mermaids were extremely Beautiful and nicely made, which i think was one of the best parts of the films.On the other hand Ian McShane's performance didn't really grab me. he seemed that he hasn't fit into the role. And was not as scary and powerful as the Black Beard should be.The Music fantastic as always by Hans Zimmer. it adds so much to the film's story and theme.I personally Can not wait until the next one is ready. Because it will always be as good as the first one.thats whats special about this, that it Never Gets boring or Old.Jack is Back,maybe not as powerful as ever, but with a new cast and new story and a new tide, brings a great deal of action to the series.So this is a MUST-SEE film of the year so far. so if you have any plans for the weekend, drop them, and get to the nearest Cinema!!Overall 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
captain jack is back,finally captain jack is back to his best after the third film i was thinking that was the end of the franchise but thank god this new film lives up to the hype. this film has gone back to basics and is very similar to the first one i must say i didn't miss kiera or orlando johnny depp gives another fine performance in this one as does mrs cruz i wont give any spoilers but one thing i will say if your going to see it in 3d beware most of the film is at night and the 3d makes it even darker and honestly i didn't notice what was 3d and what wasn't overall this film does what it says gives you humour romance and action all in one film pirates is back and better then ever,7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Give up while ahead, please give up now you are behind","From the first 10 minutes you knew it was utter junk. A series of random actions which are poorly scripted with sub-standard humor and Jack at his worst. Part 1 was banging with action, and so was part 2. Part 3 started to meander into a plot so complex and unrewarding that it lost the viewer.Good films are anchored in good objectives. i.e. What is the major objective of the antagonist. (Jack) what does he want. And this was very unresolved even 40 minutes into the film. But you keep bring up the old news - he doesn't have a ship. And over and over again the same tricks but poorly executed. The same capture and escape. Try something new. What worked for part 1 and 2 was because they were new. It is part 4 now, we want to see something different. And in both 1 and 2 the objectives and the mission was tight sequence after sequence, joke after joke.Jack seems tired and less bouncy in 4, why? Maybe because the script is so weak and the objectives so forced. And even in fiction you need realism within the boundaries of the world the script makers cast. You cant just have people show up unexplained , undeveloped. Did the film truly explain the cast and their passion? No. Keira and Orlando made a very good choice to stay away - so should the audience. Had it been so good you would see them. Knowing when to quit is criticalI hope this will be the last and that money will not squeeze out another story from a franchise which needs to be buried.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Ho ho ho, this pirate has been milked dry","Being the fourth part in the series the general setting of this film will not have to be explained. It more or less continues the story where the third film left of. Jack has the map that leads to the fountain of youth, and is in need of a ship and a crew.Missing most of the original crew this film has to make do with a lot of new people. This isn't bad - most of the new ones come across as fitting and make for a new setting. Personally I am missing some of the comical characters of the previous films though - especially the guy with the prosthetic eye and his mate. The pair of them made for an extra bit of comedy with their constant bickering and his fooling with the eye.The film starts with a bang and explains the situation as well as it must - it sets out the stage for the rest of the film. As the action starts rolling it looks rather promising. But then...Then the film gets to its main part and it becomes clear that it is a clear attempt at rinse and repeat of the success of the previous ones with different characters. Some bits are flaky, some are rather good, but overall the film is on the dull end of the spectrum. It's not entirely unpleasant, but it could have been so much more.Finally we get to the 3D layer that was added. Again it can be said that it doesn't add a single thing. The few scenes that really worked were the standard gimmicky scenes where a sword sticks into the audience - please stop doing that, it's been done, it's becoming a drag. Either make a film for 3D or keep it 2D. This one is clearly made for the 2D market and that is just fine, just don't try to sell it as 3D to make some extra money.6 out of 10 bored pirates",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A pirates life for me indeed!,"So it is 2011 and finally we got ourself another Pirates Of The Caribbean movie. The movie starts in London with the probably most iconic movie character today Jack Sparrow. Johnny Depp again delivers with his portrayal of the swashbuckling pirate Captain Jack Sparrow with some great humor and several well thought one liners. Although I do feel that some of his jokes felt that they were used before, fans of Jack will not be disappointed.Jack is on a quest to find the mythical fountain of youth. But he is not the only one. On the same path are also the British Empire (party led by the newly pointed privateer Captain hector Barbossa), The Spanish Kingdom and the infamous Black Beard with his daughter Angelica who was Jacks lover in the past. Geoffrey Rush excels as the retired pirate without actually loosing the pirate swagger and mannerisms. He steals every scene including the ones with Jack. Ian Mcshane on the other hand is not actually bad as Black Beard but as far as I know the story behind this person, Mcshane was not so terrifying at all. Penelope Cruz as Angelica was a perfect match for Jack Sparrow and she did an excellent job of portraying a heartbroken former lover of Jack.But, people who were hoping to be free of a new romantic Will-Elizabeth tale were sadly disappointed. Again we have 2 characters who were flat on their performances and I did not care if they died or lived. So in conclusion Pirates Of The Caribbean: On Strangers Tide was a great picture. The action scenes were great, the story was also less complicated then the last two films and the lenght of the movie was also adequate. Not as good as the first film but better than the last two. Not a bad movie to start the summer season!8/10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Jack Sparrow, You ROCK!","What Rob Marshall did with Pirates series, no one else could have done with such finesse and panache. Dropping out two key protagonists without explanations and instead of picking on famous novels, he opted for rather under-rated Tim Power's On Stranger Tides to fit the characters.Similarly, what Johnny Depp has been doing in all Pirates movies and what he did in this movie, no one else could have done it with such perfection. That's Johnny Depp(Jack Sparrow) for you.Most of you must have seen Indian Jones and the Last Crusade, I guess. You're gonna have a feel of Deja Vu in many of the scenes. Following an appropriately pulpy prologue, the film opens on erstwhile Captain Jack Sparrow (Depp) as he's marooned in London in search of a ship, and pursued by local authorities who he makes little serious effort to avoid. Hearing that an impostor Sparrow is auditioning pirate recruits at a seaside bar, he seeks out the interloper only to discover his spitfire former lover Angelica (Penelope Cruz), disguised as him After some requisite sword-clashing, Angelica kidnaps Sparrow and ferries him aboard the Queen Anne's Revenge, lorded over by Angelica's (maybe) father, Captain Blackbeard (Ian McShane). Commanding a crew comprised of equal parts stray pirates and hulking zombies -- why he needs the former when he has the latter is never explained -- Blackbeard enlists Sparrow to help him locate the fountain of youth, which becomes an especially urgent task after a prophecy foretells Blackbeard's imminent death at the hands of a one-legged man.Meanwhile, Sparrow's rival Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), now conveniently one-legged, has bid farewell to his pirate's life, and seeks the fountain on behalf of the king of England, who is keen to find it before a rival crew sent by the king of Spain can claim it for themselves. As the three parties converge on the fountain's jungle location, they must also deal with a ravenous horde of vampiric mermaids, from whom a single tear must be procured to drink the fountain's waters.In case any one of you haven't seen the previous movies, frequent recaps are provided through out and it doesn't matter too much anyway. Depp remains the face of the film. But a majority of his thunder is co-opted by an on-point Rush, who not only gets the funniest lines and reaction shots, but also starts to siphon away much of the roguish charm that used to be Depp's stock and trade. McShane, on the other hand, is underwhelming. Never appearing comfortable in his heavy pirate get-up, his tired Blackbeard is only menacing via other characters' testimonials to his evil, and his one on screen atrocity seems tossed in merely to stress that he is, in fact, the bad guy.Cruz is a reliably welcome, gorgeous presence, though she too often falls back on the ""feisty Latina"" signifiers that have been the crutch of so much of her English-language work. Sam Claflin supplies some semi- risible gallantry as a super-studly priest, and Astrid Berges-Frisbey looks effectively terrified as a captive mermaid.All in all, it is must watch for everybody who is a fan of Pirates series and Johnny Depp. Go for it and chances are less of you being disappointed.Thanks & Regards,My Rating: 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Painfully bad.,"This was so bad that had I paid to see it I would have asked for my money back. I went to the drive-in with my kids to watch X-men. This was the second flick. Only 9 year old boy stayed awake and wanted to watch this piece of crap so I sat watched. I knew this was bad about 3 minutes into it. Johhny Depp is walking thru this movie. It seems like he did this just so his kids can watch him in a movie as Captain Jack. That or he couldn't say no to all those millions. Whatever his motivations making a good movie was not on the table.It one chase/sword fight scene followed by another interrupted by bad jokes and pointless dialog. Boring Boring Boring. Any to top it off it clocked in at 2.5 hours of crap. I didn't get out of the theater until 2:30 AM. Even my 9 yr old fell asleep about 15 min before the end and I woke him up and said ""Oh no buddy.

Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,"At least this is bit shorter than the previous edition of the franchise, but sadly it isn't really any better. Rob Marshall has taken the helm and we have lost Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley - who presumably recognised that the boat has sailed on this much weakened fantasy adventure series. This time around ""Jack"" (a rather battle-weary Johnny Depp) finds himself looking for the fountain of youth with the newly Anglicised ""Barbossa"" (Geoffrey Rush) in hot pursuit of him and of his old flame ""Angelica"" (Pen√©lope Cruz) who happens to be none other than the the daughter of the legendary ""Blackbeard"" (Ian McShane). Now she is clever. She convinces ""Jack"" that her dad isn't so well, and that only an elixir of this water can cure him. Thing is, is ""Jack"" gullible enough to fall for this yarn? Are we? Of course it's not so simple - not only do they need to find the water, they must also find a couple of charmed chalices and, naturally, the tear of a mermaid - the latter creatures not being so benign as Walt Disney's other films might suggest. The visuals are great with a new slew of scary beasties from the depths to entertain us, but the story is pretty weak and the established characterisations struggle to resonate in anything like the way they used to. Sam Claflin adds a bit of eye candy and Richard Griffiths looks every inch the part as George II, but McShane is one of my least favourite character actors - he only has the one gear - and Miss Cruz seems more like a fish out of water than a duck taking to it. There's far too much dialogue and the denouement is stretched beyond breaking point before the obligatory ""next time"" pointer to the next instalment of this over-tired series. ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" ought to hang up it's hat now; it's had it's day.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A leap of faith cruelly abused,"When previews for the latest Pirates movies started showing in theaters, I noticed a general rumble around me and on at least three occasions heard someone comment to a fellow, ""Really? Again?"" For a long time I boycotted the sequels to the original Pirates, but I finally watched them and they weren't THAT bad. So with this one, I thought I'd give it a go.Not awful, but certainly not up to the Pirates standard.There were so many things about the first Pirates movie that made it spectacular. The music was exciting, the writing was subtle and effective, the humor was 100% on point and the action was new and entertaining. As the 'trilogy' went on, some of those things dwindled, but there was always intelligent writing (even if it did get convoluted at points) and there was a sense of the magnificent in them that I always really enjoyed.The fourth Pirates did not manage to tap any of these great wells. The music was tired and in the background. At one point, early in the film, we get a rehash of the original score which livened things up for a good six seconds before the score just... stopped (apparently Jack is losing his finesse).The writing that made the first movie so enjoyable is almost nonexistent here and it really hurts the development of new characters. Blackbeard, the replacement villain, is underwritten, under-motivated, and his 'powers' are unexplained. In the first movies at least when something out of the ordinary happened, it had SOME explanation! Cruz's character is a weak replacement of Elizabeth, who managed to have a strong background and base character that evolved over the course of the movie. We don't know where Cruz's character is from, what she would be doing on a day-to-day basis if this 'quest' weren't underway. We don't find anything out about her at all except ambiguous hints at a past with Jack. It's boring. Will Turner's replacement is a good looking religious-type who stands up against Blackbeard's brutality... with no real consequences. In the original there was a sense of danger for Will when he stood against Barbossa to save his lady fair. You actually *believed* Barbossa would kill him, or make Elizabeth walk the plank. In this, there is just no palpable danger.Humor? Very little.Action! I'm not usually critical of action sequences, but there was one fight scene in this film, taking up three to four minutes, that actually had me bored because it was almost a step-for-step rehash of the fight scene between Jack and Will Turner in the blacksmith's. Really?! The action in this film wasn't new or exciting or smooth. It was just... boring. Someone else described Jack's escapes as 'going from James Bond to Austin Powers' and I couldn't agree more. Jack doesn't really seem able to control his own destiny in this movie, more of a sufferer of others' will than an agent of his own and that's just sad.The sense of the magnificent is totally absent in this movie. That may relieve some people who found an expanding goddess exploding into crabs or a ship-battle amidst a maelstrom too far, but it really detracts from the feel of the movie. It's not that incredible things don't happen... they just don't *feel* incredible. The mermaid scene, for example, would have been haunting in a previous film. For this one, it just seemed boring. (Possible spoiler, but nothing that affects the plot) There was a completely idiotic moment where Jack and Barbossa are trying to balance their weight in Ponce De Leon's ship (which looks as if it has somehow become embedded in the side of a cliff well above sea level... again, explanation writers?), but then you realize they're in the captain's quarters at one end of the ship and it wouldn't be teetering that way even if it wasn't already established that it's BURIED in a cliff! The whole movie was atmoshperically gloomy. There was no sunshine, no Caribbean blue waters, nothing to really excite the eye. No danger, no real excitement, no wonder. Just... unremarkable in every way. I really blame the writers for the majority of this failure, but the director had fault in some areas too. Put some heart into your work, people.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Doesn't have the original spark like the first 3 but entertaining nevertheless,"Something magical about the first three movies that this movie lacked, maybe it was some of the original cast not being in it.The storyline was more island based than on sea. I missed the ship wars in the mystical thunderstorms that we got before. Half of the time it felt like a cross between Indiana Jones and National Treasure.Jack didn't have that original performance in this one he seemed more 'sober' if you understand my drift, i later found out that Disney's chairman Dick Cook helped Johnny Depp's commitment for the role until he was fired. Depp seems to have lost his influence over this thus the dimmed down performance for this 4th installment. I opened up to the new characters with high hopes but they fell bland a few times.Good movie, welcomed to the franchise but not the best.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A mix of frustration and fun.,"Thank goodness the cast is still on their game. Johnny Depp once again breathes life into the pirate movie with his smart, unpredictable, and hilarious portrayal of Jack Sparrow. Despite what the reviews say, Jack Sparrow's shtick isn't getting old as he is still a delight to watch. Geoffrey Rush once again shines as Jack's best rival Barbossa, as his quiet intentions resemble that of Sparrow in earlier films. Penelope Cruz adds a layer of sexuality that we definitely did not have with the other Pirates of the Caribbeans--it's just a shame she didn't have much time with Sparrow. Director Rob Marshall was able to shell out good performances from everyone in the cast, but he definitely wasn't the man for this job.Almost all the chase scenes or action sequences were done with very low- lighting and poor camera angles. With the exception of the mesmerizing and chilling mermaid sequence and the opening chase, all the action moments were missing that special touch. While the bizarreness of Gore Verbinski will not be totally missed (although his style worked perfectly in Rango), his ability to crank out excellent stuntwork and fights was sorely missing here. At least we got to see plenty of it, from the opening chase to the final dramatic (and short) showdown. Say whatever you want, but there has yet to be anything that can top the infamous three-way sword fight/old mill showdown from Dead Man's Chest.Bottom Line: Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides is a mix of frustration and fun. There was plenty of potential that wasn't met because of questionable plot lines, pointless moments, lack of chemistry (once again: writer's fault. Good going Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio), and uneven direction. All that banter aside, Pirates is also plenty fun with several delightful moments, funny lines, and much more action than the last Pirates flick. Johnny Depp, Penelope Cruz and company keep the movie afloat, and prevent it from being a pure bore. But I think the franchise works better when Verbinski is behind the camera. On Stranger Tides is decent summer entertainment, but doesn't have the inescapable magic and charm of the first two.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

In fact, after the Verbinski trilogy that ended At World's End, this fourth instalment looks like it could use some rejuvenation - hence its plot about a quest for the mythic Fountain of Youth.However, while the pace is supposed to build up to a climax, ""On Stranger Tides"" seems to start off fast and frivolous - but gradually slackens in pace and content right to its ending.When the movie opens, we find Capt Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) landlubbing in London - and in search of a ship to skipper. However, he learns that someone is impersonating him and is busy recruiting a crew in a race against the Spaniards to look for the fountain of youth. At one of these recruiting stations, Jack runs into his father (Keith Richards!) and old flame Angelica (Penelope Cruz).After the requisite sword play, drinking, looting and chases, Jack finds himself on board Blackbeard's ship, Queen Anne's Revenge, with Angelica as first mate! Besides the Spanish, a certain one-legged captain (Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa) is also looking for the said fountain - on behalf of the king of England. However, before they can reach the fountain, they must face a bevy of mesmerising men-eating mermaids and procure a tear from one of them, so as to put into effect the power of everlasting youth.Unlike the previous movies, which had heavily-computerised creatures like Bill Nighy's Davy Jones, this one is less of a monster show. However, Depp still wears heavy eye shadow and is back in his usual wacky self as Capt Sparrow, having an audience with King George (Richard Griffiths) and even smooching Judi Dench before setting out to sea. Yes, it is ho-ho-ho and a bottle of fun in Merry Ole England and the pace slackens when the narrative sets sail. Well, at least until we get to the part about the ravenous mermaids, anyway.Cruz takes over from Knightley as female lead but while the senorita can be as feisty as they come, the romantic angle is undeveloped. Instead she keeps the audience guessing as to whether she is the real daughter of Blackbeard. The romance factor comes in a subplot about an earnest missionary (Sam Claflin) and a captured mermaid (Astrid Berges-Frisbey as Syrena). The swashbuckling department isn't that well stocked either.The fights look contrived and the movie lacks tension and suspense. The most 'violent' sequences are those concerning the mermaids - and they don't seem as menacing as they are enigmatic and fetching (with their chests well out of view, of course).Among the cast, Rush is the most entertaining as Barbossa; Cruz earns her keep as the delectable Angelica, but McShane seems to have little to do except look fierce and frightful and occasionally kill someone. On the whole, it's more like the Pirates on Shallow Tides. (limchangmoh.blogspot.com)",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Just as good as the 1st one!,"""How about 3 shillings, and forget the name?"" That line is one of the best lines in the Pirate Films, and its from the best movie of all the films. The 2nd one was decent and had its funny parts, the 3rd one was action packed, but lacked the old way of the first one. But now we come to ""On stranger Tides"" Which in my opinion, is Just as Good as the 1st one! ""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides"" Was just what Disney needed to lift the series up! With the endless funny jokes, to the scary and hair raising mermaids, to the awesome action, This is one Pirates that you should not miss! Believe me when I say it, Its all that good! Johnny Depp was amazing as normal, no matter how many critics said he was toned down. Penelope Cruz was good enough to fit right into the cast, without being annoying. Ian McShane was, as he puts it ""I'm a Bad man!"", very evil. But the best actor award goes to Geoffrey Rush! Even with his peg leg, He was the best by far! His lines and actions made the movie! And even though so many characters were gone (Thank the Lord Elizabeth and Will were not in there), They did not seam missed.""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides"" Is the 2nd best if not tied for 1st in the Saga, and mark my words when I say this: DON'T MISS OUT ON THIS FUNNY, SCARY, AND ACTION PACKED PIRATES RIDE!

A Return to the High Seas,"Eight years ago we were introduced to a scallywag, a pirate of sorts, a pirate by trade ‚Äì Captain Jack Sparrow. Who would have thought that a big-time attraction from Disneyland & Disney World could spark a dynamite in the hearts of moviegoers? Gore Verbinski took that risk and the torch was passed down to a man who directed musicals and what not ‚Äì Rob Marshall. Well, I say, way to go Rob. You have done the crew a very BIG debt of gratitude. You took the reins and you shook them hard to make this movie the best of the 4. The cast ‚Äì Geoffrey Rush, Ian McShane (thank you for portraying Blackbeard the way it was supposed to be played), the beautiful and talented Penelope Cruz and most importantly the man who needs no introduction the man who played Edward Scissorhands, the man who played Willy Wonka, the 21 Jump Street actor from all those years ago to a rising star and a beloved actor ‚Äì the incredible Johnny Depp. From the story line, to the special effects, to the great music (Hans Zimmer, again you have proved your worth.)

"Enjoyable, but not as extraordinary as it could have been","Although it provided an absurd amount of fun and adventure, not to mention one of the most iconic film characters of the past decade, I kind of wish Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl failed miserably and just became a cult hit. Despite enjoying both of the cash-grabbing sequels that followed the first time, rewatching and further recollections of the events that transpire have proved the films to be miserable, messy and often times inanely silly attempts at trying to recreate the magic of the first film, but failing on almost all counts. So you can immediately see where the skepticism comes in when preparing to watch On Stranger Tides, the fourth film in the franchise.Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is back in London, where he finds out about an impending trip to find the previously teased Fountain of Youth. While he is not really prepared to go on a quest to find it for the King of England like Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) is, he does get roped into coming alongside former flame Angelica (Pen√©lope Cruz) who is also searching for it. And her father, the captain of her ship, just happens to be the notorious pirate Blackbeard (Ian McShane).Even though it may not sound like much (especially after the unbearable amount of subplots that seem to describe this franchise), On Stranger Tides still manages to dedicate plenty of time to a few story lines and each of the main characters. But this is not nearly as terrible as it may sound. Rather wisely, this is the shortest film in the series by a long shot, and it never feels nearly as stretched out as the rest. The majority of fat has been trimmed, and the story follows as straight a path as it can as these pirates journey to find the mythical fountain. There are no silly anecdotes and minuscule character scenes devised to pad out the running time and in turn, make the film obscenely lengthy. There are no useless supporting characters designed merely to provide some sort of wacky comedic effect using their fake body parts, asinine methods of speech or general stupidity. In fact, outside of Depp and Rush, the only returning non-cameo character is Kevin McNally's Gibbs, who is even more downplayed than I thought he would be.As wonderful as this may sound, it comes at a price ‚Äì there are no real standout characters in the film at all, and this includes returning characters. Blackbeard is built up to be an evil dictator and heinous villain, but they barely give McShane any time to let us see that side of his character. He gets a pretty awesome introduction, then sits back and looks bored for the rest of the film. The addition of Sam Claflin and Astrid Berges-Frisbey as an unconventional lovestruck pair may remind audiences of Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley, but they lack chemistry and come off more annoying and forced than anything else. Rush seems to have been toned down and held back from stealing any scenes or time from anyone. Cruz looks like she is enjoying herself, and seems to be getting the most enjoyment out of what her character says and does. But even with the conflicting emotions Angelica displays at every turn, we never really get the opportunity to feel for her as a character.Which leaves us with the former Captain Jack. Depp has been wisely dialed back, and is more conventional in his zany, over-the-top antics. He is more in tune with his Oscar-nominated performance in Black Pearl than he is with his amped up, overcooked roles in the films that followed. He is the best part about On Stranger Tides, and it is because he actually looks like he is attempting to act, as opposed to doing his very best to make a complete ass of himself. He has a lot of great lines and even better character moments, and these help bring back that initial sense of fun we had when we were first introduced to him eight years ago.The special effects are just as great as always, even though there are no show stopping additions like Davy Jones and his crew. It actually felt more realistic than I imagined it would, and a whole lot less fantastical. I can say I appreciated the more minimalistic approach, and liked that the film did not really overdo it in any specific instance. A scene involving the attempted procuring of a mermaid is of particular note, not just because it is the lengthiest and most significant action scene in the film, but because it is done incredibly well and effectively. The 3D offers very little to the film, but rather surprisingly does not get in the way of any of its visuals.For all that works and fails in On Stranger Tides, I found that the film provided a light amount of entertainment and mild enjoyment, but not much else. They just could have done so much more with this film than what ended up in the final product. It certainly made up for the past two entries in the series, but it feels like it has come much too late. The franchise is dead, and this last hurrah is simply that. It may set up for future sequels, but could easily just be content at going out with a finale that was satisfying enough. I know we inevitably have not seen the end of Jack Sparrow, but I can only hope with a bit more effort, they can make another movie that feels like it could reside on the same plain as the original film.7/10.(An extended review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com).",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Wait until it comes out on $.99 pay per view,"This was by far a waste of $28.00 in IMAX tickets. Love the characters but the plot was, well, no real plot at all. It's clear Disney is running out of story lines. The movie is about two hours long. In the middle of the movie, I was so bored I almost started surfing the internet on my cell phone. There just wasn't enough of a storyline to hold my attention. I missed Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley. Their absence is definitely felt. But Penelope Cruz was a nice addition to the cast. She's funny and adds personality to the movie. Aside from her, there weren't very many redeeming qualities. While Johnny Deep was using a rope to tie his enemies to a tree I wondered if I was watching a glorified three stooges flick.Conclusion: incredibly disappointed by this movie. Save your money and wait for it to be released as a $.99 rental.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
*A Swashbuckling Adventure with a Touch of Magic*,"""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides"" sails into uncharted waters with its fourth installment, delivering a vibrant blend of action, humor, and fantasy that keeps the spirit of the franchise alive. This film takes us on a thrilling quest that revolves around the elusive Fountain of Youth, intertwining the notorious Captain Jack Sparrow's charming antics with a new ensemble of captivating characters.Johnny Depp returns as the iconic Jack Sparrow, whose quirky demeanor and unpredictable nature continue to enchant audiences. This time, he finds himself entangled with the formidable Blackbeard, played with a menacing flair by Ian McShane, and the resourceful Angelica, brought to life by Pen√©lope Cruz. Their chemistry adds a fresh dynamic, making their encounters both tense and humorous.The cinematography is vibrant and immersive, showcasing stunning locales from the Caribbean to treacherous seas and enchanting jungles. The visual effects bring the mythical elements to life, particularly in the captivating scenes depicting mermaids-spectacular and haunting in equal measure.While the plot may not be as intricately woven as its predecessors, ""On Stranger Tides"" successfully balances high-stakes adventure with moments of levity. The soundtrack, composed by Hans Zimmer, heightens the drama and nostalgia, blending seamlessly with the narrative.Overall, ""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides"" may not rewrite the rulebook, but it reinforces the franchise's appeal. It's a ride worth taking for fans of pirate lore and fantastical escapades, reminding us that with every wave, there's a story worth telling.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"The funniest of the ""Pirates"" films.","Johnny Depp is back as Captain Jack Sparrow and here he gets the bulk of this fourth entry in the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" series. This is a great thing, because I was honestly getting tired of Will and Elizabeth's predicament in the previous two movies... and not enough Jack. I guess the producers thought so too, so we have more Jack Sparrow now in this movie that any other ""Pirates"" before.I cannot imagine anyone other than Depp as Jack Sparrow. He's become sort of an iconic movie character, the heroic outlaw who can crack a joke in a time of danger or peril, that everyone loves and wants to be (sort of). He fights and moves in situations that Jackie Chan would be proud of. In short, he's a classic movie hero, and it's no different in this installment. Depp still gives his all despite the previous two movies colossal scale potentially tiring him of the role.However, Sparrow isn't the only one to crack a one-liner. Almost every major character, even the villains, have at least one very funny line. It's as if the screenwriters were having a breeze writing this installment. The beautiful and talented Penelope Cruz joins the franchise as Angelica, an old flame from Jack's past who seems to still want to either kill him or love him - it's nice to see Cruz lightening up from all those grueling dramas and have some fun on an adventure like this. Ian McShane as the villain Captian Blackbeard has a menacing atmosphere around him that makes him quite unsettling. And Geoffrey Rush returns as Barbossa, looking not too good since the last time we saw him, but nevertheless still as wily as ever. It seems his and Jacks' characters were reduced from mortal enemies from the first film to bickering rivals here. The chemistry between all of the actors are great.""Chicago"" director Rob Marshall takes over Gore Verbinski for this installment. It's made clear during the sword-fighting sequences - they are well-choreographed and well-filmed as if it's some sort of musical. Marshall does his job well, as per the lavish production design, great camera work, good special effects (at times really pushing the PG-13 rating and Disney's family-friendly reputation at once) and grand music score by Hans Zimmer (who else?)However, the film suffers for three problems - One, the lack of character development for some of the characters who, admittedly, serve little purpose to the story whatsoever apart from making them potential comebacks for the next installment. Two, too choppy editing during the sword-fights. They are nearly incomprehensible to watch due to the fast cuts, and it ruins the good camera work and choreography and strips their adrenaline factor away. Three - said sword-fights and other action sequences were filmed too dark during the night scenes, something the 3D viewers will not appreciate (understatement). I saw this in 2D and that's good enough, you don't need an extra dimension to bring you into Jack's world.I found this more enjoyable than ""Dead Man's Chest"" and ""At World's End"". The most lighthearted of the ""Pirates"" films, this one was on a smaller scale, and had tons more humor than the previous two, and most notably more Captain Jack than ever before. See it for the laughs and Depp. Grab the popcorn and enjoy.I hope the action sequences are improved in the next installment, however.Overall rating: 68/100",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
For Jacky's fans only.,"This time even Cap. Jack Sparrow couldn't save the sinking ship. This movie is just for hardcore fans of Johnny Depp and his mesmerizing avatar as Cap. Jack Sparrow. As long as he is on the screen everything is good otherwise its all boredom. But even he has nothing much to play with this fourth time around though he is the center of the story. What I missed dearly was his ROYAL ENTRY that he had made in all the previous three outings. One thing everyone has said about this movie that this shortest movie in the series feels the longest is also true. They have dragged the story (for me there was no story they just linked some events after events). A lot of new characters are introduced apart from bringing back the old friend-foe-ally Cap. Hector Barbossa and Gibbs. Both are in their usual elements but it hurts to see the lead villain of ""the curse of the black pearl"" in nothing kind of role. Penelope Cruz as Angelica, Sparrow's ex, looks stunning but I never found that chemistry between them. The chemistry between Jack and Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) had much more spark than this one. Ian McShane as Blackbeard doesn't create the effect that Geoffrey Rush had created with Barbossa in the first one and Bill Nighy in the later two installments. The action choreography is wasted as the most scenes are too dark. Rest like cinematography, visual effects, special effects, BG score are as usual. And in direction Rob Marshall has given nothing new to the movie. To be fair the matter provided was not of that quality for any director. Its amazing that when I watched it, I didn't find it that bad but as I m writing all this I realize that I haven't written anything good about it. Whatever money this movie makes (sure it will make a lot) and the last two have made is only due to Johnny Depp. So final words: ""If you are a die-hard fan of the amazing CAP. JACK SPARROW like me then you are going to watch it anyways but if u r not then wait for the DVD mate!""Savvvvyyyyyyy ???",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not the movie I expected.,"I expected more of the same from the last two sequels. I thought those were tripe when they came out. Tasty enough, but tough and chewy, too. I saw 'At World's End' a while back, and while I still think it's overstuffed and over-long, it is at least entertaining.I can't say the same for 'On Stranger Tides'. Compared to the previous three movies, this one is certainly stranger. In a dull way. It's still preposterously plotted and there's plenty o' Jack and a fair bit of Barbosa, but it's only just enough to keep this creaking crate afloat.Even nubile sea nymphs and inanely melodious prose profusely proffered pointedly throughout cannot alleviate the strain of maintaining interest or enthusiasm as the climax climaxes.There is more to come, and oddly I hope it's more like the previous two, wacky and frenetic as they were, and less like this snoozer.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"If you loved the last three, I'd avoid this one....","After watching ""On Stranger Tides"" as far as I'm concerned, Pirates of the Caribbean is a trilogy. Penelope Cruz made a terrific Pirate Wench, and the Design of the film, as always was visually stunning. Not to mention it was actually a brilliant relief to watch a 'Pirates' film without the annoyances of Keira Knightly and Orlando Bloom's whiny acting. However, despite this, the film was really not great. The script was a lot poorer than its predecessors, as was the plot. The make-up was very very wrong and was distractingly modern throughout the film- not befitting the era or the mood. Some of the cinematography was surprisingly low-grade, especially in dark shots, and I was surprised some frames made the editing process (such as a frame with a large water globule on the camera lens, completely ruining any realism left). And that was another thing, the vague supernatural elements in the previous films seemed apt and 'in-place', yet these ideas were taken way to far in this film... since when was Blackbeard a wizard? However, the thing that bothered me the most about this film was the Christian moral values. Please don;t get me wrong, I have nothing at all against Christianity in anyway whatsoever, it's just when I go to see a film like this I do not expect to have it shoved down my throat at every opportunity. It seems that the writer/director deemed it necessary to have all the sin in the film toned-down, and that it was essential to have 'Christianity' win over all, with the incredibly sickeningly annoying 'Orlando-Bloom-esq' Missionary, who JUST WOULDN'T DIE!!! Normally I would suggest going to see this film just for good ol Captain Jack Sparrow.... but alas, even this classic character has been given a revamp, turning him into a bit of a 'Goody-goody' by the end of the film. Overall, I would say avoid it. Maybe see it out of curiosity if you must, or even just for the visual design of Blackbeard's ship. But if you're expecting another classic to add to the trilogy you will be sorely disappointed.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Boring, plotless flop","The film needlessly abandons the loveable characters of it's predecessors, and replaces them with boring, forgettable and downright bad new ones.
Angelica is played well by Penelope Cruz, but is a poorly written character overall.
Blackbeard is nowhere near as interesting as Davy Jones and his inclusion creates the glaring plot hole of why wasn't he mentioned in At Worlds End?
The cleric and the mermaid perfectly personify what is wrong with this film. They are completely forgettable and even after watching the film several times, I can't work out what good they bring to the story.
Jack is made the main 'hero' in this film which doesn't really work at all and he is far more suited to being the anti-hero. With that said, he is still very entertaining and Johnny Depp does the best he can.
Barbossa is excellent as always and Geoffrey Rush clearly has brilliant fun playing him. Not much different to the last films in his character, but the story does take him in an interesting new direction.
Overall On Stranger Tides is a poor film, with a wasted plot and incredibly boring new characters, despite a good effort by Depp and Rush.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

His character Blackbeard probably the biggest pirate ever just doesn't have the part written as so. Jack Sparrow is funny in the movie but we knew he would be. The storyline doesn't really even pickup right where they left off in the 3rd movie. It was a good idea to get rid of Orlando Bloom and Kiera Knightley as I thought it brought the 3rd movie down a bit, but if your going to do that think of some characters to replace them.

Cap't Jack is Back!,"Pirates of The Caribbean: On Stranger TidesThis film is recommended.""Captain Jack will get you high tonight, And take you to your special island.""-Billy JoelAvast ye mateys! Cap't Jack is back in the fourth installment of the Pirates franchise. This time we're set sail to find the Fountain of Youth! ( That sums up the entire plot and Depp depth of the film in about 10 words! ) Returning in full comic glory once again is Johnny Depp as the mincing boozy buccaneer, Cap't Jack Sparrow. Depp, ( in his words ) using inspiration from Keith Richards of Stones fame and PePe LePew of Looney Toons glory, plays his most famous comic creation with wry perfection. Also on board this trip is his once evil adversary, Barbossa ( an especially droll Geoffrey Rush ) and the newly eviler Blackbeard, played with true menace by Ian McShane. Penelope Cruz plays Jack's former paramour, Angelina. The role wastes the talents of this fine actress and she adds very little combustibility or comic timing to her underdeveloped role as his overdeveloped tempestuous love interest.Missing this time are Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom, but substituting for their roles as eye candy in this formulaic adventure ride of a film are Astrid Berges-Frisbey as Syrena the Little Mermaid, and Sam Clafin as the handsome and hunkiest of all missionaries, Philip. ( More people would become devout members of his congregation with him as their spiritual leader. ) Unfortunately also missing in the film's script is much of the wit and humor of the original.What there's plenty of is action, from well staged sword fights, daring escapes, and vampy vampire-like mermaids ( a mighty nice special effect, and I might add, the best section of the film ). At the helm of this film is Rob Marshall, who choreographs the festivities as if he were creating one big production number after another. He keeps everything moving at a clip, although many of the action sequences become monotonous exercises in expert stunt work or enhanced state-of-the-arts CGI, lacking any real spark or tension. The film certainly doesn't bore its audience with its numerous action packed scenes to hold one's interest. But Marshall sacrifices character development and plot details to make a film that almost seems desperate to keep everything and everyone afloat and doesn't leave any time for bona fide thrills or laughs.Production values are still of the highest caliber: rousing music by Hans Zimmer, lush photography by the talented Dariusz Wolski, glorious costumes by Lucy Bevan , and remarkable production design by John Myhre. Yes, there were many gold doubloons spent on the film's lavish budget. Money seemed to be no obstacle.The only real obstacle was the screenplay itself. If only this thin story had some meat too it. It's lean pickings. The script, credited to 5 writers and headed by Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, seemed to be rote and wrote by committee as well. The dialogue lacks wit and the storyline seems trivial. The subplot of mismatched young lovers is strictly recycled Hans Christian Anderson, rated PG, while the exploits and escapades of Cap't Jack and his roguish crew this time around seem predictable and rather listless. Yet, the adventure saga still remains entertaining, primarily due to Depp's delightful tongue-in-cheek interpretation and the sumptuous visual look of the film.Pirates of The Caribbean: On Stranger Tides perpetuates the pirate myth of yore. There is nothing new or exciting in this blockbuster fantasy adventure yarn. We get more of the expected sameness from this successful film series rather than genuine unexpected moments.

I sat through this with complete predictability- Purely a vehicle for Johnny Depp to stagger about doing his Captain Jack- and to be honest, this holds no novelty any more. A boring storyline that no-one cares about, Penelope Cruz attempting to take over from Keira Knightly, and Geoffrey Rush having no idea who's side he was on. The magic has well and truly gone- and sadly the Pirates legacy is one of being just a cash cow for Disney.

"Not What I Wanted, But I Received Better","The thing about these 'Pirates' movies is that somehow they are historically related to classic tales, in this case, it was to the famous Blackbeard. I think that he was the best choice as a historical figure. Blackbeard is very known and already sense the evil in him by hearing his name. Another thing that is related to the other movies is that there are the bits of humour throughout the entire thing. Some of the fight scenes were very very similar to the previous ones. This was worth the watch in 3-D. Recently there haven't been many good 3-D movies, but 'On Stranger Tides' was one that really was worth seeing. Johnny Depp yet again played another amazing performance as Captain Jack Sparrow. I hope to see another series being released in the near future.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Penelope Cruz was the star of the film, feisty, funny, flawed, not sure if she is really bad or not, she brought depth to the film. The film itself had depth and did not bore.

the best,the pirates of the Caribbean series has been one of my favourite films for years. but as the other stories were based on the love of will turner and elizabeth swan luckily this one doesn't it's mostly based around jack.this movie for me is surely the best in the series which is a lot to say because i quite like the other 3 stories a lot. this one has a lot more focus on the main story. cpt.jack made great humour again which is sometimes a bit daft but oh well.i would recommend this to anyone who first of all liked the first 3 movies and to anyone who likes comedy thrillers.,10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Please shoot me.,"I gave up on the Pirates after the second movie but my daughter wanted to see this and I wanted popcorn. I was hoping by the end that they would just kill everyone including me for sitting through this mess. Jack Sparrow was interesting in the first movie, with a kind of strangely intriguing but yet intelligent characterization. They left the character a mystery that we hoped would be explored in subsequent films to create an interesting story. We loved the love story between Elizabeth Swan and 'searching for his self worth' Will Turner. Though the second film was a mess, the third at least gave them a closure.This film does nothing to enhance Jack's character it's just another meaningless quest of him to regain his ship again (so tired of this). Only Barbosa gets any kind of cohesive storyline and once again his character shines. Maybe he should be the3 star of the pirates instead of Jack Sparrow, then at least we might be entertained. I won't even begin to talk about how god awful all of the secondary characters were including Penelope Cruz and Ian McShane as boring Blackbeard. I also won't say anything about the pitiful secondary, poorly written so called love story between a mermaid and a member of Blackbeard's crew. It was laughable and not in a good way. I couldn't stop laughing when all I was thinking is that I wanted the poor lovesick boy to just die. Pitiful Pirates.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Why is there so much hate?,"I don't understand why so many people hate this movie because in my opinion it's very good. It's well made, well preformed (especially Jack Sparrow if you compare his performance in his latest movie) and it has an interesting story and just because there aren't so many connections with the previous movies it doesn't mean it has to suck. It's one of the best in the franchise and i absolutely love it and am glad they made this movie. I suggest this movie to everybody and don't listen to the haters just make your own opinion about it.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Shiver Me Timbers! Jack be back! And he's gotten better after the visit to ""World's End""","Making waves at the box office this summer is ""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides"", the latest addition to Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. With a new director and creative team, this movie discards the storm tossed continuity of the second and third Pirates films and starts off on a clean slate, making the story easily accessible for newcomers to the franchise. For those who have followed the series from Pirates of the Caribbean 1, the movie might come across as rather predictable thanks to the established Jerry Bruckheimer formula of comedy and chaos.On Stranger tides opens with the eccentric pirate, Captain Jack Sparrow (masterfully played by Johnny Depp), in a bit of a tiff. Without a ship, without a crew, and narrowly escaping imprisonment Jack lands himself into a hunt for the mythical fountain of youth after running into his old love Angelica (Penelope Cruz). But she is not the only one after the fountain. Competition comes in the form of the Spanish armada, a British expedition led by none other than Sparrow's ex-rival Barbossa and the infamous pirate Black Beard. Along the way, we get a tacked on side story about a missionary falling for a mermaid, a surprising father/daughter revelation and a convoluted quest for a variety of items needed for the ritual at the fountain.Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides seems like a return to the darker style of the first Pirates movie with voodoo magic, on-screen deaths, and a really disturbing take on Mermaids. However, it retains the needless ""side quests"" narratives and the unexplained magical mythologies. Stuff like Black Beard's voodoo powers, his magic sword or the fate of Jack's old ship, The Black Pearl, are merely glossed over and never explained. Instead, more time is spent on moving the plot along from on comedic action sequence to another.Not that it is a bad thing since the comedy scenes, all involving Jack Sparrow, are the highlight of the movie. These include a gut bustingly funny chase through the streets of London and an over-the-top escape from a Spanish prison camp. The downside is that Jack is once again reduced to just being ""bugs bunny"". He is the funny guy who gets into crazy situations. The deceiving, under handed, unpredictable, eccentric scoundrel side of his character is very much downplayed for laughs.As a result Jack and the rest of the characters come across as nearly one dimensional. Character development is almost non-existent despite having so many characters to choose from. Black Beard could have done well with a sort of emotional redemption arc, or perhaps Barbossa could have been given more depth about why a pirate like him would want to ""go legit"". There was a hinting of a conflict of principles regarding fate and free will but it was never expounded upon. And of course, Disney has not forgotten about the eye candy vacuum left by the departure of Orlando Bloom and Kiera Nightly from the previous movies. The afore-mentioned missionary and mermaid (played by relatively unknown actors Sam Claflin and Astrid Berges-Frisbey) fill those shoes and deliver the passion-devoid yet mandatory romance subplot. Between the one-note villains and the simplistic heroes, ""Predictable"" would be the word to describe the plot.What the film manages to deliver is what made its predecessors such fun to watch in the first place. The unimaginative script is pretty much redeemed thanks to perfect casting and professional, though slightly exaggerated, acting. The production designs, costumes and sets are beautiful as always, as well as the various on-scene locales. They maintain the realistic-styled slant with a gritty, well worn feel mixed with Disney cartoonish colors which succeed in truly immersing the audience into that world. It is a pity though that director Rob Marshall, whose resume encompasses only musicals and small romantic comedies, feels out of his element directing a summer blockbuster. Gone are the wide panning shots and the sweeping camera-work of Gore Verbinski, replaced by Marshall's rather run-of-the-mill directing that fails to instill Pirates of the Caribbean with much needed scope and scale.More of a comedy with fantasy elements than a fantasy epic, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger tides is sure to entertain with its timely comedy and brisk pace. Compared to previous Pirates of the Caribbean films, it easily ranks higher than the second and third entries but lacks the character development, less complicated plot and scope of the first film ""Curse of the Black Pearl"". Still, ""On Stranger Tides"" does not feel like a major turning point or epic life changing event for any of the characters. Then again as Jack says, ""It is not the destination, so much as the journey."" And this is one entertaining journey which would at very least leave you with a different impression of Disney singing mermaids.7.5/10 rounded down to 7http://thexamtaroshowvault.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Cutthroat Island 2,"Thar be a treasure in store for Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, and it be the Golden Raspberry.After four entries, Sadly Pirates has lost its soul. This film may as well be marketed as Cutthroat Island 2. This is not THE Pirates of the Caribbean, it's just a pirate movie with no magic or charm. Convoluted as the second and third entries were, at least they had a sense of adventure, journey and spectacle. On Stranger Tides has none of the above. It is a scrappy walk in the park of a story, with bad plotting, poor cinematography, lazy acting, and it's over with so fast that it all feels pointless. In fact, I'd say it comes close to a rip-off.It is bad enough that there is no life to anyone in the supporting cast, but with Jack Sparrow, it is unacceptable. He's lost his persona and his zing completely, and his box of mannerisms alone does not make him a chartacter. I was also disappointed with Ian McShane. Having turned in what may be the best dramatic performance in television (Deadwood) It hurts a little to see how useless his portrayal of Blackbeard is. In fairness, he wasn't given a whole lot to work with.More than the actors, I blame the script. The once talented duo of screenwriters Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio haven't even bothered to write anyone a part for this movie. Not only that but the dialogue is sloppy, full of needless exposition which doesn't end up explaining much.Even as a source of mindless thrills and chills, On Stranger Tides is weak. The only time when it comes close to matching the scale of its predecessors is in one scene, which sets pirates against killer mermaids. I remember thinking to myself during that sequence, how much Disney has changed in twenty years. It would have been nice to see the cast of the Little Mermaid show up to do a song number, and considering Rob Marshall's skill with music, it might have helped the movie.He is clearly in no position to direct this movie. He too is unable to bring much to the film, and I have a feeling he doesn't know what he's doing with 3-D photography either. Even in regular 2D, the film is quite dark, and grotesque. 3-D would be unwatchable I figure.The movie ends in the style of setting up for another entry, which I now have little faith in. Pirates of the Caribbean, has become little more than an amateurish cash-grab.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Surprisingly boring, and fails to salvage this soulless wreck of a franchise","'Pirates Of The Caribbean' started off as a single, surprisingly good, film. With the addition of two poor sequels, it became an embarrassing franchise. Part 4 has a new story, mostly new characters, and barely a reference to parts 2 and 3. Clearly, it tries to distance itself from past mistakes ‚Äì only it doesn't get very far.'On Stranger Tides' sees Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) looking for the Fountain of Youth. Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) has the same idea - as do the English, the Spanish, and new villain Blackbeard (Ian McShane). Oh, and Penelope Cruz. There is no real reason for all the sudden interest in this mystical fountain - it is merely an excuse to kick-start the Caribbean Wacky Races.On paper, this film should have worked. It features the legendary Blackbeard. There are mermaids and zombies. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley are nowhere to be seen, leaving more room for Depp and Rush to antagonise each other. Despite all of this, the experience is surprisingly boring.One of the film's biggest problems is that it mistakes action for entertainment. Swords are unsheathed every few minutes, which leads to a gratuitous amount of swashbuckling. All of it is chaotic - none of it is memorable. There is never a sense of purpose or consequence, so there is never any tension. Boredom should never be an appropriate response to a sword-fight and yet, in Pirates 4, it is inevitable.Slapstick humour is given the same more-is-better approach as the action and becomes just as much of a farce. In one scene, for example, several characters all try to capture a glass vial and it ends up as a painfully unfunny game of Pirates Hot Potato. After eight years, relying on this sort of gag is nothing short of desperate.Do not expect Jack Sparrow to save this film. Johnny Depp does an impressive job, as always, but strangely there is not enough his of character. The film is more about Barbossa than it is about Jack. Barbossa has always been a deeper, more interesting character, but it is nonetheless disappointing that the star of the film becomes an accessory.Then there are the newcomers. Ian McShane is great to watch as Blackbeard. He has great presence, and is menacing enough without resorting to saying ""arrrrrr"". Unfortunately, his character is severely underdeveloped. He is given no back-story and it is never explained how he possesses supernatural powers. He also doesn't have much to do, which undermines his reputation as ""the pirates that all pirates fear"".Penelope Cruz plays Blackbeard's daughter in an entirely pointless role. Her cleavage, the main focus of several shots, has more presence than her character. As Jack Sparrow's old flame she has the potential to make him a deeper character, but nothing comes of this apart from a few laboured innuendos.The mermaids are refreshingly creepy and their 10-minute segment is genuinely entertaining. Blackbeard's ship is very impressive; it is run by voodoo and can be remote-controlled by a sword. So it's not all bad, but when these are the film's highlights, something is seriously wrong.It is difficult to say if the film is any worse than parts 2 and 3, but it is certainly no better. 'On Stranger Tides' is not as fun or as epic as it tries to be, and fails to salvage this soulless wreck of a franchise. Sadly, that won't stop Disney from trying to make another sequel. Please, don't encourage them.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"It delivers on the action, comedy, and visuals, but lacks in coherent screen writing and direction.","In On Stranger Tides, Johnny Depp returns as everyone's favorite rum guzzling, scenery chewing swashbuckler from the Pirates of the Caribbean saga, Captain Jack Sparrow.Several years after the events of At World's End, Jack is in London seeking a crew and a ship to set forth on a journey for the legendary Fountain of Youth, but after a chance meeting with an old flame of his named Angelica (Played by the lovely Penelope Cruz), he is brought aboard the Queen Anne's Revenge, a ship captained by the merciless Blackbeard (Played by Ian McShane), who is seeking the fountain for his own selfish needs, and who may possibly be Angelica's father. Meanwhile, Barbossa (Played by Geoffrey Rush), now a privateer for the English crown, is also on an expedition for the fountain, but above all else, has a personal score to settle with Blackbeard.The film is directed by Rob Marshall, the man behind Chicago and Memoirs of a Geisha, taking over the helm from Gore Verbinski, which is the first problem that this movie has. It's not that Marshall's direction is terrible, but it feels stylistically disjointed from the previous installments. The movie's screenplay also features moments of lazy writing, and quite a few incomprehensible subplots. But it's a Pirates of the Caribbean movie, so you know what you're getting: an admirable cast, highly effective humor, and fast paced action sequences, such as one particularly outstanding, and unsettling mermaid attack sequence.Another problem I have with the film, albeit to a lesser extent, is how it sounds. This isn't a knock against the creative effects, or another great score by Hans Zimmer, accompanied this time around by Mexican musical duo Rodrigo y Gabriela, but sometimes during the film, the blend of ringing swords, cannon fire and French horns mixed with the somewhat chaotic nature of the action scenes can become a bit bludgeoning.Still, like the previous entries, the film is typically beautifully designed through the great visual effects, lovely sets and costumes by John Myhre and Penny Rose, and incredible makeup work on mermaids, zombies, and injured sailors, so you can expect to hear me singing the praises of makeup designers Joel Harlow and Peter King for the rest of the year.On a final note, I do admit that the series has become a big cash cow, and with each new installment it had been getting worse, but I think this one is pretty much on par with the last installment. It's not a good movie, but it's fun enough.So I'm gonna give On Stranger Tides a tepid **1/2 out of ****",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Another trilogy coming?,"I'm assuming you have seen the previous installments of the Pirates of the Caribean saga/franchise. If you have, you know that Keiras and Orlandos character will not return for this one. But apart from Johnny Depp there are other people who do return from previous movies and lighten up the movie with their trademark humour.How will you feel about this movie? It depends clearly on your love of the Jack Sparrow character (Captain, I know). If you like that character a lot, you will not mind a few faults here and there. If you are fixed on the fact, that Keira and Orlando are gone, you might as well not watch this, because you won't enjoy it as much.The media tried to push other people in the cast as new Orlando and new Keira. But don't expect this to happen either.

View it as a spin off and it's a rollicking treasure seeking adventure.,"Ok lets have it out front right away, this particular writer loved the first film (Curse of the Black Pearl), was disappointed with the second (Dead Man's Chest) and positively found the third (At World's End) to be an incomprehensible bore. Part 4: On Stranger Tides is a shift in another direction, where a group of piratical characters, some we know well, others new to the fold, embark on missions to find the fabled Fountain of Youth. So think ""Indiana Jones"", ""National Treasures"" like adventures (hell even ""It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World"") and you get the drift here. Expectation of this franchise getting back to the heady days of that first film will be crushed pretty early on.There's a little too much going on here for it to be safe children's fare, but the adults, especially those who remember the serial silliness of adventure films of yore, will have a good time. The action set-pieces are superb, enter high speed carriage chase through London, some spiffing sword play deep in the brewery, Blackbeard (Ian McShane) using his black magic whiles to incarcerate mutineers in a whirl of maniacal ropes, and a mermaid attack that quite frankly rocks - as do the mermaids themselves the vicious teasers they are.Production is as expected top notch, and the cast, in spite of having to battle for screen time in a cast of thousands, are doing fine work (Pen√©lope Cruz a welcome heaving bosom of spunkiness). For sure our main man Captain Jack Sparrow, with Depp just about keeping the characters charm on tap, isn't as dominating a force as we would like, but he leaves his trusty fun mark and the others (Barbosa is back drinking rum out of his newly acquired peg leg) pick up the slack. It's unlikely to get better on revisits, so if you be hardcore POTC from earlier adventures, there's no point going back to se tis one. Those who like the type of films mentioned previously, and don't mind a different direction for the series, then tis holds no fears. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

stepping out of line to become the most enjoyable,"I had low expectations but was rewarded with all you could get from a movie like that - a perfect 7 star entertainment!I wasn't a big fan of the predecessors, because I was probably expecting them to be more like Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides. Fun entertainment with a simple yet interesting plot, including good jokes, beautiful actresses and actors portraying pleasantly caricatured characters as well as fascinating sets and action.Compared to the other movies with dozens of unfinished subplots, annoyingly stupid supernatural characters combined with cgi all over the place, main plots that are both boring and confusing (without the positive effect some complexity can have), this was brilliant.You will have no, or at least believe you don't have, long lasting scenes of boring cgi covering 90% of the screen - like giant octopuses or eternal fights with indestructible skeletons, but instead some mermaids with character. Shortening might have been possible, but all you want from a film like that is to lure you into another world for a while - why not for a bit longer?",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not Even Johnny Depp Could Save The Film From Sinking,"I remember when I first saw Pirates of the CarIbbean. I loved it. It was silly, but at the same time loads of fun from start to finish. I, like many fans of Curse of the Black Pearl highly anticipated the sequels. Again, like the first film I enjoyed them. Wonderful popcorn fun, full of funny characters and entertaining set pieces. Then the films ended and I was pleased with what I saw. Did we really need a fourth film?On Stranger Tides reunites us with the crowd pleasing Jack Sparrow, portrayed by non other then Johnny Depp. But where is Orlando Bloom? What has happened to Keira Knightly? No need to worry pirate fans, the writers have given us a Orlando Bloom look a like who is a preacher. He will fall in love with a mermaid. Problem solved? Well, not really. Although the other three films where the Johnny Depp show, Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly were still part of it and are missed in this instalment. However, Geoffrey Rush is back as Barbossa and Kevin McNally returns as Gibbs. But these characters returning doesn't add anything to the film at all. Not even the talents of Penelope Cruz or Stephan Graham help, and Ian McShanes Blackbeard is such a boring villain. I couldn't help but appreciate the inventiveness of Davy Jones in the previous two instalments whilst watching him on screen.The film hasn't got a plot or a point to it either. Different groups of characters are looking for the fountain of youth for different reasons. A bunch of stuff happens along the way and thats it. No, seriously, thats it. It's a film in which stuff is happening, but nothing actually happens. Although it can be argued that the same happened in the other three films, at least they were fun. This film is dull, tedious and very boring.Rob Marshall, the director has given nothing new or exciting to the franchise. Its Johnny Depp doing Jack Sparrow for over two hours. Which was fine before, but this time I found myself becoming annoyed at the character. I think Johnny Depp gives a good performance, but after waiting all these years for a sequel to see him do the same thing, but only not as good or funny is just one huge disappointment.I didn't hate the film, I was just so disappointed. There is no fun to be had in this dreary film at all. All you do is watch things happen, watch people talk, then things happen again, then people talk again, then things happen again and it just doesn't end. On Stranger Tides is lifeless, unexciting, tiresome and pointless. Captain Jack, enoughs enough. Lets just call it a day.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

ON STRANGER TIDES treads no new waters,"PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: ON STRANGER TIDES is quite a misleading title in many ways. First off, the movie no longer takes place in the Caribbean. While it never actually says which bodies of water this movie takes place in, the two countries involved are England and Spain, so it's safe to say we've moved to the Mediterranean Sea. And second, ON STRANGER TIDES treads nothing but familiar waters.One thing that OST does do that the previous trilogy did not was to make Jack Sparro‚Äîsorry. Captain Jack Sparrow‚Äîthe protagonist of the film. Take a moment and think: Who was the main character in THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL? It wasn't Jack; it was Will Turner. Will was on a journey to save Elizabeth, and Jack was merely his means to an end. Jack was never really a good guy. He's a pirate, after all. He's out for himself and toys with the characters actually involved with the story for his own personal amusement, only to succumb to his conscience and help save the day. But having Jack as an outside character‚Äîwith us not knowing his ultimate intentions until the very end‚Äîwas what lead him to be one of the most recognizable characters of this generation. But he's not a protagonist.Not all of Captain Jack's charisma is gone. He's still an entertaining character, but the mystery of what he's going to do next just isn't there anymore. I can't really blame Depp for this, as he pulls off Sparrow like he was born for it. But the writers just to have put him in a spot where he doesn't belong. Jack's intentions still aren't clear from the get-go, but the movie sets it up to be his story. And that causes some narrative problems.The movie itself is easily the worst of the series. To put that in perspective, I LOVE all three previous movies. Even AT WORLD'S END I adore. They're this generation's INDIANA JONES. While some may say it's better than 2 or 3, it doesn't really hold true to the original.Story-wise, it's pretty straightforward. Multiple groups of people are trying to find the Fountain of Youth for their own reasons. We're just seeing who's going to get there first and who's going to get what they want. Simple as that. But, as Captain Jack says so eloquently in one of his many clever, fourth wall-breaking comments, ""It's not so much the destination so much as the journey."" Too bad the journey isn't all that interesting.While the trailer points out both zombies and mermaids, only the mermaids hold any plot significance. The zombies are there because. . . well, why not? The first movie had a crew that turned into skeletons in the moonlight, and the second and third movie had a crew of mutated humans who looked like sea monsters. So why not make the crew of the bad guy's ship ""zombie-fied""? I will say, though, the mermaid scene was pretty damn brilliant. Too bad it's the most original and interesting part of the film, and it comes at about half-way in.Probably my biggest complaint is that many things that happen in OST just seem to be far too reminiscent of the original movie. The first escape scene is far too much like the one in the first movie, and the first sword fight is far too familiar to that of Sparrow vs. Turner‚Äîthey even fight up on planks on beams of the roof just like in the first movie. Even the final battle takes place in a cavern with rays of light coming down in patches from the holes all around. It's all too familiar and very uninspired‚Äînot to say it isn't enjoyable, but it's nothing new. Other than the mermaid sequence, nothing stands out. There's no fight with people morphing back and forth from skeletons. There's no fight on a rolling water wheel. There's no fight on ships trapped in a whirlpool.One thing the movie never does is become bad. It's just disappointing how mediocre it ends up being. The movie is still enjoyable and has a lot of that humor from the original three. The characters are still fun to follow, and the locations are gorgeous. But it just doesn't go on past decent most of the time and never beyond good. Is it worth checking out? Yeah. Despite my negative criticisms, the movie's still fun to watch. Just don't expect the same magic that the first three had.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
not impressive,"This is a good movie, but some films just don't convince the audience and don't leave a mark in film history, I think they should have stopped at the third POC movie or let gore verbinski direct this 4th movie, with his special techniques that gave me a good view in the 1st trilogy, I like the idea of introducing mermaids and barbossa having a wooden leg which obviously contributes a lot to pirate films. The zombies could have worked out well but unfortunately they weren't displayed in a convincing way as we didn't learn much about them and I felt it was just a copy of Davy Jones and his crew but in a lame way...black beard was a great add 2 the series but its weird how they just suddenly added him as a ""pirate all pirates fear"" well where the heck was he when Davy Jones and Barbossa were considered lords of ocean? and angelica is a disappointment, her character was added to waste time and add more to the movie... Also Syrena and Sam were a fail at creating a replacement for will and Elizabeth, but if a 5th movie comes out, Sam and syrena will probably have stronger contribution to the movie...POC4 was a sort of rush, this movie seemed to have been made just to earn money, it was an obvious copy of the 1st movie (curse of black pearl), it was a quest to find something that brings u back to life as it was the same plot used by the Aztec treasure that removes the curse, and most the sword fights were very similar.. and black beard was a way to reprise Davy Jones' character...I also think its a little stupid how the Spaniards went looking for the fountain and then they stated that ""its not the fountain that gives u youth, youth comes from God,"" well then why the hell did u bother going to the fountain?. Another stupid thing is how the whole crew went to drink from the fountain to get youth and at the end only black beard and angelica drank from it, and one of them had 2 sacrifice..but overall this movie is good for entertainment, but if your a fan of the 1st trilogy I don't think you will like this 1...I really don't see why its called on stranger tides anyway, I know its a novel, but the name of the movie should have been ""pirates of the Caribbean: the fountain of youth""",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It's clich√© to say but they have done it again!!!,"The Pirates franchise has always been a perfect blend of action, visuals, and comedy. As for the 4th installment, these three things are not only still part of the major experience but more powerful than ever.For starters, there is way too much going on in front of the camera for you to be easily distracted with a text or people entering and leaving the theater(which I highly doubt there will be much exiting). Secondly, if there is ever what seems to be a dull moment then Hans Zimmer's fantastic as usual score will zap you right back in to the movie. Finally, the scenery alone is worth the time and at least a matin√©e priced ticket. So, in the end Pirates does not require a long list of the good and the bad in the movie. These movies are meant for the shier pleasure of being entertained with a more than sufficient amount of eye candy and great scripts with the right touch of family/adult comedy.As for Depp, he has pleasured the screen with many great performances, but Captain Jack Sparrow will never walk the plank on the ship of his most memorable.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Depp stars again as Captain Jack,"Having seen the previous 3 Pirates of the Caribbean films, I was always going to want to see the latest film in the series to see how it compared. Rob Marshall took over from Gore Verbinski as director to deliver Captain's Jack Sparrow's latest adventures on the high seas.'On Stranger Tides' focuses on the competitive battle to find the Fountain of Youth.The fountain has the power to transfer the remaining years of life from 1 person to another. To do this the fountain's water must be drunk using 2 chalices, 1 containing a mermaid's tear.Jack Sparrow, after rescuing his friend Joshamee Gibbs from certain execution in London, has got his hands on a map that can lead him to the fountain - making him a very useful commodity.The Spanish fleet have also found clues to the whereabouts of the fountain and set off from Southern Europe in large numbers to find it. The British forces find out about this and desperate not to be shown up, hire Captain Barbosa (one of the few characters to make it into the new film from the previous trilogy) to lead a ship and beat the Spanish to the fountain.We find out later that Barbosa is really spurred on by revenge to track down and kill Captain Blackbeard.Barbosa may get what his want, as Blackbeard has received a supernatural vision of his future that states he will be killed by a one-legged man. Desperate to avoid this grisly fate, Blackbeard sets his sights on finding the 2 chalices and utilising the magic of the Fountain of Youth to extend his life.Blackbeard's daughter Veronica (Penelope Cruz), who we find out has a romantic history with Jack, manages to capture Sparrow and take him aboard her father's ship as a member of the crew.After failing in his attempts to overthrow Blackbeard as the captain of the ship by orchestrating a mutiny, Jack's life is threatened and he is forced to comply with Blackbeard's requests. Blackbeard then goes on a 'scavenger hunt' against the clock, trying to get his hands on the 2 chalices and a teardrop from a beautiful man-eating mermaid.The film culminates with a 3-way battle between all of the 3 interested parties at the fountain itself. I won't spoil who wins! MY 2 CENTS The Pirates of the Caribbean series of films has always provided good family entertainment and the swashbuckling nature of pirate life will always capture the imagination of audiences from a variety of age-groups.Johnny Depp is, as we have come to expect, amazing as Captain Jack Sparrow. A charismatic and energetic performance ensures that he steals every scene he is in. His rapport with Angelica was also successful and the sexual tension between Depp and Cruz far exceeded that between Depp and Keira Knightly in the previous pirate films. Geoffrey Rush was great, reprising his role as the salty seadog, Captain Barbosa.Ian McShane looked menacing as Captain Blackbeard, but sadly despite obviously lacking any form of real morality, the character never really became the menacing presence I feel a villain in such films should be. His reliance on the supernatural was never really demonstrated beyond rope tricks on his ship.Shot against beautiful Jamaican islands, the film provided the perfect environment for the characters to perform their expertly executed action sequences. In my opinion though, the film relied too heavily on these sword fighting scenes, which I know is an odd statement to make about a film about pirates. I think a running time of 2 hours and 17 minutes helped make these stunts a tad repetitive, with maybe a little more variety required.The use of the Spanish fleet also seemed pretty redundant and I don't know why they were really required in the film. The characters offered nothing in entertainment and I think we could have done without them.The were laughs to be had throughout the film, mainly from Jack himself, but I think there was a void left that was previously filled by the pirate comic duo, Pintel and Ragetti (Lee Arenberg and Mackenzie Crook). This kind of comic relief wasn't addressed and could be why the constant tirades of action and sword-play became a tad tiresome.MY RATING: 3/5 I enjoyed this compared to ""At world's end"" and would certainly recommend it if you enjoy the rest of the Pirates of the Caribbean series.Depp is again in his element as Captain Jack but as with most films that run over 2 hours, you will find yourself drift off now and again due to the constant action scenes. I will always be interested in this film series as long as Depp sticks with it.A good film, but unspectacular.LIKE THIS REVIEW?

The good is back..,"After the sequel duds, I can safely say Pirates of the Caribbean is back to its fun roots with On Stranger Tides.I have to admit, I am not a PoTC geek. In fact, I have only managed to see the first one completely; the second and third one were too long, too boring, and too confusing to be worth my time.Stranger Tides boasts of a tight script, stellar visuals, fantastic adventure and, of course, great performance from the entire cast, especially Captain Sparrow, Johnny Depp.The movie does get a bit stretched, consequently drowning the tempo before relieving it with another fun sequence. I would say a trim of about 15-20mins would had made the movie even better.Overall, Stranger Tides is an excellent movie. Even if you have not followed the previous story lines, and as long as you are aware of the characters, you will have no trouble following the story in this one.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great Flick but 3D not used properly,"Enjoyed the flick very much. Love Depp and Cruz and everyone in it. Great story and a lot of fun. But why pay extra for 3D if the possible effects were not utilized. Nearly 60 years ago one-eyed director Andre de Toth mapped out 3D in the Vincent Price House of Wax much more cleverly than is utilized in this Pirates. Old 3D movies showed very specific (if exaggerated) depth and did not hesitate to throw things out of the screen at the audience. I sometimes wonder if modern 3D movies are even shot in 3D as most scenes seem to lack that illusion of depth. Kudos to the film itself, a lot of fun. But be aware that the 3D claim is a rip off. (I saw it in Real 3D, perhaps the iMax version is more effective.)",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Beautiful production, lot's of action but empty","On Stranger Tides is beautifully produced and shot with great sets and scenery and lots of action right in your face with rapid editing. Great costumes, great dialog, great acting. The only problem is, it's all rather boring. Even the fight scenes seem rather tired and unoriginal.Depp as usual does a very good job with Sparrow and is quite funny here & there but I found myself becoming very tired very quickly and afterward felt glad to be back outside in the sun when it was over.The film is long, over 2 hours. Not much of that two hours is spent on dialog and story. Some people might not want that but then the rest just seems rather empty and distracting for the sole purpose of being distracting.I loved the first film but all the mystery seems to be gone from this franchise. I hear Mr. Depp will not be playing Sparrow again and maybe even he knows, it's time to retire this.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I'm over it.,"""Gentlemen, the fountain is the prize. Mermaid waters, that be our path."" Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush)In ""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,"" CaptainJack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) searches for the fountain of youth with the welcome help of Angelica (Penelope Cruz) and the usual suspects. The action is incessant, the eccentric characters plentiful, and the adventure as a whole increasingly thin, an overload of trying hard to be quirky and ending up jerky. Even cameos by Judi Dench and Keith Richards can't surface this sunken treasure.Jack and Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) try to beat Blackbeard (Ian McShane) and his daughter (Cruz) to the fountain. While the addition of dangerous mermaids adds glamour and sex to a frequently unsexy franchise (faithful to its family orientation), this enormous franchise needs to drink from that fountain itself. Johnny Depp's drunken, fey pirate is getting old (he did get an Oscar nomination back when this was fresh stuff in 2003), the affectations merely keeping us from understanding what he is saying rather than adding to his characterization.Additionally, the fight scenes rival Lord of the Rings for their excessive number and blinding cutting, leaving one to wonder if director Rob Marshall didn't just take footage from other swashbuckling movies. But the greatest thief of all is the 3-D pirate of lighting: The process drains light from scenes, and not just in this film. I'm a big supporter of 2-D.And, yes, I'm over this franchise. When Geoffrey Rush and Ian McShane make me think of their previous acting triumphs rather their respective roles as Barbossa and Blackbeard, when the addition of a clich√©d love between a mermaid and a preacher make you beg for the return of Orlando and Keira, and when Johnny Depp and Penelope Cruz can't make me forget this is a dull sequel, then it's time to let someone else handle the critique of the next installment.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Yet another exciting pirate adventure, but as expected worse then the previous ones","The fourth part in the majorly successful saga of Jack Sparrow and fellow & non-pirates fills exactly all of my expectations for this movie: a new swashbuckling adventure, packed with action and fantasy but with a missing lack of hilarious quotes that the first three movies possessed.Johnny Depp is amazing as usual, the technical elements are outstanding as usual and the movie has some funny moments, but still less and some less funny or felicitous as in the previous movies. On a hand, i might even a bit miss Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley, since there has to be someone in a movie that you dislike a bit for its particular honesty and general lameness, if you understand what I mean.Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides is a movie that i enjoyed, since i really like the whole series, but is still yet another proof that there is a low chance of sequels beating the original. Maybe the reason is Rob Marshall, who replaced Gore Verbinski and the screenplay-writers that replaced Stuart Beattie. But actually - i don't really care. I expected this to be worse then its ""ancestors"" and it was. But it was still a great movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Good, not great -- does not have the repeatability of the original trilogy.","Admirable attempt to create a new adventure in the Pirates canon with no egregious violations but certainly a host of minor infractions. It's fun, sometimes funny, with some favorite characters as well as a few new faces and succeeds at entertaining even as it falls short of it's venerable history.First the GOOD: Johnny Depp, while not quite as out of balance or odd, still delivers the quirky pirate we've all come to love. Geoffrey Rush also reprises a favorite character with relish and aplomb. Ian McShane as Blackbeard has surprising presence and I enjoyed the mystery and intensity he brings to the role. Also good are a few good action scenes, some funny moments as Barbossa & Sparrow attempt a daring heist and are captured, and the interesting twist on mermaid folklore.Another great moment was the inclusion of a true classic scene from the Pirates of the Caribbean ride - the ""Skeleton on the bed with a magnifying glass"". It was a joy to see they're still working in elements from the Disney ride that launched this billion dollar empire.The NOT-SO-GOOD: The two primary offenders happen to be the dialogue and the land-locked conquest. First of all, this is a Pirates movie, and that should mean a lot of action on the sea, canons shooting, fighting and outmaneuvering and the mystery of discovery. Instead, we spent at least 3/4ths of the movie getting prepared to set sail, or searching for the Fountain of Youth. Oye, ye Land Lubbers!The second major problem is the dialogue doesn't have the punch, or the comedy worked into the original. There is too much exposition about the quest, and everybody seems to already know where the Fountain is. Jack Sparrow is more coherent and succinct, with less meandering and fewer odd word choices. And I think we miss out on a lot of comic potential without the two bumbling sidekicks or a love triangle involvement.The interaction between Sparrow and Angelica (Cruz) is never quite believable. We don't sense Jack actually pining for her, nor does Angelica seem any bit entranced by Sparrow. She is overly dedicated to her father for reasons not explained or believable. I can't believe this... but I miss Keira Knightley's internal struggles and wish Cruz had more of that conflict.The movie definitely suffers from the lack of a true good guy (ie. Will Turner) and a true bad guy (ie. Davy Jones). This setup had allowed Jack Sparrow's self-serving nature to be showcased, moving on a whim to whichever angle served him best. In Pirates 4, Jack Sparrow has taken the ""good guy"" role, which doesn't fit him quite right.CONCLUSIONS: While it's not a bad movie and I was happy to see it, this movie is going to be more sharply criticized for its shortcomings. Too much land-trekking, more mundane expository dialogue, too light on comedy and not enough discovery.It's a fun ride, but not repeatably wonderful like the ""original trilogy"" (which is becoming a more common phrase isn't it?)",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fairly Entertaining...,"'Pirates Of The Carribbean: On Stranger Tides', directed by Rob Marshall, is a fairly entertaining fourth installment in the Pirates of the Caribbean series, with a fun & effortless performance by Depp, in his most popular character, Captain Jack Sparrow.Depp returns as Captain Jack Sparrow, this time to search for the Fountain of Youth, and is accompanied by Angelica, played by Pen√©lope Cruz, legendary pirate Blackbeard, played by, Ian McShane, a young missionary Philip Swift, played by Sam Claflin and the beautiful mermaid Syrena, played by √Ästrid Berg√®s-Frisbey.'Pirates Of The Carribbean: On Stranger Tides' has a weak first hour, but picks up gradually and redeems itself in the second hour.

Sparrow takes flight yet again.,"As long as Johnny Depp continues to don the tri-cornered hat and banadana, it would seem the Pirates Of The Caribbean franchise has a lot of life left in it. After all it is a cash cow that Disney will milk until it's udders fall off.I've noticed in the past that franchise renewals,(Star Wars being a perfect example), seem contrived and somewhat straw clutching in their plots as film makers struggle blindly if not enthusiastically to take their old characters to new levels of excitement. POTC - On Stranger Tides is a welcome exception.I for one was thrilled with this new installment. I found that making the original films a trilogy bloated them slightly so I'm glad that the new movie, can be pretty much classed as a stand alone adventure as the original Movie was before the sequels were made. I also feel that the future of the franchise should lie in these stand alone adventures where you can watch them in any order you want like the James Bond movies and not watch them in any semblance of order just to keep track of the plot.Captain Jack Sparrow is without doubt the best anti-hero the screen has had since Clint Eastwood's 'Man With No Name' in the spaghetti westerns of the 1960's and it is a part that Depp will always be best remembered for. It would be a shame if they ruin the franchise by bloating it with a further interlinking trilogy.It has been a few years since Jack Sparrow graced our screens and it's as if he hasn't been away and everything you expect Jack to be is wonderfully still there. No plot spoilers here I'm glad to say as I do not want to ruin anyone's enjoyment of this magnificent film and you should see it without prior influencing opinionsThe only gripe I have is the 3D version which although is very good fails to capitalise on certain situations that would have been great had the 3D been used more effectively, so I feel that they've missed a trick or two on that score. Hollywood studios have been playing about with 3D now for the better part of 60 years and only in that last 10 years or so have nailed it into a viable art form. We now have the technology but it's the technicians that have let this one down slightly.Don't be upset that there is no Will Turner or Elizabeth Swann in this adventure as that's no bad thing as I feel that their story had gone as far as it could have. As I said earlier, the POTC franchise begins and ends with Jack Sparrow and most importantly, Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow. As long as he's there, then I'm sure that they'll be many more of these movies to come and thrill us.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
More of the same.,"If you've never seen a Pirates film before, this will probably seem pretty darn good. It keeps a fast pace, never seems to get dull. There's a few new inclusions to the story - Blackbeard being one, and Ian McShane does a pretty fair job of being someone you don't really want to mess with (in a Disney sort of way!). The mermaids are a nice touch too. The story and plot flow pretty well and most of the actors do a pretty good job. Except for Geoffry. I don't know why, because I think he's a great actor, but he's just not as convincing in this. I always felt like I was watching Geoffry Rush and not his character.The other slightly disappointing thing with this movie is that it felt a little 'formula' driven, like it was a bit too well thought out or over rehearsed and too slick. In the end, while there was nothing to complain about, I just wasn't engaged by the movie and have spent almost no time thinking about it once it finished. Towards the end I was resisting the temptation to look at my watch....and we all know THAT feeling.At the end of the film, my wife and I looked at each other and just sort of shrugged.....aw yeah...it was alright sort of thing.It's definitely worth a watch, but it's nothing you haven't already seen.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Worst yet,"I throughly enjoyed Pirates 1 and 2, but felt three was drifting off too much.. this one is the worst yet.It starts off OK, wonderful sets of 18th century London and has the typical Pirates action from the very beginning. The first 15 minutes or so are quite entertaining however it then drifts into a disconnected story (losely based on several factual characters) and the continuation of the Jack Sparrow story. Not wishing to spoil, but it becomes all a bit too supernatural and ridiculous, there are moments of humour but few and far between. The location is clearly Hawaii and does not look remotely Caribbean which was rather annoying, perhaps it should have been called pirates of the Pacific.Anyway, all that aside this is a poor reflection of the first two films and honestly it was disappointing, somewhat laboured and one couldn't help feel it's A sour end to what should have remained a trilogy.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
More Fun Than an Ocean Full of CGI Mermaids,"KIDS FIRST! youth film critic, Daniel Menegaz reviewed Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides for us. You can see his videotaped review, together with his twin brother Jonah, here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMBP6w8qFBkOr read his written review below: Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, is a continuation of the adventures of Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), this time in a race to the Fountain of Youth along with femme fatale Angelica (Penelope Cruz), the infamous pirate Black Beard (Ian McShane) and crusty Barbossa (Geoffery Rush).The movie is very exciting, with a lot of action and a healthy dose of well placed humor. Not only is the acting good, but the action choreography is amazing as well.The roles of the characters are perfectly portrayed by the actors playing them. The CGI is so real, (especially of the mermaids) you are sure to be on the edge of you seat, almost in the movie.But if you want to feel like you're really a part of all the action, see it in Imax or 3D¬Ö or both. The picture in Imax 3D is astonishing and helped make the movie all it could be. The soundtrack is also very well played, setting the tone of each scene nicely.If you're looking for a good movie, go see Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides.

aargh!!! Jack is back,"Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, is an adventure fantasy film and the fourth installment in the Pirates of the Caribbean series. In the film, Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is joined by Angelica (Pen√©lope Cruz). I am not a huge fan of part 4s and was skeptical about the movie and expected it to stink.This movie packs a lot of action and reminds us why we liked the 1st Pirates of the Caribbean: curse of the black pearl. This to me is the second best of the series as the writers take us back to the old Jack Sparrow¬Öoh! Sorry, he prefers to be called by his full name Captain Jack Sparrow.Also in this movie we have Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) return with a lot of arggh, and a lost leg. You won't even miss Will and Elizabeth Turner as Angelica (Penelope Cruz) does a good job as a female role to replace the two.The plot to me was pointless and lacks all sense at all, and yet the director still found a way to keep me glued. The movie did have lumps, as Jack Sparrow's swag was a little tuned down and we get to see him look serious at some time, the length of the movie to me was also unreasonable, some dialogue were let me say foolish and while some achieved the purpose of making you laugh.The plot is centered and continues from the previous movie, as we watch a three way chase The Fountain of Youth, by The Spanish, The English led by Babossa and Blackbeard (Ian McShane). The movie has a subplot that involves a mermaid (French actress Astrid Berg√®s-Frisbey) to a missionary (Sam Claflin). Ian McShane, did well in the role of Blackbeard as he had the voice that can make any character look like the devil.The romance between Jack and Angelica, was just cool as we see them fall in and out of the love thingy.If you are a big fan of the first pirates film you will love this one, if not please stay away. All in all, Johnny Depp put in a fantastic performance and although i believe the writers could have done a better Job with the plot, i still give the movie a seven as it is a funny, good, not for young kids as the rating 13 says movie. all sense at all, and that's how we love it. The Spanish have found a way to get to the fountain of youth and the English we see King George II (Richard Griffiths), captures Jack and his first mate Dibbs with the help of Babossa and ask him to lead them to the fountain of youth before the Spanish get there. Jack escapes and gets captured by Blackbeard and his first mate and daughter Angelica. So he leads Blackbeard to the fountain Babossa leads the English and the Spanish who already know the way are also heading there, so we are watching a three way race to the fountain. The movie has a subplot that involves a mermaid (lovely French actress Astrid Berg√®s-Frisbey) to a missionary (Sam Claflin). And we also have to find the requirements to drink of the fountain, two silver chalices, a mermaid's tear from what we discover that this mermaids are the stone hearts of the oceans, so getting a tear from them will¬Ö well go watch and find out how they did it and¬Ö oh! Yes off to the Fountain of Youth. Aargh!!!.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Almost a standalone sequel, if not by one peculiar map...","It took me a while to finally watch this movie. Too bad I missed the hype back then. This movie stands the test of time, but only if you watch it as a standalone entry into the PoC series.PoC: On Stranger Tides picks up after the events ofPirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007), although, we are not sure how much time has passed. Jack Sparrow is after a new ship, as always. Now, he is seeking it in London, where he finds not only familiar faces, but also gets caught in a plot to find the Fountain of Youth.This is essentially the misadventures of Jack Sparrow in his universe. The only remenants of the third movie is the map Jack took for himself. This might lead to some negative reviews from the fans, but I personally don't care that much. It is not like this movie is based on any book or a known story, so they can be as creative as they want to.Turns out Jack is not the only one wanting to go to the Fountain. To be honest, it is not entirely clear if he really wanted to go there; what is sure is he wanted a ship. The Spanish also wants to find the Fountain, so as the English led by one familiar captain of ours.There is a ritual they need to perform, but this is only to add more drama to the plot. Of course the key elements for the ritual come from pirates' lore and folklore.In the end, this movie is basically exploiting the success of the PoC series and its infamour Jack character. Not bad, but definitely predictable. It definitely feels like one of those superhero movies with a plot that starts and finishes, but leaves one tiny thread for a possible sequel, even though the sequel might relate as little as possible to its predecessor.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Lives up to its predecessors,"I am a big Pirates of the Caribbean fan, so I'm kind of ashamed of myself for seeing it so late after the release. I didn't know what to think of this movie before I went to see it, because some people loved it, yet some hated it: so I had to check it out for myself. I did do that and I went into the cinema with no expectations what so ever, so I was not disappointed. Wasn't disappointed? I loved the film!It was very entertaining, the writers did a great job. Johnny Depp was absolutely amazing as usual and Geoffrey Rush played well too. Ian McShane was kind of a weak villain, and the movie took a little bit too much time to start (the first half is very slow, with unnecessary sword fights), but for the second half Rob Marshall finally finds himself and continues the film in a good pace and rhythm. I don't think Marshall is a better or worse director than Gore Verbinski, the change of directors freshened up the franchise a bit. I didn't mind the priest- mermaid love story in the film either, I think it was a good added spice.I wouldn't go as far as to say this film was the best in the series, but it was by far the most entertaining and it lived up to the first one. Thanks to Hans Zimmer's breath-taking music, Johnny Depp's performance and the hilarious character of Jack Sparrow, this franchise will never get old for me.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Jack's Talent,"A question that has been brought up in the other three movies, is how does Jack always manage to escape, Does he have a plan or does he improvise as he goes? The escape From the Palace answered my question and, I'm sure, many other viewer's. He is simply genius. Of course, he does have to improvise, but all his escapes are planned with a great deal of care. Thus making his captors always remember the day they ""almost caught Jack Sparrow"" I'm relieved that this movie had more of Jack than the previous 3. As he is the reason we run to theaters every time a new movie of the franchise is released. A breath of fresh air. Also, it is funny to see how time and time again, Barbosa cannot live without Sparrow. They hate each other but are always thrown together for whatever reason.

Kind of a step back for the series.,"'PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: ON STRANGER TIDES': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The fourth Jack Sparrow swashbuckling adventure with Johnny Depp once again reprising the role. Gore Verbinski, who directed the first three 'PIRATES' films bowed out this time around. He's been replaced by Rob Marshall, who's former film experience is directing two highly acclaimed musicals ('CHICAGO' and 'NINE') and a romantic period piece ('MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA'). Also absent this time around are Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley). Writers Ted Elliott, Terry Rossio, Stuart Beattie and Jay Wolpert all returned (for the fourth time) to pen this installment. It's adapted from a book, 'On Stranger Tides', written by Tim Powers. The story revolves around a journey to find the 'Fountain of Youth'. Sparrow and Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush also returning for the fourth time) are incorporated into the storyline and are pitted against Blackbeard (Ian McShane) and his daughter Angelica (Penelope Cruz). The film is a little shorter and lighter weight than the others (the budget was a little slimmer and the film doesn't have quite as epic a feel). It certainly doesn't measure up to the fun of the first two films but I'd say it's equally as impressive as the third chapter.The movie opens with Captain Sparrow attempting to locate an impersonator in London who has been ruining his 'good' name. He re-teams with his old first mate Gibbs (once again played by Kevin McNally) after rescuing him from execution, for crimes allegedly committed by Jack Sparrow. The two are captured though and Sparrow is taken to King George II (Richard Griffiths) who tasks him with the assignment of finding the 'Fountain of Youth' before the Spanish do. Barbossa is now working for the British Navy (after losing the Black Pearl) and is in charge of the mission. Jack escapes and soon learns his impostor is an old love interest named Angelica, who is working with her father (the notorious pirate Blackbeard) to find the 'Fountain of Youth' as well. They force Jack in to joining their crew (which includes men turned into loyal zombies) and help them on their journey. Will and Elizabeth are replaced this time around by a young missionary named Philip Swift (Sam Claflin), who is held captive on Blackbeard's boat, and a mermaid named Syrena (Astrid Berges-Frisbey), also imprisoned by Blackbeard, that Swift falls for.The film has most of the action and escapism thrills you'd expect from a 'PIRATES' movie. It's a little smaller scale and more simplistic than the other installments and therefore seems like kind of a step back for the series. Depp is just as quirky and funny as usual but Sparrow this time around is a lot less selfish and not nearly as much the antihero fans have come to know and love. Marshall's directing is adequate for this type of movie but it's not as impressive as Verbinski's. The film is not as convoluted a mess as the third chapter but it also lacks it's epicness and larger than life thrills. It probably won't disappoint die-hard fans of the series too much but it certainly doesn't live up to the first two installments. I've never been a huge 'PIRATES' fan but I've always respected the original two films as the fun classic swashbuckling adventures that they are. This film doesn't deserve the same kind of respect but it's definitely worth checking out if you're a fan of the series.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PF5zRynRifs",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The bottom of the Rum Barrel,"What we are missing here is a decent story, characters we feel a connection with, humor and an actual villain. The 3D effects were decent and the Mermaids were the best part IMO. The characters are weak at best, including everyone's beloved Captain Jack Sparrow. Poor performances abound in this picture. The most disappointing is how they portrayed the most feared pirate in maritime history... Blackbeard. Here's where the director really drops the ball. Also some of the newly introduced characters seem like filler and never add to the film. As excited as I was after seeing the first movie, I'm equally utterly disappointed in this installment. Seeing how this series has become a cash cow I'm sure we can expect more mindless dibble packaged as a summer blockbuster.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Show me that horizon!,"Thoroughly enjoyable! Although the plot could have been more substantial, it is worth 2 hours and 15 minutes of your time. Because there were so many sub-plots in P.O.C. At Worlds End, I had to go see that one twice to make sure I understood it all - but I still loved it. On Stranger Tides was perhaps a little *too* simple, I think....but again, I still enjoyed it. Note: Ian McShane should have been nastier & meaner. In the scheme of things, Cutler Beckett (from P.O.C. 2 & 3) was a more despicable and unlikable character than Blackbeard turned out to be. Just for perspective, I am a grandmother and I am happy to say that I am still a die-hard P.O.C. fan. Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush might cringe if they saw this, but I could sit and listen to Jack Sparrow and Hector Barbossa read a dictionary for 2 hours and 15 minutes. Here's hoping for another P.O.C. in 4 or 5 years - and I am sure with a clever script they will get the formula just right. Forget the critics - it's a fun movie. Go see it. Now!

painfully bad,"This is not Gore Verbiski's movie anymore, but I was very surprised to find out that the same writers of the previous parts wrote this pile of crap. To summarize, this is a collection of clich√©s, thin jokes and too clean pirates. Captain Jack is Captain Jack, but, yes, cleaner and much less inspired. Associating him with a forgotten love (Penelope Cruz), which is sassy and untamed, is a huge clich√©. The plot, as a new adventure without any relation with previous stories but a map, is very poor crafted. The action sequences are just unreal, especially the escape from the court of King George. Everything feels artificial and crafted on commission. It's really an irony that this movie had the highest profits from the series. It shows that the public is really stupid or was unaware of how bad this is. Which is not an excuse, because I had the feeling this is going to be very bad from the first trailer I've saw( I watched the movie on HBO).

The story lacks the Pirate kick barely involving Jack Sparrow as the lead artist. I miss the crew, the one eyed guy and his mate, lack of the usual wit in dialogs. The sea mermaids were making the story too much of a fantasy story rather than a Pirate action movie. What's the point in selecting Penelope Cruz with so little role tagged to her, any artist could have played her role and put the hype to rest. Anyhow, it a good entertainer, but as a fan of Pirate I feel a little disappointed.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Too much of Jack Sparrow!,"Similar to the original in mood and tone,this movie is definitely better than the third movie in the series.But not the best in the series.Its strictly average,even for hardcore Johnny Depp fans.This movie has wafer thin storyline,little action,little comedy and nothing feels complete.Everywhere on the screen you see Jack Sparrow and little of other characters.Even his character has got nothing new to offer! Just the usual witty(is it still witty at all?) last minute escapes.Even the Visual effects weren't awesome or anything,just OK.The third movie does a better job in that category. Just another movie sequel that is made for squeezing money!",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Another Trip With Jack Sparrow,"Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides is a fairly decent film in terms of expectations. It met all my expectations from previous films and even exceeded them compared to POTC3.The story is fairly simple in the fact that it is made clear from the beginning where the story has to go. There are a few twists and deal changes which adds a little more depth to the story of the overall story arc. The special effects are often very good but in parts look a little cheap (the swords for one). I am not sure if this is just for the 3D aspect of the movie or if it will look the same in 2D.The 3D is very heavy and intense at times in this movie and therefore can hinder the viewing at times because often characters would appear in the foreground and look blurry compared to those in the background of the shots.Another thing which also did surprise me was the unnecessary use of sexual innuendos and moments which were quite surprising for a Disney film. Having said that it worked 9 times out of 10 and made the whole audience laugh.Overall, if you are a fan of the POTC franchise then you will enjoy this because it is far better than the previous installment but does not quite top POTC2 in the opinion. The new characters are a breath of fresh air although I would have like to have seen more new characters throughout to keep the story from going stale which at times I felt it did.Hopefully they will add more characters when the next film is released as I am sure there will be another.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A better Pirates film,"I had decent optimism going into this film as I was hoping it would be more of a back to basics Pirates film with the intention of really entertaining its audience. With the you know who characters gone this was a clean slate and right from the outset I knew there wasn't going to be an insincere dark plot that fails to get off the ground. The fountain of youth element may seem like a thin plot for a film so long but the writers seemed to remember what genre they are in. This is more of an action film with plenty of sword fights put in. However much of the action is shot in the dark which if you're not a fan of may be off putting. Aside from that camera angle wise it is well shot and doesn't feel disorientating in the slightest clearly wanting their audience to be a part of the action without methods like shaky cam.The film isn't perfect and the pacing becomes questionable towards the middle with some scenes looking as though they are repeating themselves. Nonetheless there is a decent pay off with the subsequent scenes. Onto the performances and they are mostly good. Johnny Depp, Geoffrey Rush and co are brilliant in their roles and the film doesn't feel like it is all about Captain Jack with the way it was written. He was in just enough to be humorous without being irritating, although it is all a matter of taste and I would fully understand people becoming irritated by Jack Sparrow by now. Penelope Cruz now plays the female lead and it is clear even though we haven't seen them together before that her character Angelica and Captain Jack clearly have a chemistry and their scenes together were probably the highlight. In this sense Cruz made for a much better female lead this time round and stepped into the series like she had been there since the first film. The film despite its issue with pacing at the mid point didn't feel too long and had mostly kept itself to a premium. There is nothing terribly memorable in the film which is why it doesn't get a higher rating, it simply captures the spirit without being spectacular. In summary though it is a decent Pirates film and an improvement for the series that seemed to treat its audience with more respect this time round.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Um...no,"I have to be honest, though I am a huge Pirates fan..I went in with low expectations. I hoped though, that somewhere within the depths of this movie that it would pull out some old feelings..everything that I had seen in terms of production just looked like a straight grab for cash. As I watched the first scene of the film...my face sank into my hands (so THIS is the kind of movie it is)...I don't know why they had to continue the series, especially because they had rounded it off so well. I mean, sure they could have continued it, the ending was set up that way. But the writers had obviously changed, it had a lack of depth..and the main character, the selling point of this convoluted attempt at a sequel..Had completely changed. Jack Sparrow's charm and befuddling narrow luck has been ground out to a muddled insignificant protagonist with no soul. Watching this movie...I hoped for a pause..some easy peace that I could take for the worth of the film..I was left with more plot holes and lazy writing than I thought could be allowed passable for even a B movie. I have NEVER wanted to walk out of a movie more. I went it with no expectations...knowing that if I did that, I'd walk out with something more..I shouldn't have seen it..Because not only did it not give me anything, it took a sharp and indifferent rip out my love for the show. Pirates is great, something that I'm excited to show my children one day...But I'm not ever going to tell them that this movie was made. I think we were all hoping for something amazing. This film is for suckers.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

He could be snoring and it would be full of character and devious charm.

We are also introduced to new characters: Angelica (Penelope Cruz) and the feared Blackbeard (Ian McShane), who behold are also looking for the fountain, in fact that really sums up the plot.About its 3D,effects are not great what i was expected.But I've always enjoyed pirate movies,but i count Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides (2011)in my list.So,if you are a good fan Of Jhony Deep,ants too see stunning Penelope....then go see it for laughs, fun, and a moment of escapism into a world where the supernatural exists, there's lost treasure to be found and adventures to be had.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Reboot or Sequel?,"When it comes to the fourth Pirates of the Caribbean film, ""On Stranger Tides,"" the franchise feels like it has lost a step or two. With the addition of Blackbeard as an antagonist and his daughter as the love interest to Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow character, it's as though this entry in the Pirates franchise was made more for money than good storytelling. Nothing is ever mentioned of Elizabeth Swann or Will Turner's characters from the first three films, it's as though those stories had not happened.Fans of the first three will be disappointed that Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley do not reprise their roles in this fourth film. It does make one wonder what did happen to their characters, will they be back in the fifth film? If the franchise is to succeed, Disney execs better hire them! The fans may not stick around for a fifth film if these two are not reunited with Jack Sparrow.As for the story of ""On Stranger Tides,"" we find Jack Sparrow eagerly searching for the Fountain of Youth. However, the notorious Blackbeard is in search too, Jack's pirate enemy. The story itself has some splendor; it doesn't seem to drag on. It may have been more intriguing though if it didn't seem like a reboot of the franchise and just another continuation of the series.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Entertainment At It's Best,"First Jack Sparrow and our favorite pirates dealt with a curse from gold that makes you a zombie under the moon(Black Pearl), next they dealt with creatures that looked like a sperm whale's puke(Dead Man's Chest), then our pirates dealt with... A bunch of random things (World's End). Now in Stranger Tides, it's a race for the fountain of youth. With a load of new characters, and not a sight of William Turner or Casey Jones.The one thing that everyone wants to see in this movie is another enjoyable watching of Jack Sparrow, who captures the fun of being a pirate for us all like a master. Johnny Depp delivers the performance everyone knows and love, with a number of humorous moments given from screen writer Ted Elliot, who wrote the first classic film (Curse Of The Black Pearl).There are two ways of viewing this movie, you can watch it and enjoy it at it's own terms or compare it with the 3 previous Pirate movies. On the movie's own terms, it's great entertainment with sword fights around every corner, and tactical situations solved in goofy ways. The movie is loaded with improbable moments, such as the idea of an English ruler letting a pirate loose in his palace during a discussion about the Spanish.In light of the franchise, the film wont compete with Curse Of The Black Pearl, but will sit roughly around the level of quality as Dead Man's Chest. At World's End not only was cheesy, it was incredibly weird and the story didn't really know what it wanted to do. In comparison, On Stranger Tides beats At World's End very much. Stranger Tides actually had a plot that stayed on track and wasn't extremely desperate and confusing.Dead's Man's Chest was heavy on special effects, especially with big objects. The directer was Throwing what he can that looks action pack. Stranger Tides doesn't fall into that tiresome routine.I was entertained while watching this movie, and any Pirates Of The Caribbean fan will be as well. A fan will be disappointed if he or she expects this movie to up the level of the first, or for that mater, even be as good as the first. I walked in the theater with the expectations that this was actually going to be worse then At World's End, and it wasn't. So I was pleased and enjoyed myself.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A lot better than I thought it would be!,"I decided to rewatch the original trilogy because I saw the first 2 a long time ago and never got to see the third one. To my surprise, I realized they made 2 more since then! I really thought it would be a lame attempt at keeping a dying franchise alive, especially considering the third one was noticeably weaker than the first 2. So I went in On Stanger Tides with very low expectations... and I'm glad my fears were unfounded. They managed to keep the same 'fun factor' they had with the first 2 movies, just plain old swashbuckling adventure and Captain Jack Sparrow shenanigans. Very entertaining family film!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
More Adventures of Sparrow and Barbossa,"The 4th installment of the PotC series gives us another sea adventure featuring Sparrow and Barbossa. Will and Elizabeth are not in this film instead we are introduced to two new characters and rivals of Jack Sparrow: Angelica and the notorious Blackbeard!This movie, IMO, is not quite as good as the first two films but still had me captivated by it's story. It is a refreshing change, twist, to the series. All in all, PotC: On Stranger Tides is well worth watching. Sparrow and Barbossa tend to be the core characters in the series and they will not leave you disappointed with this adventure.8.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Whoever's handling Ms Cruz ought to be shot for her hat,"I found this movie overlong and only occasionally entertaining. Depp, Rush and McShane do excellent jobs but can't quite lift this final Pirate excursion above the tedium. There are memorable moments, but in a film longer than two hours that's not much of a recommendation. What I absolutely hated is something I don't think would bother most people: Penelope's hat.Now I'm no fashionista but for some reason, I found her hat distracting, if not downright annoying. Not sure why but think a simple scarf around her head would have been a vast improvement. She just looked too modern when the film called for a rough and tumble sort. I cannot imagine anyone seriously suggesting the hat was right for the job, but if they did they should be fired immediately.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"An uninspiring plot, pointless characters, poor places and so on!","You may find me a bit weird, but if we look at my Pirates of the Caribbean history briefly, I have to do that to explain some things and to compare, I enjoyed ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"", but I didn't love it as other people did. That's why I always think that it is overrated. If you remember, for a while, it was in IMDb Top 250. It was not epic or great for me (except the character Jack Sparrow) You know, you watch a movie, you like it, you are entertained, but that's all, it does not become one of your favorite movies. Then, ""Dead Man's Chest"" came! It was not your typical summer blockbuster for me. I found it excellent and people was laughing at me, when I said it is a kind of masterpiece! It was one of the sequels which surpassed the original like Spider Man 2. A lot of things were improved (including Jack Sparrow character), the weaknesses were made up. Dead Man's Chest was a sunny sea adventure with a brilliant direction, a real villain, a surprising story, some epic scenes such as the escape from the island or the ""wheel"" sword fight and great entertainment with some art as spice. ""At World's End"" was the weakest in the trilogy, because this time, it was not even entertaining and the movie itself was so disconnected/messy. Probably, people will agree with me on ""At World's End"". Now, let's talk about ""On Stranger Tides"". It is better than the third movie, but far from being great. It brings entertainment back after the third movie, especially the first half of the movie was fun and Penelope Cruz brings beauty, but some flaws prevent the movie from being good. The Black Beard character cannot be a villain like Davy Jones, how can I say?, he is weak and not threatening. It just doesn't make you excited like Davy Jones did. ""Zombies"" are ridiculous. Some other characters are pointless. The mermaids look like fashion models/the brides of Dracula from ""Van Helsing"" with cheesy CGI and without any nudity rather than natural, mesmerizing beauties. I didn't understand the relationship between one of them and Philip at all. What was that? There is no sea battle unfortunately as there is no sea creature, you find lots of sword fights instead, even if the editing is too close or too fast in some of the scenes. Generally, the movie is more dark than sunny, more ""land"" than ""sea"" and more reality than fantasy. Probably, this is because the producers tried to make the movie more like the first movie to meet the expectations of the audiences. And the movie does not include a climactic final like At World's End or a dramatic final like Dead Man's Chest, which disappointed me seriously. However, probably, the thing that disappointed me the most is fountain of youth. It was not that beautiful and it was not mesmerizing. The place looks more like the place in the first movie, which they do the sword fight! Therefore, all my dreams about fountain of youth ""fell in the drink."" As for the captain for the chair of direction, Rob Marshall, direction had not any identity this time!",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Meh,"Now don't get me wrong, the latest film Disney churned out did have its moments. It tried hard to downplay the 'epicness' of the story and provide us with a simpler and more straight forward adventure, much like the original, and does it pretty well. However, this instalment doesn't leave you with that same feeling you get when watching the others ‚Äì you don't really get the sense that you've just watched a Pirates of the Caribbean film. All the best elements from the first three films were hardly in use here. Heck, Blackbeard is one of the most feared real pirates there were, and he was so underused. The returning characters don't act same as you'd expect them to (Barbossa, really?) and I especially didn't like the fact that the main cast hardly share any screen time together, due to a limiting script. There were a couple of stand-out moments, nothing memorable though ‚Äì the journey didn't really go anywhere, even forgetting the anti-climatic ending. Verbinski 'got' the POTC films, and this one just seemed to be lacking that something special. It was OK, but that was just its problem ‚Äì it was OK.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

This is one of those movies where the 3D was the best part about the movie. Jonny Depp was good and the acting wasn't all that bad. It was nice to see AL Capone from Board Walk Empire in there as a different role. Mermaids were cool and they entertained me enough to not completely close my eye lids. Some funny parts, but over all the movie is not a movie I could watch twice. It was long at times, everyone was glad when it was over, and when the movie ended, there wasn't any applause from people like most Friday nights of a new movie release.

"Lots of swash, lots of buckle, not much plot","The ""Pirates"" franchise is one of the strangest in the world of movies; it is so entertaining and profitable and yet based on nothing more than a theme park ride and totally lacking the narrative form of the ""Harry Potter"" films or the endlessly refreshed format of the James Bond outings.At its heart is Captain Jack Sparrow, one of the oddest and most lovable characters in cinema and an absolute triumph of creation by Johnny Depp. Nothing else seems to matter, as long as there is endless swash and buckle.For ""Pirates 4"", Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley have sailed over the horizon but Geoffrey Rush is back again, wide-eyed and legless, and Ian McShane and Penelope Cruz are now on board. And we have mermaids - but not as we usually imagine them (think ""Splash"").As with the other ""Pirates"" sailings, an intelligent ‚Äì or at least intelligible ‚Äì plot is as elusive as a mermaid's tear. All that is clear is that everyone is seeking the Fountain of Youth and, at some two and a quarter hours, the viewer too might want to join the search.Yet visually it is all so kinetic and emotionally it is all so much fun, we forgive the leaks in the hold and just go along for the voyage.

Absolutely Worth Skipping!,"Terribly written, poorly directed & shoddily performed, the fourth instalment in the Pirates of the Caribbean series is an insipid, pathetic & horribly executed chapter that takes whatever right was left about the original trilogy and brings it to an absolute low for this movie is not only the weakest film of the franchise but also one of the worst films ever made.A stand-alone sequel to the previous three movies, the story of Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides finds Captain Jack Sparrow embarking on a new journey to find the fabled Fountain of Youth but on his way comes across a woman from his past who's the daughter of the feared pirate, Blackbeard, and discovers that they are also looking for the same place.Directed by Rob Marshall, On Stranger Tides begins a new phase in the famous adventure fantasy series after Gore Verbinski wrapped up his story with three films yet this latest entry is such an uninspiring, tedious & unnecessary instalment that it makes even the least impressive film of the previous trilogy look like an under-appreciated classic for there isn't one thing that this movie gets right.Even the technical aspects aren't up to the mark and that's disappointing when considering the fact that On Stranger Tides is the most expensive film ever made. The exotic locations are wonderfully captured by the camera but it fails to immerse the viewers into the narrative plus thanks to useless editing, its 137 minutes of runtime is severely felt, while the score by Hans Zimmer is inferior but still fitting for the most part.Visual Effects also exhibit a downgrade when compared to its predecessors and on various occasions isn't convincing at all. Coming to the performances, Johnny Depp, Geoffrey Rush & Kevin McNally are the only ones reprising their roles from previous features while the new additions include Pen√©lope Cruz & Ian McShane who play Angelica (Jack's former lover) & Blackbeard (the prime antagonist), and the performance by the entire cast is, in one word, terrible.On an overall scale, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides is a sequel that shouldn't have been made in the first place. The previous three films by Gore Verbinski may not rank amongst the finest trilogies ever made but it had a wit & charm of its own plus was perfectly good in a way. Even Captain Jack Sparrow fails to keep the interest alive this time and is annoying for the most part. With nothing working in its favour, On Stranger Tides is definitely worth skipping.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Fair enough, for a fourth installment","Free of his debt to Davy Jones, we join Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) in the process of rescuing a trusted shipmate from the Royal executioners. When that fails, the crown attempts to coerce him into setting sail for the fabled fountain of youth. However, while Jack is in possession of neither ship nor crew, (and the film is without former cast members Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley who elected to pursue other projects) Sparrow's captors are under the impression that he has a ship and is presently amassing a crew. Sparrow investigates and discovers someone impersonating him for their own purposes. A woman, of all things. In fact, a woman from his past by the name of Angelica (played by Penelope Cruz).Clearly the story is complicated and the viewer is asked to make many accommodations where plausibility and time are concerned. That said, it's a well-executed successor to the three previous films, the action is entertaining and the cast is, for the most part, more than adequate. A great time at the movies.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"A Successful Reboot, That Be Our Path!","After the third installment of the ""Pirates"" franchise brought nothing but disappointment to the public, On Stranger Tides brings forth a fresh new sea breeze, and ultimately saves the series from drowning to Davey Jone's locker.For starters, I highly approve of the editing of characters, from the introduction to brand new pirates, to the goodbye of some unneeded luggage from the previous trilogy. Elizabeth Swan (Kiera Knightley) and Will Turner (Orlanda Bloom) overstayed their welcome in the first three Pirate films, and now finally we can be reassured with new, more interesting characters in Stranger Tides.Among the new crew, Angelica Malon (Penelope Cruz) is brought on board. Her phenomenal acting talent, as well as her attractiveness successfully take over Knightley's position, and actually represents a believable pirate as opposed to Governess Elizabeth Swan transforming into a pirate lord. Give me a break.Taking over for Davy Jones is the well-known, menacing Blackbeard (Ian McShane). Stranger Tides provides great depth into Blackbeard's true darkness, and in my opinion gives us one of the most truly evil antagonists in film.As for returning characters, what's a Pirates of the Caribbean movie without Jack... Pardon me, Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp). Sparrow pretty much continues right where he left us off: in search of the fountain of youth, without his beloved Black Pearl, and still causing nothing but havoc among everyone around him.Also in search of the fountain is Blackbeard, showing no mercy towards his expendable men in order to obtain its power of eternal life. Sparrow tags along with Blackbeard, in hopes to somehow find the fountain before Blackbeard.And wait, there's more! Mermaids and zombies and Spaniards, oh my! On Stranger Tides gives so many obstacles for Jack Sparrow to encounter, and overall provides a thrilling adventure that is just as good as Curse of the Black Pearl. I believe the filmmakers made just the right moves to use the proper characters and just the right amount of action and adventure, which ultimately creates a believable story to follow and enjoy. The only question is, will there be a fifth Pirates movie to come, and can this same, simple flow be kept still for a new trilogy? Oh, and as always, stay after the credits.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Barbossa and Gibbs were always two of my favorite characters and it was a pleasure to see them again. It was an absolute breath of fresh air to have Elizabeth and Will gone. Orlando Bloom wasn't horrible in the first movie, but he got worse as time went on. Keira Knightley was awful from beginning to end.

As Swashbuckling as 'Curse of the Black Pearl'!,"To be honest, I was not a fan of Pirates 2 and 3. They seemed thrown together to make a movie as quickly as possible to sell tickets...mission over-accomplished. So I had my doubts going into 'Stranger Tides'In this new adventure, Sexy wonder of the World, Capt Jack Sparrow is off on a quest to find the fountain of youth. We see many characters of Pirates past and new faces with new villains. Ian McShane is superfluous as Blackbeard. His depiction in the movie is wonderful. Johnny Depp is on queue, as always. The Romantic story of a handsome religious zealot, falling for a beautiful and dangerous mermaid is AWESOME!The last piece of the recipe, which remains to be scene (pun intended) is Penelope Cruz, as Angelica opposite Sparrow. I'm not certain I'm convinced of her caliber playing opposite such an icon. We will see as this franchise sets sail once again. I believe (and hope) that this film will run the course of the first in theaters, gaining popularity as time goes on with even bigger box office busters to follow.I highly recommend this movie as someone who loved the first 'Pirates' film, still purchased the 2nd and 3rd.

If you loved the first three, you will find this movie very shallow and even slightly lame in comparison. It lacks the cutlass-sharp wit, panoramic sets, exhilarating fight scenes and jaw-dropping concepts that made the original trilogy so spectacular, and instead offers a sort of half-hearted attempt at fumbling with the impersonation of Jerry Buckheimer's masterpiece. The soundtrack is still that of the glorious Hanz Zimmer, but the drive is gone. Some scenes momentarily boosted the edge and intensity like that present in the original trilogy, but these moments are not terribly frequent.

Sure it has it's flaws and sort of feels incomplete. But it still is a thrilling ride and adventurous. My main complaint about this movie is how after it is finished it feels like there should have been more to it and seemed like it was missing some scenes. Also the coincidences in this movie is way to far-fetched to the point it sort of throws you off a bit and I am not talking about the supernatural stuff. But encounters, stuff happening at the right moment and etc. The movie seemed to drag a bit but it was still somewhat engaging.

One more step down from the original,"Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides had a few new things going for it and quite a few going against it, namely the budget being reduced, which is blatant throughout the film. While it tries to deliver on what the series is known for, it ends up feeling redundant.What the film did have going for it was the new cast of actors and a new storyline, that is not a direct continuation from the last one making it accessible for new audiences. However like last time the plot is over complex, has too many characters and fails to bring a satisfying conclusion to any of them. The Spanish Armada are made out to be a significant force and their is a race to the fountain of youth but that never comes across. Maybe it was the reduced budget; one scene involves everyone preparing for a ship battle but no.Ian Mcshane is a great actor and gives an intimidating performance as Blackbeard, however the script is weak and fail to make any of use of him. Unlike Davy Jones, one of the better villains in recent memory, Blackbeard simply barks orders and threatens people. There is no menace under his skin, which is a shame because he is meant to be a ruthless pirate.Penelope Cruz, while a good casting decision is poorly used and the relationship between her and Depp is underdeveloped. Stephen Graham always brings something to his roles and does so here but is not given enough screen time. Richard Griffiths is embarrassing to watch as King George and Keith Richards appears briefly but only to help push the film forward slightly. I was hoping to see more of his character this time but instead we get less. Replacing Elizabeth and Will are a missionary and a mermaid. Their involvement is small yet inoffensive and do not hurt the film as badly as what other people have made out.This leads me onto the mermaids, who steal the film/ have the best scene where they attack Blackbeard and his men. All the other action oriented scenes lacked any spectacle unlike the kraken scene from the second but this was very entertaining. The mermaids are presented as viscous yet seductive creatures who take men to the sea bed and kill them. It is also the only scene where there is a clear sense of danger and excitement. The films finalie is underwhelming and any drama and tension are broken by scenes of humour.While Depp, Rush and McNally as Gibbs are good, they too suffer from what felt as if a large proportion of the film was cut down to a restrictive budget. Unlike the first two films, I feel less-likely to be returning to watch this again.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Action packed and a good laugh,"What can i say? Johnny Depp is awesome in this movie as Captain Jack Sparrow, Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa, Pen√©lope Cruz as Angelica Malon, Richard Griffiths as King George (If you don't know who he is he is the actor that played Uncle Vernon in Harry Potter) that's not all there are a lot more good actors in this movie. The story/plot (which i am not going to reveal) is simple and understandable and really well done. Unlike the other movies, POTC has new characters but as i said before you will have to watch and find out. Enough about that POTC is packed full of action, thrills, laughs and all. Please i highly recommend you watch it. 6/10. DID you know? Pen√©lope Cruz was pregnant will acting in POTC and her sister played a role in the long shots. Kind regards, ben-james300.

Snoozefest,"This is how you lose the series, the plot and everything. One thing notable is the europeans and their destroying nature of indigenous places. The only thing worth mentioning, they got that right, even though this series fancy the england. Rest a snooze fest. Maybe few shots were ok like the ships in a bottle. But most of it, bizzare and dull. Very few visuals were nice but rest bland. No interesting characters. The father daughter relationship displayed horribly, even though it was a bad one. Jack and his love, playing a puppet. Finally, always gets out because of his quirkiness. Huge downfall from the first film.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides is a cinematic masterpiece!,"I truly wonder why this movie got such a low rating... It's a swashbuckling return to the beloved franchise filled with new characters and an amazing plot. Absolutely the best PotC movie.Top five reasons this movie is awesome:1. Johnny Depp is devilishly good as Captain Jack (again)2. Penelope Cruz is absolutely mesmerizing3. Ian McShane delivers an incredibly haunting performance as
Blackbeard4. The locations guys!5. Amazing CG and all that epic music by Hans ZimmerOverall, this movie is an incredibly enjoyable watch for any fans of PotC and Disney in general. Still can't understand the negative reviews!!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fun Continuation of the Series with more Mythology,"This film took me awhile to finally watch. It had been on DVD for some time and I really liked the original trilogy that it was continuing on the story with. I also really like some of the actors here so that helped as well. This review was also written quite a while go, probably 6 years and I'm just now posting it. The synopsis is Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) and Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) embark on a quest to find the elusive fountain of youth, only to discover that Blackbeard (Ian McShane) and his daughter are after it too.We begin with some fishermen bringing their net in. When they do, they find a man in it. They take him to the Spanish king. They are looking for the Fountain of Youth and this man seems to know where it is. The king sends √ìscar Jaenada after it.We then shift to a man in a cell who everyone believes to be Captain Jack Sparrow. He's removed and taken into a courtroom. It turns out that it is really Gibbs (Kevin McNally). He is on trial for piracy. When the chief justice comes in, this turns out to be Jack Sparrow. He convicts Gibbs of not being him and orders him to serve the rest of his life in the Tower of London. Jack gets in with Gibbs as they head for the Tower. On the way there, he learns that Jack is getting a crew together, but he doesn't even have a ship.Things don't work out as he plans. Jack is taken to a room where he is chained to a chair. He is then given an audience with King George (Richard Griffiths). He wants to find the Fountain of Youth, much like his Spanish counterparts. He has heard that Jack has a map to it and that he is getting a crew ready to go. When this rumor doesn't seem to be true, King George believes him to be an imposter. He then calls in a privateer that he is sending after it, who turns out to be Barbossa. Jack has been removed from his chains and Barbossa tells the king that he needs to be back in them. King George of course doesn't think he's capable of escape. He is wrong and that is what Jack does. We also learn that Barbossa works for the crown due to losing the Black Pearl.Jack has to be creative to get away and with the help of his father, Captain Teague (Keith Richards). He takes Jack to the crew that he is supposed to be getting ready and hints about the Fountain of Youth needing two chalices to make work. He then disappears.Jack then has a run in with someone that turns out to be Angelica (Pen√©lope Cruz). During this he is also hiring a crew that already seems to be hired by him. Jack gets knocked out and wakes up on the Queen Anne's Revenge, the dreaded ship of the pirate Blackbeard.I have to say that I did enjoy this film. I was a little leery coming in, because I really like the original trilogy and didn't know how they could go on. Something strikes me in how they been able to continue, is the ability to continue to add mythology of the sea into their movies. I don't know a lot, but I do recognize certain names like Blackbeard, Queen Anne's Revenge and this also is using a classic myth in the Fountain of Youth. Here they did come up with a few ideas and brought them together which works.Playing on that as well, I liked that this film plays up the lore of the mythic Fountain of Youth. I don't know much about mermaids, which are something that appears in the film. One of which Syrena (Astrid Berg√®s-Frisbey) and if they are supposed to be like they are in the film, but I liked the idea of them being monsters. I also liked that Blackbeard used 'zombies' as his officers. He uses voodoo to create them so he can control them. There are other things with voodoo in this as well.The acting across the board is solid. Depp and Rush are just two actors that really become these roles. I know that Depp has talent, but we don't always necessarily see it. Rush on the other hand is just great in everything I've ever seen him in. I also liked adding Cruz here. It's smart to have a solid female lead like her and being that they're incorporating the Spanish, that makes a lot of sense. I really liked McShane as Blackbeard. He played the notorious pirate well and I think a lot of that just goes to his screen presence. Plus we have McNally, Stephen Graham, Richards and Griffiths among others to round this out for what was needed.My biggest problem is that this is a Disney film and concept. Since it all started with a ride at their amusement parks. I would really have loved to see what could be made of this if it wasn't restricted with being teenager friendly. With that said though, I digress. It is still paced in a way that despite its 136 hour runtime, it never really gets boring. It is just entertaining.This film is being added to the horror film research due to a lot of the elements. Pirates, voodoo zombies and mermaids that kill men to drink the blood are all things that can be scary. Actually the mermaids reminded me a lot of vampires to be honest. The Pirates of the Caribbean films have used horror film elements throughout, which I like and they are still family friendly even with using them.I would recommend seeing this film if you like The Pirates of the Caribbean films. This one just continues to add to the storyline and this one is quite enjoyable. It has really good acting across the board, the story is solid and the only drawback is that it is done by Disney. This does make it friendly for families. It is a fun film with horror film aspects that isn't scary at all.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Stranger Tides...a good spice added to the main course made of the first three movies,"I am writing this as a fan of Pirates of the Caribbean in hope that other fans will trust me: This movie was good, but it wasn't GREAT. It of course wasn't as good as the first three movies were. It had an entirely different taste. It began in a very fast temp, but later lost it. It did not have the balance the third movie had, and neither was it as active as the second one.From time to time I found myself really missing Keira Knightley(and this surprises me because I've never been particularly fond of her presence in the movies.) Angelica is cool, and a pirate, and has a nice body and all...but Elizabeth was much better(actually Elizabeth was a better fighter than Angelica, which surprised me.)Blackbeard? He's fine, but not awesome. Sometimes looking at him I felt like I was looking at an ordinary old man clinging to his vain beliefs. He is just too dull next to the colourful villains of the previous movies(even Beckett was more colourful.) He did not have the effect Davy Jones had, but still he is a to-be-adored character. I had the feeling that he had a tremendous back-story to himself that was not given(and yet still supposed to be given.)I really liked the mermaids. They were CREEPY,but I loved them. Jack as usual is a pleasure to have on white screen.Johnny Depp did a good job there, but I should say that sometimes the screenplay leaned too hard on Jack and the jokes started getting lame.To me the best thing in the movie was Barbossa. He was the only character that preserved his taste...In the end, yes movie had many faults, but still it was one of those movies you could watch forever. Continuous adventure is fun. And seeing Jack and Gibbs under the sunset, and Barbossa finding his fancy hat and giving his usual ""blaaah"" laugh made me forgive and forget everything else. :) So, go and see it- while it's still on the big screen (and by the way, I watched it in 2D and I don't think I missed anything- I'm anti-3D for movies.) It is very fun and you definitely should see it. Don't worry: It is not as bad as it seemed in the trailer, but still know that this movie has an entirely different taste. In the end, I'm sure you'll be very happy too when you see Barbossa wearing his old hat ;)",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Lower your expectations. It helps!,"'We're all back together again!' Jerry Bruckheimer (Producer) tells the audience in a featurette. And it feels that the main purpose for this movie was some kind of reunion, because it was fun for them to make the first three.Gore Verbinski is not directing this anymore. And it shows. There is nothing particular memorable about this movie in style or direction. They kept the DOP from the previous movies and the movie is still beautifully shot.When I went to the cinema expecting nothing of the movie (because every story finished nicely at the end of the third movie) I was still entertained. Upon re-watching it, boredom struck. The movie's basic structure is like this: Here you have characters, they need to do these things, okay let's do these things, movie end. It's narratively speaking quite straight forward and therefore the movie doesn't feel pretentious or bloated. What does bother me is that the characters are so uninteresting and what happens during the movie is also quite uninteresting. The movie lost the grandeur of the previous entries.Hey Jerry! What did you say? 'Blackbeard is one of the most evil characters we have ever given you?' Nah, sorry to burst your bubble but the only positive thing about the Blackbeard character is that he is played by Ian McShane. McShane does everything to make the character interesting, because the script is lacking. Blackbeard is really boring and underdeveloped. The second and third movies had time to develop their villains, whereas this movie did not take it's time or tried to bother. Probably because this movie was meant to be the Johnny Depp Show!I'm not even going to mention the forced love-couple in this movie, because that was laughable. The Penelope Cruz character was a nice addition though and she was OK. Johnny himself was not that memorable. He was more on repeat of what he did in previous entries, but now he was the main focus of the movie.But, overall, the highlights of the movie were the Mermaid scene and Geoffrey Rush's Barbossa. (he always looks like he's having fun with the character he plays) You can decide for yourself if that's worth your time to go see this movie.Lower your expectations. It helps!",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good but not great,"Remember those straight-to-video sequels Disney often releases. On Stranger Tides feels like one of them. By itself it may count with a great production and actually not a bad story to bring to film, but it doesn't really live up to the previous films. The original trilogy felt like that. A trilogy. Curse of the Black Pearl's story may not have much to do story-wise with the other two, but at the end, the three felt like a saga. This feels more like a stand alone film, which, have it been the first one to be released, it wouldn't have felt as bad as it does now.When it comes to the story, it's not all that entertaining. While the first one brought a fresh piece to cinema, and introduced us to beloved characters in an epic adventure, the second and third one brought those characters to develop, finish personal business and get into new adventures. This one leaves everything aside going for a fresh start, not really giving much importance to where the characters were before, and bringing some new ones which don't really grow into us.The mermaid sequence is the one worth watching in the whole movie. I wish the part with Ponce de Leon's ship would have carried us to a more epic battle, and I feel the same way about the part where Jack and Barbosa steal the silver chalices from the Spaniards. Which, BTW, the Spaniards work as an antagonist to all, Barbosa, Jack Sparrow, and Blackbeard, but in an attempt to reduce screen time and avoid saturating the story, they don't develop those characters (or at least one of them), and don't give them a motivation to go to the fountain, making all their role in the film feel a little off.Aside from that Angelica and Blackbeard could be characters to look forward to in further films, and so are Philip and Serena. The cast of the fifth film has been announced and none of them are part of it. A film where all the major characters from the franchise have a worth part would be way too heavy, so if i had to choose, between bringing them back, or having more Will and Elizabeth, I would go with Will and Elizabeth any day. So yeah, stick with the original trilogy, but don't give this one the cold shoulder.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
2+hours haul of Disney goodness..,"this is the fourth movie in the series, and the fifth are rumored it is on the way, do we see a sixth??... anyway this epic tale just drags on as usually. seems like they just made up the movie, as they went along. filling in the plot with silly theatrics and side-tracking subplots(that we love of course!) so it ridiculous dragged out to 2+hours. but at least i didn't fell a sleep half way through, like i did on the two other movies before this one... must have been because of penelope, the sexiest woman to roam the TV screen. so is it worth watching 'yes'... because of sexy penelope and keith richards as the coolest pirate ever(again!). but first bottle up with coke and popcorn, trust me you will need it.... if it rains outside it will be good to, and if you have one of those living room chair that have a toilet included, it will be a big plus. after all your in for a 2+hours haul of Disney goodness, you definitely don't want to miss a second of it..",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The New Characters of this movie were fascinating and it draw my attention How I ever imagine that Captain Jac Sparrow fighting off, these brutish pirates from the Civil War from England. Being a Pirate doesn't mean ""Its a Pirate's Life for Me"", it's just a Pirate's Life for Me being a Pirate ARRRGH!

Incoherent Action: The Captain Is Back,"Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides is everything a Pirates sequel should be, trumping the previous follow-up attempts. The plot is more over the top and muddled than ever with a plethora of pointless characters and incoherent nonstop action sequences, but Director Rob Marshall (Chicago) creates a film that will please fans and revive people's love for the series that was lost because of the previous two flops. Much of the success of the newest installment comes from the axing of Will and Elizabeth from the story finally being true to the real star of the series, Johnny Depp reprising his role as Captain Jack Sparrow. His previous nemesis Hector Barbosa is back (Academy Award Nominee Geoffrey Rush, The King's Speech), along with newcomers Ian McShane (Kung Fu Panda) as Black Beard and Academy Award Winner Penelope Cruz (Vicky Christina Barcelona) as Angelica, a long lost love interest of Jack. The plot is basically about Captain Jack trying his hardest to beat numerous other journeyers to the 'Fountain of Youth' with his deceptive tactics. On the way he has to deal with Black Beard, a reformed Barbosa, the Spanish (even though they only show up a couple times) and an obnoxious love story between a religious man and a Mermaid. The plot doesn't matter much in this Pirates attempt disregarding the development of a storyline completely replacing it with nonstop action. The fast pace is hard to grasp at first, but it never gets out of hand as the rum flows through its veins slowing it down to a comprehensible speed.On Stranger Tides is the best of the Pirates sequels even though it still fails to come close to The Curse of the Black Pearl. As long as Depp and Rush continue providing entertaining antics with their peculiar relationship the boat will stay afloat for many more installments.. McShane's Black Beard acts as the new and improved Davy Jones succeeding in adding a dark humor to the film. Even so, all that really matters is that it is a blockbuster completely overwhelmed with action commencing with the opening sequence and not taking a breathe until the end.The most pointless and irritating part of the film is the awkward relationship that forms between a man named Phillip (Sam Claflin) and a mermaid named Syrena (Astrid Berg√©s-Frisbey). The audience cannot connect to the relationship because Phillip comes off as a creepy nothing character and the only point of the relationship can be attributed to lazy scriptwriting, which becomes a major theme throughout the film. The cleverness is that used to be prevalent in the series is gone causing the predictable to set in.Leave all high hopes at the door going into this one and you may just be as surprised as I was after seeing this film. Just remember the captain, the action, the rum and that it is nothing more and nothing less than a blockbuster sequel.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Arghhh! We be searchin' for the fountain of youth!,"One thing that will never cease to be cool is middle ages era pirates. Pirates are loved, hated, feared, and admired by many, many people. back in the 16th through 18th centuries, the most popular pirates, the English, french, and dutch were hired by the European hierarchy to plunder Spanish vessels carrying treasures and gold from the Americas and the Caribbean back to Spain. they kept this up until the 1730s, by then pirates wern't the same as they were for the past 2 centuries.Nowadays, piracy still exists, but most of it happens around the coast of Africa and Asia. Somali is infamous for it's piracy. However, Somalian pirates aren't as swashbuckling and charming as jack sparrow would be.Set in 1750, Jack sparrow (Johnny depp) finds himself in an quest to find the fountain of youth, along with Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush). However, he is not alone. He is in a race against Blackbeard (Ian McShane) and his beautiful daughter (Penelope Cruz). They all need a few extra things to drink from the fountain of youth - 2 special chalices and a mermaid's tear. With exciting sword fights, Treks through jungles, Fights for life against enchanting yet deadly mermaids, and religion (Yes, Religion.) hang onto your seat cause you're in for a swashbuckling time.Now my favourite scene has to be the mermaid scene. Nothing says awesome like seeing and hearing a beautiful mermaid, the way her eyes stare into yours, and her voice bringing you into falling in love, and the next moment, her friends start to tear you to shreds. quite literally. (note to parents: One scene involves a man being dragged about 30 feet below the water, and 8 or so mermaids rip him apart and eat him alive. just a little warning.) Bottom line, if you're going to waste 30$ this summer on a movie, make sure it's Pirates. i guarantee you won't be disappointed.one question - What the hell happened to Philip and Syrena at the end!?",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Improves on the third film but is still just a lot of empty noise without enough fun,"I remember the first film in this theme-park-inspired franchise. I liked it. It was fun, didn't take itself too seriously and was as light and playful as the cowardly and comical Captain Jack. That was nearly a decade ago and a lot has changed since then. For one thing the franchise has to content with the fact that the third film was a terrible dog ‚Äì plodding, dull, overly-serious and provided big action sequences that for all their cost didn't have a second of fun in them. I ignored On Stranger Tides in the cinema (as I did with the majority of the summer blockbusters this year) because I had no high hopes for it and no reason to spend nearly ¬£20 to see those low expectations fulfilled.On DVD it hurts less so I tried it here. On the positive side the film is better than the previous one. It seems to have recognised that it isn't some amazing sea-faring epic but just a silly piece of entertainment based on a theme-park ride. As a result it seems a little freer with itself and at times it seemed to suggest that my entertainment was something it had an interest in. Sadly it doesn't do this often enough or well enough to really lift it up to be a film worth seeing. Along with the less serious tone, the film delivers loads of action sequences with lots of special effects ‚Äì they are large, they lit up the walls in my front room and they provided enough bass to make me happy with my choice of speakers. But that's about it because they are, like the film, dramatically empty. You never really feel peril for the main characters and there is little dramatic reason to care ‚Äì so, while the effects and sets are expensive, the money is wasted as they do not have the content to make it work.In terms of the writing, one problem is the transformation of Captain Jack into an indestructible superhero. Where once he seemed to be winging it, now he seems to be in charge; where once he appeared cowardly, now he rushes into danger. OK the words out of his mouth suggest otherwise, but the action doesn't. It makes it harder to like him and, while Depp's performance hasn't changed, the character certainly is a lot less entertaining than he originally was. Speaking of the cast, a few key names are absent but bigger ones are brought in. Cruz was potentially a nice bit of casting as she does have a passionate air about her and seems to be able to ooze sexuality with ease; sadly the film doesn't use her well and, although she looks good, she cannot find that spark ‚Äì something I would have thought would have been so easy for actors like her and Depp to get. Rush returns and does his thing while McShane takes the role of the main baddie. Again this should have been an open goal but he is too one-note. He is still a good presence in the film but I'll take 30 seconds of his Swearengen over 2 hours of him here any day. Graham gets his exposure and payday and who could blame him ‚Äì but he is capable of so much more than he does here. Richards shows up for an obvious and unfunny cameo while the rest of the support cast are either stuntmen or famous faces for the sake of it.The fourth Pirates film is an improvement on the third ‚Äì but sadly not by anywhere near the margin it needed to be. It mostly avoids being overly serious but yet it still isn't a great deal of fun to watch. The noise and effects mean the time doesn't drag but it is empty spectacle for the majority of the time and good chunks of it could have been cut to the benefit of the film (the priest and mermaid for example). It isn't absolutely awful by any means but it is bland, empty and nothing like the amount of rip-roaring summer fun it should have been. There will be a fifth of course, but event movies make money, but I really hope they can work out that simply spending more and more money on effects or putting more plotting into the film is not what made people enjoy the first one.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not what i expected,"I am kinda fan of POTC and can't really come to terms with this part. Not that this part was bad but it doesn't quite live up to the standards set by the previous movies. The fourth movie plus 3D factor set me to expect more. 3D effects were good and our favourite CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow is at his best. But this can't make up for otherwise slow story and weak characters. Their was not as much fun and enjoyment as could have been. Also, their is a confusion regarding the nature of characters which is most of the time self-contradictory. One can simply sense that something is missing. Plus, the movie keeps on moving away from the main plot. Disappointed yes but still it was a good time pass. Totally a one time watch.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Oh, great. Now we need a mermaid's tears","Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger TidesJack Sparrow's, as he obtains two chalices to use while drinking from the Fountain of Youth and seeks a mermaid's tears to invest them with magic. I had fleeting hopes for this episode of the Disney franchise. An opening sequence is fun, as Captain Jack impersonates a British judge, is chased through London,and discovers his old amour, Angelica (Penelope Cruz) attempting to impersonate him while raising the crew for a ship. That anyone would still want to sail under Jack's command is a tribute to the daring of British seamen. The movie is fun until they set sail. Johnny Depp, who confesses he's rather tired of playing his relentless hero, nevertheless does a plucky job here. He plays Jack Sparrow as an insouciant wise guy, rarely ruffled, always ready with a quip. Whether he is a competent swashbuckler is hard to say, because the fight sequences here are composed in the editing and do not seem to exist in an actual space-time continuum. Angelica and Jack set sail for the new world aboard a ship commanded by Blackbeard (Ian McShane), who is said to be her father. The ship's crew includes zombies, which is a step up from previous crew members in the series, skeletons. Blackbeard is in a race to find the fountain before Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), who is being financed by King George, who needs to drink from the fountain none too soon. Rush is as always a dependable actor, but his sandpapery complexion is rather alarming here. Get this sailor some Lubriderm. ""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides"" is about what you'd expect. It is long, expensive and bombastic, and the beautiful mermaid has a tantalizing way of not coming quite far enough out of the water. For me, it's too much of a muchness. The whole series was inspired by a ride at Disneyland. There's a bright side to that. At least no movie has yet been inspired by ""It's a Small World.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Less chaotic and confusing than some of the earlier entries in the series,"Currently a captain without a ship - the Black Pearl having been shrunk and placed inside a sealed bottle, at least for the time being - the inimitable Jack Sparrow finds himself impressed on a vessel, captained by the Spanish pirate Blackbeard (Ian McShane), that is hot on the trail of Ponce de Leon's famed but ever elusive Fountain of Youth. Meanwhile, a British contingent, led by peg-legged ""privateer, not pirate"" Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), is on the same mission, though he claims to be doing it not for personal enrichment but for king and country.""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,"" with a screenplay by Ted Elliott and Terry Rosio and direction by Rob Marshall, keeps the storyline fairly simple and streamlined this time out, avoiding the overstuffed, convoluted plotting that often made the earlier installments all but impossible to follow. Even Johnny Depp himself, in the spirit of the enterprise, seems to have toned down some of the more flamboyant qualities of his earlier performances and appears to be relishing playing a pirate who is less in charge of his own fate and more at the mercy of the other characters this time around. Yet, he's still able to land a sharp-tongued barb with the best of them, whether it be against Blackbeard, Barbossa or Angelica, the feisty love interest played by the beautiful Penelope Cruz.As is par for the course, the movie runs on far too long, padding out its length with a sappy romance between a preacher-man and a mermaid and a few too many distended swordfights for the movie's (and the audience's) good, but, overall, this turns out to be one of the less top-heavy and heavy-handed of the ""Pirates"" films.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
On Stranger Tides Of Boredom,"Another disappointment and wasted opportunity in what could've been a fantastic rollicking adventure.First of all, I must say that I've always had a love/hate attitude towards the series. I love it simply because of its genre, the excellent production values, character designs and fantasy elements. Unfortunately, the scale still always tilts towards ""hate"" and this is why: The script for ""On Stranger Tides"" is horrible. It is pure Hollywood lazy/formulaic scriptwriting with zero inventiveness. Characters are put in place just to drive the plot along, like gears inside a clock. They are lifeless and evoke no emotion. It is reflected also in the acting, as you can see quite clearly that most of the actors are just hamming it up and going through the motions to get to the end. (Apparently, the focus is on the ""end"" and not the ""journey"" here.) Even though I like the character Jack Sparrow, I haven't seen him in an adventure that was worth his salt. In this installment, he downright feels like a side character, as there is really nothing at stake for him other than a failed attempt at creating a past love interest whose life needs saving for stupid reasons. (Daughter of Al Swearengen turned to pirating on the high seas? c'mon!) There are too many things wrong with ""On Stranger Tides"" on too many levels that if I go on it will just seem like pure whining - which isn't my motive at all. In short, nothing made any sense nor drew any of my feelings or even ""stirrings"" as Jack Sparrow would like to put it.Sad to say, I wanted to like this movie. The ingredients are all there for a great adventure but somehow they messed it up. (for instance, if they had made the final minutes of the movie to be the introduction instead, it would give it much more energy and swagger.) Just my two gold coins.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
He's  back  for  round  four!,"It's Jack and he's back! Captain Jack Sparrow! Getting an upgrade from the last three pirate films, On Stranger Tides to most Pirate fans was questionable from the beginning. That is however when it came to the call of what the script would look like, it would seem Jack Sparrow's character would be getting a face-lift. The film is loosely based on a book by the same subtitle name, which included the historical pirate character, Blackbeard. Since several characters from the last three films did not return to the casting call, the script had to change. There are honorable nods to the original film, Curse of the Black Pearl, yet script writers pushed it back farther to tell a little bit of Jack's personal life, of which gave us a new character, Angelica, who in term has a very important role in the film. It may not measure up to the original 2003 summer blockbuster, but it certainly has some exciting twists in swords and in plot. The film even suggests that it could have easily been a better sequel than Dead Man's Chest in the writers had known better. However, Pirate fans or not, this should not be missed for any movie goer! It rocks!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The change came from behind the camera,"I love this story franchise. It simply goes places and does things that no other even approaches. The casting/acting, filming, scripting, the soundtrack... it's all just impeccable.In the first three installations, there was a great deal of continuity in characters and story line. It was all woven together to create one large movie tapestry. But this fourth one makes a number of departures... and as a devoted fan of those first three, it has taken a little bit of post-interlude retrospect to come to terms with it all.One thing you notice almost immediately, but may need to consider before identifying, is the change in director... from Gore Verbinski to Rob Marshall. It's like having two chefs prepare the same dish, but each with their own personal touches to give it a unique signature.So, while the basics remain the basics, the tang factor is noticeably changed... the seasoning is different because there was a new chef. Marshall's serving is a touch less charismatic-sweet and more bludgeoned-reactionary.Now, none of this is to cast a disparaging light on direction or on those stranger tides. But for those who, like myself, submerse themselves into a good movie, there is also a forensic relationship that definitely missed the Gore Verbinski touch.Here's keeping fingers crossed for episode #5!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Good, but not 'THAT' good.","I love the original trilogy, got em all on Blu-Ray, but didn't get to see this movie until 2 weeks after it came out, so i could pick up my popcorn and take a pretty good seat in the 'house'. I gotta say, it's good, BUT, not that good. The goodness of the London chase sequence still had the pirates feel, but after that it falls short of the first 3 films, where the hell did Barbossa's leg go?, yes he explains it, but i would prefer to have seen it happen, give us a flashback even. The soundtrack still hits the high notes when it needs to, especially when Depp and Cruz duel, it reminded me of Jack and Will in the 1st movie when the music matches the sword play. Which leads me to the cast, the casting of Penelope Cruz is genius as Jacks love interest, she looks so hot in this movie its unbelievable, Keira who? Ian Mcshane is brilliantly cast as Blackbeard, but why the hell did they kill him off? Surely he could have been as prominent a figure as Davy Jones although he didn't figure until the 2nd of the trilogy, questions need answering, where did Blackbeard get his seamingly power to control his ships components? and where and when did he get the collection of ships in bottles? Sure, Jacks got em now, but how does he release em, so thats the next sequel in whats gotta be another pirates trilogy i guess. I have a theory, somehow bring Blackbeard back, because he's the only one who can release the ships in the bottles?",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A fantastic new addition to the pirates franchise,"This movie is a top movie to watch this summer and I highly recommend it for Pirates of the Caribbean fans and people who just want to see a kick ass movie this summer. It is a great much anticipated addition to the pirates franchise.The reasons why this is so good is it follows a more Pirates of the Caribbean Curse of the Black Pearl feel to it, which sat better with the people and the first movie was a classic, so smart move there.Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) had great dialog in this movie that was funny and delightful, bringing back the same old Jack we all know and love and he still maintained everything about Jack that makes him great and he also still managed to surprise me with new sides to his character. Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush)is also brought back in this film and this was very good because in the film he is a great ally to Jack even though he doesn't like him too much and he and jack had great bits of funny banter and friendship at points but he also managed to be quite unpredictable and intimidating at times and also I think bringing back Barbossa brought a lot of pirate spirit back to this fourth installment.The addition of new characters such as Black-beard (Ian Mcshane) and Angelica (Penelope Cruz) was also a good move as Angelica, acting as Jack's love interest and almost his equal, made it more interesting to watch because Jack has not had a love interest and nobody has really been able to outwit Jack Sparrow (sorry Captain Jack Sparrow) and Black- beard was also a great character, being very villainous and having the uncaring aspect of a villain in that he would just kill anyone and also to add he is probably the best pirate villain I have ever seen in a film in my opinion. Other new characters are brought in like Phillip and Serena the mermaid, which added quite a bit more to the film and Scrum, being a sidekick to Jack and quite funny which was cool also, so all the actors and actresses acted very well. Great Job!.Another reason why the film was awesome would be the addition of new creatures like Mermaids, which where something pirates really believed in at the time and the use of zombie crewman, which is cool because all the crewman in the franchise have been some form of skeleton or creature, so that maintains some iconography and it is also good to see them in 3D.Lastly the 3D, which none of the other films have had, adds unique qualities to the film and the 3D was very good considering this is a pirate film and not a sci-fi film. The 3D effects showed swords coming out at you and at one point fire coming out at you and a Monkey in a glass bottle screaming in your face which rocked. Although it wasn't like animation 3D, which is amazing, this was very understandable because this is not an animated film. The 3D brought to life the action scenes a bit more which were really adrenaline pumping, although land based and I would have loved to have seen a ship battle or battles in 3D. However overall this is a highly recommended movie for all to enjoy.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
On Medium Tides!!!,"What started amazingly with The Curse of the Black Pearl, was carried forward remarkably by Dead Man's Chest and ended astoundingly by At World's End (though many people may beg to differ), staggers a lot with On Stranger Tides. Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides rests solely on Captain Jack Sparrows' shoulders, because its other characters are hazy enough and do not let their presence being felt. A huge disappointment being Blackbeard (Ian McShane) who fails to deliver as the feared pirate he's supposed to be. The movie opens with a map being found, and then we directly jump to London, where Gibbs has been imprisoned by the British. A major distress over here was Captain Jack Sparrows' entry, unlike previous movies, where Jack's entry oozed awesomeness, here it lacks big time. After it, for around 30-40 minutes, it's just swords clashing, people escaping, witty fight dialogs, and everything you had already witnessed in the previous movies. Half way into the movie, you wish it were less of fighting and more on content, but the clashing goes on and on. Except for a few sequences like the Mermaid Hunt, which is brilliantly executed, rest all somehow feels a repetition of the earlier movies in the merchandise. The movie does deliver on the story premise too, but only in the later portions, where you can actually guess (if you're a Pirate's fan like me) what is going to happen. The climax is somewhat anticipated, but not from far. And as always it leaves scope for another sequel. The witty one-liners of Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) are quite few, which might bring chuckles to your faces, but still being compared to what we've seen earlier, one would be disappointed to a large extent. Angelica (Penelope Cruz) is a character which could've been explored further, but amidst all the gunshots she comes across just as another coat of gloss added to shine. Hector Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) makes impression and does deliver up to his wicked reputation. Blackbeard (Ian McShane) as I'd mentioned earlier fails to make you shiver as the evil pirate, whom all pirates fear. Comparing his image with what Barbossa had in The Curse of the Black Pearl, or what Davy Jones had in Dead Man's Chest, he does not seem someone who is even remotely feared. Philip (Sam Claflin) and Syrena (Astrid Berges-Frisbey), who are a part of a small sub-plot are okay and don't have much to offer. The only character which has been utilized to full extent seems to be Jack Sparrow, who is the only reason this film needs to be seen. He's excellent, in the escape sequences (which I believe were a little far-fetched) and does bring that quirky smile on your faces with his antics and his sharp lines. The romance between the lead pair is cold and one gets really confused whether Jack 'actually' loves Angelica or not. Overall the movie falters as it's got glossy action sequences but a weak plot and average performances. All it needed was a little character improvisation and crisp script, and it could easily have at least lived up to the movies prior in this series. Though I watched it in 2D, I doubt whether 3D actually does any good. There are very few scenes which portray good use of 3D technology. Director Rob Marshall clearly, bombed as compared to Gore Verbinski (Director of previous 3 Pirate movies). Even if one does not compare it with the previous three movies, this one is just an average masala gun-trotting fare. I would give it 3 out of 5, simply because it's a Pirates of the Caribbean movie and Johnny Depp deserves it, none the less!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Dosn't live up to its predecessors,"Flick Reviews Wes Yunker Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger TidesMy hopes for the new Pirates of the Caribbean film was average at best. First of all there was the fact that Gore Verbinski did not return to make this fourth installment. Secondly, no Orlando Bloom and no Keira Knightly. I do agree that there story had been spent up and they lived happily ever after but in all reality Johnny Depp as the infamous Captain Jack Sparrow is what I would call a supporting role. There needs to be that straight man to even it out. And that is how I ended up feeling when watching At Stranger Tides. It was as if all the villains and great supporting cast of the first three films were having a separate spin off adventure. Sure I love Sparrow and Barbosa but not as leads. I'm not saying that they should have brought back Bloom and Knightly and I'm also not saying that they should have brought some other good looking male and female leads to take their place. So they were just screwed from the beginning in that sense. The second issue with the films was the villain. The notorious Pirate known only as Blackbeard (Ian McShane) did not in any way measure up to the villains in the first three Pirates movies. You don't see him at first and you're waiting wondering what this guy is going to be like. And then when he finally makes his long awaited entrance you may be somewhat disappointed; I know I was. I wasn't afraid of him, I didn't find him the least bit threatening, and could someone please explain to me how he has the ability to control the magical movement of everything in this ship by just waving his sword. And I would also love to know how he has the ability to capture gigantic ships and store them in tiny glass bottles. These are two things that are never explained in the film. We know why Barbosa turns into a skeleton in the moonlight and we know why The Flying Dutchmen has a tentacle face heart beats outside of his chest, but what the hell makes Blackbeard so magical? I would have been fine with that if it was explained. But I must say with its flaws it was a very entertaining flick. Quite better than the third which is still my least favorite and still not nearly as good as the first two (the second, Dead Man's Chest being my favorite of the whole franchise). I must praise the new director Rob Marshall ( Chicago, Nine) there was never a single moment when I felt that this movie was by a different director. It had the same look and feel as Verbinski gave to the first three. The action (entertaining as it sometimes was) often times seemed a little too much like a time filler. There has been great action scenes from the Pirates franchise that have stood out in my head but in this film most where pretty forgettable. The greatest scene in the film was most defiantly the mermaid scene. I won't reveal anything all I'll say is that it was the greatest moment of tension in the whole film. And of course Johnny was good as always as Jack Sparrow. It's the same old Jack; I don't need to say any more. A great new addition was Penelope Cruz. She did a great job as Angelica, a not to be reckoned with con artist and Sparrow's former lover who joins the cast on this fun, entertaining, just not all that satisfying installment of Pirates of the Caribbean. 3 ¬Ω out of 5",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not as good as the first three.,I'll try to make this short. First of all I loved the character of Jack Sparrow. I feel Johnny Depp's greatest character portrayal to date is that of Capt Jack Sparrow. I was saddened when the last of the trilogy ended. By accident one day I was commenting on such and by accident found that he had just announced that the would be a fourth. I waited anxiously for the movie to come out and one the first day we went to see it. I was so happy to see Capt Jack. I waited to see the Jack that I had come to love and then the movie ended. I was very disappointed. It was as if the director held Johnny Depp back from bringing out his famous character. I believe that if the old Johnny doesn't come back in number 5 there will not be a number 6. I hope the old Jack Sparrow comes back!,6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Film Fans Will Adore,"If you're like me, a huge fan of the Pirates of the Caribbean movies and an even bigger fan of Johnny Depp, you are very excited to see the latest installment. I had the honor of seeing On Stranger Tides last night and I am very pleased to say that it met every expectation that I had. The humor was definitely at it's highest point since the first movie. The new characters kept the story fresh and interesting. Although Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann are missing from this film, there is no void that they left, and if you love the 'young love' aspect that they brought to the screen, two of the new characters will provide a different romance story that will keep you just as happy.Captain Jack Sparrow is, as always, the star. He shines in this latest movie in every way. He keeps things exciting and steals every scene that he's in. His relationship with Angelica is a great way to see a new side to our beloved character while still keeping his care-free, charming personality we all fell in love with.When I read critic reviews for this film, I was nervous. But fans, fear not. Critics seem to overlook the magic of these movies. If you loved the first three, the new one will be a movie you enjoy.CAPTAIN JACK IS BACK!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A new era for our beloved pirates!!!!!!!!,"The first three films are now a big part of the history of cinema and no one can deny that. ''On Stranger Tides'' is a worthy sequel to those films.Of course, Johnny Depp is once again incredible amusing as Captain Jack Sparrow, showing you his acting skills one more time and why he was nominated for an academy award for best leading actor for the same role in the ''Curse of the Black Pearl''. Every time he is on screen, his presence is so entertaining, you'll just want more more of Captain Jack. So we have our favorite pirate back -who is also one of the most iconic character from the 2000's...but what else?Geoffrey Rush returns as the cold-blooded pirate captain, Hector Barbossa. This time his story is evolved just like in the previous films. From an evil villain, a guest star, and a tritagonist he has becomes now a huge supporting character. His performance is of course excellent, the motives of his character are very interesting and I give you my word, you will love his last scene!!!Penelope Cruz is better than I expected, I'll give her that. She manages to appear as the complete equal to Jack Sparrow's cunning and her role in the story is extremely important. Plus, she is so hot!!!But what is a good movie like this without a menacing villain? Ian McShane is perfectly cast as Blackbeard, the ''pirate all pirates fear''. Even from his first scene you realize that he's not messing around and that he will stop at nothing in order to get what he wants. The only bad thin about Blackbeard is that I expected him to be....more evil...don't get me wrong, he was very cruel, but still...The rest of the cast is very good as well. Kevin McNally is funny as hell in the role of ''master'' Gibbs, just like he was in the ''old days''. Astrid-Berges Frisbey is incredibly cute, hot as the mermaid Syrena and she gives us a very interesting sample of her acting skills. Sam Claffin is also very good as the priest caught prisoner by Blackbeard and falls for Syrena and he has some very well written scenes. Stephen Graham is incredibly amusing as Scrum replacing Pintel and Raggeti as a comic relief and Keith Richards, Richard Griffiths, Greg Ellis and Oscar Jaenada all have small but important roles. The writers Terry Rosio and Ted Elliot give us a clever script based on the novel ''On Stranger Tides'' and Rob Marshall directs in a very good way, just like Gore Verbinski.To sum it up, is very entertaining movie for every age and a worthy sequel to the previous films and it cannot be missed. It's not perfect, but it will make forget your problems and take a deep dive into the amusing world of the Pirates of the Caribbean.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Fun-Filled Adventure!,"Johnny Depp hasn't lost a bit of his pirate charm in this newest installment in the Pirates franchise. I'll admit, I went into the movie with my doubts- I didn't think the movie would be half as good as the first, or even the second or third. However, those doubts were quickly and utterly washed away. So let me assure you, the movie is well worth the watch- it's filled with action-packed, fun and sometimes hilarious fight sequences, witty dialogue and wonderful, new characters. This is one Pirate movie you don't want to miss out on.I'll stay spoiler-free, but go a bit more in-depth about the movie. Once more, Captain Jack Sparrow is wrapped around and involved in another mysterious and adventurous plot, and the fun is only just beginning. I watched it with a friend, and we found ourselves laughing, cheering, gasping in fear and surprise, and overall enjoying the movie by every second. If you enjoyed the charm, spirit, and the essence of fun and adventure from the first three movies, you'll love this return to the world of pirates just as much, if not more than, the previous installments.One of the best parts of the movie was the acting. The two new main actors we see, playing alongside Captain Sparrow, didn't feel out of place at all- they held their own as solid, 3- dimensional characters and even challenged Johnny Depp for the limelight. We also get to move along the plot with a few secondary characters that were, in my opinion, just as wonderful and deep as the main ones were.Overall, I rate this film as high as I possibly can. The score was brilliant- Hans Zimmer wows us again with his unbelievable talent- the acting was flawless, and the fun never stopped. I was even impressed with the fight-scene choreography. It challenges even the first movie in regards to which movie would be my favorite. If you're looking for a fun adventure (without the complicatedness of the trilogy-interwoven-multiple-plots from the first three), sailing the high seas with pirates and the always clever and charming Captain Jack Sparrow, definitely take your friends and family to go see this movie.P.S. As far as appropriateness for children goes, I'd be okay with going to take the 12-year old I babysit with me to see it, as there isn't really any extreme sexual or vulgar references, and the language is surprisingly kept to a minimum (with a few scattered exceptions). However, the fight sequences and sometimes bloody/graphic moments, while exciting and fun, may be too scary for the younger children. So take caution when bringing the little ones along for the show.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A waste,"If the bar hadn't been set so tremendously high with the first three installments of the POTC franchise, you wouldn't be so disappointed with this film.Gone is the clever storyline that made the first three so interesting. Gone are the characters that made them so worth watching. Gone are the rich and clear settings, that made everything stand out so crisp and believable.POTC is (was) simply one of the most breathtaking, entertaining, and masterful series of motion pictures EVER. The characters, imagination, storyline, plot lines, music, setting, photography, special effects, and overall, spine tingling INTEREST are completely missing from this latest installment.The ENTIRE picture is shot in dreary, overcast settings that compel ZERO interest or imagination. In fact, when they get to the edge of the cliff, it suddenly brought back the last time Jack was faced with a situation in picture two, and the contrast was more than sharp. The fun, fantasy, imagination, and utter whimsy of the previous picture was completely robbed with the current situation, where Blackbeard threatens to shoot his daughter unless Jack jumps off the cliff. (Oh, so wonderful.) Barbarossa the pirate is no better. He looks more than 10 years older in this picture, and I couldn't get over his heavily lidded eyes and odd hair and beard treatment. It wasn't until the very last scene, where he becomes captain of Blackbeard's ship that a smidgen of the previous movies returns.If this were a stand alone movie, made completely apart from the previous three, would it stand on its own. Barely, at best. But that's the point. This WASN'T made in a vacuum, and all the story-points from the previous movies were utterly missing from this dreary tale.The original three movies were good productions made by professionals at the zenith of their craft. Virtually EVERY SINGLE ASPECT of those movies is flawless. The inventive story-lines, the tremendous special effects, the humorous character pairings, the masterful production values and thrilling musical score, all combined to achieve a cinematic accomplishment never seen before. Utterly masterful in every meaningful respect. Crisp, scintillating, compelling, and thoroughly watchable.In comparison, this current picture was made by a completely different production team, and had NONE of the excellent qualities found in the first three. Jack Sparrow was really the only one who kept this movie together; all the others, including Barbarossa and Gibbs, were wooden and lackluster in comparison.IMDb says the budget was a quarter of a BILLION dollars, and that it grossed a cool billion at the box office. That tells you how strong the previous three were; that fans would venture their money in hopes of seeing something from the originals even though initial reviews warned it was a dog. They went to see it anyway, (just like me.) Any positive review of this movie is given strictly in deference to the originals.I'm not sorry I watched it, if only to see how the mighty can fall. No doubt, this movie was not poorly made, but it turned out poorly anyway. Depp made $30 million, I'm told. Not bad for three months work. Definitely produced as a cash cow, and on that level, it succeeded. Don't look for anymore, though. Only in a TV series could you get any more life out of this franchise.

The saga continues!,"This review will not contain any spoilers. I was very excited before going to this movie, thinking that it might bring it back to the original form with some 3d effects. The first movie was one that I loved more than anything but after getting through this movie, I felt that I left disappointed.I ended up thinking about what they could have done differently. Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) has always been one of my favourite character in these movies. It ended up not working out so well in my opinion. FIt just felt like they just had the main character acting as a comic relief with no one good enough to make it work in the cast. The synergy just wasn't there. In the 3 earlier movies he had Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom by his side. It gave it a kinda flow and chemistry that worked. Now they tried the same thing with Pen√©lope CruzAnother thing is that the boat rides are just fantastically boring. In the first movie, it gave the viewers a kinda feeling, That the time and plot actually moved forwards. In this movie I felt more bored than anything, cause it was just being used as a way of transportation instead of taking into account that this actually is a pirate movie.However the movie did have some good parts as well tho. It is funny from time to time, and has some decent special effects. It's a movie to watch, but I wouldn't go in there with high expectations. Just try and enjoy it for what it is, a blockbuster.Hope this review was helpful, rate it for some unbiased critic. Christopah out 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
ANOTHER GREAT FANTASY ADVENTURE,"All the pirate's films so far have been Brilliant & i mean BRILLIANT!!! The production design is outstanding, costumes, sets, acting, music & directing all excellent & best of the best & this 4th entry is still full of that quality filmmaking.Although ""On Stranger Tides"" is not directed by the legendary Gore Verbinski it's still greatly directed by Rob Marshall. The beautiful attention to detail is there & the gorgeous old fashioned sets are all here full of textured detail & realism, really these films are works of Art!!!
I have yet to see the 5th pirates movie yet & probably my favourite of the franchise so far is ""Dead Man's chest"" because i loved the Davey Jones charactor & Mythology & all the sea creatures crew & it's really dark Horror-Gothic look & atmosphere.
Now here with ""On Stranger Tides"" we follow Captain Jack Sparrow on his own personal adventure as he searches for the legendary fountain of youth & is accompanied by his old enemy Captain Barbossa played brilliantly by the great Geoffrey Rush, who i absolutely love in this role. Now Elizabeth & Will are not in this film & it's still a great film. We have new characters joining this adventure with Captain BlackBeard played by Ian Mcshane, another great performance, also the beautiful Penelope Cruz as Sparrows true love & an equally cunning & savvy pirate as himself, named Angelica.
The special effects are fantastic as always in this outstanding franchise & one big sequence stands out as the best part of this film & that's the incredible Mermaid scene!!! These Mermaids are the best ever put on screen in my opinion & show the darker mythology of those beautiful singing sirens. The sequence is Amazing, exciting & creepy. All in all this 4th entry is just as much fun & exciting & thrilling as the one's that came before.
ANOTHER great movie in the fantastic franchise & just a whole lot of entertaining fun.

Steady as she goes.,"'Pirates Of The Caribbean: On Stranger Tides (2011)' is much simpler than its two predecessors, a stand-alone adventure that wraps up all its arcs by the time it's over. It feels of a smaller scale, reminiscent of adventure movies like 'Raiders Of The Lost Ark (1981)', and it benefits from it. It isn't confusing or bloated like 'Pirates Of The Caribbean: At World's End (2007)', but it also isn't quite as well-conceived. There's just a sense that the thing is sort of sub-par compared to the three films before it. Still, that doesn't mean it isn't a ton of fun. It's about as enjoyable as 'Pirates Of The Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (2006)' and its aforementioned 'part two', becoming a swashbuckling roller-coaster ride once it gets underway. It looks great, with a unique aesthetic and plenty of not-too-CG extravaganza, and its writing is on point, familiar but fresh. The flick's returning characters are as good as ever, given slightly new spins to blow off their cobwebs, and the new introductions are as compelling and scene-chewing as is expected (well, most of them, anyway). The piece feels kind of like an odd extension to the trilogy and it isn't as memorable as any of its predecessors, but it's very entertaining nevertheless. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A decent entertaining installment.,"Like its other installments, the elements of franchisee 'Pirates of the caribbean' have been handled well. The fantasy factor (in story), black magic, relationships, anti-pirates, pirates (mostly Jack), crew, etcetera are amazing like always. The visuals are worth mentioning as well.In this installment characters are after fountain of youth, which would grant them additional life.(Like most of the audience) for me all's well that ends well. A movie with such theme appeals to bigger audience. The end however in this movie seems abrupt but makes up to it with 'Jack's dialogue 'The Fountain does test you'.The character of Jack portrays a witty, selfish person but righteous as a hidden quality. It wins heart of the audience in general. It's worth to solely mention that.Final Verdict: It is a decent entertaining installment.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

not as good as the original trilogy,"In comparison to the original trilogy, ""On Stranger Tides"" is less inventive, less funny and less impressive. However it still has a few strengths that makes it worth watching.Pros:The plot, as always, is great - simple enough to understand, but complex enough to be fascinating. Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is conscripted onto the Queen Anne's Revenge, captained by Blackbeard (Ian McShane), where he meets his past love Angelica (Pen√©lope Cruz). They sail for the Fountain of Youth in a race against Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), as well as the Spanish. There's plenty of action, with which the mythology and legends are interwoven wonderfully.The cinematography, special effects, costuming and design elements are beautiful, just like the original trilogy. They make ""On Stranger Tides"" a cohesive movie, and ensure that the world of the movie is rich, deep and convincing. Hans Zimmer, again, delivers an amazing soundtrack that complements the story perfectly.Cons:The movie takes itself too seriously at times, especially with the romance between Philip (Sam Claflin) the clergyman and Syrena (Astrid Berg√®s- Frisbey) the mermaid. It seems forced and superficial, and the lines exchanged between them are always over-dramatic. Also, Barbossa's super- serious revenge story is boring, washed-out and clich√©d. This comes as a great disappointment because Barbossa's character was hilariously outrageous in the original trilogy.Which brings me to another point. The humour in this movie was really lacking. There were many moments in the original trilogy where I laughed so hard I cried - Jack's experiences on the cannibal island, the fight on the wheel, Jack and Barbossa arguing over captaincy - but there were no really memorable moments in this instalment. The ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" franchise has always been special because of its absurdity, but this movie just doesn't live up to it.I wish I could say that Johnny Depp's performance as Jack Sparrow carried the movie for me, but it really didn't. Depp is a great actor but his lines just lack the wit and cleverness that really characterised Jack in the first three movies, and he also lacks swagger. In the original trilogy, Jack's brilliance always came from the way he played everyone for his own benefit, and we don't really see much of that in ""On Stranger Tides"". His willingness to sacrifice for Angelica undermines his every-man-for-himself nature that made him so likable.Blackbeard and Angelica's stories lack conviction. She wants to save him because she wants a father figure she's never had - this seems like a very pathetic excuse for sailing to the Fountain of Youth. The best villains are either the ones you love, hate or fear, and Blackbeard fits into none of those categories. In the end I felt nothing towards either of them.The plot twists in this movie are quite predictable. There was not one surprising moment. The original trilogy was ridiculous and unpredictable and left me wondering what was going to happen next, but ""On Stranger Tides"" is filled with clich√©s and shoddy writing that made it lack suspense.Overall, ""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides"" is a mediocre movie that is nowhere near as good as the original trilogy, but is still worth watching because of its interesting premise, the nice action scenes, and Richard Griffiths's cameo as King George.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It still entertains but now the writers are getting sloppy,"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003) was one of those rare films that was made all with the right people on board (no pun intended) and managed to become a title worthy of a franchise. The cast was talented, the music was memorable, the action was energetic, the writing was clever and it was filmed beautifully. Wistfully, like every popular franchise that becomes mainstream, there comes a point where the series begins to show its age. Audiences try not to accept it and go in hoping for the best but there always seems to be something out of place when the next chapter is made. Disney's Pirates has been subjected to that unfortunately but noticeably on a slower decline than many of its other counterpart strains. For this passage, the story is continued but shows that its writers are beginning to lose their grip on its mythology.After Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007), Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) had taken the map that lead to the fountain of youth. While on his way, he learns that he's not the only one. Turns out that the Spanish, the English (currently headed by Hector Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush)) and the infamous Blackbeard (Ian McShane) are all headed to find it as well. Sparrow also runs into an old flame named Angelica (Pen√©lope Cruz) who thinks Jack owes her a debt. The writing is developed once more by Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio (the duo that started it all). Delightfully the story doesn't contain as many confusing character threads as the previous film. However in spite of that, they managed to sloppily write a different aspect and that belongs to the character traits and disappearances. A big question that comes to mind is Blackbeard's ship and the powers that he has, which are controlled by a single sword.So how exactly did he get these powers? No real reason is given as to why he has these powers other than waving around the magic sword but even that isn't explained. Along side that is Blackbeard's henchmen who are apparently mentioned as being ""zombified"" (which again isn't explained), can't be killed. In Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003), Hector Barbossa and his crew had a reason to why they couldn't be killed. That reason was the curse; yes the logic wasn't factual but the idea was based on fantasy. Here, Elliot and Rossio wrote in Blackbeard and his crew with invulnerability without giving a proper understanding. What would Blackbeard's henchmen need the fountain of youth for if they can get stabbed and still live? Another character trait that isn't elaborated on is the mermaid mythology. When a mermaid touches dry land, why does their tale disappear forming legs and when they touch the ocean their tale returns? Perhaps there's a rule to this but nothing was said in the film and doing a little outside research didn't shed light on much either. So was it just made up?The other issue the story suffers from is absence of clarity on its previous cast members. The only returning main supporting cast member from the past trilogy is Gibbs (Kevin McNally). There was a clear ending for Elizabeth and Will Turner from Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007) but everyone else rather just vanished. What happened to the crew Gibbs worked with? It's not like the writers needed to film a scene explaining what happened but a transparent justification is all. There is a scene which involves the Black Pearl and where it ended up but does that mean the previous crew is there too? Nothing's said about it. Gratefully not much else has changed. Although directed by Rob Marshall this time, he's still able to keep the film moving. The pacing is still even with no lagging in between. The special effects remain well mixed with its live-action counterparts. The only element some audiences may find less of is the action sequences, which still are energetic but is more sparse than usual (it could be me). This could also be because of the toning down in scale prior to the last entry.The main actors to this story also continue to entertain. Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow remains unchanged which is totally fine because he is what made Sparrow. Kevin McNally as Gibbs and Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa also remain the same, which is great. The new additions are acceptable too. The best addition is Ian McShane as Blackbeard. McShane's menacing presence feels very close to that of Davy Jones (not as dangerous personally, but just as threatening). Pen√©lope Cruz as Angelica performed decently too and her chemistry with Johnny Depp was commendable. The last two additions belong to Sam Claflin (a missionary) and Astrid Berg√®s-Frisbey (a mermaid). The relationship between these two actors is predictable but alright in most regards because with Elizabeth and Will Turner out, there kind of needed to be romance somewhere. The cinematography is again headed by Dariusz Wolski who hasn't disappointed yet in this series; with beautiful wide screen shots of tropical scenery. Enough said. Hans Zimmer also returns to score the music and also retains the main theme for Sparrow while including new themes such that belongs to Angelica, Blackbeard and the mermaids. It's still enjoyable, just slowly losing its grip.The production quality of special effects, music, action, camera-work and talented main cast all continue to do the work that is required to keep this franchise afloat. Unfortunately, the screenwriters are beginning to get clumsy in their storytelling by not explaining a number of character traits, mythology to certain creatures and leaving out information of what happened to prior characters.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Decent... but not what I was expecting,"Ever since I saw ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" in 2005, I have thoroughly enjoyed Captain Jack Sparrow and his many adventures with various Lords and miscreants. But perhaps more so than that, the musical themes of this first movie were simply extraordinary, and I would definitely be so bold as to say that it was in large part to the music that the movie was so successful, and that it is now very much a cinematic classic.With exquisite titles like the ""The Medallion Calls,"" ""The Black Pearl,"" ""Underwater March,"" and ""He's a Pirate,"" Klaus Badelt and Hans Zimmer essentially did for Pirates of the Caribbean what John Williams did for Star Wars. With such beautiful, luscious music largely characterizing the film -- giving it an essential, strong musical identity, these brilliant composers managed to distinguish Pirates from all other movies in the industry.On top of this, the screen writing was simply superb (so good in fact that I can easily read it like a play without actually watching the movie). And even further upon that, the decent casting involved actors very capable of executing their lines, not to mention the fact that the characters are very well-written and developed (which is probably one of the biggest elements aside from the gloriously well done music). Thus, overall, the first Pirates movie was very well done overall, with unique musical themes that set it apart from all other movies.After that, you had ""Dead Mam's Chest,"" which while so similar to ""The Curse of the Black Pearl,"" wasn't nearly as good. For one thing, the musical themes weren't nearly as strong as those of the first film (although a few stood out, such as ""Davy Jones""). And while the same essential characters were involved (with perhaps a few additions), the plot was somewhat underwhelming. And after this decent movie, you had ""At World's End."" Now, this third film wasn't very much tied to the first film (as it had many new characters, new musical themes, and a somewhat different feel overall). Yet, the plot was very good with music that was slightly underwhelming (even if the titles were decent overall). ""At World's End"" seemed a much better movie than ""Dead Man's Chest,"" although both weren't what I'd called ""disasters.""Skip along to 2011 and you have the latest film of the series: ""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides."" Immediately, it's known that much of the previous cast is no longer present and so mean new characters have been added, with only a handful of the original characters still with Jack on his grand adventures. But this is a problem, because of the few still remaining, Hector Barbossa is a completely different character, playing an almost completely different role. Overall, it's as though everything that made his character charismatic and appealing was stripped away in some second-rate perspective of an otherwise great character. Joshamma Gibbs, as well, seems somewhat ""different"" in his role, while Jack Sparrow is perhaps the only character still available which seems to have his old flare. So suffice it to say, while the new characters (such as ""Black Beard"") weren't horrible additions, they simply do not compare to the very attractive and charismatic characters of the previous films. And even on top of this, the introduction to the movie was simply based on an absurd premise, while the plot itself was extremely underwhelming, and on some level, rather disappointing. And this doesn't even begin to get into the fact that music was largely rehashed versions of the original music (used in all sorts of new ways that didn't at all seem ""suitable"" or ""natural,"" but instead more ""forced"" or ""contrived,"" as if they just had to throw them in there somewhere).And lastly, Black Beard, as a new character, was tremendously disappointing. When one thinks of Black Beard, there is often an image of a large, brawny man with a large face and body who seems ""larger than life"" and downright brutal. The impression of Black Beard in this latest Pirates movie was absolutely nothing like this iconic historic image; instead, he's somewhat weak, not very aggressive, older and shorter than one would imagine, on top of the fact that his evil, nasty nature is only ""implied"" and never truly ""demonstrated!""Overall, this latest pirates was somewhat underwhelming and disappointing, and I definitely think the first three movies were far superior. 7/10 (mostly because I can't help but enjoy a movie with a Pirates feel to it, the character Jack Sparrow, and some sense of the original music that made the first movie so great). But perhaps I am being too generous here, as this movie was really relatively poor (but just seems to have depended upon the ""brand name,"" ""famous stock character,"" and ""signature music"" to get by, and that's a shame).",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fourth time's the charm?,"""I have no say in it, Gibbs. It's a pirate's life for me. Savvy?""I think a fresh start was exactly what the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise needed, and as a result, this is the best entry in the series since the first movie.While the second and third movies were overly-long and tedious, On Stranger Tides goes for fun and entertainment over the increasingly seriously direction the last couple of movies followed. Jack Sparrow's search for the Fountain of Youth is still a little too long (there's really no reason for these movies to be over two hours in length), and there was DEFINITELY no need for another peripheral love story now that Bloom and Knightley's storyline was finally (and mercifully) ended in At World's End.The characters of Philip and Syrena are blatantly forced into the story just so there would be another couple, and the time and attention focused on those two definitely hurts the overall pacing of the movie. They're are by far my biggest complaint about On Stranger Tides.I like the other new additions to the cast, though.¬†The new villain, Blackbeard is appropriately menacing and Penelope Cruz fits the PotC world like a particularly sexy hand in a glove.I'm glad and slightly surprised to be able to say that the forth entry in this franchise is a good one, and it accomplishes that by going back to what made the first one so likable; it gives us a fun adventure that's not weighed down by attempts to be dark and serious.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Swashbuckling Action All The Way!,"Johnny Depp returns once again as the the swashbuckling Captain Jack Sparrow! This time he is joined by his past love Anjelica who is played by Penelope Cruz and together they search for the Fountain of Youth! As expected there is plenty of action from the start and Johnny Depp continues to fascinate me with his eccentric behavior and quirky accent. The storyline contains the usual elements of action, sword fights, romance and magic however for me, the visual effects did not amaze me as they did in the first two films.The film lasts just over 2 hours and overall it was very entertaining and for a younger crowd I am sure it was fabulous but for me it was just a good film.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Another great adventure!,"I'm also weary of people trashing the Pirates of the Carribbean movies. I thought they were imaginative and great fun. The latest, ""On Stranger Tides"" was excellently done. I've seen the movie twice, both times in 3-D. The first time, I thought the movie probably wasn't as good as the first three, as Captain Jack Sparrow wasn't as many steps ahead of me as he was in the first three movies. However, after seeing it a second time, I think Captain Sparrow did a great job of planning things out, given the circumstances. Not as many betrayals going on in this movies as in the second two in which he can strut his stuff.I just love how the supernatural is reintroduced in these movies. Not especially gory, just exquisitely spooky. White Camp Bay would now give me the frights as it did the sailors in that movie. Excellent! A lot of people put in a lot of work in order to make this movie, and they did a spectacular job. They deserve our praise and our support. Unfortunately, I'm now addicted and am eagerly waiting the next movie. I sure hope there is another one.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Entertaining,"This movie, about Jack Sparrow and Barbossa who embark on a quest to find the elusive fountain of youth, is a good sequel to Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007)!Like its predecessors, it has a somewhat straightforward story where it also relies a little too much on comedy. It lacks a bit of seriousness, making it not as deep as wanted. However, it is enjoyable because of many other elements. Despite relying much on comedy, it is not without its funny humor. In general, it has a lot of entertaining action and drama, making it difficult to avoid the screen. My favorite element is the score by composer Hans Zimmer. It is not just the score itself, but it elevates the whole movie, making the movie pretty epic and cool. All in all, it offers a good experience!In conclusion, while this movie prioritizes lighthearted fun over a complex narrative, it delivers a thoroughly entertaining experience. Exciting action sequences, engaging drama, and a captivating score by Zimmer make it a thrilling escape.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A bit too long but very enjoyable,"The good thing with franchises is that you know what to expect when you go to the cinema. ""The Pirates"" bring the same good old mix of colorful language, Laurel&Hardy slapstick comedy, a feisty heroine who gives Captain Jack Sparrow more than a run for his money, rum, magic, sword fights, more rum and magic, and, of course, Captain Jack running and screaming like a girl. What's not to like? :)My only complaint is that there were a couple of secondary stories that ran to long and did not bring too much to the movie. The beginning was a bit loose and the story took a while to really get started, and the Christian missionary story was kind of unnecessary, in my opinion.Music was great, visuals were stunning, and Johnny Depp was his usual charming self. Very enjoyable.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""On Stranger Tides"" ends up configuring itself as a completely forgettable film, which wastes the base material, sounding like a repetition of what we have seen previously","With the end of the initial trilogy that was widely applauded by critics and audiences, it was time for Disney to take new directions and explore other legendary characters from the seven seas, in addition to being able to focus more on its great star, Captain Jack Sparrow. Unlike previous films, which were filmed on locations in the Caribbean, On Stranger Tides was filmed on location in Hawaii. Its plot is inspired by the book ""On Stranger Tides"", by Tim Powers - which had already inspired LucasArts' game The Secret of Monkey Island - and features Captain Jack Sparrow looking for the Fountain of Youth and confronting the legendary pirate Blackbeard. It is the first film in the series to be directed by Rob Marshall, and not by Gore Verbinski. He is also the first to show fictional versions of historical figures, such as Blackbeard, George II of Great Britain, Henry Pelham and Fernando VI of Spain.Even keeping the writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, the loss of some characteristics of the previous films is notorious, however, also positive points can be observed. During the simultaneous recordings of ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Chest of Death"" and ""At the End of the World"", the duo of screenwriters from the franchise found out about Tim Powers' book and, from now on, began planning for another film in the series, something that has already been made clear by the outcome of the third feature film, which showed us Jack Sparrow interested in the Fountain of Youth. Despite the overwhelming success of the first three films, the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise was already dead and buried in 2011, already having its ideal outcome in At the End of the World. It is evident that money speaks louder and that one more sequence would be produced. Although it works apart from its predecessors, we feel as if the work simply repeats the old formula, which is already exhausted, bringing absolutely nothing new, however much it seeks to portray another legend of the sea.Although Johnny Depp remains great on paper, there is nothing else he can offer, tiring the viewer with his adventures that already sound like a joke told a thousand times. It is not known exactly why the writers are reluctant to develop Sparrow. He is gradually becoming a redundant and predictable character and this destroys the innovative spirit he had in the original trilogy. In this film, they had the perfect opportunity to evolve Jack's emotionality with Barbossa's condition, the reunion with Angelica, and the friendship with Mr. Gibbs - this has a very important role for the narrative.We also have the excellent Ian McShane who gives life to the infamous and feared Captain Blackbeard, a recurring character in many legends involving the seven seas. McShane shows his talent and gives us another excellent antagonist for the confused Captain Jack Sparrow. Pen√©lope Cruz has a good chemistry with Depp, as an ex-novice and disillusioned ex-girlfriend of Sparrow, but nothing that is memorable and that makes us believe that our dear Captain Jack Sparrow can even be tied by some woman in this world. However, Geoffrey Rush, like Barbossa, has lost much of its luster, even though it is characterized in a completely different way, something that could work to bring a sense of novelty, but that does not reach that point. The degree of repetition is such that some duels, such as that of Sparrow against Angelica, seem to have been copied and pasted from other films, this one, specifically, is almost equal to that of Will and Jack at the beginning of ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"".
In an attempt to avoid the confusion of the third Pirates of the Caribbean, each of the details of this new plot is explained in its details. A bet was made here for certain. Thus, the fourth film in the Pirates of the Caribbean series goes around, goes up, down, jumps off cliffs, plays very lightly with the supernatural and makes fun of it, but ends up in the same place. So we learn that Blackbeard and Angelica want to get there to cheat death; Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) wants revenge on the one who left him one-legged; and the Spaniards and English have an unimportant religious feud that adds nothing to the plot and could have been left out without prejudice. In order not to miss the possibility of a little romance in the story, now that Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) and Will (Orlando Bloom) have agreed, the religious Philip (Sam Claflin) and the mermaid Syrena (Astrid Berg√©s-Frisbey) are on the scene. The presence of the two is much more ornamental than that of the previous couple, who made the plot move. Here, more than ever, the protagonist is Jack Sparrow.One of the many negative points of the story is to leave the Pearl aside, which is by far the most iconic ship in the franchise, and bet on the Blackbeard ship. Locked inside his large collection of bottled vessels, Ian McShane's character holds the Pearl as an asset to one of his many won battles. Queen Anna's Revenge is a cursed ship, as in the past Sparrow's former ship was, and from the orders of its captain, who wields a kind of magical sword, the vessel comes to life and annihilates potential enemies. We also have the debut of countless other characters, such as ""The Spanish"", a service of the European country of the same name with a religious fervor, which states that only God can give someone the gift of eternal life. The Spanish antagonizes all the other characters in the film, and also seeks the Source, but with the intention of destroying it.Director Rob Marshall also demonstrates that he does not have the same control as Verbisnki, wasting all the exquisite production design of the franchise, employing shorter and more closed plans, which remove all the sense of wonder and grandeur that we felt in the first three features. The director clearly has difficulty in making the action scenes with different characters and simultaneously, one of the marks of the series, as is the case of the final climax at Fonte da Juventude. Marshall is sometimes too exaggerated and fails to give actors accurate comic times; however, it makes correct action scenes, although they do not reach the feet of the grandeur of the previous three features (this may be deliberate, since this plot is much less complicated than the others, and is translated in a much more episodic way). The journey shown in the film is quite interesting, but the script unfortunately bets on a difficult path along the way, putting several extra things unnecessarily. What is seen, given Marshall's ability, is disappointing. Little has changed in relation to the visual work shown in the last film and in some points it is not rash to say that there was a significant loss of quality. The epic battles, which gave rhythm to the script, have now not been well planned and carried out, and many of them lack agility. Even the soul of the series, which was the explosive barriers between ships, were left out. In fact, the entire film lacks memorable action scenes that make it into the series. Among many other mistakes in the script, there are also shallow, easy and light solutions to various conflicts. For example, the unpredictable climax of the film that is resolved very quickly without the slightest development.But it is worth mentioning that we have some very interesting scenes. The entire initial sequence set in the English capital is well-crafted, fun, action-packed and beautifully choreographed by Rob Marshall (Chicago, Nine), the new director of the franchise. The escape plan improvised by Jack serves to remind the public of the genius that his ever-drunken style hides. The mermaid segment is the most interesting in the film - absurdly fantastic. The dialogues between Barbossa and Sparrow enrich the quality of the film. The few revelations of Sparrow's past also satisfy the viewer's curiosity. The select action scenes (such as obtaining chalices on the ship or even the final climax at the Fountain of Youth) are exciting and references to previous films are a gift for attentive viewers. Other than that, the marriage of the fictional narrative with the historical period is very well accomplished. There is also the hilarious transformation of Barbossa from pirate to privateer.
The special effects, like all the other chapters, are excellent. The photography of Dariusz Wolski, a professional who worked on the previous features, again impresses and gives personality to this universe. The CGI of the film is exceptional, especially in relation to the mermaids, giving a credible aspect to many things that happen during the course of the story. Again the soundtrack is spectacular. Hans Zimmer innovates a lot and makes the little more than two hours of film worth more for his majestic tracks than anything else. Blackbeard has one of the best themes of the franchise, Blackbeard (the character's name in English), and creatures like the mermaids and the locations where the coveted Fountain of Youth is also found, with tracks like Mermaids, Mutiny and On Stranger Tides. The themes used in the locations of Queen Anna's Revenge are equally great, and songs like The Pirate That Should Not Be and South of Heaven's Chanting Mermaids are used to delve deeper into the old relationship between Angelica and Jack.""On Stranger Tides"" ends up configuring itself as a completely forgettable film, which wastes the base material, sounding like a great repetition of what we have seen previously. As much as it is of considerably shorter duration than the previous ones, the work seems to extend for much longer. It doesn't reinvent the franchise and deepen characters, but anyway, it's always interesting to revisit this universe. For those who liked the initial trilogy, they'll be fully satisfied and have fun.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Slow and Strained But Gets Stronger Along The Way,"20 May 2011. The dialogue and that plot in the beginning and throughout the movie seems to ooze with a scriptwriter under pressure to create a blockbuster movie and the dialogue and plot seemed strained to do so. The first half of the movie seemed to drag interspersed with the requisite action scenes which have particular merit in their captivating novelty. There are sparkled throughout a few one-liner gems that sometimes though seem to be thrown out to help carry the rest of the movie. By the last half, a fascinating dynamic and relational subplot occurs that at times seem to overshadow the main storyline. Nevertheless, the original discovery towards the end of the movie and the role of Spanish are tweaked in a way that makes for a more substantive movie.

"Classic style, but not so surprising","I don't know how to write a good review, so I'll just start from nothing. The story is about Jack Sparrow, Blackbeard, Angelica, Barbossa, all looking for the Fountain of Youth, where you can take another person's years and extending you life, for different reasons. As usual, somebody wins and some body dies.Here you can see some expected scenes, kisses, explosions, killing people, some strange looking guys, stuffs like those. There are roughly two story lines, and merged properly. The 3D effect is not so obvious in the middle part of the film, but clearly them have put some effort on making some of the scenes popping out of the screen, not just depth of field 3D. The ending is not surprising as you saw the bad guys are dead and everybody lives happily ever after, but it's acceptable in this movie.One thing about Johnny Depp is that he switches brilliantly between different emotions, and the ""laughing points"" are quite well too, adding some more features to this film. Also, his ""non-lethal"" attacks are pleasing too.almost forgot to mention about the CGs, just so natural that you could forget their existence, the effort they have put in should not be forgotten(speaking as a non-experienced 3D modeler).Overall, this is a movie that if you walk into the theater, you should walk out smiling(should), but don't look for big surprises.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"On Stranger Tides Falls Flat On Characters, Dialogue & Production Design","I'm sure everyone could tell just by watching Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides for the first time that it looks cheaply made compared to Black Pearl, Dead Man's Chest, and At World's End. It would appear as if the makeup and cinematography teams sat this one out.That should confuse everyone considering On Stranger Tides had the highest budget out of the first four films. The movie had a production budget of $379 million, and with tax credits, the total cost came to over $410 million.The Curse of the Black Pearl had a budget of just $140 million and ended up making $654 million in worldwide box office gross. Dead Man's Chest and At World's End were shot back-to-back at a cost of $225 million and $300 million, respectively.Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) could not carry On Stranger Tides on his own because even his character was done dirty. The script dialogue and acting are very different from the first three films.The plot was actually perfect for a POTC sequel, as At World's End did a great job of setting up this storyline at the end of that film. It could have worked just as well as Curse of the Black Pearl if it was executed better.Jack and his crew set sail on a quest to locate the Fountain of Youth. However, English royalty also wants Jack and Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), now an English privateer, to lead their faction to the FOY.Then there's the villainous Blackbeard (Ian McShane), also known as Edward Teach, aboard his Queen Anne's Revenge ship, with his daughter Angelica (Penelope Cruz) as his first mate. I really like Angelica's character. She clearly wasn't the worst part of the film.We didn't get much of a backstory on Blackbeard, which is a problem because he just didn't seem menacing enough on-screen to help build around this plot. In 1718, the real Blackbeard met his gruesome end after being shot at least five times and stabbed at least 20 times before being decapitated.I personally think a stronger plot for this sequel would have been Jack setting sail to find the Fountain of Youth because Captain Edward Teague (Keith Richards), Jack's father, is dying. That would have been all the motivation Jack needed, helping someone who he loves and cares about. He originally wanted it for himself, but that changes when Teague becomes ill.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A fun-filled joy ride. Way better than people make it out to be.,"This movie is way better than people say it is.That is, if you're not expecting it to be a huge epic or a completely innovative work that'll keep you thinking. It's not meant to be that. It's a fun, good old adventure.And it's in the spirit of the classic adventure film that Pirates 4 strives. The action isn't overdone, but there's just enough that it'll keep you alert. The conflict of the story also isn't overdone, which is a huge relief from the last two. I mean, don't get me wrong, I loved the last two installments. But after the incredibly complex story of Beckett and Davy Jones, it just feels right that it goes back to the basics.Three ambitious parties all searching for the fountain of youth. Simple. Understandable. Adventurous. The perfect plot for the fourth installment.Of course, however, the first viewing will most likely be A LITTLE disappointing. That's just because it's a sequel and I, for one, am always somewhat disappointed with a sequel the first time I see it. It's been that way with pretty much every big franchise I can think of. But then, once you get past that (which you will), you'll realize it fits quite nicely into the series and ought to be watched at least a second time or a third.So, in conclusion, it's not that innovative epic or the high point in the series. What it is, is a fun movie filled with laughter, love, and the many other things that make movies great. Don't criticize it if it wasn't everything you expected. If it made you smile, then it's a good movie. Unless you just like to complain.And don't forget, there will be two more installments added before the franchise is done, so don't be disappointed that it's not as epic as the last two. It's not supposed to be the high point in the series. But it is entertaining. I'd definitely rank it as one of the best movies of the year.And, oh yeah, I forget to mention the best part.

If you've seen one before...Be prepared for more of the same,"Having seen all the previous films in the series and despite being woefully disappointed by the third instalment, I decided to give this one a go anyway. The critics tell me it's better than ""At Worlds End"" and I am prepared (on this occasion) to believe them. Fortunately (for them), they were indeed correct and while not as good as the first two, it is an improvement. I will give you more of my thoughts after this brief summary.This time Jack Sparrow is on the trail of the Fountain of Youth. Teaming up with an old flame, Angelica, who turns out to be the daughter of the notorious pirate Blackbeard, Jack finds himself aboard Blackbeard's ship and on route to the island where the Fountain can be found. Also on their trail there is Barbossa who, having lost his leg to Blackbeard is out for revenge. Throw in the might of the Spanish fleet and there's more than enough competition for the prize. Certain items have to be collected before the Fountain can be used, not least of which is the tear of a mermaid and this proves very difficult to obtain. I don't want to say too much, but needless to say a perilous journey is about to culminate in the mother of all showdowns! I had better not say any more of the Spoiler Police (Pirates Division) will have me clapped in irons and keel-hauled.Very well made with some excellent CGI and stunt work; these are the hallmarks of these films. Performance wise; Johnny Depp did his usual comic turn as Jack Sparrow, Pen√©lope Cruz did a decent job as Angelica Teach, Geoffrey Rush was good (as ever) as Barbossa and Ian McShane I felt did a decent job as Blackbeard. Honourable mentions must also go to; Kevin McNally as Joshamee Gibbs, Sam Claflin as Philip, Astrid Berg√®s-Frisbey as Syrina, Stephen Graham as Scrum, Keith Richards as Captain Teague and Richard Griffiths as King George.Although I did find it entertaining to a point, I did feel it got a little tedious and predictable towards the end. The trouble is, with three previous films, we have seen it all before and it does all get a little repetitive. I also felt it was way too long! I guess the films are still making large amounts of cash for the Disney machine and so they will continue to make them (sadly). I think, if you haven't seen a 'Pirates of the Caribbean' film before then I can recommend it to you; if you have, then be prepared for more of the same.My score: 6.3/10 IMDb Score: 6.6/10 (based on 111,001 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 33/100 (based on 245 reviews counted at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 61/100 (based on 145,528 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not as I had expected,"okay am I the only one who did not enjoy this movie?unlike the first 3 parts i actually felt bored in the theater a few times ,i feel like there this movie should have had the old cast members like pintel and raghetti,the chemistry b/w the cast of the first 3 was excellent.the comedy and dialogues were amazingly done in the first 3,i loved barbossa's character in the first 3, in this one he doesn't deliver good dialogues,kind of a stiff character in this one.its only at the end he becomes the kind of character i had expected him to bejohnny depp did amazingly like he always does, but i feel like blackbeard wasn't a good antagonist,davy jones from the second and third part did amazingly as an antagonistall in all i feel like the script wasn't solid enough,i'd give it a poor rating",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Entertaining but faulted installment that will please fans of the franchise,"As a fan of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, I was anticipating this movie ever since the title was announced. I finally got around to seeing it yesterday and found that while I did enjoy it, it lacked the adventurous qualities of the first 3 films and had some flaws that really should have been fixed.To keep the story brief and not give away spoilers, the film takes place after the third movie and follows Captain Jack Sparrow searching for the Fountain of Youth only to discover that a feared pirate named Blackbeard and his daughter, Angelica are after it too.Naturally, Johnny Depp gives a great performance as Jack Sparrow. It's one of the defining roles of his career and one of the main reasons these movies were great. The other positives of this movie are an interesting new character in Angelica, played well by the gorgeous Penelope Cruz and she has and interesting relationship with Jack, an opening scene that pulls you in right away and good ending.The negatives of the movie however are as followed. Ian McShane as Blackbeard. While he gives a solid performance, he simply doesn't fill the shoes of Barbossa, Davy Jones or Beckett from the previous installments. The film lacks a lot of the sword fights or ship battles that you'd expect from a movie like this and the movie also contains a subplot surrounding mermaids that is almost completely disposable. I also personally missed Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly, but I can respect the writers for starting out on something more fresh.Overall, the film has flaws and is the weakest Pirates of the Caribbean film so far, in my opinion, but it certainly does provide solid entertainment. Whatever problems exist here are likely just the fault of the new production crew. Rob Marshall is no Gore Verbinski. Just don't expect too much from On Stranger Tides and I'm sure you'll enjoy it.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Had to get used to a new couple but actually really liked it.,"It's by no means a bad movie. It has a really cool villain with Blackbeard and is funny and has action. Angelica is a character I got used to and kind of like.Serena and the Priest, I forgot his name, also have a really interesting thing going on.Overall not bad.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Somewhat Disappointing but Overall Pretty Decent,"I have been waiting for this movie ever since I heard there was going to be a fourth POTC. I was very excited to see it but when i found out that Gore Verbinski wasn't directing the fourth installment, I knew that On Stranger Tides would be different than the others, and it was. The film was somewhat disappointing. As far as acting goes, Johnny Depp steals the show again and Geoffrey Rush and Ian Mcshane deliver solid performances. The action was superb but I didn't like the fact that more than half of the scenes were shot at night. Unlike the others in the series, this one was forgettable. Don't get me wrong, it was highly entertaining, just forgettable. Even though its a pretty decent film, compared to the previous installments, this one looks like a pile of crap. Another problem with this film is that it is nearly identical to the previous ones, just a different storyline and a few different characters. Don't walk into this movie with high expectations, this is more of a popcorn flick. If they do another pirates, please bring back some of the old cast and please bring back Gore Verbinski to direct.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Best thing since the bible,I never been a fan of pirates films until I happened upon this monster of a franchise helmed by non other than Joshamee Gibbs. His actor holds nothing back and watching his performance is what can only be described as having a full blown orgasm in the cinema. Gibbs alone would get this film a 9/10 but the fact that we learn that he has a cousin named Jeremy raises it beyond human comprehension. This film should be called Pirates of the Caribbean: Joshamee Gibbs because he carries this film with his own bear hands. Also Johnny Depp is there but no one really cares about him.,10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides (2011) - It's a Pirate's Life for Me! Savvy?,"I was completely excited to see all the new changes of the brand new Pirates movie. The movie is set after the events of the third movie, and it shows Jack Sparrow arranging a crew together on a quest for the Fountain of Youth. Also, along the way, Jack has to go through rough competition between Barbossa and a former lover, deadly mermaids, zombie armies, and the mighty wrath of Blackbeard. Although I loved the movie, I have mixed thoughts. The negative side - unlike the first three, this one didn't take us to the familiar locations in the first three. Also, the film didn't bring Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley back. Also, the film just didn't feel traditional to its elements. But my positive side - I thought this movie had excellent new characters including Ian McShane as the horrific 'Blackbeard', Penelope Cruz, who sizzles on screen, as Jack Sparrow's former lover, and Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush return to the screen for their roles as Jack Sparrow, who is still witty as ever, and Capt. Barbossa, who is now sent Admiral of a British ship. The film also had neat visual effects, amazing music, and my favorite scene in the movie was the deadly mermaid scene. What happened was...well, you need to see the movie to find out what happens. Also, the story where everybody searches for the Fountain of Youth carried my expectations. Although not traditional to the first three, Pirates 4 was a unique style of the Pirate films that was completely interesting. ""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides"", in my review, ""nothing traditional, but extremely unique"".",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Pirates On Stranger Tides - It's a Must See,"And ye be fantastic mate. I have been waiting for this movie to come out since the last one and I enjoyed it even more than the first 3 with Kiera Knightly and Orlando Bloom. Penelope Cruz and Johnny Depp are fantastic in this new adventure. I was blown away with the unique-ness of this sequel. It was so similar and yet so different from the previous films. It's so full of fantasy and treasures. It was thrilling, you get so wrapped up in the entire thing. There was also the perfect amount of humor. They also did the best job on portraying mermaids into a film. There are so many myths and ideas on mermaids, but I like that these mermaids are almost monster. : ) I won't go to far into it because I hate spoiling things, but as an overall movie It was fantastic, it reaches a large audience and is enjoyable for everyone.

Without Jack Sparrow This Would Be On The Worst Movies Ever,"Captain Jack Sparrow is an amazing character, and he is the only one who makes this film bearable. The other characters were pointless and irritating, the plot never went anywhere and the world could have done without this movie.Long story short, this film is the most unguided, poorly entertaining and below average 2 and 1/2 hour thing you will ever see. There is NO point in this film. I am pretending this movie was never made and there are only 3 instalments in the POTC franchise.Wait for this movie to show up free on your t.v., only then will you not be disappointed.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good entertainment but not a great movie. Still worth a watch,"After a couple of overly complicated and convoluted sequels Pirates of the Caribbean returns to a more straight forward storyline with a new director,Rob Marshall of Chicago and Nine fame, and an almost entirely new cast. Only Johnny Depp, Geoffry Rush, and Kevin McNally return from past films to reprise their roles. While I have to say that I've enjoyed all of the films so far Dead Man's Chest and At World's End both felt entirely too long, convoluted, and overall full of pointless subplots that didn't go anywhere. On Stranger Tides is a remedy to this as it goes back to some of the principles of the first film as Jack Sparrow rushes to find the fountain of youth before the Spanish and British navies can get to it first. On Stranger Tides also introduces us to an almost entirely new cast made up of Ian McShane, Penelope Cruz, and Sam Clafflin who play Blackbeard ""the pirate all pirates fear"", Angelica; Sparrow's new love interest, and Phillip Swift; a missionary who falls in love with a mermaid. While this certainly looks like a new start,the film has actually been down sized in scope and size in comparison to the last 2 films. Is this a bad thing? Are the Pirates worthy to sail for another sequel or has the series finally gone overboard?Check out the rest on my film blog http://mastersfilmreview.wordpress.com/2011/05/22/pirates-if-the- caribbean-on-stranger-tides-review/",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not as good as the first one,"(2011) Pirates Of The Caribbean: On Stranger Tides ADVENTURE/ ACTIONFourth Pirates film which is not related to previous ""Pirates..."" films except for the return of three characters, besides Jack Sparrow and his right hand man, theirs also Geoffry Rush coming back as Barbosa. The plot about people competing for the ""Fountain of Youth"" only serves as a backdrop to the following things, a woman posing as Sparrow and fights as good as he does who also happens to be Blackbeard's daughter. A map where the Fountain of Youth is cited and the search for it's chalices. Besides the French fleet they're also human killing mermaids and adapted from a novel written by Tom Powers. There is so much going and so many things happening that the only way I can enjoy this is by watching it in segments since it looked like it could've been broken down into 5 different movies. The ending is probably the best thing that has ever happened in this film since there were times I kept asking myself will this movie ever end.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Return to the High Seas,"Eight years ago we were introduced to a scallywag, a pirate of sorts, a pirate by trade ‚Äì Captain Jack Sparrow. Who would have thought that a big-time attraction from Disneyland & Disney World could spark a dynamite in the hearts of moviegoers? Gore Verbinski took that risk and the torch was passed down to a man who directed musicals and what not ‚Äì Rob Marshall. Well, I say, way to go Rob. You have done the crew a very BIG debt of gratitude. You took the reins and you shook them hard to make this movie the best of the 4. The cast ‚Äì Geoffrey Rush, Ian McShane (thank you for portraying Blackbeard the way it was supposed to be played), the beautiful and talented Penelope Cruz and most importantly the man who needs no introduction the man who played Edward Scissorhands, the man who played Willy Wonka, the 21 Jump Street actor from all those years ago to a rising star and a beloved actor ‚Äì the incredible Johnny Depp. From the story line, to the special effects, to the great music (Hans Zimmer, again you have proved your worth.)

The critics get it wrong yet again,"I went in expecting to be disappointed, after the trashing the majority of the critics gave this movie. I came out quite happy actually, and so will you, probably.While it's not on par with 'Curse' and not as humorous as the previous trilogy, it's still got more focus and less film-flam than the last two entries. At two hours it might seem a little long, but it's all full of story - a straightforward, focused story that maintains pace and direction throughout. The start is a little fuzzy, but by half way through the train is well on the right track.Nice.Most of the jokes fall to Depp who does a stirling job with Sparrow, whilst the tone of the rest is somewhat more adult, by which I mean ""grown-up"" as opposed to anything else. Less silliness. That's not a bad thing - I found the more adult nature of the film to be quite satisfying. There is plenty of adventure to be had here.It also doesn't have Keira Knightley or Orlando Bloom in it. Another plus.Penelope Cruz is feisty and sexy and everything Knightley wasn't, though if anything Ian McShane could have been a lot more intimidating than he was. That said, he was adept at barking orders and being reasonably menacing, though his relationship with his ship could have been expanded a little. Geoffrey Rush made the most of his diminished role, and the way his story is resolved, despite it looking a little silly at the start, is quite neat.All in all this is a satisfying entry into the series and proof yet again of how the cynical critics are out of touch with the wider audience.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not as good as previous...,"I am a big fan of Pirates of the Caribbean. However this part was not as good as others. There was a lot of blah blah blah. Jack Sparrow was in the center of this movie, a lot of him, to much, therefore almost lost his ""muchness"". Personnaly I didn't found this part as intense as other parts. The 3D completely worthless, what one is losing in brightness, contrast and eyes comfort, few 3D effects don't compensate. Sometimes I wanted to put off the glasses, as I really didn't feel the 3D, only in few scenes. Could be very interesting if not expecting to much. Could be a disappointment if expecting better than before. Best viewing in 2D.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Pirates 4 sails on safer tides rather than stranger ones,"No one expected Pirates of the Caribbean 4 to live up to the originality of the first film but it does manage to bring some of the frivolous fun back into the series that went missing in the third film with a simpler story aimed purely to entertain.A new director (Rob Marshall) helps to inject some enthusiasm back into the franchise and the inclusion of fresh bunch of supporting characters, led by Penelope Cruz, was a wise choice given the characters portrayed by Knightly and Bloom had pretty much run their course. Let's face it as far as characters go Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow is the real draw card for the series and has been since day one.The opening action sequence has been criticized as being overly choreographed and while I agree it does come off a little too staged at times I thought it was a lot of fun to watch and given the director is best known for musicals such as Nine and Chicago you'd expect the action sequences to have a dance like rhythmic quality to them.There are no undead pirates or mutated sea creatures in this chapter. Instead we have have to make do with a brief scene involving Mermaids to satisfy the 'supernatural' aspect and while the sequence was engaging I found I was left wanting for some ghosts of pirates past.McShane's Blackbeard has drawn criticism for not being menacing enough while Rush is applauded for almost stealing the show and while I'd agree on both counts I felt it was a tough ask for McShane to maintain the menace level expected for the duration of his screen- time especially given the tone of the film. Keith Richards has an all too brief cameo reprising his role as Jack's father, so brief and oddly placed that you wonder why they bothered but I'm guessing director Marshall is a fan... personally I'd like to see Aerosmith's Steven Tyler play Jack's uncle in the 5th film, if there is to be one. Tyler dresses like a pirate anyway so if nothing else he'd save the production by supplying his own wardrobe.While Pirates 4 might have failed to set the franchise sailing again I found it rather enjoyable and better than expected.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Johnny Depp brings  a little bit back to a falling franchise,"I didn't like the 2 and 3 sequel to POTC, but I thought this one was a lot better. It wasn't as boring, the story made more sense, and it seemed to be a little shorter. I wasn't expecting much since I hated the third sequel, but like I said, I thought this one was OK.Jack is in London hearing rumors that an impostor is lining up a crew. The impostor is his ex girl, Angelica, the daughter of black beard. The next thing you know, they are on a ship and after the Fountain of Youth. And so is the Spanish and Barbossa. Blackbeard is played by the perfect villain in Ian Mcshane. He almost always plays the bad guy. There are mermaids thrown in, a religious missionary, funny scenes of Jack using coconut trees to corral the Spanish, and a decent ending.FINAL VERDICT: I loved the first POTC and this is the first sequel I can recommend. I thought it was decent, not as boring nor as long.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides""- An entertaining but middling installment in the beloved franchise.","Few franchises in the past twenty years have taken the world by storm quite like Disney's ""Pirates of the Caribbean,"" which is of course based on the famous theme park attraction. With a grand sense of adventure and a great deal of heart behind it, the original 2004 release ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"" was a surprise hit and quickly became a modern classic thanks to a remarkable lead performance by Johnny Depp and original director Gore Verbinski's suitably dark but also entertaining eye for composition. It was a cultural phenomena, eventually spawning a two-part follow-up with 2006 and 2007's ""Dead Man's Chest"" and ""At World's End."" Though the sequels were even bigger hits and were generally well-received, you could tell that the effects of ""sequelitis"" were starting to rear their head. Both films were well-made on an aesthetic level and boasted strong performances, but the storyline started to become convoluted and the focus became disjointed.There was a prolonged wait before any news of a fourth film was finally unveiled. And when the news hit, it was both exciting but also worrying. Verbinski jumped ship to work on other projects while Rob Marshall took his place at the helm. Also gone were a great deal of the co-stars from previous installments. But the writing team of Ted Elliot and Terry Rosio were on board and so was the franchise star Depp. We eagerly awaited the release of ""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides"" with optimism.And while far from the series best, there certainly is some fun to be had with the film. Yes, ""On Stranger Tides"" is absolutely a middling and slightly disappointing follow-up. That much I must admit. But giving it the benefit of repeated viewings has softened my initial negative views on the film, and allowed me to see the many things it does right. It's still a ""Pirates"" adventure through-and-through... it's just not quite as fresh as it once was.Jack Sparrow (Depp) is caught in a new adventure when he escapes the clutches of arrest and is shanghaied aboard the dreaded vessel ""Queen Anne's Revenge"", under the command of the devious Blackbeard (Ian McShane) and his daughter (and Jack's former lover) Angelica. (Pen√©lope Cruz) Blackbeard is seeking out the mythical ""Fountain of Youth"", which he hopes to use to escape his death, which is prophesied to come at the hands of Jack's former rival and accomplice Barbossa. (Geoffrey Rush) Soon, it becomes a race against time as Jack, Blackbeard, Barbossa and a fleet of Spanish ships all try to reach the Fountain before anyone else, each for their own selfish reasons.The problems I have with the film really fall into two major issues. The first being that the film itself feels too much like a one-off adventure, and therefore contributes very little to the franchise as a whole. It's a blast seeing Jack Sparrow and his shipmates once again, but its in the service of a tale that has little dramatic impact. I appreciated that both of the previous follow-ups developed the story and the characters in the grand scheme of the ""world"" that had been created. ""On Stranger Tides"" might as well be called ""On Another Tuesday Afternoon for Jack Sparrow."" While it does tie into the other films in a few ways I will not spoil... it's clear from the opening act that the film is merely here to entertain and nothing more.And the second problem I have is our replacement director Rob Marshall. Don't get me wrong, he's a fine storyteller. But he's not the right fit. His visual guidance is too slick and manufactured for this type of film, and it lacks the grit and grime of Verbinski's down-and-dirty storytelling. It just doesn't quite capture that same delightful ""Pirates"" feel that the other film films excelled in. It instead feels more like we're watching a slightly tamed down and well-photographed ""Pirates""-themed stage- show. It's just all a bit too clean. A bit too squeaky.Those major complaints aside, I do quite enjoy the film for what it does well. And I think what it does well most certainly outweighs the bad. To start, the cast is as magnificent as always, with Depp easily stealing the show for the fourth time in his now-legendary role as Sparrow. He's as quirky, treacherous and charming as ever, and I couldn't even imagine another actor in the part. Depp simply is Jack. Rush and other returning actors such as Kevin McNally are great fun in their roles and are their appropriate moments to shine. And the new cast is a blast and a half. Particularly McShane, who makes for a wonderfully vile villain in Blackbeard. Just perfect casting.The film is also quite adventurous and is filled to burst with stand-out action set-pieces and plenty of bits of good-natured humor. It's an audience-pleaser to say the least. From a wonderful opening chase sequence through the streets of London to a genuinely startling Mermaid-attack (Yes, ""mermaid attack"") to sword-clashes aplenty, the film is completely loaded with eye-candy that will tickle that child inside of all of us. All the while, there's a constant layer of banter, bickering and gags that are sure to get some pretty consistent chuckles and laughs out of anyone. It's pure dumb-fun at its core, and its in these moments that the film excels.Your enjoyment of the film is going to come down to how much you are willing to forgive it for its faults. It's just another adventure for these characters and it's a bit too over-produced for its own good... but this is balanced out with a quick pace and a nonstop onslaught of action and humor. If you go in expecting a great film, you'll be disappointed. But if you just wanna spend another two hours in this universe, you'll have yourself a good time. I give it a slightly above average 6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Goes a long way to redeem At Worlds End but still needs polishing,"I hardly saw any previews and so went in expecting nothing and I was left surprised which is good, as I was really let down by the last part. At Worlds End was a bloated, convoluted special effect driven mess that had me hoping that there would be no more Pirates movies. Gore Verbinski pulled a Wachoswski brothers in destroying the goodwill they created with the first Matrix with two very poor sequels. While Verbinski had a better second movie the third is very comparable to Matrix 3.The Positives: The humour is mostly back and it was funny, unlike the lame jokes from AWE.Penelope Cruz looked really amazing, till I realized later that she was 7 months pregnant at the time of shooting- what a glow! She also held up very well in her role and her comic timing was excellent. I hope she makes it into the next movie.Less special effects and more real action. This is a huge step up from AWE whose ending was terrible.No Orlando Bloom or Keira Knightley! Yahoo! This deserves a 7 rating just for just positive alone! Slightly more focus on the story, even if it is still weak compared to the first movie The negatives: The story is still weak and not totally focused which let down the movie overall The opening action sequence was unnecessary, dull and overly expectant. It was a copy of the action from the first movie so it was just a matter of going through the routine. Not very funny either.Sparrow being the focal point of the story was not handled well. In fact the more the story focused on Sparrow the less interesting he became.Blackbeard's story was very dull and for a fearsome pirate...he was not. Ian Mcshane didn't do the character any justice and he could have well been left out.The movie suffers from too many plot angles still...There's Sparrow vs Barbossa, Sparrow Vs Blackbeard, Sparrow and Barbossa Vs Blackbeard, Sparrow vs Blackbeard AND the Spaniards...The plot still suffers from the parts 2 and 3 problems. This needs to be toned down to one or two rivalries, not the whole world vs Jack Sparrow Barbossa was not interesting and it's time that this character is cut from the plot entirely.Gibbs's role was really reduced which is a shame because he provided plenty of good humour in the first movie and he and Sparrow shared a really good camaraderie. He needs to have a bigger role in the next movie.All in all it's still worth watching at the cinema. Ignore the opening and ending sequence. It's a good start to repair the damage done by AWE but it still needs improvement. If there are still 2 more sequels to come then they have time to get it right. So far the first movie still ranks as the best, even if orlando bloom and keira knightley are in it.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Bit Blah,"Continuing my plan to watch every Johnny Depp movie in order, I come to Pirates Of The Carribean: On Stranger Tides.Due to his good relationship with Walt Disney's chairman of 38 years, Dick Cook Johnny Depp agreed in pricipal to star in this film before ""there was a script or anything in place."" After Cook was fired, Depp said his enthusiasm for the fourth Pirates movie had reduced after Cook left the project. He said, the only reason he agreed to it was because he trusted Cook, who supported him while ""others at the studio were less than enthusiastic about my interpretation of the character, Dick was there from the first moment. He trusted me."" He regained his enthusiasm by recieving a paycheck with a lot of zeroes in front of the decimal point.It is about what you'd expect. It is over long (a very long-winded 137 minutes) and totally over the top. It starts off well enough as Captain Jack Sparrow impersonates a British judge, is chased through London, makes out with Dame Judy Dench and discovers someone is attempting to impersonate him, while recruiting the crew needed to man a ship. The movie is ok until they set sail. Then it all gets a bit dull.Blackbeard played by Ian McShane is ok, but is not really threatening, Penelope Cruz is fine and has good chemistry with Depp, which we knew from Blow. Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swan (Kiera Knightley) do not return (Instead of Will and Elizabeth, we get a love subplot involving a priest and a mermaid.) but Captain Barbossa does, but he is bland and timid here. In fact he is pretty pointless, and only returns so audiences know more than two returning characters (Captain Jack's right-hand man, Gibbs is also back) Keith Richards turns up again, playing Captain Jack Sparrow's father too.Rob Marshall's direction is competent and, from a technical standpoint, there's nothing wrong with the various action sequences but it is just so blah!! The fight sequences are all impossible leaping and fast cutting, its confusing and uninvolving. The story does not engage, the characters are bland and the whole thing reeks of being a money-grab. Yet, I didn't hate it. It was watchable but nothing more!!POTC: On Stranger Tides grossed $241 million at the domestic box office to become the 5th highest-grossing movie of 2009.

Useless chapter,"Chapter healed but useless for the purposes of the saga because with a story completely disconnected from the general plot, in addition to this Jack is stupid at colossal levels but not yet annoying.

My favourite POTC so far,"This instalment of POTC could easily be a stand alone film. I felt much more of a connection with all of the characters in this instalment of Pirates. Whether that is due to watching the first three in a row, then this one, I'm not sure. Johnny Depp was as brilliant and entertaining as always as the Charismatic Captain Jack Sparrow. Penelope Cruise was an excellent addition to the cast as Jacks ex love interest Angelica. Their shared scenes are charged with underlining attraction and adversity at the same time. Angelica showed guts, power, determination and heart.I enjoyed the relationship of Jacks father returning in the first part of the film, it gave it solid grounding. The visuals felt real in this film and not overdone with CGI which I appreciate. The mermaids were beautiful and mesmerising. Everything was a pure journey of escapism, being lost in this wonderful world. This fourth instalment has heart and soul in abundance. It appealed to my 11 year old granddaughter and my husband who in his 60s as well.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I'm a bad man,"What Jerry Bruckheimer says to himself everyday. Anyway, 2010 was a bad year for Mr. Brockheimer, producing two flops, Prince of Persia and The Sorcerer's Apprentice, so needed a hit to get back on top. Luckily a Pirates of the Caribbean sequel is a good way to do that, even though At World's End was a incomprehensible mess and the director of the original trilogy, Gore Verbinski decided to make an animated film instead.In the middle of the 18th Century Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is in London after loosing the Black Pearl after the end of the third and King George II (Richard Griffiths) orders the pirate to lead an expedition to the Fountain of Youth, with Hector Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), who is now a privateer for the British Navy. Despite this Jack does not join them and escape, finding out someone is pretending to be him and lead their own expedition. He is soon captured and taken on board the Queen Anne's Revenge, the ship of Blackbeard (Ian McShane) and his daughter Angelica (Penelope Cruz), a former flame of Jack's. Soon Blackbeard, the British led by Barbossa and the Spanish are all heading to the Fountain and want it's power.After the problems of At World's End, the budget of On Stranger's Tide was tighten, with filming moved to London and Hawaii and the plot was simplified. This was a smart move because it gave the characters and factors a clear focus. It is a better plotted film then At World's End and characters do not have loads of different goals. There were a few subplots but they were in context of the overall of the film, such as mutiny and the capturing of a mermaid. The actual story about finding the Fountain was very similar to an Indiana Jones, trying to find a famous legendary object/treasure/location and what's impact could be. Essentially this film is trying to be a Indiana Jones film with pirates. At the same time Jack's ability double cross people is toned down and On Stranger's Tide suffers because of it.Rob Marshall replaced Verbinski in the director's chair and he is best known for making musicals. He does an decent enough job and pretty much the same from the previous films. This Pirates film is shot with a darker colour pallet and creates a problems, because it makes it harder to see the action sequences. The action is this film is the weakest in the series, the mermaid attack the best part of the film. On Stranger's Tide was shot in 3D and I saw it in 2D: but the 3D shots shall we say lacked subtly, with Blackbeard thrusting his sword or the mermaids driving towards the camera. Also Marshall saw fit to add some dancing and singing in the film.Johnny Depp obviously loves the characters, he keeps coming back to the role and I am sure it's not just for the money. He is still pretty funny, but Sparrow was a more serious character this time round. Cruz is a fine addition to the cast as the feisty woman who is a capable fighter and had a spark with Depp, though I would have liked to have seen Zoe Saldana's character from the first film return and have her character expanded upon. Cruz is a talented actor and her Latin charms were a great addition to series: hopefully she will returns and get a bigger role. McShane is always good as a villain for hire, menacing and ruthless, particularly with the mermaid. Rush however looks very ragged and his role was pretty pointless: I am sure he respired his role for the paycheque so he could afford to do smaller films like The King Speech. Somehow the casting director found an actor who was even more boring then Orlando Bloom, Sam Claflin, who was a really brand, wet missionary who added nothing to the film and √Ästrid Berg√®s-Frisbey is very petty, but because of lack of English skills she did not speak much. And Stephen Graham was seriously misused: he is a talented actor and was just used as a comic relief character, not say, a tough swordfighter and potential match for Jack.There are elements of the film which are not expanded, like how does Blackbeard control the ship with his sword: is it a magic sword? Some explanation would be nice. Also Blackbeard's officers are zombies, making them more obedient, wouldn't it make more sense to make the crew into zombies and let the officers keep their intelligence and if anything the zombies did not seem that out of it: their only advantage is that they could survive being stabbed.At times On Stranger's Tide feels a bit lazy and laboured, made simply to cash in on the popularity of the series. I have never been a big fan of the series but the films are entertaining enough. I just hope the fifth film the final one, allowing Jack Sparrow to retire and put some effort into it. On Stranger's Tide is decent enough but it is your typical blockbuster fare. You got to love Hans Zimmer's music, giving Pirates an almost Lord of the Rings style score this time round.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This ship set sail a long time ago...,"'Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides' should effectively be renamed 'The Captain Jack Sparrow Show' as the fourth film in the always popular pirate franchise is nothing more than a two-hour vehicle for Johnny Depp to show off all his talent and charm, which eventually wears thin after the first hour of the film. Aside from the world on Depp's shoulders, the plot is disjointed and the rest of the crew are mere puppets to Depp's act.While the first three films were concerned with the antagonist Davy Jones and Sparrow's one ship the Black Pearl, 'On Stranger Tides' is a more straight-forward, linear action-adventure film with Captain Jack Sparrow becoming involuntarily part of the heinous pirate Blackbeard's (Ian McShane) sailing staff to help them find the mythical 'fountain of youth'. Also on the ship is the empowered primary commander Angelica, who is the First Mate in charge of the Queen Anne's Revenge, while a few other characters from the previous films make their presence noted in the form of Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), Joshamee Gibbs (Kevin McNally), Lieutenant Groves (Greg Ellis), Lieutenant Gillette (Damian O'Hare) and Captain Teague (Keith Richards).The plot resonates throughout the film in a very stereotypical manner, Jack Sparrow makes a wise-cracking joke, this results in a chase or fight sequence, which is then promptly ended before the journey continues and the same sequence is repeated over and over again in a slightly different location. Until the final ten minutes of the film, nothing new is not attempted nor is nothing old expanded upon, Rob Marshall has certainly taken the safe route of throwing together a recognisable, albeit fragmented, formula and hoping the audience will jump on board for over two hours. For the fans of the film franchise this will most likely work, to ordinary cinema patrons; boredom ahoy!Another flaw is in the form of introducing the missionary Philip Swift (Sam Claflin), unlike the previous three instalments in which Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightly) provide the crux of the film's morality and principles, in 'Stranger Tides' there is no character in the primary cast who can accomplish this, so Swift's story and subsequent relationship seems to have been hastily thrust into the plot with no regards for how undeniably boring and tedious it actually is. He therefore attempts to also add a bit of humility and humanity among the blood-thirsty pirates and the psychopathic Blackbeard, but with his little screen time and over-acting this is never accomplished and the promising English actor becomes nothing more than a kind religious zealot with a muscular abdomen.Despite Depp's persistent and continual screen time, he does still provide adequate comedic relief, his best wisecracks seem to appear at the very moment when the plot and story seem to be slowing down, but neither the script, direction or rest of the cast and crew do anything else to keep this fourth film from being anything less than a cinematic sinking ship. It will no doubt quite easily gross it's estimated two-hundred million dollar budget back within the next four weeks, and subsequently facilitate a fifth film in the franchise, but 'On Stranger Tides' is definitely the weakest effort in the 'Pirates' series so far.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Better, shorter and darker than it's predecessors","This is the best Pirates so far. It brought numerous occasions down to lower levels such as action sequences, murderous moments, length and plot; but darker than the previous films. The story is much easier to follow than the last sequel (At World's End). Captain Jack Sparrow and Mr. Gibbs go on a hunt to find the Fountain of Youth. But it's not just them that are hunting for it alone: Blackbeard and his daughter Angelica are after it too. Brimming with swashbuckling special effects and thrilling moments, this film gives another cinematic experience of pirates, treasure hunting, scary stuff and sword fighting. A franchise and film that could carry on to do more sequels but wait until you've watched it to agree.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Prepare to set sails...,"""On Stranger Tides"" carries on the legacy of the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"", and it does so quite well. It is like a continuity of the movies, one supplementing the other, adding to the lore and history of the Pirates universe.The acting was spot on, as in the previous three movies, so nothing to complain about here, and nothing new to be seen here either - on the downside. Lots of really good actors and actresses to be seen on the screen here.The story was good and compelling, drawing you in as you are spun into the web of deceits and treachery, who sides up with who, and why? I liked the storyline, despite having read reviews where writers weren't too happy with it.There was one point that seemed to be toned down a bit. Jack Sparrow was less in your face in this movie, it was like they had toned down on his charms and quirks. That was a shame, because Sparrow was amazing in the previous movies, especially the way he moved and twitched about constantly.Mermaids? Well, some might not like seeing these mythological creatures in this movie, some do. I was one of those who liked it. I think mermaids added a great deal of interest to the storyline and the universe in which the Pirates movies unfold.Having seen ""On Stranger Tides"" I am looking forward to another movie in this series, because they are all really unique and interesting in their own ways and own rights.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Seriously, enough is enough.","The one word I kept repeating as I watched Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides was, ""Why?"" Why haven't they explained the disappearance of the characters from the previous films? Why are mermaids a complete ripoff of sirens? Why was this movie made???All questions aside, let's go through the brief synopsis. The film opens with the Spanish discovering a book that leads to the fountain of youth. Jump to London, we find Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) and his first mate Gibbs (Kevin McNally) in a tight bind (per usual). In an attempt to acquire a new ship, he runs into an old flame, Angelica (Pen√©lope Cruz). Without giving away too much, Sparrow and Angelica wind up on Captain Blackbeard's boat (Ian McShane), who is also in search of the fountain.Meanwhile, Barbosa (Geoffrey Rush), under orders of the King of England, is on a mission to beat the Spanish to the fountain. Though his pirate roots run deep, he uses the English for his own personal gain, the reason for which is revealed later.To be honest, there isn't much to the story without revealing some marginally important plot points like relationships being revealed and character histories. Here's what you need to know, there are three main parties rushing towards the fountain of youth. They all cross each other's paths from time to time, and they each have their own motives for reaching the fountain. To use the fountain's powers they must perform a ritual that requires two silver cups from Ponce de Leon, a tear from a mermaid, and a human sacrifice.Let's start with what works, as that list is the shortest. The special effects are decent. Nothing new from the previous films, just decent. Depp hasn't lost a step with Captain Jack, though he hasn't learned any new tricks. Not a good thing, not a bad thing. The same goes for Rush. To be honest, that's all I have to say as far as compliments go, and those weren't really compliments. More like aspects of the film that I didn't strongly dislike.I'll begin with the action. Over the top is one way to describe it. Boring is another. I think it's best to call it pointless. There are chases and sword fights that seem to go on and on when there was really no need for it. There is a part where two opposing characters are about to face off, swords in hand, fire in their eyes. Just before they face off with their bands of troops behind them, Jack Sparrow steps in, noting that it is only the two men who have the conflict. A valid argument, but the men fight anyways. The fight is eerily similar to the one that took place at the end of the first Pirates movie. How interesting.The story? Flawed. It comes off as if it were written to be made into a video game. There are small quests, puzzles, and sword fights galore. Every bit of which is predictable as the one before it. Accompanying this story is a cast of new characters, also predictable and uninteresting. For the fourth straight movie we meet a new pirate captain, one that is supposedly unbeatable, infamous for past battles. The writers are running out of pirate lore to exploit. Who is next? Captain Hook? Sandwich? Morgan?This is by far the most violent Disney film ever. I'm not just talking about a few bad guys meeting their untimely end via a distant explosion. For those interested in preserving the shock, skip this paragraph. A MAN IS STRIPPED OF HIS FLESH! Yeah. Don't be fooled by the Disney logo at the beginning. There is some pretty wild stuff here. It's one thing to show living (sort of dead) pirates. It's a horse of a different color when a live pirate gets the arch of the covenant treatment. There are several others attacked by sea creatures while others just get capped. On the whole a lot of death.So who is behind this? The blame could lie on Rob Marshall, whose previous work is primarily show-stopping musical pieces like Chicago and Nine. As easy as it is to blame him I don't think he has much to do with it. It has an almost identical look to the other films, which begs the question who has the bigger influence, Rob Marshall (Gore Verbinski for the previous three films) or producer Jerry Bruckheimer? I'm better on Bruck. This is his baby and I'm sure he has the final say.Back to my original question of ""why?"" In short, the answer is money. The previous two sequels made a large, and I mean large, sum of cash. Although I highly doubt this one will be as successful, I'm sure they will get their money's worth and then some. Money aside I honestly can't see why this film was made. It completely abandons several key characters from the previous films and in the end, I'm sorry to say, takes us nowhere. It is a zero gain. At least in the other films there was some sort of terror or element that could potentially lead to the end of the world. Not here. Sorry. Nada.Save you money for something worth while. And do not, DO NOT, see this in 3D. I saw this in standard definition and it was fine. With the money you spend on 3D you can have a couple of months worth of Netflix movies. That is a much better deal.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Excellent movie for ordinary people!,"Go and see this movie since it's as good as any of the other installments in the series. Why is it that professional critics want to deprave the ordinary man (woman) of a good movie? If it is a bad movie, like the love guru, it will get a low score on IMDb. I would never have seen this movie if it wasn't for the high score it got here.A long time ago I learned from a true movie-buff that you get the best movie experience if you sit real close to the screen and in the middle seat i e row four to six. That is especially true with these modern 3D-movies.Any movie with Kieth Richards in it is a good movie by the way.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Swashbucklers are still cool,"The fourth film of the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" franchise is only loosely connected to the other ones. Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush are still there, Knightley and Bloom aren't. The story is typical for the series and I think the viewer gets what he can expect: loads of adventure, action, sword fighting, wondrous creatures and pirate marvels, the movie has it all. It's fun, but it could improve on that, it's also not too violent, making it a nice family movie. The acting is fine, thanks to the many great actors here, with appearances such as Judy Dench, Richard Griffiths, Geoffrey Rush and the like. The landscape, the props, the music and special effects are as great as they were in the other three installments.I give it a 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"I wanted to like it, but....","So if you thought Pirates 3 was overwrought and overwritten, bogged down by questions about eternal life and love, then maybe you'll like the new one. I found it underwritten, under-produced, and generally kinda lame. All the characters are underdeveloped. Geoffrey Rush pretty much took the movie, in my opinion, and was a welcome departure from the otherwise dialing-it-in aspect of the others. And yes, I include Johnny Depp in that. Love Penelope Cruz but her character had a huge amount of promise and not much depth. Same for Blackbeard. Actors can only go as far as the script lets them go, and while it needed a lot of tightening and editing that it didn't get, this script was chopped to the bone at every turn. If you're going to include several different intertwining stories, and they do, then you either have to go for the long movie or fail to develop much of anything. I'd far rather have a long movie that actually does something with the characters than a bare-bones plot that merely uses the characters as props.The thing about Pirates 2 and 3 is that the movies started to take themselves a bit too seriously--but that added depth and atmosphere. Davy Jones really was kind of scary; the East India Trading Company really was pretty evil. There were religious and political overtones that added a bit of gravitas. If you didn't like that, you'll like the new one. If you did, you'll be disappointed. Even the religious references in Pirates 4 never get past the surface; there is no actual grappling by any character with issues of theology or redemption.Visually, the movie had a strangely cramped effect. The characters spend a lot more time on land than in the other movies and there is very little of the feeling of actually being out on the open seas. The budget for cinematography obviously was a lot less generous than for the first three movies.But if you just want some sword fights and a few explosions and a little bit of supernatural stuff, plus Johnny Depp having fun revisiting Captain Jack, go for it.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"""A light-watch movie, with scintillating performances . Don't die for watching it in theaters, although , if you are a Depp fan, then its another story !""","Capt. Jack Sparrow is back , and this time , a good ensemble cast follows him...each character , be it Barbossa, Angelica or Blackbeard - each one has their own story to tell , and, as they all follow the quest for the Fountain Of Youth, they enchant you with their stylish performances!Especially, a note for Geoffrey Rush : What a fine actor he is! Hard to imagine that this very person had delivered a serious role of a speech therapist in ""The King's Speech""....he is funny, witty and is able to churn out something classy whenever he enters a scene.Penelope Cruz was as enticing as ever-seductive and sensible. it was impressive to see her pull off those fight sequences amazingly. And seriously, I am bowled over by her accent!Johnny Depp was as splendid . He really has a thing for playing weird characters on-screen(we are talking Edward Scissorhands , Sweeney Todd, The Mad-Hatter, and of course, Jack Sparrow , among many others.. ). The way he delivers those one-liners, his expressions and ability to put eccentricity in the character, is simply amazing. Got to say, Jack Sparrow flows in his veins!Ian McShane was appropriate as Blackbeard, although his relatively smaller screen space seems to be responsible in failing to showcase him as the most dangerous pirate ever lived(the viewers are just made to assume that fact when he first takes entry in the movie). A little bit more , perhaps , could have just done the trick.For the plot, well, don't expect anything grand here, as it might be a disappointment then. Just sit back , (relax if you want to!! :P) and enjoy as the top-billed actors play around the whole time. The low point of the movie is, I would say, the plot. It seems a drag many a times in the movie , and this fact remains there since the third part. They makers are not at all working on the plots of the franchise but are solely depending on the casts (primarily on Depp) to pull off the show, else this would have been a treat for both easy-goers and critics alike. A little lesser action than the previous ones, POTC: 4 lags at its plot, way too much, after all this hype and hoopla.Not much effort was put in the 3D facet, with very less CGI effects to watch out for. Although it was a treat to watch some scenes- Jack playing with a dewdrop , the brandishing of sword by Blackbeard, Jack jumping off the cliffs and the climax sequence etc. Plus , 100 bucks for 3D, i won't mind! ;)Finally, a special word of accolade for Hans Zimmer : HE HAS CREATED A MASTER-PIECE OF A THEME-TUNE! I mean, at the end of each installment, I would wait for the ending credits to roll, and when the tune follows, it simply gives me goosebumps!The conclusion: Watch the movie if you are a Depp fan, more if you are a Jack Sparrow follower. Don't expect much in the action or the plot. And watch out the slapstick and witty humor of the movie ,(the hollow peg leg scene, the stealth sequences , the escape sequence etc.) and the one-liners. Sequel is a possibility(sit through the credits and in the end, you will get the hint!). And for the fun,it gives you!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""Our favorite pirate is back""","Jack Sparrow and Barbossa embark on a quest to find the elusive fountain of youth, only to discover that Blackbeard and his daughter are after it too.But not in a good way. I am very disappointed. As from whatever we saw in at World's End, I thought Rob Marshall would do some respect to the series; giving in some flair. Instead of doing that, he made this too rubbish, cheesy, lame. Whatever you may call it. Now this very well could've been a 4 or 5 stared film, but very surprisingly the film packed some memorable scenes in it. There was some humor and some great action, but it only came in small portions, sadly... I never got that feeling I had after I watched the others, I miss the bizarre-ness of the series and I miss Will and Elizabeth, surprisingly.

Meh,"Of all the sequels to the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie, this was the most meh.Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad movie. But it might be a bit of a stretch to call it a good one. So this film finds itself stuck in the middle.Acting, once again, was fantastic, the music was great, and the effects were beautiful. The plot, once again, though, is what killed it.The main flaw of the movie is that it doesn't feel like a Pirates of the Caribbean movie, and more like a spin off adventure. This probably happens because it lacks several characters who had major roles in the last movie.Case in point: Will Turner, Elizabeth Swan, Pintel, and Ragetti. These are the characters who seemed to be missing from the movie. Of course, there were others, such as Davy Jones, but most of those characters are dead, and even though that didn't stop Barbosa, bringing back Davy Jones would be flat out illogical.The rest of the movie was pretty good, but the fact that it remained so unfaithful to the other movies makes this one feel less like a proper movie, and more like a Netflix spin off.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Depp steals show as fun outshines originality,"Personally I have been a big fan of the POTC series and have seen the first and best many a time. You may think I am a big kid but being a 13 year old you are allowed these privileges without receiving too much ridicule .The new film 'On Stranger Tides' was a chance to redeem the series after what many saw as two below par sequels (I personally enjoyed them). The fourth instalment does not disappoint, with use of the dependable Johnny Depp and the classic POTC formula used in the first film to rescue its few faults. It also helps how it is a separate film to any other and gets all of the story done in one go. The effects are not as impressive as 1,2&3 yet it makes up for this with a witty script. The film does turn a bit Indiana Jones towards the end but there are enough twists and turns along the way to keep you guessing, although predictability does tend to set in every so often. Ian McShane and Geoffrey Rush put in solid performances as does Penelope Cruz, but it is Depp who steals the show again. We may have seen him 4 times now but I don't think that we will ever get tired of him.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A good change from the previous two sequels...,"I admit, when I first got word that another Pirates movie was in the making, I thought it was just another attempt to make more money off an aging franchise. Honestly, the only really good movie in the series is Black Pearl. Deadman's Chest was OK, but it contained a plot too complex for me to fully understand. At World's End was a disappointment (I fell asleep within the first 30 minutes of it). So the idea of a fourth Pirates didn't appeal to me since the third movie convinced me that the series was due.However, after seeing On Stranger Tides with a group that invited me to come see it with them, I must say that I totally misjudged it. The filmmakers were smart in their choice to cut down the time of the movie and abandon Will and Elizabeth in favor of a storyline centered around our favorite pirate Captain Jack Sparrow. Instead of a continuation of the plot unfolded in the previous two movies, we are presented with an entirely different plot that is much easier to follow and less complex. The acting is good, most notably Johnny Depp who propels the entire movie as Jack. The action sequences, like in previous Pirates movies, are smooth and well choreographed. And we are left with an ending that is satisfying and somewhat humorous (you would have to see it to know what I'm talking about...).Overall, On Stranger Tides was a good way to make up for At World's End and gives us a movie centered around Captain Jack Sparrow, whose character is responsible for the popular interest people have in the series. Definitely go see it, despite what some critics have been saying. It was a breath of fresh air...",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Pirates of the Caribbean:on strange tides,"Let's face it. The Pirates of the Caribbean movies aren't really awful, but they are no longer the ground-breaking spectacle that the original was. So it was with lowered expectations that I watched the latest effort, and I can gladly say that the movie exceeded those low expectations. Damning with faint praise? Yes.This time around, we've lost the characters of Will and Elizabeth, which is a good thing. I don't know about the rest of you, but I was getting tired of the triangle they formed with Jack Sparrow. The two characters were just getting annoying and in the way of Johnny Depp, so when their stories were pretty definitively ended at the conclusion of the third movie, I was happy. Taking Elizabeth's place as the story's heroine is Angelica, daughter of Blackbeard and played by the luminous Penelope Cruz. Like Elizabeth Swan, Angelica can kick butt and take names; the difference is that Cruz is far more convincing in the role than Keira Knightley ever was in her. Cruz's presence gives the franchise a much-needed jolt of fiery Latin temper, to use a clich√© that happens to fit nicely here.As for the character of Will Scarlett, the noble Everyman/blacksmith played by Orlando Bloom, his replacement would probably be the clergyman who finds himself in the service of Blackbeard, trying valiantly to ""save"" him. As the movie progressed, I began to sense that Philip the Good would somehow let slip the bonds of his faith and fall for someone. I knew that someone wouldn't be Angelica the daughter of Blackbeard, and a quick glance at the trailer showed me his eventual target. So, like Scarlett before him, Philip finds love where he never thought he'd find it. Trouble is, that relationship was starkly uninteresting to me. I'm not sure if Sam Claflin, who played the character, or the screenwriters, is to blame, but boy and howdy was that part of the plot a giant bore. If there's a Pirates 5 - and who are we kidding, of course there must be - I hope Philip and his new love don't make an appearance.So what made this one palatable, anyway? You minus the two more wearisome characters from the last one and add a temptress, and you're good to go. Plus you add in Ian McShane as the diabolical Blackbeard, and he's an actual bad guy, unlike Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), who's jumped sides about as often as Jack Sparrow himself - and here begins the movie in the employ of the British King.The stunts are well staged as usual, and good use was made of the location shooting on Oahu and Puerto Rico. Never let it be said that a Pirates movie wasn't fun to look AT. But an added benefit for me was that I watched the movie in 2D, even though it was also available in 3D. Why, you ask? Well, I'm glad you asked, Imaginary Reader. You see, when a movie is shot in 3D, the 3D process absorbs some of the light; therefore, if a movie features scenes in darkened environs - like caves, the ocean blue, underwater, jungles - then it'll be so dark that one will have a lot of trouble seeing what's going on. And for this you'd pay an extra few dollars. Ain't worth it. So if you do see this in 3D, you may want dial this rating down a notch.Overall, the movie - and the franchise - owes quite a bit to Mr. Depp. Yes, he IS Jack Sparrow, and it's impossible to imagine the movie without him. And even though this is his fourth go-round as Sparrow, Johnny Depp's enthusiasm doesn't seem to flag a bit; he sells the character wholeheartedly and joyfully. He is, as usual, a lot of fun to watch.Oh, yes, the plot. Nutshell: Barbossa (with the British), the Spanish, and Blackbeard (with zombies on his crew, of course) are all trying to find the Fountain of Youth. Sparrow had the map, Mr. Gibbs - Sparrow's first mate all these movies - memorized it and burned it, and there you go. And there's a prophecy about a one-legged man, and there are mermaids. It's like Harry Potter without house elves.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

If you are one of those harden intellectuals who considers a movie bad if it wasn't as good as the Dark Knight or some other Christopher Nolan film, then of course you won't like it. Truth be told, I never liked the fact that they ended the series with Pirates 3. It ended sad, unlike Curse of the Black Pearl's romantic, swashbuckling final scene. Pirates 4 brought back that ""Pirates"" ending that the 3rd lacked! As for plot, not as good as the previous movies, but definitely enjoyable. Also, as for it being a series that Disney is using to bring in loads of money, Pirates 4 would have been even bigger and more bloated than Pirates 3 was, and it certainly wasn't!

Of course the famous Jack Sparrow was not so comic as the previous ones but really this is what drove away many viewers, actually this dosage of humor attracts more the female side of the population. So the humor balance was well placed. The plot for me was very nice. The duration of the battles was restricted to the necessary which I liked and disliked in the previous ones which lasted more than necessary. So this left place for acting. The love scenes were the necessary. The pace of the film was steady which was not the case for the previous ones, some scenes in the previous Pirates were too slow. Generally a 9/10.

All Jack and No Story Makes Pirates a Dull Film,"I really hate to say it, but Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides is just boring. While the second and third films were derided for their muddled and overcomplicated plots, this film hardly has enough story to fill a napkin and a serious lack of solid direction. The characters are lifeless and hollow, and even in the midst of action scenes nothing terribly interesting ever happens.The Curse of the Black Pearl is, of course, the best Pirates film to date, but after re-watching all three movies over the past couple of days, I've reaffirmed my opinion that Dead Man's Chest and At World's End are worthy, if flawed, followups to the original. Yes, the latter two films definitely suffered from the fact that they began production without a finished script; Dead Man's Chest tried to do too many different things without taking time to flesh any of them out all the way, and At World's End was left with the impossible task of properly tying up all these disparate plot threads. However, despite these flaws, they were still enjoyable movies from start to finish due to good characters, and great direction by Mr. Gore Verbinski. Verbinksi gave the series a solid direction and a life that this fourth installment is sorely lacking.On Stranger Tides starts out loosely referencing the end of At World's End in which Jack had taken the map to find the legendary Fountain of Youth. We're quickly reintroduced to the only three returning cast members: Jack Sparrow, Barbossa, and Mr. Gibbs; there's some fun stuff in the beginning, but after the Fountain of Youth is introduced as a MacGuffin it quickly devolves into monotony. Part of the problem lies in just the structure of the story this time around, in On Stranger Tides they broke away from the structures of the previous films in order to tell an Indiana Jones-esque adventure film however, the characters and settings of Pirates of the Caribbean do not lend themselves well to that kind of movie. And speaking of characters, with the exception of the returning cast, they are all just completely one- dimensional and uninteresting. Black Beard, who is supposedly ""the pirate all pirates fear"" is particularly bad. It seems like they were trying to go for a villain somewhere between that of a Saturday morning cartoon and a silent psychopath, but in the end it just ended up feeling phoned in. There's also a half-baked side story between two characters seemingly trying to fill the role of Will and Elizabeth's characters from the previous films, but again, the acting is completely cardboard and it isn't effective.As I said, this film is just tragically boring, you can't empathize with the characters, you don't feel compelled to ponder any of the mystery, and even the action sequences aren't enough to make you sit forward in your seats. It's a meandering, poorly directed, boring mess. Disney is apparently planning a fifth and sixth film for the series, and if that's the case, I beg, and I plead: please bring back Gore Verbinski. On Stranger Tides is proof that the heart of the series lies not in the action, the locations, or even Jack Sparrow himself; Verbinski was the heart and soul of Pirates of the Caribbean, and without him the franchise has been left hopelessly adrift.Rating: Zzzzzzzz...",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Pirates- Ahoy, another nice addition but not the best","Pirates 4 was a good movie but not as excellent as the rest. It focused to much on the town adventure rather than the journey. It lacked in excitement, with little dialog to work with, the action wasn't as big and fast paced as the other films. The missing presence of Kiera and Orlando was well noticed , but the new couple helped this but did not fully develop throughout the film as it was open-ended and left audiences wondering what there fate was... Johnny and Penelope did a great job, black beard was an okay villain but lacked a menacing feel compared to Davy Jones.. Overall a nice addition to the franchise but not the best, 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Dip in Quality,"Not nearly of the same quality as the previous trilogy, but still a pretty good film. Slow to begin with, despite immediate sword fights, and you certainly feel the length of this film more than its predecessors. Sparrow's comedy is cut down massively, and the co-leading characters lack a little of the charisma from the first three, whether you liked them or not. But still, a decent storyline, far easier to understand immediately than before, with a decent mix of fantasy and history.It isn't great in comparison, it isn't bad alone.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"My first review of IMDb , regarding the movie Pirated of the Caribbean : On Stranger Tides! There will be no spoilers in this review so don't worry :)","So last night around 1 a.m. me and a couple of friends got the spontaneus idea to go and watch P.O.T.C. 4 (Premiere night). Withing twenty minutes i booked the tickets , we hoped into my car and were on time for the 1:20 a.m. play ! It couldn't have been a better night :)Firstly , if any of you were worried that the fact that Bloom(Will Turner) and Keira Knightley(Elizabeth Swann)not playing would somehow make the movie worse.. then just don't ! The movie was perfect without them ! They were good in the previous three but they just didn't belong in this one and i can guarantee that you won't miss them at all!The cast was well picked and everyone's performance was superb..Also many ""big names"" appear in this movie, but i will mainly talk about Blackbeard (Ian McShane) and Angelica(Penelope Cruz). When i first saw Penelope in the trailer i, for no particular reason got the idea that i will not like her in the movie .. but she totally proved me wrong. She fitted her character perfectly and i couldn't imagine anyone else playing her role. Blackbeard was also ""awesome"". He brings out the "" I am the pirate that all pirates should fear"" kinda vibe with his deadly black humor and beastfull actions ,without falling into the "" I AM SO EVIL HAR HAR "" trap. Really quick here.. i personally loved and couldn't take my eyes of the mermaid and the the little romance embed in the plot (Watch what people say so that you don't fall into wrong conclusions).The movie was also more action packed than the previous movies i believe , with Jack once again showing us how creative , funny and plot twisting he can be by multitasking a thousand things at once !The VFX (Visual effects) were there , taking my breath away every know and then (but mainly because i am into that stuff) but i am pretty sure they will get you jumping on your seat as well !Soundtrack was similar to the previous movies but remade and as always fitted the scenes perfectly , making everyone in the theater wanting to draw their non existing sword :DPlot was OK , nothing complicated( and by that i mean it wasn't Inception... but it also wasn't F&F ) but still had a lot of twists and turns that will make you go AaaaaAaaa!As for the 3D.. it depends on how you think of it. If you are one of those guys that take their glasses off , don't see a big difference and then decide that 3D is awful then got watch it in normal ^^ If like that little difference that only strikes the back of your mind then i guess the 3D was OK-ish.So !!! You liked the previous 3? GO watch it ! You are not a big fan of the series? STILL.. GO WATCH IT ! 9/10 will leave the Theater with a huge smile on their face.. and if they wait till the credits end.. an even bigger smile! (o.O) P.S. The mermaid's beauty will bring tears in your eyes!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Wanted to Buy: Competent Writers,"The Pirates of the Caribbean franchise has always been fluff. After all, what can one expect from movies derived from an amusement park ride? Given that genesis the first two movies were a rather entertaining ride. The over-long sequence of Jack in the bleached out desert from which he must be rescued in the third film served as an extended metaphor for the life that was visibly draining out of the series. Now we are into a ""walking dead"" continuation of Capt. Jack Sparrow's biography as it moves from bang to whimper to bleached skeleton.As a filmed amusement park ride the basic premise of the Pirates films is stringing together fights and chases like (black) pearls on a slim filament of plot. Unfortunately for On Stranger Tides the filament is absent. What we get is a disjunct pile of, to be kind, faux pearls. Each action sequence is brief fun but they all seem to be rolling around independently. First Mate Gibbs is back but only as a creaky plot device. The same is true of the male half of what becomes the couple in love sub-uh-plot that vestigially fills the gap left by the absence of Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley.Rob Marshall's direction isn't much to write home about but it sometimes serves which is far, far more than I can say for the script, that missing filament. It starts out promisingly enough with picking up the teaser from the end of At World's End about the Fountain of Youth and even manages to end on the same theme for the most part. In between though we have hackneyed clich√© after hackneyed clich√© and nothing near as imaginative as the ""fruit kebab"" or water wheel sequences of past films. In the course of this attempt to construct a coherent movie the writers senselessly rip off past literature and movies from The Odyssey to Hans Christian Andersen to Moby Dick and even Splash. I searched in vain for a writer involved in the script who had a single original idea. In fact, even the the 3-D seems tacked on and the Spaniards who open the movie seem like an accidental afterthought.Take, for example, poor Ian McShane's Blackbeard. He appears to have some magical control over his ship through the cutlass he carries at his side. We don't get any explanation even in exposition for this power. Does this power belong to Blackbeard? To the sword? Is it imparted by the ship to is captain? We never know. There's a reference to Blackbeard having been beheaded at some point in the past. It's there in the movie but it's one more loose...ah...pearl rolling around the pitching deck without a filament to make anything coherent of it. And Ian McShane is no Bill Nighy. There's as little energy in his Blackbeard as there is in the script itself.Though the direction is pedestrian - deadly for an amusement park ride - and the script an incoherent mess that doesn't stop the actors from trying to inject some life. Johnny Depp minces around and tries mightily to extract some wit from the not-quite dialogue with which the alleged writers have afflicted him. Geoffrey Rush is a wonderful, delightful, talented actor despite the fact that he's been shamelessly ripping off Robert Newton from the first film in this series onward. Had there been some real point to his presence in this movie I'm sure that he could have delivered the kind of performance that made us so glad he'd returned in for At World's End. Penelope Cruz, besides being beautiful, is also a wonderful actress, just watch her in her films with Pedro Almodovar to confirm my opinion. In this movie she's mostly window dressing and the main attempt to replace Keira Knightley. Ian McShane is the actor for whom I feel both the most and least sympathy. He does what he can with the script pages he's given but I couldn't help wishing that he too had more of a chance to break out of the prison to which the lack of a script condemned him. Then I think that he could have made more of an effort. Perhaps it's McShane's fault but I think he could have done much better.On Stranger Tides is worth the price of a matin√©e on a rainy afternoon. Johnny Depp is fun. Geoffrey Rush is fun too though less so. Penelope Cruz is beautiful and delivers the line which will undoubtedly become the quest and McGuffin for the inevitable fifth film. Still, unless Disney can find a good writer(s) for the next script and an imaginative director, I'll wait for Pirates of the Caribbean: To No Real Purpose to show up on cable before I watch it.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Awesome as always!,"Pirates of the Caribbean on Stranger Tides is the fourth instalment in this franchise and it is definitely as good and entertaining as all previous films.In this one, Jack is trying to get to the fountain of youth with a lot of other peoples including Black Beard played by Ian Mcshane. Then follows the usual awesomeness you would expect from a pirates film!After the poor critics that received Pirates Of The Caribbean at world ends which I thought was really good but maybe the weakest of all four movies, this one had only one way to go and that's up. After 4 years On stranger Tides finally came out and it was fresh and inventive. It went back more to the routes of the first film which is considered to be the best. It was a fun entertaining Summer movie and that's why I think it's an awesome fun movie to watch. I Definitely recommend this one to anyone if you have not seen it yet.I can't wait for the next one(still a few years..)and I think this movie is excellent,definitely check it out! You won't regret!",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Wasn't over hyped about this but it ended up being pretty good,"I wasn't all that excited about another ""Pirates"" movie, having liked the first one but not really remembering it all too well, seeing the second one but not remembering what happens in it at all, and not even seeing number three after the royal slating it got from most.I Have too admit though that I enjoyed number 4. These sort off action movies make a nice change from all the super hero ones we are force fed these days, even if it reeks off self importance, and expects us too cheer in our dozens at all the hundreds off times Johnny Depps ""Jack Sparrow"" is mentioned.I Liked the story too. Which sees Sparrow join forces with a new crew (which is awesome considering I missed the last flick) led but an always great Ian McShane, and a great looking Penelope Cruz. Even Stephen Graham was in there. So I was loving the cast.Film has ships and sword fights so what else would you want from a pirate movie? How about some mermaids? These creatures made the film differ enough from previous efforts even if there could off been more off an effort from Depp (whose now just sailing along in the part off Sparrow) or more action or laughs in the movie. I enjoyed it reasonably enough though. It was a decent sequel really that stands on its own.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"I'm sorry Jack, but I just didn't cared for you this time. Savvy?","The main story strangely revolves around the duel between Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and Blackbeard (Ian McShane) building anticipation for the final stage of their on-going battle. Captain Barbossa, now a one legged man, is sent in the name of King George of England to find the two silver cups which are to be found on Ponce De Leon's ship. On the other hand, Blackbeard wants to reach the Fountain of Youth where he dreams to gain the years of another person or simply put: more life. Surprise or not, there is a ritual and for that ritual he needs the two silver cups and a tear from a mermaid. Yes, there are mermaids in the movie. They also deadly and frustrated I guess. However, Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) gets thrown in this by meeting the one who impersonated him and told the people that he was the real Jack Sparrow, a tricky double. That double is a ""she"" played by the wonderful and gracious Penelope Cruz. Let's not go that far though. She plays Angelica, daughter of Blackbeard. We all get the point after this reveal. Jack Sparrow is condemned to help Blackbeard reach his destination. We also find that Blackbeard's main reason to gain more life is an actual prophecy that fortells his death brought in two weeks by the ""one legged man"". The ""one legged man"" is actually the man he cut his legs off few months before and stole his ship. From this point over the story runs not only predictable (not that it didn't ran before) but also monotone. Along their journey to the Fountain of Youth we get a glimpse of Jack's old friend Gibbs (Kevin McNally), Phillip (Sam Claflin) a young Christian believer, Syrena (Astrid Berges-Frisbey) which is a lovely mermaid and Scrum (Stephen Graham), one of Blackbeard's ""servants"". We get through many fuzzy moments and pretty much boring. There is a big loss of excitement since there's nothing really new that can be said or shown in this franchise and definitely we really lost interest in the story since it's the beginning of a new one and it isn't even half the level of ""The Curse of the Black Pearl's"". We get an washed-up piece of entertainment filled with religious tomato-sauce and atheist pastry. You get the point of that. We get a couple of angry mermaids, we get a love story, we get few clicheic moments and more than anything we get a ""shocking"" ending to this new beginning. Nothing impressive, just the expected. The final act, the final confrontation it's exciting in terms of action but lacks in terms of storytelling and delivery. We also get the Spaniards (another group chasing the two silver cups) being actually smarter than all but ruined it at the end of the movie by doing one of the most stupid things I ever saw on screen. If you ever get what was that stupid thing I'd probably consider sending you 10 bucks. With all that we get that this movie has barely anything to do with Jack Sparrow. He's like a pawn or let's not exaggerate and say that he's more of a Mad-Man on a chess table played by Kings. He didn't really achieved anything in this movie and we didn't get any conclusion about his character's past, present or future...Overall a boring fiasco well-executed that proves that this movie isn't necessarily a bad one but more an irrelevant, unnecessary, predictable, monotone, obvious and lifeless piece of filmmaking. But was it well executed? As far as I remember, I witnessed the most choreographed battle scenes I ever saw in cinema. Seriously, I understand they all need choreography but at least make them feel spontaneous and natural not forced and looking like they were practiced over and over again and the only thing Depp had in mind was to not mess it up. Not to mention because of this choreography, some battle scenes are actually hilarious and unfunny. I heard some ""mehs"" in the theater... Besides that, the 3D was far from being great. A lot of inconsistency and bad contrast, bad depth of field, bad blurred images and so on... It could have been much better.The positive thing about On Stranger Tides is mainly Johnny Depp. Even though he isn't as funny or ridiculous as he was, even though this movie was not centered around him he still did the best he could do with the material he had. Johnny Depp is still Jack Sparrow and he'll forever be Jack Sparrow. I must say something that might enrage some fans out there: with all it's charismatic behavior, Jack Sparrow did not stole the show. No he didn't! Ian McShane as Blackbeard stole the show. His delivery cranked everybody up and he was a fascinating character to watch. He had potential to become a real nemesis of Sparrow's but who knows? Maybe he'll return the way the writers could always find a new curse or a new magical land that does the impossible. All the other roles were played accurately, even Penelope Cruz was enjoyable even if her moments on the screen were short and most of them lacked in sense and good development of her character. I think at times I found the acting too good for this boring story, I found the beautiful shots too much for this pointless flick and definitely found the music too epic for this epicless movie.As a fan of this franchise I declare myself disappointed, not in Jack, not in Blackbeard or Barbossa and not in a new beginning but in execution, bad writing, bad structure and especially in the people responsible for the production of this movie for making a big U-Turn from the first trilogy to this second one. I'm sorry Jack, but I just didn't cared for you this time. Savvy?",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Another one that reboots what seemed to be a dead franchise,"¬®What can I say Gibbs? It's a pirate's life for me. Savvy! ¬®The fourth film of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise has finally arrived and I must say I was pleasantly surprised. I was reminded why I had grown to love Jack Sparrow so much after the previous two sequels had lowered my expectations a bit. I've enjoyed all four movies, although none has topped the original one. The good thing about On Stranger Tides (the title taken from Tim Powers' novel which this film is loosely based on) is that it's the closest and most similar to Gore Verbinski's first film The Curse of the Black Pearl. The following sequels seemed to get more complicated and loose some of the focus of what made the first film so great: the characters. On Stranger Tides goes back to the basics and has a much simpler story reminding us that there is no need to complicate the plot when the truly entertaining thing about these movies are the characters. One may argue that two of the most important characters are missing in this film: Elizabeth Swan and Will Turner, but in my opinion Jack Sparrow and Barbosa are truly the central characters. This film lets us focus entirely on Sparrow and that is fine enough with me, while Barbosa takes an interesting and comical approach in this movie. Screenwriters Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio are back for the fourth time and I'm glad they decided to keep things much simpler and entertaining. This time around the man that was missing was the captain of the original three Pirate movies, Gore Verbinski, who was replaced by Rob Marshall (director of Nine and Chicago). I must admit this is my favorite Rob Marshall film now and the second best in the franchise.Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is back again for another adventure. When his friend Gibbs (Kevin McNally) is about to be hung in London, Jack shows up to rescue him, and in his possession he has the map to the fountain of youth. While in London he hears a rumor that Jack Sparrow is looking for a crew for his new ship. But that can't possibly be true because he is Jack Sparrow and he doesn't even own a ship. It appears a woman from Jack's past is behind this, Angelica (Penelope Cruz), a con-artist who will do anything to get Sparrow to take her and her father, Blackbeard (Ian McShane), to the fountain. Sparrow apparently still has feelings for her, but he doesn't really want to take them, so he is forced on board the Queen Anne's Revenge anyway. The ship is protected by zombies who obey Blackbeard's every command, but that isn't Sparrow's only worry: the waters are infested by dangerous mermaids who lure the sailors into the deep sea to be eaten. Blackbeard is an evil man, as one of his Christian missionary prisoners, Phillip (Sam Claflin) points out to him. Angelica is worried about a prophecy that her father will soon be killed by a one legged man, and that's why she's in such a rush to get to the fountain before anything happens to him. Sparrow has no intention in saving Blackbeard. Barbosa (Geoffrey Rush) is also after the fountain of youth, although he isn't a pirate any more. Now he is working for King George and his men. So the race to the fountain of youth begins with several dangers on its way.This film is character driven, the story really doesn't have to be all that complicated and that is fine with me. It's purely entertaining and fun. Jack Sparrow is his usual self again and I just couldn't get enough of him; he is always great and funny. Out of the four films this is probably the least funniest. I didn't laugh a whole lot like I remember laughing in the other movies, but I still had a great time with the action and adventure. Geoffrey Rush is probably the funniest character in this movie showing a different side of Barbosa. Newcomers Sam Claflin as Phillip and Astrid Berges-Frisbey as Syrena seem to be the next Will and Elizabeth for the franchise, although they didn't get too much screen time. My least favorite character was probably Angelica, I didn't like her character at all. Ian McShane played a decent villain. The best thing about On Stranger Tides is that the film centers on Jack Sparrow and we get to see plenty of him. The action sequences are really well choreographed and the visuals are great. The scenery is also beautiful. Before this film I wasn't so excited about seeing another Pirates movie, but this one left me wanting more. This is not one of those intellectual films, but it is what a summer popcorn movie should be like. It's not perfect at all, but it is entertaining and reminded me a lot of the original.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Poor.,"The worst of the lot in my opinion. Even though they tried to cram as many things as possible into the film, I was completely and utterly bored, leading me to fall asleep at one point.It was like they took all the dull parts from 2 and 3 and mashed them all together to create this film.The script was very poor, Depp was not funny, more irritating. Blackbeard is supposed to be a pirate that all pirates fear, I saw nothing of this, I just saw a man pointing his sword a lot.Another thing that really bugged me, is the fact that pretty much all the fight scenes happened at night. There are probably 3 occasions where this film is set in the daytime which leads to you not being able to see much at all, I just don't see the point.Disney should have called it a day after Curse of the Black Pearl as it has all gone down hill from there. I'm really annoyed that I wasted my money on this film, if this film spawns another trilogy then it will be a sad day, I am sick of money grabbing awful films.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
How many times can you tell the same story?,"Like the Pirate's movies before it, this movie is entertaining feel-good, action packed comedy, but how many times can you tell the same story? While, Captain Jack sparrow still manages to amuse the audience with his dazed intelligence, the story and screen shots lacked freshness and ingenuity. Surely, Mermaids and Blackbeard add new twists, but plot is identical to the first movie. On top of it all, Penelope Cruz and Johnny Depp had next to no chemistry on screen. The days of the movie ""Blow"" are behind them, its too bad. The 3D is more of a headache than an entertainment. The lighting of the movie is dim and smoky, and through the 3D glasses there are moments the audience sees very little. It is time to quit making these movies before they lose their appeal entirely.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Exactly like the tour! Unfortunately, it's a movie! (Screen)","As I went recently to Disneyland with my nephews, we took the tour and this movie is the same: dark, misty, with filthy pirates, great for the eyes but lacking of a story.This was actually my first Pirates movie i saw (and the last, i think) and was taken aback at the start with the characters. They seem to know each other but nothing is explained.The coming of Penelope is a waste because she does nothing here except walking. If she was so pregnant, why cast her? The story of the youth fountain is a rip-off from the ""Last Crusade"".The character of Deep doesn't make me laugh. The only funny moment was with the swinging ship and it's not enough.I even slept between the escape from London and the attack of the mermaid: what's the fun of being in the hold of a ship by night?

The Last Crusade,"I think it's fitting to start with the fact that this plot was stolen from ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade."" For that alone this movie starts with a deficit.Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), at the strong arm insistence of Black Beard (Ian McShane), was out to find the fountain of youth. They only needed two chalices from Ponce DeLeon, the tear of a mermaid, and water from the fountain to complete the ritual. There must be two drinkers: one who drinks to gain all of the years of the other drinker.Like always this is an adventurous tale with fighting, love, and trickery. In this case a religious man played a significant role which seemed totally useless except to peddle religion upon the hapless viewer. They could've used anyone to fall in love with the beautiful mermaid.""On Stranger Tides"" didn't move the needle.

"Horrible with no Will Turner, Elizabeth, or a proper villain","Don't know where they got off making a cheap lame movie like this, but all the characters suck. Jack just looks like he's doing the same stuff from the first movie but more cheaply. Not to mention that what he does in this movie, is really not even cool. The stunts seemed lamer and his whole character is just poorly done. And even if, you can't focus a whole plot just around Jack, that's just STUPID.And I know this counts as critique for the previous movie, the third one (At World's End)...but no Norrington or Governor Swann is really not the same movie. I never really liked Beckett's character too. So all that from the third and second movie screwed up this one. Leaving you with just a Jack Sparrow who doesn't even look like he's into the movie acting-wise. No Elizabeth? No Will? Sure the ending of the third one made it so you couldn't have more Will, but if it's saying the third one's ending sucks then so be it. Will should be in EVERY Pirates movie. Same with his little bonnie lass.Overall this movie is annoying with Penelope Cruz, a highly unfit character for any big movie, she should just stay in the cheap Loreal commercials. Don't know how she got to be big. This director must be a real idiot. Blackbeard is lame too, the whole mermaid siren thing is kind of cool but just wasn't fun enough to sustain a plot. Blackbeard looked and functioned like a two year old's pirate character, like Captain Hook from Peter Pan or something (no offense to people who like Peter Pan). Where's the cool people like Bosun? Raggetti? Black Beard was annoying, boring, and HORRIBLE to watch on screen...nothing but a big embarrassment. The whole ""my father is mean"" Blackbeard plot is redundant and not Pirates material. Not to mention it's a cheap ripoff of other movies too.You can't just bring Gibbs in, because honestly even Gibbs seemed off. The other members of the Black Pearl can't be just tagging along for the ride as well. I don't remember if Tia Dalma was in it. But everyone lacked the Pirates charm.0/10",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It is a pirate's life for me,"Once again, we are treated to the further adventures of Capt. Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) as he attempts to recover The Black Pearl.I will not go into too much detail because most of the fun of the movie is the surprise twists and turns. Suffice it to say that there are many subplots. Some of these plots include ""The Fountain of Youth,"" and the prophecy of a one-legged man.The film moves fast and there is not a wasted moment or word as everything gets wrapped up neatly. Well, some things may be better solved in the next installment.For me, much of the fun of the movie was actually the cameos. I will always think of King George as looking like Richard Griffiths of Harry Potter fame. More surprising than that I could not believe it when who should appear out of nowhere but Judi Dench. It brought back memories of her performance in a ""Midsummer Night's Dream"".Overall, you will not be disappointed if everything that you look for in the Pirates of Caribbean series is in this film and if nothing else is more exaggerated.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
the fourth time no charm,"The main character is there, a couple of his old buddies and even the monkey, ""hate the monkey"", are there, but the charm, the wit, the tongue-in-cheek jokes and playfulness of the previous three movies are all gone. If the rum was gone by the end of the third movie, this installment is a hangover. I love all three previous movies, and I recommend all PoC fans to watch extra features on the DVD, there are interviews with the director and artists and actors, one really gets to know and appreciate how much talent went into making the series. Not the fourth movie, though.The charm is gone. Everything is gone. I got bored after the first 5 minutes and remained bored until the end. There is no logic in haphazard fights, there is no rhythm, no humor. ""Between your sister and the dog I choose the dog"" - this passes for a joke here, the better one at that. The movie alternates between fake sentimentality and vulgarity, even Hans Zimmer's music seems too loud and pretentious. It's almost as if he tries to hang on to the main pirate theme too much because there is no development there, no breathing space for music because the plot goes nowhere. If only Rob Marshall had at least a sliver of the creative talent of Gore Verbinski. The material is fantastic, there is Blackbeard, the Spanish, the mermaids - and yet nothing works. What a shame. We watched it in 2D, and it became obvious that some of the scenes were made to look go-o-geous in 3D. They probably did for those watching this disaster in 3D, but a few 3D tricks cannot make a movie.There is a handful of scenes which reminded us of what this movies could have been in more capable hands. Keith Richards has a few lines in the beginning, his acting career seems to be picking up :), the scene with the king is funny, and the last few minutes of the movie (with the monkey in the bottle) have the tempo and the feel of the real Pirates of the Caribbean. I mean the first three. This one is a fake.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

DBOX 3D Review: Bigger doesn't exactly mean better,"** out of (****)Keeping my head held high, walking in with my $22.75 ticket to where my derriere would be seated D-box style, and my eyes wide open in every dimension, I thought, how could I possibly be disappointed with such an experience? Too bad it wasn't the experience that sucked. It was the movie. Now don't get me wrong, I enjoy my case of pure action fluff, but when it's done to the point where it's fun and engaging. This wasn't. Any fun or intrigue that the franchise once had has been drained, and the results reflect on that. The story is non- existent, the performances are nothing special, and the film's running time is lengthy, feeling bloated and excessive. Remember, bigger and louer doesn't always mean prouder.First, let's start with the story. Well, there isn't one much to begin with. The Pirates are basically on search for the Fountain of Youth. And yes folks, that is seriously it. You'll have the occasional pratfalls and drawn-out fight sequences, but for the most part, that's it. And do they find it? I think you can figure that one out. I just don't get it. After three movies, that is the best story they can come up with? Why not embark on something more fascinating, or have a few twists here and there. Instead, it's just a rehash of the films, and not exactly the best one either.The performers? Everyone's pretty much the same. Johnny Depp plays the eccentric, occasionally irritable protagonist, while Penelope Cruz is the snappy love interest, who bats her eyes and looks pretty. Geoffery Rush is well... Geoffery Rush.What about the eye candy? Action is action. I don't care if you have a character doing ninety backflips in a row. It's just staged material that tries to be as slick and stylistic as possible, but comes across as middle-of-the-road and tiresome. And the scenery, it is nice to look at, and for sitting through all the credits, and even being a skilled observer, this does look like an expensive movie. However, there's nothing new to look at. Actually, I think the earlier films had a more sleek design.Now the common question everyone has, the 3D. In all honesty, I personally think it was useless. Yes, you have the typical ""gotcha"" moments, but there was no sense of depth. I think it was just such a waste to use perfectly good cameras on the tired third dimension. 3D just did not work with this movie.DBOX. After 3D and IMAX, this is allegedly the new theatrical format. I must say, it doesn't disappoint seeing as how the chair is in sync with the audio (it vibrates, moves side to side, or ascends or descends the viewer), however, there's always room for improvement. Still, I wasn't exactly the happiest camper paying $22.75 for a bloated picture that went nowhere, a tried 3D format, and seats that while good, still leave a lot to be desired.Boom. Boom. Boom. And... it's in 3D. If that gets your heart racing, then by all beans see this movie. Actually DBOX it. Then you'll be ""in the movie"". I'm sorry, I'm all for enhancements in technology, but when the story and acting is sacrificed, the whole movie suffers. I hope this seriously is the last installment. The series is just getting more and more tired with each progression.On a side note: The after-credits sequence is a disappointing one. I sat through and watched all the credits and waited for a nearly one minute scene that was rather unnecessary and completely useless.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Weirdly disconnected; depressingly dull,"I hadn't seen this one since the theatres, and it's no surprise why I'd forgotten 95% of the film. It's... fine.I think there's a lot of neat concepts here that were really good ideas at the time. It's just that the scenes feel undercooked. The plot points are serviceable, but the dialogue needs spicing up; the flair of the Verbinski films is barely there - both the convoluted stories and the creepy distinctive worldbuilding.One of the highlights of the trilogy was the recurring side characters. Even if they didn't have their own subplots, it was nice to have some consistency. Instead we're left with just three characters (four if you count the monkey) that we know. And that's fine, if the new ones were memorable in any way. To be fair, Blackbeard himself is pretty fun, but it does feel like Ian McShane-lite after seeing Deadwood.The high production quality is still there at least. There's no dated CGI, and the sets are quite impressive. A few towards the start are especially complex, and quite promising at the time.Jack Sparrow fortunately was less dopey than I remember. There are a few scenes that really stretch believability, even in the world of Pirate-physics, but there are a few scenes that still suggest he really is quite intelligent underneath it all.The soundtrack is the first in the series to disappoint me. It really feels like Zimmer phoned in this one. He reuses themes that were associated with in-world aspects in the original trilogy that just aren't in this film, and it comes off as lazy to me.He does introduce more strings into the soundtrack, to give it that Spanish touch, but it's just not enough.And Spain is actually an important thing in the franchise finally, but again they're undercooked and serve as basic plot-points, nothing more. I want to see Spanish ships in combat!So I'm left pretty underwhelmed by this fourth entry. The world feels stale, and lifeless without the quasi-mythology that the second and third films set up pretty well. The fountain of youth could have been a lot more interesting, and beautiful monster-women that lure sailors are 2800 years out of style.It's a shame, as I do really like those first three films a lot. They're ridiculous and get a lot of flak, but at least they're visually interesting and fully commit to themselves.On Stranger Tides fails to live up to the title, and the films that came before.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Better PotC Movie Than Most People Will Give It Credit For,"When a film franchise has made as much cash as Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean, you know it'll take more than the end of a trilogy to put it to rest. I guess I always sort of knew another movie would make its way to theaters, but I admit I was still surprised when Disney announced a brand new sequel four years after the complicated conclusion of AT WORLD'S END. Well, when a new movie is inevitable, all we can do is hope they fix the mistakes of the first few movies without making rather than just horribly botching what was once an entertaining, if overly complex, series. Captain Jack Sparrow returns to continue the journey hinted about at the end of the last film: the search for the Fountain of Youth. After narrowly escaping arrest in London, Sparrow learns that there is an imposter posing as him in an effort to scrounge up a crew. His investigations land him enslaved on the Queen Anne's Revenge as part of Blackbeard's crew. The infamous pirate and his first mate Angelica (his daughter and one-time lover to Captain Jack) are in search of the Fountain of Youth before a prophecy can be realized: it has been foreseen that a one-legged man will kill Blackbeard. That one-legged man is none other than Captain Hector Barbossa; no longer a pirate, Barbossa sails for England as a privateer. The race is on as Blackbeard, the English, and the Spanish hope to be the first to the Fountain.To start, I can't be the only one who doesn't think this isn't the worst film in the series. In fact, I actually really liked it. It's definitely better than AT WORLD'S END, and I'd say it's at least as good as CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL. I enjoy this film because it doesn't over-extend itself with a multitude of story lines, dozens of supporting characters, or overzealous special effects. This movie feels more like a straightforward pirate adventure film. It does maintain a handful of supernatural aspects, but you expect a couple bits of mysticism in a good pirate movie. Whereas the first three movies always felt as if there was way too much going on, the story here is simple: a race to the Fountain. I admit it's a little sad to have a PotC movie without the Black Pearl and her crew, but the movie hints that we should be seeing her again in any future sequels (which I suppose are guaranteed with the roughly $1 billion worldwide box office this film pulled in). The movie is a lot of fun, with enough action scattered throughout to keep the adventurous pace. For whatever reason, I actually didn't care for the film when I first saw it in theaters (the wasted 3D didn't help the matter). I realized it's because I went in expecting another bloated, colorful PotC that I've grown accustomed to, and ON STRANGER TIDES breaks from that mold with a simplified, darker pirate adventure tale. I've since come to find the fourth movie as one of my favorites.You know what I really loved about this movie? No Kiera Knightley and no Orlando Bloom. Good riddance. Their characters, Elizabeth Swann and Will Turner, are primarily responsible for what is wrong with the first three movies, in my opinion. Those fact that these two incredibly boring individuals were such pivotal roles dragged the series down. But now they're gone! Thank God for the Flying Dutchman. Not only did they do away with the two weakest characters, but they brought back one of my favorites (Barbossa). Next to Captain Jack, Barbossa is the greatest part of the series (probably because he less goofy and more¬Ö.uhm¬Öpirate than Sparrow). Ian McShane makes an even better villain as Blackbeard. If you've ever seen HBO's ""Deadwood"", you know McShane can do stone-cold. Give him a cutlass and a supernatural pirate galleon and you've got yourself an awesome baddie. Penelope Cruz is Blackbeard's daughter Angelica. She's infinitely hotter than Elizabeth Swann ever was, plus she's got a fiery personality that Knightley could've only dreamt of in her time with PotC. The movie misfires a bit by giving a preacher and the mermaid he loves a little more screen time than necessary, but it only slows the story down minimally. I really don't know why more people enjoy this movie for what it is. Kudos to screenwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio who've been with this franchise from the beginning and took a chance to change up the routine we've all grown so used to. At this rate, I'd probably support a fifth installment if Johnny Depp is up for another round as Captain Jack Sparrow.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Very Enjoyable,"There has been a lot of hate for the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise ever since they released Dead Man's Chest. I personally love every Pirates of the Caribbean movie EXCEPT for No. 5: Dead Men Tell No Tales. The reason this is an 8/10 is because it's slightly less enjoyable than the previous 2 but still AMAZING! The other reason is because I'm not too impressed with what they did with Barbossa but it's fine! And I'm not removing a star because of no Will or Elizabeth, because we needed a change of scenery and characters, and you get the reason why they're not in it. This unprepared sequel is worth the watch!",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Surprisingly good - although focus was on wrong characters,"I was surprised when I realized I was actually enjoying this movie - the latest installment of the Pirates movies. I am a fan of the first film but found that the following two did not quite add up to the sheer genius that was the first one. So I wasn't sure I would like 'On Stranger Tides' either. Also, I thought I would miss the characters of Will and Elizabeth. I didn't, as it were.Instead I found I was far more intrigued by some of the new characters. Philip the cleric (played by Sam Claflin), mermaid Syrena (Astrid Berges-Frisbey), Scrum (Stephen Graham) and Ian McShane's Blackbeard were all interesting characters. Ian McShane had the most fleshed out character obviously, being the antagonist of the story. Stephen Graham (Scrum) filled his role of comic relief well. I was however very disappointed that Sam Claflin and Astrid Berges-Frisbey weren't given more screen time.I found the love story between Philip and Syrena very interesting. Yes, I realize they were there solely to fill up the void of Will and Elizabeth and to add a little romance to the plot for all the pining ladies and teenage girls at home. BUT it worked! (Apparently I too am a sucker for love stories - who'd a thunk?!) Anyway, by the end of the movie I found myself more invested in Philip and Syrena's storyline and fate than any other character in the movie - even Jack Sparrow's!I wished their characters would have had more impact on the story. I personally could see several directions where they could have taken the character of Philip; him as a captive, as a missionary and as a ways of redemption for the pirates. It was a pity the Philip/Syrena storyline was so short and ended so abruptly. I sincerely hope they bring back Sam Claflin and Astrid Berges-Frisbey's characters for the fifth installment and give the actors more to do.Furthermore, the film in itself has everything that makes for a good movie. Action, adventure, good acting (from most), beautiful photography etc. And Johnny Depp was fantastic as Jack Sparrow - as always. You all know why so enough said about him.Dislikes: Two words. Pen√©lope Cruz. First, woman can't act. Second, most pointless character ever! So what, Angelica's reasons for doing what she did were that simple?! Come on! The writers could've done way better than that. And the suggested sexual tension between Angelica and Jack Sparrow just wasn't there.To finish off, I really missed some of the old characters. Ragetti and Pintel for example. And Gibbs should've gotten more screen time.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A script so bad that it made Jack Sparrow boring...,"Much like the 'Survivor' series, Jerry Bruckheimer just doesn't know when to call it quits with his projects. 'At World's End' is without a doubt one of the worst third installments I've ever seen. One would figure he would stop there. But why? Two of these pirate films are within the top 10 highest grossing pictures of all time. And that's what making movies is all about right?....making money? Well, with two of your main supporting actors gone, (Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly), you obviously need to introduce NEW characters for Jack Sparrow to pinball around with on screen. Enter Penelope Cruz.....who i kid you not, contains more wood in her character than Keira Knightly. And no, that was not a sexual reference. I actually dreaded every scene she was in. She could have died halfway through the movie and i would not have cared. And the character who i guess is suppose to replace Orlando Bloom, was even more boring. He had absolutely zero stage presence. He looked more like an extra that they decided to make one of the leads at the last second.But i do not blame these actors......i blame the terrible writing. Because there is no depth to any of these characters. I remember the first pirates' film, and how fun it was to watch, and how entertaining these characters were. Now it's just a bunch of non sense. Dare i say that the writing is so bad that even Jack Sparrow was boring? Yes, i will say that because it's true. Just because you have him swing from a chandelier, doesn't mean it's the same Jack Sparrow. Where were his funny little comments? His quirky/confident sense of humor? My guess is that it sunk somewhere within the third installment. If you're reading this and shaking your head saying 'That can't be true'.....yes, it is. I didn't think it was possible either.And speaking of nonsense, the storyline. For starters, the bad guy is a man named 'Blackbeard'. Who has the ability to control stuff with the wave of his hand. Much like a jedi. But what separates him from being a jedi is......in Star Wars, they actually explained how they were able to move stuff. Whereas in this movie, they just did it because it looked cool and didn't even care to explain how he's able to do these things. That's just one example from the laundry list of loose plot outlines this film has.Bottom Line.....good lord this was boring. This series has gone from ""Can't wait to see the next one"", to ""Oh, they're making another one"", to now ""Ah, who cares"". But knowing Jerry Bruckheimer, this probably won't be the end. And that makes me sad......what a waste of 250 million.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Weakest POTC Yet,"Depp and McShane are always entertaining, but this movie isn't even close. Cruz is like Puss In Boots from ""Shrek"" in human female form. Keith Richard is ridiculous, as usual. This might be about two hours but feels like two years. Rush is possibly the best thing in the movie, but he's really underused. The plot concerns the Fountain of Youth and somehow all these characters chase each other around with occasional sword fight to relieve the tedium. The battles are well staged, but the story is incoherent and silly. Depp gives his usual performance, giving more to the role than it deserves, the same is true for Rush and McShane, Cruz is blah. Worst one yet, but surely there's another coming along.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
On Stranger Tides: Back to being about Pirates,"This film is as good as the Original ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl"" - I never liked the story arc that followed Curse of the Black Pearl, it was about everything but Pirates. Sea Goddesses, Flying Dutchman (With the wrong Captain, Davey Jones was not captain of the Flying Dutchman, Vandervecken was), the three original Pirates films were the story of Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann- Curse of the Black Pearl was complete in itself, I always thought by adding all these sequels, they were stretching for a story. It was all too much, too fantastic, and not wholly as enjoyable as the first adventure.Not so here: This 4th installment of Pirates of the Caribbean, brings the focus back to a Pure Pirate Adventure, and with the departure of Swann and Turner ""At Worlds End"", Ted Elliott & Terry Rossio were free to tell further stories about Captain Jack Sparrow, with the help of novelist Tim Powers, Disney actually purchased the rights to his book and worked with him, as opposed to James Cameron's outright theft of Poul Anderson's 1957 Hugo award winning short story ""Call Me Joe"" (Which became Avatar). This merger of a 20-year old novel and new characters from the franchise, and the acknowledgment thereof, makes me hope for Hollywood Writer/Directors who would borrow plots and characters from well known books and try to get away with it ""scott free"".The threads from the Novel meld into the already laid out story of Jack Sparrow, which we have been hearing since the first film in the franchise- Kevin R McNally, as ""Gibbs"" has been Keeper of Jack Sparrow's Continuity since the first film.This film injects a new villain into the Pirates Universe: Blackbeard, as played by the great character actor Ian McShane. McShane epitomizes all of the portrayals of Blackbeard and other evil pirates in pirate movies back to Basil Rathbone in ""Captain Blood"".Geoffrey Rush once again plays Barbossa, who is ""Not a Pirate"", well, at first, in this story. Along with McShane as Blackbeard, Penelope Cruz is ""Angelica"" - Apparently ""Blackbeard's Daughter"". Or is she? The characters of Jack Sparrow, Barbossa, Angelica are all wonderfully duplicitous, not being ""evil"" or ""good"" characters, they are more like real people, who have both bad and good aspects. And so, the relationships between Jack and Barbossa, and Jack and Angelica leave you asking ""Who is fooling who here""? And in reality, we are the ones being fooled, by the convoluted plot which Elliott & Rossio have woven into the fabric of the original Powers' novel.With the absence of Elizabeth Swann and Will Turner, This film focuses more on Jack's actual romance with Angelica, and there is also a side-romance which develops between the characters of Man of Faith ""Philip"" (Sam Claflin) and a mermaid named ""Syrena"" (Spanish Actress Astrid Berges-Frisbey) - The resolution of which is difficult to understand, unless you pay attention to the sailors small-talk and speculations regarding the nature of Mermaids in this story.Look for Cameos from Dame Judy Dench, Richard Griffiths and another appearance of ""Captain Teague"" (Kieth Richards). Stephen Graham (Band of Brothers, Snatch, Gangs of New York) is the Mandolin-playing Scrumm, another duplicitous character. The ""First Mermaid"" is played by Gemma Ward, the Mermaids are all Fashion Models - From the waist up.Barbossa has developed a ""hobby"" of collecting Poison Frogs - There is a reason for every apparently idle scene in this film.This film is back to the basics of what made ""Curse of the Black Pearl"" so good - It is a fresh story, less dependent on special effects and more on character interaction. The introduction of new Director to the Franchise, Rob Marshall, did not significantly alter the way the story was told- This is a story about Jack Sparrow, and all of the things that endeared that character to us from the first three films, are all here in ""quadruplicate"". Marshall's direction was less over-the-top than Verbinski's. But the best quality of this film is the usage of Hans Zimmerman's Score, including the ""Pirate Theme"" - Which was first used in the movie ""Gladiator"", all of the musical queues from the first three films are here, plus new cues with Spanish flavour which add a lot to the atmosphere of the film. This is a film of extremely high quality, as is the case with anything Jerry Bruckheimer produces.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
just wrap the film into the popcorn basket and leave it,"This film like all other films these days has the same things that people are addicted to watching.Some adventure which is not quite an adventure and some Blondie's's private parts.In this case it is Penelope Cruz who was not at all required in the film.Ian Mc Shane also was not quite required in the film.All the stunts were very ordinary stunts.The script was revolving round and round.The camera was pointing to Cruz's CLEAVAGE right from the first shot.script-0;direction-5,cinematography-no need ....The film as is believed is inspired from a DIsneyland ride.There are times when the film does get a grip on you but then some stupid stunts take away the pleasure of it.The director desperately tries to keep the Depp-Cruz chemistry alive repeatedly by separating them and bringing them back again.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Terrific Theme Park Ride,"It still amazes me that all of this came out of a theme park ride. That said, the action should be like a roller coaster and this didn't not always happen in the first three films. In the words of Steve Urkle, fret not my pet. Such is not the case here.Johnny Depp finally displayed a sense of knowing he's a bada-- as Captain Jack Sparrow. He always came off a bit too aloof in the previous films, but here he is in fine form with attitude, swagger, and a glint in his eye that belies his tomfoolery. He knows what he's doing even when it doesn't look like he knows what he's doing, and he knows it.Penelope Cruz has rarely shown me anything interesting, even in her serious roles. She has a few pouty scenes here, but action seems to suit her well. There is nothing she does that strikes me as fake or hard to believe. I can be sucked into this world and believe for two hours she is the character doing all of these things, not an actor who gets replaced by a stunt-woman from time to time. She's charming, deadly, and then charming again. A true daughter of Blackbeard and worthy adversary for our beloved captain.Geoffrey Rush is always awesome. If he did it, he's good. 'Nuff said.Ian McShane is getting some bad raps. Apparently some people don't find him mean enough or evil enough. Perhaps they want a drunk man stumbling around firing a gun in randoms directions. What they have missed is the perfectly understated, confident captain of all that is evil. Not only does McShane nail Blackbeard, he comes across so disarming that by the time you realize how evil he is and that you are about to die it is too late. Undoubtedly the performance of the movie. He rarely loses his temper, always thinks of himself first, and is in complete control of the situation at all times. Oh yeah, and don't look at him cross-eyed or he'll kill you. Perfect.The story itself is exactly what you want from a summer blockbuster. It is a great popcorn flick with some meaningful moments and dialog mixed in for those who actually pay attention to words in a swashbuckling film. There is a clear first act, second act, and third act, and they progress in a linear path that leads to X rather than a dramedic complicating action, reaction to complicating action, and resolution of complicating action. The only drawback, and thus the reason for 8 stars instead of 10, is the presence of some stunts that are outside the realm of human, rational possibility. Kind of like Indian Jones and the Refirigerator of Steel. Well, anything in that Indy flick, actually. That said, for the most part it is wonderfully free of CGI and filled with lush scenery and an amazing take on the beauty of mermaids. Rob Marshall does not disappoint.There are some difficult scenes for children in this one. Make sure you see it first before letting your pre-teens take in some of this violent death and destruction.I believe this film will satisfy your taste-buds as you wait for the progression of the summer blockbusters of Transformers, some dude named Harry, and that guy with the bullseye on his shield.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
On and on it goes.....,"A really uninspired movie for me. It's starts with a really murky opening, the part in London is very low brow and infantile. You have to give the film some praise for its stunts but it's not in service of a story you can believe in. The film tries to set him up yet again as a great laddies man without ever showing us why that is the case. More seriously it doesn't build any proper human relationships for him in the movie. The violence is mostly bloodles, the story mindless and one of the worst things is the lack of resolution, things may conclude but always in a way leaving the door open it could all flip. There's also a Romeo and Juliet like love story, which again wasn't very original but at least was an attempt to have some real human feeling in it.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Shouldn't have been made.,"I give this movie 2 stars, one for the interesting spin they had with the Mermaids and that arch and the death of the villain. That's it! Other than that, this movie completely discarded all of the wonderful and nostalgic elements of the previous 3 movies and became something that did not work at all. It didn't bring back the most likable characters and Jack Sparrow isn't that funny anymore, since you know he'll survive everything. In the previous movies you weren't entirely sure he lived at many points! I'm not interested in the plot at all compared to the first 3, which actually felt like a coherent and collective story (briefly connecting this movie to the end of the third one doesn't really count since it's just under a minute of movie material). And forget about the movie after this, didn't even get through that one! The should've ended it at 3 and it would've been the perfect trilogy!",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

And of course they have skeletons and Zombie type of people but they just have a lot of scares on the face. This was not too scary for me(I get scared easy). The mermaids could be a little scary to kids with vampire like fangs. This was a fun movie to watch and not to scary. They film part in England and most of it in Hawaii.

The best outing,I watched the movie today in 3D. There are moments of magic in the movie that simply take your breath away. Was the 3d worth it and good- answer is yes...there are many scenes in which the effects are enhanced by use of 3D technology.Geoffrey rush(barbosa) is superb as usual. Johnny Depp is his usual quirky self and Jack sparrow rocks. Penelope adds some freshness and feminity to the franchise(though I hear that she was pregnant while the movie was being filmed). There are many sub plots and little love stories within the main storyline which keep us interested.I cannot understand why the critics and other pedestrian review sites(RT) are giving the movie a mauling and ? were they paid or were they in love with skinny lizzy or orlando blooper,9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Empty soulless calories,"The 2 parter was done, and now it was time to make more pirates movies, or was it? On Stranger Tides is one of the most soulless attempts at continuing a franchise I have ever seen. The magic and enthusiasm from the prior movies are completely done and we are left with a shallow and theme park ride feeling movie where the plot means noting and it¬¥s all about going from thrill to thrill in form of action scenes. While there is fun to be have it actually hurts my mind that this failed so miserably. There is endless potential with this franchise. Insert random old legend, cue funny pirates and bam, you have a safe movie. Pirates' potential was endless until this movie proved it wrong.Captain Jack Sparrow has given up on finding the fountain of youth, until and old flame, Angelica, weaves him back in. She is, to Jacks surprise and unfortune, the daughter of the legendary pirate Black Beard.One part that really makes this movie become just soulless is the acting. So many actors that gave it their all-in previous films just barely scratch the overacting and over the top itch you need from this franchise. Sparrow and Barbossa are barely recognizable, and their performances are sleep-inducing here. The new characters and plots are barely given time to flourish and for us to care about them. This is an action first then story movie and it really shows. You can do that when you have a full cast of characters, we are familiar with, but there is barely anyone left from the old cast, so the new needs time this movie is not giving them.As mentioned, there are still things to like and enjoy here, it¬¥s not all completely without reason. The humor is pretty good actually and I found myself laughing at so many jokes and scenarios. This movie would have floored me had the delivery not been so flat and unlively. I think if Jack Sparrow had the same energy as in previous films, I would have loved this movie a bit more.The plot and plotlines here are not really important to the movie. This movie uses nearly half an hour in the beginning just making fun action scenes instead of actually making me invested in the world and plot. There is only told 2 things; we are looking for the fountain of youth and someone is saying they are Jack Sparrow at an in. This is half and hour of a two-and-a-half-hour movie and it doesn't get much better. The movie is bloated and too long for what it is and what it gives us. It¬¥s fun because the premise lends itself to fun and exciting adventure but the movie has no idea how to utilize this. The movie also really wants us to care about side characters and plots. I kept forgetting some characters existed until the movie kept cutting back to them.This movie betrays the character of Jack Sparrow in my opinion. The same could be said about Barbossa but he made just a bit more sense to me. The way they made Jack care about anyone besides himself is hilariously poorly written and the movie even has a hard time making it sound believable. Of course, Jack likes his friends and has made sacrifices, but he is first and foremost a guy looking out for number one, himself. Here he is smitten by a girl we barely know anything about and has to believe what Jack did to her was worse than anything he has done to any other woman. It just doesn't make sense and the movie really struggles to justify it in the script.The score is pretty good as always. Returning scores are good but the original score is also memorable, action pact and scary at times.I would also say, even though I feel like they drag on a bit too long for the most part and has some really questionable endings at times as the lighthouse blowing up, the action scenes are fun. They lean on the action bloating I always complain about when it comes to action movies. Either the action is going on for so long your adrenaline doesn't care anymore or you don't space out your scenes so your pulse can¬¥t take a break. I think the movie balances this fine in terms of spacing, but the length of scenes are felt. They are still fun and there are some creative and memorable ideas such as the chase in London and the wrecked ship.This movie just left me mostly frustrated and without any emotions for the story the movie wanted me to care about. The superficial stuff is fine enough such as the action and humor, but that is the empty calories, the actual calories aren't really here and when they are here they are delivered in the most dull and soulless way.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Swashbuckling.... again!,"The Spanish galleons, Captain Barbossa leading a British vessel and the nefarious Blackbeard aboard 'The Queen Anne's Revenge', are on a quest to discover the mythical fountain of youth that holds the most desirable power. But one man is not too keen on obtaining such powers. He would rather face danger everyday and sneak life out of death's grip. With his mascara, beaded hair, trinket filled ragged attire and a worthy hat, Captain Jack Sparrow unfolds yet another adventure at high seas involving his female counterpart, a religious prisoner, the one-legged Barbossa, infamous Blackbeard who returned from the dead and those unearthly mermaids. 'On Stranger Tides' is by no means a revival of the series but it is still the same swashbuckling fun that you have aboard the journey that involves everyone's favorite Pirate.Director Rob Marshall ('Chicago', 'Nine') takes the reigns from Gore Verbinski but one fails to notice any disparity in their styles of Pirate faire. As Jack Sparrow escapes imprisonment in London, he is however, unable to secure a ship and a crew that can set sail to freedom. That changes when he meets the ravishing Angelica (Penelope Cruz). He soon finds himself on-board Blackbeard's ship which is in pursuit of the Fountain of Youth. The challenges around the ceremonious drinking from the fountain involves two chalices, a teardrop from a mermaid and getting there before the Spaniards and Barbossa do.Jack Sparrow is incomplete without his missing Black Pearl aboard which he commands a strangely buffoonish crew. Here, he is a reckless but glamorous guide without a plan as he jumps over cliffs, exploding lighthouses, sways over coconut trees and escapes certain death in all cases. The crew's encounter with the Mermaids in dark waters is perhaps the movie's highlight. Gorgeous looking mermaids conceal a vicious side but the determined Blackbeard does find a victim for a tear. Philip's tender love with Syrena, the captured Mermaid is strictly within limits in terms of length and digression from Captain Jack's adventures. The climax doesn't add any twist and is atypical of how Verbinski would end such adventures.Nevertheless, Rob Marshall doesn't do much wrong. People can grow tired of any series that continue through the years but this one has Johnny Depp. He lets go of his forgettable self as a 'Tourist' and gets into more comfortable shoes so easily. Jack Sparrow is an iconic character and Johnny Depp is now hardly more than this character. One can get tired of sequels but not with Jack Sparrow in them. This ship can sail on for much longer with him at the stern.When the cast is dominated in such a manner by Johnny Depp, there isn't much of a lasting impression the others can leave behind but Penelope Cruz is a much better Pirate than Keira Knightley could ever be and without Orlando Bloom, there isn't much to miss unless he's an elf. Ian McShane as Blackbeard looks nefarious but nothing like Davy Jones' presence while Geoffrey Rush again, as Barbossa is competent. Hans Zimmer's score still resonates the precarious adventurous spirit at high seas and the cinematography even with most sequences being in the dark is captivating.Frankly, Rob Marshall could not have done much more and Disney should be content with this year's biggest opening recorded by this installment of the Pirates on Stranger tides. If you prefer a convoluted plot with mystery, deep characters, intense emotions, memorable dialogues and epic story telling, then you cannot have the nonsensical Jack Sparrow in the middle of it all. He would be lost in his delusional state that he often tends to be in. For now, sail these stranger tides and aye! Don't be bringin those bottles o' Rum wid you...8.040 on a scale of 1-10.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"The Worst So Far, I Think","POTC4 isn't really apart of the POTC saga. It seems like a spin off. It should have been called The Jack Sparrow Chronicles Part 1: On Stranger Tides. It really has no relation to the series.One thing I'd like to mention is that this film has a 150 Million dollar budget, which is strikingly lower then the rest of the franchise, but maybe for a good cause.This film is 90% action scene after action scene after action scene. Every 5 minutes, Jack Sparrow is swinging from chandeliers, jumping off an exploding lighthouse (in slow-mo), jumping from treetop to treetop, or getting into sword fights on cliff sides. While it may seem exciting, it is surprisingly VERY boring. There were several scenes that made me almost fall asleep. We've seen all of it before, and we know whats gonna happen.The story involves trying to find the famous Fountain of Youth. But it seems like the story and script was originally a National Treasure film, but they changed the script and put in pirates. When they finally get to the fountain, nothing is accomplished. Its just like ""we found it...lets fight!"" and another big action scene pursues.In conclusion, its the worst one yet. If you wanna see it, fine, go ahead. But its definitely the last I wanna see of Jack Sparrow.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
They just keep getting worse,"I was a huge fan of the first Pirates of the Caribbean (it was one of my favorite movies of all time), however, each successive movie has just gotten worse. While the second and third movies at least had some merit, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides has reached an all time low. It is apparent that the film makers are only interested in making money at this point.I didn't really expect that much from this movie but I at least expected some good laughs, entertaining sequences, and good sword fights. This movie failed to even deliver that much. I found myself extremely bored half-way through and wishing that it would end already. The returning characters are just sad shadows of their former selves and the new characters are boring. My biggest problem was with the new portrayal of Barbossa, who is delivered by a seemingly bored Geoffrey Rush as a rather pathetic afterthought to the movie. Apparently, he is supposed to be this big scary fate for Blackbeard but he really only comes off lame. In fact, the characterization of him in this movie undermines his previously terrifying character in the first movie. He is no longer terrifying but now almost silly.Blackbeard is not a particularly convincing villain. Most of his evil we seem to be told as background story, rather than actually being shown. He cannot hold his own against the original Barbossa, Davy Jones, or Lord Cutler Beckett. I had a hard time being convinced that he was even worth dealing with.I did have a soft spot for Penelope Cruz as Angelica, if only because it was nice to finally have a girl that could keep up with Jack in sword-fighting and had an actual Spanish accent (the other Spainards were pretty unconvincing). She certainly tries to entertain, and for that I give her credit, but her storyline is based on a rather flimsy pretense (what the heck was the daughter of a pirate doing in a convent, anyway?) Against my better judgment, I kind of liked the clergy and the mermaid side-story but it didn't really add anything to the movie. It seemed to sort of be just a stand in for Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley, without whom Pirates is just not the same. The sort of anonymous ""Spanish"" group who are sort of supposed to seem like the enemy had me scratching my head. Their part in the movie seemed so utterly pointless, I'm not sure why the film makers included them other than just to have more action.A couple final issues: All the sword fighting was a sad repeat of the first three movies. It was incredibly obvious that the film makers had run out of ideas. You see almost the exact same moves as in the previous moves (fighting in the rafters, tripping enemies with a rope, etc). I know sword-fighting is sword-fighting but I can't believe that they made it that blatantly repetitive. Also, the funniest moments of the movie were basically those that were in the trailer. If you can boil the number of funny moments down to about two minutes, you know there is not nearly enough of them. Lastly, the ending of the movie was lame. We know that Jack has feelings for Angelica but the whole movie goes by and neither ever really act on them which is just plain frustrating. But that's Disney for you.If you're a Pirates fan, you'll probably watch this movie no matter what I say (I know I would) but I doubt you'll get much out of it.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Pirate of the Caribbean Stranger Tides. An incredible and must watch,"An extraordinary movie from out of this world i happened to watched screening of this movie last night. I do not have spoilers to giveg away and all i can say is that it was exquisite. Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom not being there, the film felt more like more than just like rehash of all the other Pirates of the caribbean films. Penelope Cruz and Ian McShane placed an entrincic spice to the film, and I loved Sam Claflin's performance. And there he was, Johnny Depp, because it would not be Pirates of the Caribbeans without him, Geoffrey Rush was spectacular as always. The film has everything else that one woild expect expect from Pswashbuckling, sea creatures, sword-fighting, and lots of great comedy. Bravo to the new cast members who kept the flame burning.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

PotC 4 ...a new beginning,"Action, adventure, romance, and comedy all fit into this one magnificent movie. The fourth installment of Pirates of the Caribbean is an excellent family or teenage movie. ofcours some questions remain unquestioned but this is a different director from the previous three movies. All is good with captain Jack(Johnny Depp), once again he seems to be looking for a source of youth, the elixir of life, more specific The Fountain of Youth, but of coarse some other being is in search of the same item. Blackbeard(Ian McShane)and Barbossa(Geoffrey Rush). in quest of a crew Jack seems to inquire himself with a past lover, Angelica(Penelope Cruz) there is one problem though she seems to be Blackbeard's daughter. Held captive on his ship, Jack is forced to guide them through the dangers of the path to the Fountain. I find that the actors portray their characters excellently and each one of them capture the audiences attention. In place of William and Elizabeth there is a new, heartwarming romance between Phillip(Sam Claflin) and Syrena(Astrid Berges-Frisbey). They seem to nail the role of outcasts from their own kind, and yet every moment i saw the two being tortured or harmed in a scene it gave emotion and commitment. Like I've said before the plot had specific questions unanswered. What happens to Anelica after being marooned on an island, what ever happened to the rest of the crew from the Black Pearl (besides barbossa), and what happens to Phillip after Syrena drags him under the sea? Perhaps these questions will be answered in the next installment of PotC, along with better reviews. Besides the cast and storyline, the locations were beautiful and it was, over all, a thrilling adventure to sit through.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"For a Fourth Entry, It Rocks!","Honestly, I thought the new entry in the lucrative Pirates of the Caribbean franchise is actually not has half-bad as many people claim it to be. Going into this movie, I expected to see my favorite hero return and a bunch of well-placed action and explosions. That is what I signed up for and that is what I got. Also, this movie focuses on Jack Sparrow rather than other characters. I'm glad that happened because we got to learn more about Jack.The fourth entry into the series is about how Jack ""teams"" up with Blackbeard and how they find their way to the Fountain of Youth.I'm glad Johnny Depp reprised his role as Jack because no one can play Jack like Johnny can. Geoffrey Rush returns as Barbossa and he still is good. I thought Ian McShane was a sinister villain and Penelope Cruz was a nice addition.Overall, this was a fun film that featured that good, ol' swash-buckling action. I was happy to see that they added the element of mermaids into the movie. This movie reminds me of the fourth Indiana Jones movie. People didn't like it much but I really did. That is how I feel about this movie. I rate this film 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good film with lots of action,"The first film in the series was a good movie, the 2nd was too long and I didn't bother with the 3rd because it was longer. This time it is a decent film but still too long. The story is that after escaping from a hanging Jack Sparrow played by Johnny Depp ends up on the ship of Blackbeard, it was a good idea to put him in this movie cause he's a well known pirate. I thought the humour was the best of all the films because it made me chuckle quite a few times. The acting was up to the standard of the previous films, Johnny Depp did a great job. The characters were good however it has too many new characters and not enough old, all it has is Jack Gibbs and Captain Barbosa. The length was too long, it was a good length for most of the film but dragged on near the end. The action was brilliant, there was a good amount of action scenes for example the mermaids in the sea. Overall this is a good film but the ending was disappointing. I give it 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Slightly better than its immediate predecessor i.e. 'At World's End',"If truth be told, Rob Marshall's 'On Stranger Tides' does it slightly better for me (than 'At World's End) and that is mainly because this movie is largely centered around Captain Jack Sparrow; his antics, and his adventure, which I wholeheartedly admired.Unlike Virbinski's Original trilogy which had not one but multiple sub-plots parallelly going on, amongst which, a handsome number was solely devoted to developing the relationship dynamic between Swann & Turner. To be frank, I never really cared for that pair, so I am rather pleased that they finally decided to move on.That being said, as a spectator, I'm still far off from being gratified. The improvisations were indeed pronounced but they were not enough to sell the whole proposition.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not even a cat mouse game ...,"Now something like this doesn't work for me,if I consider previous three installments.This movie cannot even be considered as good,if I am an enough good movie goer & specially when I am a die hard fan of this series.Direction:No offense but Rob Marshall fails to deliver this time after you have seen his work in Chicago or Memories of Geisha.I don't know but I missed Gore when I was watching this movie.for him it is 5/10.Its like zero to his work.Writing and Screenplay:Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio didn't impress as they did in the previous movies.Story fails to keep you interested,on the edge of the seat is a far cry.Actors:Depp tries hard to keep up but the story does not have much scope for him.But not to forget he is the only thing for whom I would ask you to see this movie.Penelope,Geoffrey,McShane were OK.Music:Hans Zimmer did his job quite well but still i feel something was missing.What Impresses:The Mermaid sequence and the relationship thing between mermaid(Syrena) and Philip was good.What we miss :The enthusiasm was not there.I missed the sunlight (brightness),whole movie is dark and then 3D diminishes brightness.The grandness,the larger than life visuals that was part of the previous three movies was not there.I think They shouldn't have created this one.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I can say that I would pay to see this movie, the length is good, the ending too, the way it ends leaves you thinking.

It would be good if they released the sequel soon because even though it is closed in certain points it leaves some questions that should be resolved or answered with a prequel.

VERY bad...Not believable...,"This movie made no sense...THeir is no such thing as pirates! Also their is no such thing as mermaids and how can water make you live forever? Such a fake move, only affects and 3d was OK, rest boring and stupid...Also Penelope is sexy and the sword fight sequences were fun to watch but no logic... Whoever came up with a story like this is from another world and needs to understand reality. How can a man get stabbed and not get killed? How can a man simply pick up his sword and create magic like that? Also those mermaids were all wrong...I mean I have heard in other stories that mermaids (even though they don't actually exists) are peaceful and loving... In this movie they are shown as being evil which is completely ridiculous... Doesn't make any sense... Also the background score was repetitive and Johnny Depp has a lot of wrinkles on his face...He looks old...Plus Al Pacino needs to get a new job cuz he looks like a monkey..Overall I wouldn't recommend this film...Even the first film sucked because there is no such thing as pirates and no logic!

"Another fairly decent installment of the ""Pirates"" franchise","One may think that another ""Pirates"" film would be terrible, specifically the fact that there's no Keira Knightley or Orlando Bloom, there's a different director, and the idea in it of itself seems insane. Despite these discrepancies, ""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides"", proves to be another decent installment of the series.Once again, Johnny Depp dazzles the screen with his humor, charm, and wit as Captain Jack Sparrow. It's impossible to resist the man in a pirate's outfit with the flawless gold teeth and eye make-up. Geoffrey Rush is simply better than ever as Barbossa (who doesn't need much makeup for the role I might add). Kevin McNally returns as Gibbs as does Keith Richards as Jack's father‚Äîbut only for a mere, somewhat out of place cameo. It may seem disappointing that some of the old faces are gone from the first three films, but the new ones blend in perfectly as replacements. Among them is Penelope Cruz, as Jack's old flame, and Ian MacShane as her evil father Blackbeard. Both do exceptionally well, though Blackbeard is not as up to par as a villain like Davy Jones‚Äîhe simply lacks the menace.""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides"", also proves to have some very memorable action sequences, particularly a chase scene in London (which takes place during the first half hour of the feature). There is also a bit of clever humor that made me laugh almost as hard as the first ""Pirates"" film. Rob Marshall proves himself to be fit for the role as the new director of the Pirates films, too. The other technical aspects of CGI, production design, and make up are impeccable.One technical feat that seems lacking is the lighting. It is understandable that it is to be dark during the night, but it did not have to be so dim that I can't tell what is happening on the screen. The plot also did not hold up as good as the earlier films. For instance, I was expecting a big finale like in any other feature. There is one, but it is not long enough, nor is it very memorable. There are also a couple of things left hanging that made me feel confused.Overall though, for a multi-billion dollar series, ""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides"" does a pretty good job. It is better than the slow-paced ""Dead Man's Chest"", but it is not a masterpiece like the original film. When you have nothing better to do, go see this feature on the big screen.***/****",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

What Indiana Jones 4 should have been!,"Gore Verbinski did an excellent job in re-creating The Ring for American audiences. He works well in dark surreal worlds, which worked well for the first Pirates of the Caribbean film. It's a classic, one of a kind action/adventure with the dark tones of a horror film.Dead Man's Chest had a plot neither children or stoners could follow. It was an exhausting wait to get to the action sequences and then, when they did happen, it was so over-the-top, all believability, and therefore all invested suspense, was lost. You found yourself laughing at the film, not with it.At World's End takes a turn for the serious and gets much darker. Much too dark for the kids who Disney sold the first two films to. As an adult, it's good twisted fun at the beginning but that soon fades out with the drama that comes with being the end of a trilogy.Now, with a new director and some new characters mixed with the old, we have a new film in the Pirates of the Caribbean series, On Stranger Tides.First, On Stranger Tides never gets any more strange than the last film but it is a whole hell of a lot better! Rob Marshal has shown here the balance a film needs to be fun for children without insulting the intelligence of the rest of the audience, in both action and comedy. The action stays in the ""fun"" zone, best compared to Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, all things that happen outside of known physics are played along side a well deserved laugh. You laugh along with the film, the opposite of what the past films have been guilty of.Also, this is the best live-action 3D film since Alice in Wonderland. Disney and Sony have the new 3D technology locked-down. All other studios should just give up.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Lacks the Heart of the Original Trilogy,"After the original trilogy, there wasn't much story left to tell with Will and Elizabeth, so Disney wished to continue the franchise putting a heavier focus on Johnny Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow. On Stranger Tides featured Sparrow at the center of everything, which can be a good and bad thing.I don't necessarily think it was the best idea to make Sparrow the only character with significant depth, but I also don't think having the story involve mermaids and an overly powerful supernatural villain either. The Pirates films at their best when the stakes are high but are also grounded with some realism. One of the reasons At World's End is a much better film is because there are stakes in that film. William's sacrifice feels earned because we've been with these characters for a few films. I never connected to anyone in On Stranger Tides because the writing never makes a considerable effort to flesh out the characters. The efforts that are made aren't very committed.As a standalone sequel, which is essentially what this film is, On Stranger Tides is far from awful. It has plenty of fun swashbuckling action scenes that the franchise has always presented. Ian McShane is pretty good as Blackbeard, though he doesn't really compare to anything Bill Nighy or Geoffrey Rush did in the original trilogy. But the film itself presents a far goofier tone than any of those films. Sparrow is even more over the top (believe it or not) and thus removing any human connection to the characters.I think it's best to treat this entry as a distant cousin people choose not to acknowledge at a party, because it has next to nothing to do with any of the other films (even the most recent film, Dead Men Tell No Tales). There are flashes of the Pirates we know and love but it's nowhere near as grandiose or as magical as its predecessors.+Flashes of greatness-Forgettable-Characters are getting a little too over the top5.6/10",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Solid pirate summer fun,"As a huge POTC fan geek I'm going to be biased, so I'll just say that the other five people I had with me on the first viewing all like it ""I enjoyed it"" - ""it was good"" were the comments I got over dinner after, and this was from people who may or may not have seen any of the other POTC movies. Had to do a fast synopsis for a few.The good: For me, Depp holds his own in deliciously fine form through the film, and it's a relief to have lots of Jack, strong and sardonic in some places, fey in others, and as amusing as ever - with an equally excellent performance by Rush as Barbossa (good energy from both). Penelope Cruz turns in a believable performance as Angelica, and Depp and Cruz are a good fit. There's been some complaints about McShane being a less charismatic Blackbeard - but in the original book he is also portrayed that way - very bad, ruthless, but very intelligent. In the book he isn't some fire-breather of a person. Some pains are taken along the way to make sure the audience is carefully filled in, which I thought was funny as the producers were obviously taking care of all those bemoaning how confused they were during POTC3 - even though POTC 4 is pretty straightforward.Lots of action and some high-energy fencing and escapes, balanced out with some down time. A lot gets crammed into the allotted time, but it's paced evenly. As rich-looking location and set-wise as any of the other POTCs. Thought the mermaid scene was impressive, spooky, even a nice haunting song that threads through the scene.The bad: A couple of things could have been built up to than to more than they were, and the zombies while impressive didn't really do that much in particular, for me they made less of an impact that the sea critter men of POTC 2 and 3. But that's also true of the book the movie is based on (where it may be hard to tell you are dealing with a zombie). The subplot romance with the mermaid was a nice nod to mermaid folklore but it was just OK. And there is a bit of jerkiness or jumps in the narrative here and there that I thought were ""reaching"".Was better in the second viewing as the new setting(s) and characters were expected and could relax into the film more - probably will see it again before it leaves theaters. The audiences I have been with were laughing and seemed to be enjoying themselves. In any case, think a lot of ""professional"" critics are ignoring all the good things about this film, like the fact that it's a good to very good film.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""Lame"" sums everything up about this movie","For the not so demanding movie goer this might be just enough to be entertained, for anyone slightly more choosy this film is rather lame to say the least. Most elements are foreseeable, while poorly acted and story-wise unnecessary in parts. This movie is Hollywood by the numbers, an overly long fast food production without real content and an offense to the previously established characters and franchise. If you are watching this to see another part of the franchise, this might work for you. If you're watching this, expecting a good pirate movie with twists and turns and witty dialogues, you will be disappointed.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Pirates Franchise Reborn,"Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides is full of new things. New director, actors, and storyline. After ""At World's End"" many people thought the series was over. However, Rob Marshall managed to renew one of the most successful movie franchises of all time.The addition of Penelope Cruz really added to this movie. As Jack's opposite, she really shares some of the same ""skills and abilities"" Jack does. Blackbeard was also played perfectly by Ian McShane. I would even go as far to say that he is more intimidating of a vicious pirate captain than Barbossa was in ""The Curse of the Black Pearl."" Overall, the new actors really helped this movie. You couldn't do any more with Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley's involvement in the series, so this is exactly what you needed if you wanted the series to continue.As far as the length of the movie, it sure did not seem like a mere 2 hours and 17 minutes. That's not a bad thing, either. The last movie, ""At World's End,"" was only about a quarter of an hour away from 3 hours. (which it somewhat had to be because of the climatic battle that had to be at the end) I am saying that this movie had lots of action and plot contained in the shortest running time of all previous movies in the franchise.Overall, I was very impressed with this movie. Captain Jack was his usual, witty, hilarious self. The witty lines, charm, and action-packed sequences propelled this film. It's like what people say, it seems to return to the style of the ""The Curse of the Black Pearl."" I definitely recommend watching this movie. And, with the Pirates of the Caribbean 5 script already finished, it appears we will see Captain Jack back before we know it.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
For the love of Jack Sparrow,"Very action-packed as the others, but it's far from a bad film. Fantastic job at carrying the franchise to its fourth installment. There's plenty of laughs, some well choreographed action sequences, and it's a nice little tale of the search for the Fountain of Youth. This one is definitely up there with the first three films for me. It was pretty darn good. Loved the characters. Johnny Depp did so damn well too. He's so funny at the time he made a mutiny. A good acting from Johnny Depp. I really enjoyed the fights. And the mermaids. I give it a 10 out of 10 for the love of Captain Jack Sparrow.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
My Favourite Film in the Franchise,The plot is the most complicated and less straightforward then the other films.

This is ground control to Captain Jack...,"I am really unsure of how to sum up On Stranger Tides in simple words. Before I begin this review, let me state 2 things: 1. I absolutely love the first three movies, and 2. To that guy who said ""the skinny girl is not in the movie"", that skinny girl is named Kiera Knightley. OK, now moving on, sort of.The first three movies were good old fashioned fun that didn't take themselves too seriously. I enjoyed them all very much and have seen them numerous times. I thought Verbinski did a hell of a job, considering he was a punk rock video director before a filmmaker. When I heard a fourth movie was being made, I got super excited. However, I had a stirring feeling of disappointment when I found out Verbinski was not directing. I'm not down with Rob Marshall- I thought Chicago was overrated and Nine was a confusing and slow mess. But, it's a Pirates movie, so I figured it'd be fun.Since I'm kinda pressed for time, I will sum up what I liked and didn't like.FIrst, the cast were great as per usual. Visually it was entertaining and the movie moved along at a nice pace... for the first hour. That, and Penelope Cruz is hot!!! And she did a great job as Angelica. Blackbeard was a cool villain, and Ian McShane does a fantastic job. There's a creepy scene involving mermaids, and that got a good reaction from those at the theatre.The bad... is everything else. First off, Barbossa is in the movie for only 20 minutes. The last hour is boring, drags a lot, and that's not all- there's a MAJOR plot hole involving the fountain of youth which is really annoying. And the 3D sucked.Overall, this is not a bad movie, but the writers are running out of ideas and it's clear.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Best of the sequels,"Pirates Of The Caribbean: On Stranger Tides is the odd one out in the quadrilogy (as there must be in any quadrilogy) but I think it's an overlooked gem, and is my second favourite of the franchise, after Black Pearl. Dead Man's Chest and At Worlds end had their moments (Davey Jones and his crew are a special effects highlight), but are so bombastic, overblown and convoluted to the point of freaking madness, it's nice to see a shorter, saner, more toned down sequel that ditches all the hooplah and gets down to what made the first one special. Also, it ditches Keira Knightely and Orlando Bloom in favor of some new characters to freshen things up. Knightley I always enjoy and somewhat missed, but I was damn happy to be rid of wooden faced Bloom, he's just such a buzz kill in anything but Lord Of The Rings. Hear that shrill sound on the wind? That's the furious cries of several million girls reading this and calling for my head on a stick for my comments about Bloom (believe me, I've explained my opinion on this to girls I've known in person, and the looks I've gotten could melt steel beams lol). Deal with it. There's still Johnny Depp, free from much of the CGI spectacle of the two previous ones and immersed in an enjoyable story, this time searching for the infamous Fountain Of Youth. Also out to find it is ex - villain Barbosa (Geoffrey Rush can play this character for the rest of his career as far as I'm concerned, he's always a delight), now working for the King of England (Richard Griffiths in one of his final appearances). Penelope Cruz fares well as a fellow rapscallion out to find the fountain. I also fell head over heels for the stunning, eerie mermaid played by newcomer Astrid B√®rges. It's Ian McShane as Blackbeard, however, who steals the show. Ian has a presence that fills every frame and second of dialogue he's in, and he has a blast as the notorious pirate king, sporting eyeliner, the classic tricorner hat and a psychopathic attitude. I was just so pleased to find the sense of adventure restored in the franchise, an order out of the previous chaos of sorts. It's the sort of spirit that's owed to the legacy of the first movie, and the same spirit I hope to see from the upcoming fifth entry.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Jack is back... unfortunately.,"Jack is back. Which is not surprising seeing as the original trilogy racked up over $2.5bn in worldwide gross. Many, including myself, thought the franchise should've wrapped up after At World's End thanks to the increasingly convoluted story lines and the boredom setting in with a few of the characters. Well they've thrown Orlando and Keira overboard and now Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp ‚Äì trying hard to be funny but failing) is setting sail on a new adventure. Chasing the fountain of youth, Sparrow must contend with Blackbeard (Ian McShane), old flame Angelica (Penelope Cruz ‚Äì woeful) and the returning Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), along with bad dialogue, an uninspired plot and a massively bloated runtime. Fortunately the well-staged action sequences save this from drowning completely. Be sure to sit through the end credits if you're keen to see one final small scene. 2 out of 5",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Change of Direction Proves Faulty,"The first three POTC movies were a joy to see. Sure, the later ones had moments of drag and scripts, that got out of control sometimes, but they were fun, beautiful to watch and they tackled a genre that is as old as the movies themselves, with a nice 21st century punch. From the moment the first movie, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003), opened up with Jack Sparrow's grand entrance, these films have dazzled audiences. It was a trilogy, that was self-contained and with this fourth installment, the Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), plot arc, had run its course and it was time, for a new direction. In Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides (2011), Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), is enveloped into a quest for the legendary Fountain of Youth, first by the British monarchy and second by the evil Blackbeard (Ian McShane). Along the way he joins forces with his old nemesis Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush). In order to unlock the secrets to the Fountain of Youth, they need to get the tears from a mermaid, who is captured by Blackbeard. What complicates matters, even more, is the return of one of Jack's ex-girlfriends, Angelica (Penelope Cruz), who turns out to be the long-lost daughter of Blackbeard. Also, in attendance is a level-headed, compassionate, man of faith, named Philip (Sam Claflin), who befriends the captured mermaid Syrena (Astrid Berges-Frisbey).It is clear, that the producers of Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides (2011), felt the sea-change. They needed to continue keeping this franchise fresh, so it would need some new changes. They needed to reinvent the wheel. You can clearly tell, that they wanted to scale back the number of characters and shorten the runtime of the finished film. This one was a svelte 136 minutes, which is chump-change compared to the other three films (143 mins to 169 mins). What worried me though, was they might have also scaled back the fun too. Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides (2011), seemed a little boring in parts. Other than an exciting chase through the streets of London and an interesting mermaid attack, there wasn't much more there. Even, the beautiful scenery seemed toned down too. What was an interesting positive was the fact, that Jack shows emotions that we aren't used to. It is clear that he actually has remorse for the way he treated Angelica in their previous life and he does everything he can to keep her out of harm's way, even from he own father. It is a coming of age film for Jack and it is a new approach to his character. There does seem to be some loose-ends, near the end of the film, that exasperates the whole thing even more.They did check in with some other reoccurring characters from the first three films, like Jack's Dad, Captain Teague (Keith Richards), Gibbs (Kevin McNally) and the monkey, who Jack always responses to, saying, ""I hate that monkey"". Johnny Depp is brilliant as usual, Penelope Cruz is a delight to watch and Ian McShane does not disappoint as Blackbeard, although it would have been awesome to hear him drop at least one F-word, as an homage to his great character, Al Swearengen from HBO's Deadwood (2004-2006). Hey, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides (2011), is a PG-13 movie. I believe you are allowed to have one F-word in a PG-13 movie.PMTM Grade: 5.2 (E+) = 5 IMDB.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Pirates of the Long-Winded, Dull and Disappointing Caribbean","This film started perfectly, first 30 minutes really got you into the action/adventure genre and had a few great ambitious, action sequences, and from there, possibly one of the most drawn-out films I've ever seen. I felt it was dull, rushed but drawn-out at the same time? The middle hour was SO DULL, the ""mermaids"" (pathetic ones) and ""zombies"" (in it for minutes) didn't add anything, and considering the first Pirates film is one of my all-time favourites, they've gotten progressively worse, and I really thought this one would bring back the terror of no.3.Such a disappointment, the trailer gave it all away too; Penelope Cruze was meh, and Johnny Depp looked like he wanted to be somewhere else.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Apart from Jack Sparrow, the movie itself is fully packed and keeps the audience guessing to what will happen next.

On Stranger Tides - A Swashbuckling Adventure,"On Stranger Tides"" is a thrilling adventure that takes audiences on a wild ride filled with action, humor, and heart. The fourth installment in the beloved franchise brings back the iconic Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) in a new quest that's both familiar and fresh.The film's narrative is expertly woven, blending mythology and fantasy with the series' trademark wit and charm. Director Rob Marshall masterfully balances the tone, shifting seamlessly between intense action sequences, comedic moments, and poignant character interactions.Depp's performance as Captain Jack Sparrow is, once again, a highlight of the film. His eccentricity and charisma bring depth and nuance to the character, making him both lovable and infuriating. The supporting cast, including Pen√©lope Cruz as Angelica, Ian McShane as Blackbeard, and Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa, deliver strong performances that add richness to the story.The film's visuals are stunning, with impressive set designs, elaborate costumes, and breathtaking cinematography. The action sequences are intense and well-choreographed, particularly the memorable mermaid attack and the thrilling finale.One of the standout elements of ""On Stranger Tides"" is its exploration of themes such as love, power, and redemption. The film delves deeper into the characters' motivations and backstories, adding an extra layer of complexity to the narrative.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Just didn't live up,"I wanted to like this story, I really did. There were simply too many elements of the original story left out. The dynamics of the scoundrel in waiting in Orlando Bloom and the sexual tension of Kiera Knightly were both sorely missed in this film. Even the quirky interactions with the ships crew were absent, and took away from the charm of the film. Yes, Depp is the star but it is the interaction with those characters that express the greatness of the ""Jack Sparrow"" character. Without them the acting was flat.Plus the constantly changing Barbosa character is making me dizzy and Penelope Cruz was just a pretty straw man. The ending was stuffed with feel good one liners.The movie had a few laughs, but I missed the old characters and the new ones didn't make up the distance.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Well at least it wasn't 'Yo-ho-hum and a bottle of sleeping pills'...,"As I watched the blur of colourful characters from varied backgrounds whirl and strut across lavish sets and exquisite locations I couldn't help but think I'd seen it all before... but had long since forgotten. A fate that will no doubt be consigned upon any recollections of Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides within days.First let's take a step back by disclosing everything I know about the Pirates franchise already: - Johnny Depp is a scurrilous PG13 pirate named Jack Sparrow, without him the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise is sunk. - The original movie is named after a theme park ride. - Don't ask me about the second or third films, I have seen them and can't remember a thing about either.That's about it really, I know sweet Jack Sparrow... squat about the films, which doesn't seem to impact any enjoyment derived from this one. In reality each film is about providing just enough distraction to have the audience walking out of the theatre thinking 'well that must have been entertaining', and recalling one of the many distractions ‚Äì pirates, ghosts, mermaids, Johnny Depp, cleavage ‚Äì in a favourable enough light that they line up for the next inevitable sequel.In this outing we are caught up to speed quickly. Sparrow is as always in custody, though the type of custody where he can casually escape whenever he wants.He has lost his beloved ship the Black Pearl, presumed sunk, most of his crew, and 90% of the co-stars from previous films. The one constant is Captain Barbossa, the nefarious ying to Sparrow's debaucherous yang, though he is now siding with the British navy, how very un-pirate-y indeed.After the initial catch-up chat between Barbossa and Sparrow, which rapidly devolves into a slur-off of indecipherable accents and roguish bravado, there is the inevitable escape sequence and getaway chase.The now free Sparrow hears of another claiming to be he, and he is none too pleased at this pirate piracy, that is until he is astonished to learn that it is none other than Angelica (Penelope Cruz) an ex-flame of his ‚Äì one who he may have even actually... liked, and the two spend the remainder of the film smouldering at each other as they move from one carefully constructed setpiece to the next.A map has emerged that apparently leads directly to an important site, but it seems every man and his parrot have the co-ordinates already with the British navy ‚Äì lead by Captain Barbossa, the Spanish navy ‚Äì lead by a handsome guy who looks like a cross from the Cat from Red Dwarf and Prince circa 1985 and still another vessel making a beeline toward it ‚Äì lead by none other than the greatly feared Blackbeard (Ian McShane), a man whom even the lowest, most dangerous pirates dread.Blackbeard's ship possesses magical powers that are stronger the closer he is to the ship and his crew are zombified strongmen, apparently more loyal and focused than regular scumbags. Angelica managed to secure a place aboard for both herself and Sparrow by claiming to be Blackbeard's long lost daughter...The 'treasure hunt' in this film is the Fountain of Youth ‚Äì something Depp and Cruz might actually need if they plan to sail this cash-seacow for much longer.The remainder of the film has the various parties moving towards their goals in a very PG13 manner, with fight scenes at sub-Jackie Chan levels, and of course the primary characters running into each other repeatedly to exchange suitably pirate-y dialogue.If you believe the film every ship is full of empty barrels lying about to be thrown around, jumped on or jumped off as they roll away cinematically, every room has many ladders that go straight up to the rafters for no reason, and every rope when cut has no impact but allowing the cutter to ascend rapidly, they never seem to be tied or supporting anything.The much discussed mermaid scene serves no purpose but to allow the filmmakers to discuss it much more, insinuating how tough it must have been to have all those supermodels lying about with no clothes on again and again, even when the finished on screen product CGIs away all the goodies... And the finale takes place on a set which might have been left over from The Goonies.I was amused by Pirates 4, mostly because I let the bright colours and expensive elaborate sets seduce me, lest I become enraged at just how calculated and empty this all is.Final Rating ‚Äì 5 / 10. Pirates 4 might not be a total shipwreck, but it doesn't really float my boat either.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Super Awesome,"Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides is a fantasy action/adventure film set during the Golden Age of Piracy in the early 18th century in Puerto Rico. The story follows the life of Captain Jack Sparrow (played by Johnny Depp) and how his past comes back to haunt him when he meets Angelica (played by Pen√©lope Cruz), a beautiful pirate whom he once loved but then left. Angelica compels him to accompany her on a journey to find the notorious Blackbeard's (played by Ian McShane) ship, the Queen Anne's Revenge. Along with a zombie crew, the trio sets sail to find the legendary Fountain of Youth. However, Jack's rival, Barbossa (played by Geoffrey Rush), and a ship from Spain are also in pursuit of the fountain.One of my favorite characters in the film is Angelica, who is Jack's former love interest, first mate, and the daughter of Blackbeard.

Pale and flat compare to the predecessors,"PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: ON STRANGER TIDES is the latest addition to a franchise that I personally think ended at part three. In one word, the whole film was forced. But to say it was bad solely on the fact that it was forced is being too rash, rather it was actually fine when compared to most any other sequel (TERMINATOR SALVATION, anyone?). Overall, the film was mediocre.The plot takes liberty in setting up a new adventure for Jack Sparrow since things seemed wrapped up in AT WORLD'S END and while this looks promising, it's not. The expedition to the Fountain of Youth is admittedly interesting on paper since this would branch deeper into pirate lore but what we get instead is a mash up of random ideas most probably thought up by kids. Ranging from vampire mermaids, zombies, a flamthrower ship that isn't even used that much again after its introduction and flying ropes of doom (easily the worst weapon on screen in years), the creativity that once surrounded the POTC franchise with so much intrigue and mystique has been thrown out the window in favor of kid-friendly crap (the Kraken and Barbossa's skeleton crew were definitely not kid friendly).The characters didn't help much; even Depp who as always plays an effective character on screen can't do much to salvage the film from already being a disappointment. The rest of the cast all seem to be cartoon characters from a TV show about pirates stuck into a live action movie; either that or they were forgettable. Instead of pirates, we get joke characters who rely on humor or two dimensional villainy to make their presence felt. Barbossa has degraded as a character compared to his previous appearances but was still fun to watch while Angelica just wasn't engaging enough.The worst offender has to be Blackbeard; when compared to Davy Jones, he could've been a wonderful contrast to the otherworldly Jones since he would just be a normal human being who was feared by everyone on the high seas. He could've been the pirate world's answer to the end of the supernatural age that ended when Davy Jones died but instead we get a clich√©d, two dimensional old man who's trying desperately to be the villain. Blackbeard just appears in the scene acting evil; all he does on screen is flaunt about how weak the good are, how awesome he is as the bad guy and that's it. Thanks to this his actions are pretty predictable right up to the end.Even the action wasn't much; I don't mind the fact that there are no ship battles anymore since the story concentrates on the expedition on an island but watching a bunch of stunts isn't that exciting. To make matters worse, the music seemed recycled. I know this is a small detail, but it was the music that made the first three films come to life and now that they're just recycling them, the magic is lost.The film does have its moments though, some in humor, good dialogue or in a decent action sequence or two but overall the film was still a big disappointment. As a fan of the original trilogy, I feel that while this film still manages to maintain the feel and spirit of a PIRATES film, it was a downer. There was so much potential in the premise and the characters but in the end, all those element just couldn't add up and make a great film. If all you want is a time waster, then go ahead and check this out. Otherwise, stay away from it.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Just awful,"I think it would be difficult to find another better example of the emptiness of corporate filmmaking than the fourth entry in the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, On Stranger Tides. Taking the interesting bits from the earlier films, tossing them completely, and placing the largest side character front and center in an aimless adventure that simply drags from one empty conversation of plot points to another, the film is a dreary exercise in a corporation deciding that hitting a release date with a recognizable and conceivably still profitable property is more important than finding an interesting story to tell.I don't want to say that this film was made from a first draft. I would imagine it was draft 10-15 or so, but there was no one person guiding the writing process executed by the writers of the first three films Ted Elliott and Terry Russio. Yes, there was a director, the largely unremarkable Rob Marshall, but it's obvious that the writers took the inspiration from the novel On Stranger Tides by Tim Powers and then executives were determined to include certain things they thought people liked from the previous films without understanding what originally made those things special. To take a quick and easy example: fantasy.The first three films are filled with dead pirate ghost skeletons, fish men who man a dreaded ship that can dive below water, a strange afterlife, and pirate lords electing a king to fight off the East India Trading Company. Those movies are weird. This replaces all of that with...Blackbeard with a magic sword that...controls the ropes of his ship? Mermaids? The Fountain of Youth? Yeah, they're fantastical for sure, no one would deny that, but they are a decided step down in the weirdness department, like a studio executive said, ""We know that fantasy made the previous films popular, but we feel like Gore Verbinski took it too far, despite the money we made. Include the fantasy, but make it more grounded, because that's what the kids want from their fantasies about pirates fighting supernatural beings."" Also there are some zombie members of Blackbeard's crew. Why? I don't know. The kids like zombies, right?So, the story, for what it is worth, is about Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) joining the Queen Anne's Revenge under Blackbeard (Ian McShane) and his daughter and first mate Angelica (Penelope Cruz) in the search for the Fountain of Youth. They are racing against time to reach it before Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), now a celebrated privateer working for the British crown, and the Spanish. This is the makings of a Pirates of the Caribbean movie, all right, except that it's remarkably boring. That boringness starts before the action suddenly stops for an hour, by the way.It's a chase with no sense of urgency because motives are intentionally hidden. In the previous films there was deception around every corner, but we ultimately understood what the characters wanted. Will wanted alternatively to marry Elizabeth and to free his twice cursed pirate father. Jack wanted to live forever and regain his ship, the Black Pearl. Elizabeth wanted to marry Will while growing into a bit of a pirate herself. It made sense, and despite all the crossing of plot lines, we were never in doubt of what they ultimately wanted. Here...the motives of two of the three parties chasing after the Fountain are hidden until 100 minutes into the film. Heck, the main Spanish antagonist doesn't get his second line until the movie's almost done. It's a fog helped none at all by the fact that Jack seems to have no reason to be there at all.The films have progressively become the Jack Sparrow show, but that really manifested before in Jack becoming a more prominent member of what really was an ensemble. Here he is definitely the main character, and yet...it's hard to tell what he wants at all. He starts the film, having given up his search for the Fountain completely between the stinger at the end of the last film and the start of this one, showing up in London because someone's impersonating him looking for a crew. He then gets pressganged into this crew, which turns out to be the Queen Anne's Revenge, organizes a mutiny for...reasons, and then is told why he's there at all by Blackbeard. He will lead them to the Fountain since he had the charts (the magical compass Jack carries gets forgotten for more than half the movie). Jack, essentially, has no motive to search out the Fountain of Youth through the entire film. He's always going because Blackbeard tells him to. That's...that's a terrible way to write a main character.Why does Blackbeard want it? Because of a (groan) prophecy. What is this prophecy? That a man with one leg will kill him in a fortnight. That's mighty specific, but whatever. How is this going to stop the one-legged man? Well, I presume the Fountain's extension of life makes you impervious to swords and bullets. And how is one supposed to drink from the Fountain? Well, there's a complicated process involving two silver chalices that were once owned by Ponce de Leon (how it might have worked before the 16th century no one seems to care), a mermaid tear, and the water from the Fountain. You know what all of this is? Busy work to extend the runtime.The character who should have been our main character, the straight man to Jack's crazy wildcard, is the missionary Philip (Sam Claflin). He's not seen until about 40 minutes into the film, and his first line isn't until about twenty minutes later. He also has a single interaction with Jack and spends most of his time pining for the mermaid that the pirates under Blackbeard capture. He is kind of the center of my idea that the film was rushed to production once an executive with no sense of storytelling saw that the script had all the elements he wanted to see whether they worked or not in context. The missionary was there. It didn't matter whether he served an interesting or useful story purpose, he was the Orlando Bloom character. Check that mark and move on.The finale, where the pirates, Barbossa's privateers, and the Spanish all gather at the Fountain is where we finally get the Spanish motivation (they wish to destroy the Fountain because they consider it prophane) is interesting in that it shows what the movie could have been. This literally is a chase and it never feels like it, and at the core of this chase is the idea that the Spanish will not just take the Fountain and block off other people from it, hoarding it for themselves. Instead they wish to destroy it forever. So, the Spanish wish to destroy it, Barbossa doesn't care and just wants to kill Blackbeard (he is the one-legged man), and Blackbeard just wants to get there because of some prophecy. Well, I like the first two (the third one is terrible), and that all provides the interesting context for how the chase would go down in a better script.And yet, in the center of it all is Jack. Jack, the character who spent the previous two films obsessing over the idea of living forever, has no motivation in a movie about a quest to gain the Fountain of Youth. That's just simple writing malpractice. Even when they get there, he's not tempted by it in the least. He's just there to play his part in the drama between Blackbeard and Angelica.This movie is awful, but I can't hate it because it's just not worth the emotional energy. It's a dreary, largely boring exercise in corporate filmmaking that represents pretty much the worst of how Hollywood makes movies. It forgets why the previous films were popular, instead choosing to just weakly mimic what came before without any understanding of what's going on. Rob Marshall was brought in because he would follow executive orders, just like Russio and Elliott were retained because they would craft the script in the way the studio wanted. There was no artistic intent left in the final product. It was just cogs in a corporate machine following orders from someone who doesn't understand what they're doing.This movie sucked.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Depp held the franchise together,"This is one of those movies I knew going in that I would have a hard time with. I was told many things about this movie that were only criticism and hate. While I try to form my own opinion on every movie I see and begin by ignoring anything I've heard, This movie fell terribly short of any review I had heard or the past trilogy of POTC.Missing two of the greatest assets of the franchise hurt this movie some, but the main reason this movie suffered was because of the supporting roles not stepping up to the plate. Sparrow and Barbosa did well in keeping the adventure interesting, but the other roles fell short.In my opinion, this insert was flawed in a major way and damaged the franchise. While the plot was okay, it didn't come together and the new characters hurt this movie in comparison to the first trilogy.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Best since the First,"I, like a lot of people, absolutely love the first Pirates of the Caribbean. It was one of the most entertaining movies I've ever seen, and gave birth to one of my favorite movie characters, Captain Jack Sparrow. But unlike a lot of people, I really enjoyed the second and third movies in the franchise, especially the third. Now we have, On stranger Tides, and it is my personal favorite since the first one.In this film, the focus in entirely on Jack, no Will and Elizbeth Relationship, although there is a different relationship between a religious man and a mermaid. The movie is basically Jack trying to find the fountain of youth, along with his ex Angelica. Unfortunaly Blackbeard the pirate also wants to find the fountain, as well as the Spanish government, and the British Parliment. Don't let this plot fool you, this film is much less confusing than the last two.It's funny as well, Jack is still great, and the film, overall, was entertaining. Lots of battles, sword fights, and the mermaids were awesome. Really my only big problem was the villain, what a bore.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Life of sexy Jonny Depp,"First the casting of main character is very awesome. I think Jonny Depp is most sexy man in the Hollywood. So he is very suitable for his character Captain Jack Sparrow. Second the plot was really exciting. Whoever watch this movie, they will surely enjoy this movie. Specially in fighting scene on the ship. Third I think the directing of Rob Marshall was great. His directing gives us a comfortable feelings during running times.I enjoy watching this movie for 5 times. But when I saw this movie for5times, it wasn't boring. I think if you are virgin at this movie, I surely recommend to watch it. Have a good day!!!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Jack Sparrow,"Captain Jack Sparrow is acted to perfection by John Depp. The swashbuckling, sea creatures, sword-fighting, and lots of great comedy is to die for. But the new cast members made it possible by keeping it feeling fresh. Cruiz and John blended in with the other crew members. Jack Sparrow ' s paranoia is on another level, he couldn't trust his past and he was correct. The costumes used were suitable. Ar first they thought they were the only ones searching for the fountain of youth buy alas another part was also doing that so the scales were higher quick thinking was required. All l can say is it's worth watching and you won't stop laughing.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good film if you want to be bored to death,"I finally got round to watching Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides last week. I personally had never been a fan of the franchise, but my sister dragged me along with her to watch it.Now, the past three films of Pirates were enjoyable to watch, they were forgettable yet enjoyable. Sadly, the same cannot be said for On Stranger Tides.This film drags on at such a sluggish pace I literally almost fell asleep around 30 minutes through, and if it hadn't been for my contacts lenses I probably would have fallen asleep & be done with the whole thing.Not even Johnny Depp's impeccable performance as Captain Jack Sparrow could save this movie from being a shipwreck.Only reason I gave this 2 stars is because of the little romance between Philip ( Sam Claflin ) and Syrena ( Astrid Berges-Frisbey ), they certainly had more chemistry than Johnny Depp & Penelope Cruz's forced partnership which was to be frank, simply painful to watch. Also, the last 20 minutes wasn't too bad; it was actually mildy entertaining, at least it managed to wake me up a bit. Syrena's appearance was the best thing throughout Pirates, as she gave something fresh to a tired franchise.All in all, I think the ship of this franchise has long sailed, and I sincerely hope they don't make another one, lest they churn out an even worse monstrosity than this one.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Review,"The film follows Captain Jack Sparrow as he embarks on a new adventure to find the Fountain of Youth. Along the way, he encounters the ruthless Blackbeard (played by Ian McShane) and his daughter, Angelica (Pen√©lope Cruz), who has a complicated past with Jack. The plot also includes the Spanish, who are after the Fountain for their own purposes. Jack must navigate these competing interests, all while dealing with his own complex relationships with Angelica and his ever-present thirst for treasure. In summary, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides delivers the spectacle and action that fans expect from the franchise but struggles to capture the magic and charm of its predecessors, particularly in terms of character dynamics and story.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The new team is a familiar atmosphere,"""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Strange Tides"" in 2011 is the fourth film of the legendary franchise, which managed to surprise and conquer even the most skeptical viewers. I remember that I was very surprised that the creators were sending familiar characters to ""pirate"" again, and sometimes I thought that this new adventure might go sideways to the franchise, because the story of the trilogy was completed well on a decent note. Despite the fears that the sequel may not reach the level of the previous parts, the film, in my opinion, turned out to be extremely good and brought with it fresh ideas, exciting adventures and a new worthy story.One of the most pleasant surprises was the constant charisma of Captain Jack Sparrow, who was again brilliantly performed by Johnny Depp. His character, with all his eccentricities and unpredictability, finds himself back in the center of events, overgrown with new mysteries and intrigues. The film successfully plays on familiar motifs, while offering freshness and interest in what is happening.The plot of ""On Strange Tides"" offers to embark on a new exciting journey full of dangers and secrets. This time, Jack Sparrow finds himself involved in the search for the source of eternal youth, and both old acquaintances and new dangerous enemies stand in his way. A colorful antagonist appears in the film, the pirate Blackbeard, whose role was superbly performed by Ian McShane, who added a special gloomy atmosphere to the picture. I liked the character of Penelope Cruz. The actress presented a cool heroine who reveals some aspects of Sparrow's past. The image was truly a success.A memorable element of the film is the scenes with mermaids. An impressive song from the inhabitants of the underwater depths, accompanying their appearance, creates an atmosphere of mysticism and anxiety. The mermaids in this film are presented not just as mythical creatures, but as real predators, which adds tension and surprise to the plot. These scenes, filled with dynamics and visual beauty, became one of the highlights of the film.Director Rob Marshall, who took over the direction of this film, managed to bring new visual solutions to the franchise, while retaining the spirit of the previous installments. The cinematography and special effects are amazing, creating a stunning visual series that immerses the viewer into the world of pirate adventures with his head.It is worth noting that, despite the change of director and the departure of some key characters, the film has not lost its appeal. He offers the audience something new, while maintaining all the things that made the franchise so popular: humor, charismatic characters, exciting naval battles and an atmosphere of adventure.""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Strange Tides"" is a film that not only surpassed my skepticism about the fourth part, it really lived up to expectations and gave new impressions. The picture shows that even after several films, the franchise is able to surprise and delight its fans. This work once again immerses viewers in the world of pirate adventures and leaves behind a pleasant aftertaste, making them look forward to the continuation of the adventures of Captain Jack Sparrow.8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I could watch it numerous times and never get bored .",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
More CGI nonsense,"Just when you thought that the endlessly bloated PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN trilogy had finally finished, along comes yet another blatant exercise in money-grabbing by Disney. By now, half of the original cast have bailed, leaving the shameless Johnny Depp to headline things in another overlong, over-boring adventure.This time around, Depp teams up with a stilted Penelope Cruz in search of the fountain of youth, or some such thing. It's a pirate-fantasy re-run of INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE, with Ian McShane taking over from Sean Connery as the larger-than-life elder. Sadly, the wishy-washy storyline is simply an excuse for endlessly dull action sequences and pretty but insubstantial special effects.I've never been a fan of these films, not even the first, which I found to be a soulless and bloated Hollywood blockbuster, but ON STRANGER TIDES really takes the biscuit.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,"I was harboring a disappointed heart after watching this film in cinema, a 3D version, even though I had not laid a high expectation on this one, in any case it is the fourth installation within 10 years, together with the franchise's downhill path, On Stranger Tides doesn't have any chance to breakthrough and revive its fame.Firstly, the script lacks its appealing vigor while the interwove plots are too disorganized to handle (particularly the limited screen time and omitted introduction of the Spaniard's team, which abruptly left the audience heads in the clouds), and I was also keen to find out how all the money had been spent, sad to say that only the man-eating mermaids bring some freshness and could be ranked as a gratifying discovery. The special effects are merely served to fulfill their original functions here (which simply attests that they really spent tons of doughs instead of appropriating them into their own pockets), let alone to be visually impressive or mentally inspiring. The 3D effect could not save it (like Thor, I don't know why the hue is always so dark as to some scenes are beyond recognition).Speaking of the actors, Jack Sparrow's idiosyncratic personality is being way over-exploited, and his new love interest Penelope Cruz is not at her best state, the chemistry between was looming but never had really accomplished. a extended screen time of Geoffrey Rush's Barbossa solely causes him unreasonably abominable, Ian McShare has a dramatic opening as the evil Blackbeard, but very soon his character becomes preposterously ridiculous and will suffer the loss of credibility. Desperately, my only guilty pleasure comes from Judi Dench and Keith Richards' cameo.Although I may pessimistically point out that the Pirates of the Caribbean series is on its own dooming destiny, the fact is that after its first week global release, its overall box-office is on fire right now (particularly overseas main markets and China is of course included), so predictably the fifth one will not be mission impossible, I have one suggestion, please fire director Rob Marshal, don't entitle him to further ruin the golden-signboard of Disney Films anymore!",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
