Midnight in Paris,"Woody Allen's love affair with France, which goes back decades, finds its finality with ""Midnight in Paris,"" the latest of Allen's Parisian brochures, which recently opened at the Cannes Film Festival on Wednesday. The good news is that Allen seems to be paying attention in a way he hasn't always done in recent films, and has found a way to channel his often-caustic misanthropy, half-comic fear of death and anti-American bitterness into agreeable comic whimsy. The nominal point of ""Midnight in Paris"" is that we've all got to make the best of life in our own time while longing for a past that probably never existed. If anything, Allen seems to be rebuking himself, ever so mildly, for his compulsive romanticism, his obsession with the past and his disconnection from contemporary American life. Allen has baked us a sweet, airy Parisian dessert with just a sense of sentimental substance in the finish. One of his better films in his latter years.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
"Ah, they don't make them like this any more","I'd been meaning to watch Midnight in Paris for ages but, I have to confess, I was put off by the presence of Owen Wilson, who I could not really envisage as the lead in a Woody Allen film. He was actually surprisingly good though and did a decent job as the vessel from which Allen's brilliant dialogue could be heard. However, this is not an actor-driven film or even a story-driven film; its beauty lies in the simple but clever script and the easy-going laid-back style that you'd expect from a Woody Allen film all about nostalgia.To be fair, I can completely understand why there have been so many negative reviews of Midnight in Paris. There isn't a great deal going on superficially and the characters are all gloriously stereotypical. This doesn't matter though because, although the film is quite simple, it is at the same time wonderfully clever and thought-provoking. However, you do probably have to be in the right mood to watch it. I saw this film on a lazy Saturday afternoon and wasn't expecting too much, so when I was left both entertained and thinking about the past, the present and the future, it was a pleasant surprise. There are few films these days that still have you thinking about them several days later – this is definitely one of them. What do you want from life, with whom do you want to experience it, and why are we always so dissatisfied with where we are and what we've got? Like I say, quite thought-provoking!It's incredibly ironic that some critics go on about how Woody Allen films aren't anywhere near as good as they were back in the seventies and that he's a has-been pseudo-intellectual, when here he is making a film about nostalgia and poking fun at pseudo-intellectuals in both an obvious and also a more subtle manner. Midnight in Paris is full of self-parody and interesting contradictions, but not everything is immediately apparent and I believe that some viewers of the film may have simply taken it at face value and consequently been left thinking ""is that it then?"".On a slightly more negative side, I am perplexed that some people have praised the cinematography and the wonderful images of Paris in the light, in the dark and in the rain. To me, the use of colour and imagery are not too impressive and I would argue that Paris has looked far better in plenty of other films. The music can be a little annoying too – especially in the opening sequence, which seems to go on for ever!As I said before though, Midnight in Paris is primarily about the dialogue and the interesting ideas that it throws out to the audience. Catch them if you like, and run with them. It's a great easy-going relaxing film that'll hopefully leave you both entertained and thought- provoked.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Paris - where passion for living and for loving become your sole reality.,"Woody Allen's love letter to romance and Paris in the 1920s, with its nucleus of historic artists and writers drawn to the city by its beauty and irresistible forces of creative gravity.Human nature often pines for the romance and nostalgia of an earlier era, but one (hopefully) discovers that the ""golden age"" can be our world today, should we choose to recognize and explore its existence around us.One of Woody Allen's most universally appealing films laced with subtle humor, and memorable cinematography. The keys to his protagonist role are handed over to Owen Wilson for this excursion into a Parisian daydream fantasy (that sets sail every nite at midnight).Superb supporting cast delivers as does Allen's direction and pacing of the film - On my ""5 Favorite Woody Allen Films"" list, and highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Forever grateful,"I was, until half an hour ago, struggling with life, I graduated from my university last year and I haven't coped with this new life style, I kept feeling nostalgic and depressed and wishing to go back to the past because I liked it there, it really affected my life badly. Thia movie helped in a way I could never explain to you, helped me see things in a clearer way and more importantly helped me move on, I'm forever grateful to Owen Wilson and Woody Allen, thank you very much.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Allen's Dreams are Magical,"There's something about the midnight hour, something special, mystical, and magical. In the case of this marvelous movie, its impact is fully realized, as we see our protagonist suddenly realize that he has the opportunity to face that which he truly admires, treasures, and dreams about. In the opening scenes, he expresses his desire to settle in the city of lights, and we know it's not going to be an easy thing to do. His girlfriend and he are quite different in their appreciation of what being in Paris means. She understands it's special, maybe from an aristocrat's point of view. He might be looking at it, as the dream place for an artist to find aspiration to fulfill his artistic goals.One night, he wanders into the streets of Paris and finds himself lost, only to find himself rescue by a party of night socialites who turn out to be quite famous in some literary circles. Soon, the screenwriter/aspiring writer has an opportunity to see himself living one of his dreams as well as slowly come to some surprising epiphanies as he discovers more and more who his new acquaintances might truly be, and most important what their dreams really are.The film is set in several time periods, and Paris glows intensely and seductively in everyone of those. From its overcast skies and reflective streets, showing lovely architectural details and its magnificent landmarks to the superb and lovely recreations of older time periods, one can't help being seduced, charmed, and inspired to find a way to show what a special place, and consequently what a truly magical film this might be.Performances are outstanding all around, with Cotillard once again stealing every second she is on the screen. Through her eyes and carefully delivered lines, we understand what attracts us to this special time and place. She is a gorgeous and very talented performer, one who might be truly aware of her standing, yet she doesn't dwell on it. She attracts many types, but her philosophy is unique, move on, enjoy, live the moment. In a way, she is like the city that has inspired Allen, and many others before him. Paris as a place might not be aware of its magnetism, its beauty, and its power. Cotillard's muse is the perfect human equivalent, a dazzling and potent woman, who moves from man to man, place to place, time to time, and who surprises us with her own wishes near the end of the story.Wilson inhabits the Allen persona, and he does a very good job, not creating a tired imitation, an annoying cliché that could have ruined the perfect balance of sight, sounds, and insightful dialog, keeping this masterpiece way ahead of the best Allen has offered before. For those of us who gasped during the fantasy sequences of ""The Purple Rose of Cairo"", the marvelous recreations of the stage in ""Bullets Over Broadway"", the dissection of relationships in many of his best films, get ready to see it all finally come together, as he picks from the best, and adds his personal touch, with many a funny and clever observation, uttered by Wilson with a honest and complete sense of wonder. Unlike many of his leading men, Wilson displays an innocence which allows him and us to see his adventures in a fresh light.""Midnight in Paris"" is a beautiful display of what movie magic can truly create, a sense of wonder long gone from contemporary cinema; This is a movie that entertains, teaches, and wears each one of its elements, like Paris bewitches us with every light, every facade, and every heartbeat of its music.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
"""We'll always have Paris.""","""Paris, France is exciting and peaceful."" Gertrude SteinWelcome to the world of Woody Allen as he has always loved it: nostalgic, romantic, imperfect, and full of hope. Midnight in Paris is one of his finest treatises on the lure and delusions of the past: Like Zelig it depicts other times, like Purple Rose of Cairo it uses magic realism to deal squarely with the present. Allen has another of his surrogates, this time Gil (Owen Wilson),who virtually experiences the past (the twenties) while dealing with the troublesome present.Gil, engaged to marry Inez (Rachel McAdams), is with her and her parents on business in Paris where he hopes to work on his novel while he is still a successful Hollywood writer. Although she is a materialist who would like him to become wealthy to enjoy the life his parents are used to, he dreams of escaping the hack work of LA and living in the City of Lights for inspiration, just as his idols Fitzgerald and Hemingway did in the roaring twenties.Well, the twenties roar back to him as he experiences their friendship and the mentoring of Gertrude Stein, among just a few of the many expatriate luminaries he meets through the magic of nostalgia. Just one of the Allen signature touches that make him the equal of great European directors such as Rohmer and Godard is opening the film with music that reflects the allure of the twenties, the romance of Paris, and his abiding love for this city: ""Si Tu Vois Ma Mere"" by Sidney Bechet combines jazz, the clarinet, the twenties, and Allen with a romantic nostalgia.Owen Wilson catches the halting diffidence of the typical Allen persona without slavishly imitating him. Yet whatever little duplication Wilson employs endears as he sweetly visits his heroes, falls in love, and comes to terms with his writer's voice and his mismatched engagement. But that engagement is the troublesome present; the past offers the chance to experience history on a human level that only someone who writes for now and reveres the past can do.The magic and the realism, both requiring hard work from the protagonist, lead to surprising understanding of human nature, the delusion of nostalgia and Paris, and hope for a present that brings love and inspiration.""For all we know, Paris might be the hottest place in the universe."" (Gil)It's been at least a decade since I have enjoyed an Allen movie this much.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
one of my comfort films!!,"I absolutely adore this movie. All of the actors did such a wonderful job portraying all of the figures and the movie itself is just absolutely stunning. This movie just brings me so much comfort and happiness, it never fails to make me feel better (even if it's just a little bit) when I'm feeling low or sick. And yes- i know it's not the most amazing film but it's still a good one!",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Parisian Holiday,"""Do you think it's possible to love two women at the same time?,"" asks our protagonist Gil Prender to a tour guide discussed Auguste Rodin's love for his mistress and his wife. Like that's the first time we've heard that question in a Woody Allen movie. Infidelity, gorgeous women, and neuroticism are some of Allen's favorite motifs, so it's really not too much of a surprise that they all appear in Midnight in Paris.That said, Allen's rendition of those ideas feels fresh this time. Midnight in Paris is a sweet, fun romp through the art world of France. This light comedy may not have some of the heavier messages about adultery and art that previous Allen films have had, but Midnight in Paris is, nonetheless, an enjoyable exercise in allusion to the Lost Generation and artists of the 1920s.Midnight in Paris begins with the same idea of a man, in this case a screenwriter named Gil played by Owen Wilson, searching for connection with the real world. The protagonist is clearly a projection of Allen's self, but no matter. Gil is engaged to the Inez, played by a blond Rachel McAdams who coincidentally (or is it?) looks like Scarlet Johansson from Vicky Cristina Barcelona. Inez bores Gil with her pretentious friends and spiteful parents, which ultimately causes Gil to seek inspiration on his own time by drunkenly wandering that streets of Paris. One night, he is invited into a car that takes him back to the 1920s where he meets his favorite writers and artists, something that eventually leads to a breakthrough in his work. A large supporting cast includes Kathy Bates, Allison Pill, Adrien Brody, Michael Sheen, and Marion Cotillard.Allen's conception of Paris is just as romantic as the story itself. The film's physical look matches some of the complexities of the women in that it appears to be almost splashed in gold. It is, after all, the City of Lights. It's a beautiful movie that matches the pretty faces of its starring women.Allen's screenplay leaps right off the page thanks to his cast, but this too is something that isn't unusual for a Woody Allen film. At his best, Allen picks actors that play their parts with a sense of realism that, when combined with some elements of the fantastic, charm the audience. Just about everyone here manages to do just this, with the exception of Rachel McAdams, who tries her hardest with an underdeveloped character. Marion Cotillard is the best of the cast (as per usual) in her role as Picasso's mistress. She's bursting with sexuality yet she's grounded in her ability to deliver her dialogue with her natural French accent.Midnight in Paris is fantastique. In comparison to Woody Allen's previous tales of lust and spite, his newest film feels like a dessert rather than a filling entree, yet this is exactly how a good, highbrow summer movie should be. The cast shines just as bright as the lights at the top of the Eiffel Tower and Allen proves himself worthy of his place in society as a master director once again. By no means a classic, Midnight in Paris is a pretty little diversion, one that is grounded in a theatrical gimmick that totally works every time. This, along with The Tree of Life, will be one of a few summer movies that will dazzle visually (without explosions) and somehow manage not to insult the viewer's intelligence.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Midnight In Paris,"Midnight In Paris follows a young writer in a visit to Paris with his fiancée where he travels all nights ninety years back in time to get advise and friendship from the literary geniuses of the time. Yes, it's another film from Woody Allen, but this time is not as routinary as You Will Meet A Tall Dark Stranger or as cheeky as Vicky Cristina Barcelona. This shows Woody Allen at the standard he should be at every year. Original, funny, engaging and with some light meaningful message that we all relate to; what else can you ask from a film?The colors and cinematography of the film are more of the same of the post-Barcelona Allen, all beige and brownish, but he achieves a beauty in his portrayal of Paris that has not come from him since he first visited London with Match Point in 2005. It's also the most original screenplay he has written since, and the plot works and looks like one of his short stories, as a crazy, illogic and absurd showcase of gags and jokes.The performances are all fine, nothing stellar though, except for Adrien Brody's magnificent role as Salvador Dalí. Owen Wilson does a very good job but he tries too much to be and act like Woody Allen. The impersonations are all great -Hemingway,Picasso, Buñuel, Fitzgerald- they all look exactly the same than in real life.This is a film that will surely not disappoint any moviegoer or Allen fan. It's true that it doesn't come close to other of his better films, but it is a step forward from Vicky Cristina Barcelona, Cassandra's Dream, You Will Meet... and even Scoop and Whatever Works. Still, if you want to enjoy some true Woody Allen, go and see Annie Hall, Hannah And Her Sisters, Crimes And Misdemeanors, etc. This is not anything brilliant, but it is very entertaining, amusing and original; and it its a great time spent at the movies.Midnight In Paris is a surreal and touristic romantic comedy with clever comical gags, a creative story and a beautiful portrayal of the City of Lights.Rating: 3.5/5.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
"French Woody, at last!","The love between the French and the Americans has always been mixed with an element of dismissal even contempt but the love is real. Woody Allen walks that fine line in truly inspired fashion. ""Midnight in Paris"" is a delight. This is he first time I actually loved Owen Wilson. He is terrific as Woody's alter ego. Rachel McAdams superb. Her mean American girl is hilarious and frighteningly recognizably, so are Kurt Fuller and Mimi Kennedy as her parents. What a chillingly awful, normal pair. I loved the moment in which Owen Wilson, in a great close up, comes to accept what's happening around him. I accepted it too. Happily. Another stand out moment: the meeting with Salvador Dali, played brilliantly over the top by Adrien Brody. Highly recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
The Obvious Star is Paris!,"MIDNIGHT IN Paris sounds good on paper and looks in ads. The film opens with a long sequence of views of the sights in Paris - no actors, no story, just the breathtaking magnificence of the City of Light. For this viewer that section i the most rewarding of the entire film. Once the film starts Woody Allen imposes an improbable story with stereotype characters and with a few notable exceptions, it gets stuck in its own cuteness.VERY briefly screenwriter wannabe novelist Gil (Owen Wilson playing Owen Wilson) and his bride to be Inez (Rachel McAdams) are in Paris with Inez' parents (Kurt Fuller and Mimi Kennedy) who in turn are on a business trip. Inez is a bore: Gil wants adventure. As Inez sees the touristy places with her friends, the hideously boring pedantic Paul (Michael Sheen) and his flaky partner Carol (Nina Arianda), Gil escapes to walk the streets of Paris and fall in love with the history and the magic of the city. At the stoke of midnight he is picked up by an elegant car and is taken to the 1920s where he encounters Cole Porter (Yves Heck), Ernest Hemingway (Corey Stoll), F Scott Fitzgerald (Tom Hiddleston) and his Zelda (Allison Pill), Josephine Baker (Sonia Rolland), Alice B. Toklas (Thérèse Bourou-Rubinsztein) and Gertrude Stein (Kathy Bates), Picasso (Marcial Di Fonzo Bo) and his current flame Adriana (Marion Cotillard who seems to have phoned in her performance), Djuna Barnes (Emmanelle Uzan), Salvador Dalí (Adrien Brody - in probably the only convincing performance in the film), Man Ray (Tom Cordier), Luis Buñuel (Adrien de Van), TS Eliot (David Lowe) - in other words all the famous artists of the 1920s. Gil is captivated by the opportunity to share his work with these greats, though he finds it difficult to understand time travel. He falls for Adriana who in turn wishes she could live in the time of Le Belle Epoque so of course Gil and Adriana time travel again meeting Henri Matisse (Yves-Antoine Spoto), Toulesse-Lautrec (Vincent Menjou Cortes), Paul Gauguin (Olivier Rabourdin), and Edgar Degas (François Rostain) at Maxim's. Gil by day grows less enamored with Inez and by night more infatuated by Adriana and in the end there is a permanent schism between Gil and Inez and we are left with the moral 'Don't wish to live in another time than your own.'Sounds like a run through of famous names? It is. Wilson is inept at romantic comedy, and Woody Allen's script is fairly boring for Allen's works. BUT Paris is Gorgeous - and that is enough!Grady Harp",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Terrific!,"I loved this movie! It blends film noir with Stardust Memories, The Purple Rose of Cairo, and a bit of Annie Hall. The scenes of Paris were enough to make one fall in love. The music was superb! Having all the artists and writers show up was the ultimate name dropping contest! Their caricatures were hysterical! Casting Adrien Brody as Salvatore Dali was mind blowing, along with the surreal discussion about a rhino.I think Owen Wilson is the best Woody Allen by far. He has a kind of naivete that seems to fit perfectly with who Woody seems to be and the combination of Owen's good looks with Woody's humor is riveting!Of course the ""nostalgia"" theme and the -I really want to be somewhere else because it's too boring here- give the story a whole other layer of meaning. For we artists and writers it's one of the things that sparks our creativity, so I loved this discussion and the never ending unraveling the story provokes.

Speaking as an Allen virgin...,"As crazy as it may be, this is the first Allen film I have ever seen, and after watching this, I am definitely going to watch all of his others. This kind of film makes me wonder how we can be happy with rom coms where we know the films entire plot from the advert. I was completely caught by surprise at the romantic, clever, intriguing, funny, interesting and thoroughly well written script. I had no idea about the plot and was happily led by Wilson's character into the depths of Paris' magical midnight strike. Other actor's involved did a great job too. I was particularly impressed with McAdams as it just adds to her ability to play any role. I think overall I'm simply in awe at the film. It's a classic. A really refreshing idea, gently portrayed in an almost realistic way, like this French magic really does exist. The music and scenery adds to the charm of the film and the subtle humour is a nice touch too. I would definitely recommend this to anyone and will watch this over and over again for years to come.

Allen Is Back In Fine Form,"Woody Allen takes Paris and bathes it within its own glory all the while making one of his most entertaining films in decades. Great cinematography, classic music, french food, french culture and Allen's trademark humor are pure magic. You may see some of the familiar character types from other films, but they only add to the mixture. Odd man out is Owen Wilson, but somehow he sheds his B-movie past and encompasses the Woody Allen humor without mimicking Allen. The ever-evolving plot twists will have you laughing as well as entranced. This is the first Allen film (in a long time) where he doesn't pontificate about life and death, but only celebrates the present while ironically, living in two eras. This is beyond Oscar material.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Here's a Woody Allen movie I wanted to like...,"Because I heard such good things about it. I ended up liking the bits of music in the background, the look of Paris itself, and two of its principal actresses--Rachel McAdams and Marion Cotillard, both of whom played their roles to the hilt.But I had trouble with Owen Wilson's habit of ""slavishly"" portraying Woody Allen as the troubled central character who finds living in the past is giving him the kind of nostalgic glow he craves. It takes the full story to unwind before he finds a girl who likes to walk in the rain alongside him and is also an eager devotee of Cole Porter's romantic music. Wilson's imitation becomes tiresome before the first scene is over and from then on I had a hard time just trying to enjoy the film.Lots of name dropping goes on throughout the writer's story, once Wilson embraces the past at the magic hour of midnight. He meets F. Scott Fitzgerald, Zelda, Picasso, Gertrude Stein (a bored looking Kathy Bates), a macho Ernest Hemingway and a hilarious Salvador Dali adroitly played by Adrien Brody. There's a hit and miss aspect to the casting of these celebrated characters but they provide the right comic relief.But something seems wrong from the start, mainly due to the wrong casting of Owen Wilson as the protagonist. He seems as nervous and on edge as his mentor (Mr. Allen), but watching him is an uncomfortable experience.The film is slight but amusing, although hardly worthy of a Best Screenplay Oscar.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Midnight Magical Movable Feast,"It had to happen sooner or later, and finally it did. Woody Allen and Paris ""fell"" in love with each other, and, as the result, we, the viewers, received a precious gift from the master of subtle, intelligent and charming dra-medies, gentle and charming ""movable feast,"" the new movie ""Midnight in Paris "".I have been a fan of Woody Allen for long time and seen all his movies, those that he made, and those in which he starred or only wrote the screenplay for. I look forward to each of his films and I am ready to love them before I even see them. I knew I would like Midnight in Paris, but I had no idea how good it was. From the first frame, following the Darius Khondji's camera on such familiar but uniquely beautiful streets, alleys, boulevards and quays of the City of Light, it was hard not to fall in love with Paris and with the film of Allen, his love letter to the most famous city in the world, capital of love and Mecca for writers, artists, musicians and artists to whom Paris gave inspiration during all times and epochs - Belle Époque 1890s, the Golden days of the 1920s, and today, right now...Midnight in Paris is a delightful, kind (yes, this is Woody Allen), light, and charming film, which can be described as A Paris Midnight Magical Movable Feast. Paris in the film is beautiful during day light, night time, bright sun, and rainy hours. Oscar nominee, the master cinematographer of many remarkable films, including Panic Room, Se7en and Evita, Darius Khondji worked with Allen on three films: Anything Else (2003), Midnight in Paris (2011), and the next film, the Roman project Bop Decameron (2012).Soundtrack consists of Allen's favorite songs from the 1920s-30s by such songwriters as Cole Porter, Glen Miller, and Enoch Light, and from the repertoire of Josephine Baker and Juliet Greco. For the original film theme, Allen picked the guitar composition of the French jazz guitarist Stephane Wrembel ""Bistro Fada"". Wrembel's influence and source of inspiration has been the music of the famous French Gypsy guitarist Django Reinhardt, whose longtime fan and admirer is Woody Allen himself. According Wrembel, Allen was searching for a typical French-Parisian melody, reflecting the spirit and atmosphere of Paris. I can confirm that the film theme and the songs that Allen picked up for Midnight in Paris are important, integral component of the film's charm and add to the romantic and joyous feeling that the film brings to the viewers.As always, in Woody Allen's movies, the actors give uniformly good performances. Owen Wilson is very convincing and likable as Gil, Hollywood's successful screenplay writer who works on a first novel, a protagonist, a much younger, attractive, and funny Woody Allen stand-in. Adrien Brody played the best role since The Pianist (very small cameo, but memorable and hilarious). Kathy Bates was very believable as a famous literary critic and friend to the struggling talented writers and artists. Alison Pill was impressive as the bright, outgoing but showing the signs of instability wife of the celebrated American writer. I hardly recognized Corey Stoll but liked him a lot as another famous American writer. Watching Marion Cotillard, I had no problems believing that the character she played, Adriana, could have been the muse and the girlfriend of not just one but three amazingly and uniquely talented world renowned painters. Rachel McAdams (Inez, Gil's not so romantic fiancée), Kurt Fuller and Mimi Kennedy (Inez's parents on the business trip in Paris who don't seem to approve their daughter's choice), and Michael Sheen (Paul, Inez's pedantic and arrogant former boyfriend from college) were quite good as not very likable Americans. The First Lady of France, Carla Bruni appeared in a small role of a museum guide.The story itself was so lovely in using the time travel as the plot device and brought so many funny and sharp one-liners, dialogs and scenes as well as the plenty moments of recognizing the beloved literature and art figures of the past, that I sat and smiled happily during the whole film. Like I mentioned in the beginning, I expected to love the film even before I saw it and knew from the very first scene that I was in for something very special but my husband, who is much more reserved in his ratings and not often calls a film a masterpiece, used the word for Midnight in Paris and asked whether the film has won some prestigious prizes. Well, the awards season is several months away, but for me, and I am sure for all Woody Allen's fans, Midnight in Paris is a great prize from the writer/director.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Old Fashioned Fun!,"I love Woody Allen, so already I'm biased. But even I will admit that he's been spotty for the last...my God!...twenty years or so.

"Whimsical Allen and his time-traveling taxi-cab...lovely moments abound, though it is without charming characters","Owen Wilson plays a present-day Hollywood screenwriter and novelist on vacation in France with his fiancée and her parents; he's transported back in time to Paris in the 1920s by a magical taxi, where he meets legendary literary and artistic figures who help the writer put his work and his love-life into focus. Allen, who wrote and directed but does not star, is seemingly in love with Paris, and he appealingly uses fantasy to both confuse and clarify reality, but he's lacking interesting, wonderful central characters (a major problem which cools this confection out). Stepping in for Woody, Wilson doesn't have a dynamic screen presence--he fades into the foreground; Rachel McAdams is also disappointing, and the comedic scene involving her missing earrings (which should play fast and smooth) has a bland denouement. Allen's nostalgia for the past is fun for awhile, but he doesn't use it to build momentum; fairly soon, we're stuck in a revolving door of personalities and romantic couplings, sequences which have an attractive sheen but ultimately feel a little underwhelming.

"A film so mixed it requires a detailed review to ""summarise""","Woody Allen has done an excellent job in Midnight in Paris (MIP).There are a lot of special features about this movie. The dialogue (script), the acting, the score, the cinematography.Midnight in Paris provides a lot entertainment without essentially ""going anywhere."" It isn't an extraordinary story. It doesn't provide some deep meaningful message. It's merely a bunch of interesting dialogue mixed with outstanding acting put together to provide good entertainment.The kind of entertainment I speak of in MIP isn't the ordinary type of ""entertainment."" It's a rare kind of entertainment and can only be found in certain movies. Pulp Fiction is the other prime example that springs to mind. Although very different in genre and script, there was one broad striking similarity I noticed between the two movies. They both have no purpose, no story (or at least, the ""story"" is used as a scapegoat to present the desired script in the movie), there basically isn't any real ""reason"" to see the movie. It's just about nothing. But what both movies succeed to do is just make you watch the movie, immerse yourself in it, provide you with a different kind of ""comedy."" It isn't comedy that makes you laugh out loud (for the most part) and it isn't failed comedy. It's the kind of comedy where you simply get subtle enjoyment from, you let out an occasional smirk or smile, but the smirk isn't necessarily in relation to the a specific comment in the movie, rather it's a smirk signifying your quiet enjoyment towards the film generally. You can sit there continuously for hours and days following repeated viewings of the film and not get bored simply because its so enjoying to watch. That's the kind of entrainment MIP offers and for the very same reason, it will attract negative attention from certain viewers, but not from me.Next, the cinematography. Oh my gosh! I could have given this movie a 10 without the rest of the movie being so good. I, having visited Paris, for unfortunately not too long a period, fell in love with the city. It is the most romantic and beautiful city I have ever seen. It really is the city of love and all expectations were not only as good, but better. I hold this thought even though some friends I know of have had, well, not as great an experience as myself.Woody manages to capture the beautiful presence of Paris like no other director. I felt like I was back in Paris and it sometimes managed to put a chill down my spine because of the amount of beauty I was both witnessing and remembering. I really can't say anymore about the cinematography except that it is the best, it is flawless, it is exceptional and if you have ever been to Paris and loved it, you'll definitely love this movie.Moving onto the acting, I'll settle this briefly. Although MIP has a lot of very solid small roles (Rachel McAdams was very average, but I think that's how her character was intended to be), Owen Wilson is the complete stand out. Although I can't quote statistics, I think this may be the first movie Owen Wilson has been in which has scored and 8+ on IMDb. To put this bluntly, I'm not an Owen Wilson fan. I generally don't like his comedy. But in MIP I have never met any other actor who fits the lead role so perfectly. To put it metaphorically, Owen fits into MIP like a glove. I have never seen such an flawless representation of Woody Allen himself. Owen is Woody. And therein lies the perfection of his acting. He barely needs to act, because I know all he's doing is being himself and dishing out lines given to him, but it fits so perfect with a Woody image. All in all, MIP is Woody Allen movie, with a Woody Allen touch, a Woody Allen script, a Woody Allen cinematography and a Woody Allen leading actor.Unfortunately, I can't express a very specific audience to which I would recommend this movie to. If you have been to Paris and loved it, chances are you will love it. It captures the beauty, the fashion, the culture and personality of Paris like it really is Paris. However, like I stated before, the dialogue in this movie and the ""story"" and ""purpose"" is something which will attract mixed feelings. I, for one, absolutely loved it. All I can say is that, if you agree with my comments above or if they touch an emotional nerve, then the chances of this movie doing the same to you is very high.It is nothing too special. It doesn't provide a great message. It doesn't have a extraordinary story. But it provides for a rare kind of entertainment, coupled with exceptional cinematography and for these reasons, I cannot give any less than a 10.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
"Bravissimo, Monsieur Woody!","I had been eagerly anticipating Midnight in Paris ever since it came out. The concept seemed interesting, the cast on paper were great and I loved a lot of Woody Allen's early work(Annie Hall, Manhattan and Crimes and Misdemeanours come to mind). And I wasn't let down at all.To me Midnight in Paris is Allen's most sustained and most enjoyable movie in about 15 years. I personally would've loved for it to have been a tad longer, however with that there is much to like about Midnight in Paris.Starting off so promisingly with a gorgeous opening montage, one of my personal favourite beginnings to a Woody Allen movie actually, Midnight in Paris with its striking locations/scenery, beautiful colours and skilled cinematography is a very well made movie.Also, its soundtrack has a nostalgic and appropriately romantic feel to it. And the story is always interesting, it is splendidly dotty in its construction which ensures it is never overly-comic or overly-serious, but what made the story interesting for me were the literary and painterly references, it helps to know some of them but even those I didn't know were done in an informative rather than heavy-handed way.The characters like with many other Allen movies are examples of those you are not sure whether you would like, but learn to by the end. Owen Wilson's character is particularly true to this. Allen's direction is always assured, but aside from the opening montage and the references Midnight in Paris's remarkable selling point was the script, the comedy is savvy, the romantic elements are yearning and the questions asked are done in an affectionate manner.I don't have much to criticise the acting either. Owen Wilson in the central role was unexpected casting for me, but it was unexpected casting that paid off for he is delightful here. Rachel McAdams is suitably shrewish and Marion Cotillard is alluring and intelligent. Michael Sheen and Kathy Bates are rock-solid as usual.Overall, a wonderful movie. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
"A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: Woody Allen's ode to the City of Love, and its most celebrated denizens of the past","Midnight in Paris is a subtle romantic drama with a comical touch that has a little bit of almost everything: be it magic-realism, romance, phantasm, voyeur, surrealism or even noir. It wouldn't be a hyperbole to proclaim that everything that Woody Allen learned and gained during his long stint in cinema culminated in form of Midnight in Paris – An ode to the City of Love, and its most celebrated denizens of the past. Driven by the very impetus that gives cinema its resonant charm, Woody Allen the auteur has seen his art go from strength to strength, taking new shapes and forms, being completely oblivious of the existence of his larger than life alter ego, Woody Allen the showman, whose stimulating works have been a treat for us all for last so many decades, and who himself has been a force to reckon with, right throughout his long and illustrious career that still seems to be in its prime.I have grown up watching works of legendary Dev Anand, whose iconic movie career spanned well over six decades. Being an Indian, I guess it comes naturally to one! The first that I heard of Woody Allen was when someone eloquently referred to Dev Sahab as the Indian Woody Allen. It indeed seemed revolting! A showman, whom not only you but also your grandparents have grown up watching being compared to some run-of-the- mill movie maker form the Occident. But, it did succeed in getting me hooked. Today, I find the comparison to be much more apt. Dev Sahab was oblivious to the changing trends in the India Cinema, and remained royal to his idiosyncratic style. The same can be said about Mr. Allen, who became the champion of a resurgent parallel stream in American Cinema— inspired by the avant garde works of European auteurs like Federico Fellini and Ingmar Bergman—while others kept busy figuring out their new roles in rapidly changing American movie circles.Marion Cotillard and Owen Wilson in Midnight in Paris Vintage Woody Allen, watching Midnight in Paris is like savoring the great city of Paris from the eyes of Mr. Allen himself. Midnight in Paris made an emphatic debut at the 2011 Cannes Festival, and succeeded in leaving a lasting impact on most of those present at the screening. During a press conference at Cannes, Woody Allen had said that he wanted to show the city of Paris emotionally, and wanted it to be the way he himself sees it, and he indeed succeeds in fulfilling his dream by bringing the city to life, thanks to his perspicacious eye.Midnight in Paris presents a chapter in the life of a successful but disillusioned Hollywood screenwriter, Gil Pender (Owen Wilson), who yearns to break the shackles of monotony by writing a fiction novel, but is perplexed by his slender prospects as a writer beyond the glamour and razzmatazz of the sequestered world of Hollywood, while he is out on a vacation to the breeding ground of creativity and talent, Paris, and accompanying him are his ravishing fiancée, Inez (Rachel McAdams), and his affluent future in-laws. The perfunctory relationship that Gil shares with his fiancée seems to be a result of Inez' perpetually disinterested outlook towards Gil's ambition of graduating into a full- fledged writer by making a foray into fiction writing. The beauty of Midnight in Paris is that it poses several questions, and while many of them may be answered in the due course of the movie, the true onus truly lies with the viewer to fathom the reality based on his own understanding. One major question that would continuously perplex the viewer is whether it is the yearning for creativity or the want for true love or the search for something even more profound that's haunting Gil?Midnight in Paris has loads to offer even to the average viewer, especially to ones who are willing to delve deep into realm of the unknown to savor the real delight that awaits them. The dreamlike sequences that depict Gil interacting with the likes of Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Salvador Dali, Luis Bunuel, and Pablo Picasso are an absolute treat to watch. While I greatly admire Hemingway and Fitzgerald for their indelible contribution to English Literature, I just absolutely idolize Luis Bunuel not only as a Surrealist, but also as a movie maker par excellence. Who can dare to overlook Bunuel's decorated oeuvre right from his maiden venture, An Andalusian Dog (1929), which he collaborated with another pioneer Surrealist, Salvador Dali to his surrealistic magnum opuses, The Exterminating Angel (1962), to which Mr. Allen pays a tribute in the movie, and The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie (1972), which won the Best Foreign Picture Oscar for the year?Woody Allen's inspired direction and inciteful screenplay are well complemented by a very fine ensemble of support cast that includes the likes of Kathy Bates and Adrien Brody. The music and cinematography are awe-inspiring to say the least. Owen Wilson and Rachel McAdams perfectly fit in their respective caricatures, and the charming presence of Marion Cotillard adds a whole new spark to the movie. Midnight in Paris has already managed to bag a handful of accolades, and the Oscar nomination is indeed an icing on the cake. Midnight in Paris crosses genres, and presents cinema at its most colorful, while also serving to be a delightful cinematic experience that has something for almost everyone. 9/10http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Pretty good,"An enjoyable, if slight, Woody Allen comedy. I probably would have enjoyed this more on video than in the theater, however. I don't think there has ever been a film that invited more forced laughter than this one. It's funny, but rarely laugh-out-loud funny. But you wouldn't know that from the audience, who guffawed at the mere appearance of Henri Matisse. The one person in the audience besides me to have heard of The Exterminating Angel made sure to let me know by her laughter during the film's very unfunny Marvin Berry moment. Of course, everyone cackled loudly when Salvador Dali popped up. So everyone by now knows the story: Owen Wilson, playing the Woody Allen surrogate, plays a Hollywood writer entranced with the city of Paris during his trip there. He's annoyed by his stuffy future-wife (Rachel McAdams) and her even stuffier parents (Kurt Fuller and Mimi Kennedy). During a midnight walk through the city, he gets picked up by an old automobile and transported to Paris of the 1920s, where he meets F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald (Tom Hiddleston and Alison Pill), Ernest Hemmingway (Corey Stoll), Gertrud Stein (Kathy Bates), Pablo Picasso (Marcial di Fonzo Bo) and other famous figures from the era. He also meets Picasso's current girlfriend, played by Marion Cotillard, and falls for her. Not surprising how quickly he would leave McAdams, who plays such an awfully detestable shrew it's hard to believe anyone even remotely like Wilson's character would put up with her for over two minutes, let alone propose to her at some point. McAdams and her parents are so awful that any sequence that takes place in the present are borderline painful. Fortunately, the sequences where Wilson visits the past, as annoyingly congratulatory as they are, are quite delightful. Wilson ain't half bad, and Cotillard, as always, is enchanting. Most of the historical figures are kind of fun to hang out with. Who wouldn't want to hear Ernest Hemmingway talk about hunting lions all night long? Of course, it helps that Paris really is beautiful, and Allen films it with a fine eye.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

"A man's wish and dreams of a new setting, leads to an illusion of a past era that shows his current future wasn't meant to be.","I'm not the greatest Woody Allen fan in the world, yet I must say with his latest ""Midnight in Paris"" it's offbeat, funny and strange enough to prove life can be interesting and misleading. It's showcase of wanting to dream and the wish for a change can lead to an illusion to prove that your current fate wasn't meant to be! Also a nice eye candy treat is the work and performance from the sexy Rachel McAdams(one of the big screens most enjoyable pleasures to watch). As with typical Allen he keeps it offbeat and funny, he proves that life, love and relationships are complex, and most of all fate is unexpected and life can start anew.Set in the capital of France the to be married young couple Gil(Owen Wilson)and Inez(in a sexy performance by the hot and cute Rachel McAdams)have came along with Inez's parents to adventure the city and take the French culture. And one by one the arts and buildings, museums, galleries, and fine wine eateries are a delight. Yet as Inez aside from being a hot and sexy lady enjoys the material side of France, her love Gil an author falls in love with the setting he wants to live in France! He doesn't want the California rich sun life that Inez does.So one night while strolling the city Gil has an illusion he's taken back to 1920's France! It's with this strange meeting and with many more trips back in time he sees France is more and more meant for him and the love thing with Inez just wasn't meant to be.

where have all the good times gone?,"Unfortunately, one do miss a quality Woody Allen movie these days. Midnight in Paris: beautiful shots of Paris but no serious plot. Yes, many acclaimed stars, but no acting.Nostalgia is fine but this is very fake. I watched the film with my mind sending the relevant past clips from other beautiful Woody Allen films like Manhattan, Purple Rose of Cairo, Radio Days, even Vicky Cristina Barcelona. But bringing them together does not make a nice movie.I love rain in Paris but not like the last scene where the rain pours over only the cast not the bridge; is it cost-saving?And after all, why do we need Owen to mimic Woody?",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
An Ode to Nostalgia and Art,"¨That Paris exists and anyone could choose to live anywhere else in the world will always be a mystery to me.¨ Woody Allen has directed more than 40 films in over four decades and I can honestly say that his last film is one of my favorites. If you think otherwise then you are just probably living in nostalgia and trying to remember the past as being much better than the present. Like Micheal Sheen's character would say: ¨Nostalgia is denial - denial of the painful presentthe name for this denial is Golden Age thinking – the erroneous notion that a different time period is better than the one ones living in.¨ Woody Allen has directed numerous great films and this is one of them that will be remembered nostalgically in years to come. It is not a romantic film as we are used to seeing, it is more of a nostalgic film; the true romance isn't between Wilson and McAdams, but between Wilson and Paris, between Wilson and art. The romance is in the city, in the art, in the past. The central theme of this film is clear: nostalgia. Woody Allen manages to deal with these issues in a very comedic way and the dialogue and story is just great. Midnight in Paris is a very funny and nostalgic film. The city of Paris may have never looked as great as it does in this movie. The characters are memorable and it is interesting how Allen intertwines the present with the past and makes fun of some of the stereotypes these artists have. I had a great time with Midnight in Paris; Woody Allen has done it again! Gil (Owen Wilson) and Inez (Rachel McAdams) are an American engaged couple who are visiting Paris with Inez's parents, John (Kurt Fuller) and Helen (Mimi Kennedy). Gil instantly falls in love with the city and the rich story it has to tell, while Inez on the other hand doesn't like Paris that much. Gil insists they should move to Paris once they get married, but Inez would rather stay in Beverly Hills where Gil has had success writing scripts for Hollywood films. Gil is unhappy with his Hollywood life and has decided to try his luck on writing a novel. Inez insists he should stick to what he does best. In Paris, Inez runs into some friends: Paul (Michael Sheen) and Carol (Nina Arianda). Paul is a very pedantic sort of guy who always has an opinion on everything and is showing off his great knowledge. Gil can't stand him, but Inez insists on hanging out with him and his wife Carol, and asks Paul to critique Gil's novel for him. One night the couples decide to go out and dance, but Gil says he's too tired and decides to head back to the hotel on his own. While wondering the streets of Paris the clock strikes midnight and a group of French partygoers invite Gil to a party. In this party, Gil runs into Zelda (Alison Pill) and Scott Fitzgerald (Tom Hiddleston), and Ernest Hemingway (Corey Stoll). Gil realizes that somehow he has travelled to 1920 and is meeting all these artists who he's admired all his life; he's in the decade he considers as being the Golden Age. Ernest tells Gil that he can get Gertrude Stein (Kathy Bates) to proofread his novel for him; but when Gil goes to get his novel he is back in 2010. Gil realizes that he can only travel back in time when the clock strikes midnight, so the adventure begins every night where he meets interesting people like Picasso (Marcial Di Fonzo) and his mistress Adriana (Marion Cotillard) who he falls for, and other great artists such as Salvador Dali (Adrien Brody) and Luis Buñuel (Adrien de Van), among others.The true heart of the film relies on Owen Wilson's performance. He is great in this movie and reminded me a lot of the younger Woody Allen who used to star in his own movies. The funniest moments of the film have to do with these stereotypes that these great artists of the past have been given. Adrien Brody is great as Salvador Dali, and the rhinoceros scene is extremely funny; Corey Stoll is equally great playing the courageous Ernest Hemingway. His dialogue with Wilson's character about love and death is powerful and funny at the same time. Marion Cotillard and Owen Wilson also had great chemistry together and it was fun to watch them on screen. McAdams is one of my favorite actresses, and this time she plays sort of the villain, instead of the sweet role she is used to playing. This is a much different role from the one Wilson and McAdams played in Wedding Crashers. Midnight in Paris is just a terrific movie, with a lot of heart, and Woody Allen proves once again that he is a great director and writer. I absolutely recommend this movie as one of the best the year has had to offer.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
It was better back then,"The plot is simple. Wilson's character is a former screenwriter who's crafting a novel that he hopes to monetize. At the same time, he yearns to be living the 1920's where he could've rubbed shoulders with the literary geniuses of the day to inspire his novel. The Paris lights enchant him, to be sure. He wishes he could be there all the time, far away from his nagging fiancee and narrowminded, materialistic in-laws. He's grown tired of modern life. One night, he's transported to the past. And that's how it all starts!Many people complain about the plot being too slow, shallow characters, no action or exciting sequences, etc. But I think there's more to a movie than just intro-lead up-climax-resolution. The scenes of Paris, the limelight, the music, and the cinematic lighting are all very charming. It feels like you're actually there. And the dialogues are so genuine. The characters' speech has a fun, alluring flow (this is how I felt watching The Network--the lethargic plotline can be drab for some, but the individual dialogues and performances shine). MiP is overall a heartwarming film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Classic,"Midnight in Paris! Omg, I've watched this movie so many times. One of my absolute favorites. The concept to the movies is so amazing! The scenery and the details within the movie are so precise. I'm a huge fan of classical art and music so seeing the angle they took into making that part of this movie is great. The main story line itself is a bit tragic and heartbreaking. However as you see it unfold, it all comes together very well. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys classic art, music, romance, fantasy, and even passion. This movie is a must watch. It is also very family friendly.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
"A fresh take on the done-to-death themes of love, Paris, and time-travel.","This is not a romantic comedy. Romantic comedies are incredibly stupid, and this was actually quite intelligent.I didn't know the plot of this movie coming in, and I was pleasantly surprised to see that the time travel theme was not overtly gimmicky, with humor not entirely derived from the awkwardness of people from two different eras coming together. The stupefied utterances of ""What? We're where? You're WHO?"" were kept to a minimum from the protagonist, thankfully, and not seen at all from the historical characters. Since the movie does not focus on a fish out of water aspect, the time travel serves as a literal picture of the pursuit of ""the golden age"" that people nostalgically view various eras throughout history.Put into the eye of Gil's romantic view of Paris, we are given generous, gorgeous views of the city both past and present, with a great amount of detail put into sets that are seen for no more than a few minutes. The historical figures are amusing, providing some excellent one- liners, the more you know about the time period, the better.Owen Wilson could pull off the naive character well, Rachel McAdams was nearly too perfect as the annoying one, and Marion Cotillard of course, was very French.Overall, the movie might have been a tad formulaic, and the characters bit flat. This movie is light, visually stimulating and enjoyable, yet it presents its material with enough depth to make us think about humanity's desperate longing for a past that never was.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
"Past, Paris and past Paris. Love reviewed in the rain","Midnight in Paris is a wonderful work, full of passion and soul. As expected, Woody Allen shows you Paris though the eyes of love, but mostly through they eyes of a nostalgic all time tourist, in Paris.The direction is wonderful, as is the general acting. In my point of view, Owen Wilson could have done a better work. He often seems more idiotic than lost, and he keeps delivering the lines as he would in any other movie he played.The plot if really entertaining. It creates the illusion it was intended for, and, although, the ending might seem predictable the conclusions and the message itself is not.Not one of the best movies, not even one of the best of Woody Allen, but it is what it promises to be, time and place, love and life, questioned and answered wonderfully.

Should have shown the script to Hemingway,"I picked this DVD up in a backstreet, but when I got it home Paris Hilton was nowhere to be seen! Swindlers, I tell you! Okay, okay, this is Woody Allen's latest and again, another 'return to form'. My sister said it was delightful, but she had no expectations. Any UK guy might recall a BBC comedy called Goodnight Sweetheart from the 1980s in which a young man steps into a pub and finds himself back in the 1940s, where he meets and falls in love with a belle from back then, committing a kind of time-travellers adultery. This has a similar theme only it's an American Owen Wilson (who looks not wholly unlike Nicholas Lyndhurst) who gets in a Rolls and finds himself back in Paris in the 1920s, his ideal time.It's a decent premise. I didn't take to the film however. It has lovely opening shots of Paris, but the cinematography is very plain and grainy and Woody's style is very point and shoot throughout. Don't expect much depth here. Wilson falls into the trap of just imitating Woody, like most his leading men do, and it's a distraction. Actually, I thought Johnny Galecki from The Big Bang Theory would have been excellent in the role, as he has real comic chops and I'm not sure Wilson does really.Michael Sheen (Blair) turns up as a pompous bore, the sort you see in Allen's films sometimes, and gets plaudits for being wholly unlike his Blair persona. Initially you find yourself thinking that talk of him being a Bond villain is really not wide of the mark at all. Until, that is, you realise that he's doing another of his impersonations - it's a young Anthony Hopkins. Again, Sheen is not bad, but doesn't really nail the humour of the situation, though it gets indulgent audience titters.The scenes where our hero finds himself in 1920s Paris lack authenticity and is all too broadly drawn for my taste, with Hemingway seeming a real bore and the whole thing might as well be set in a 1920s themed speakeasy bar in Shoreditch. All these literary legends of the time take to Wilson, though he seems to bring nothing to the party at all, has nothing of interest to say to them. And you never get much sense of why he might feel disillusionment for the time: wouldn't a neurotic like Allen realise that they never washed their hands after using the john back then? What about the casual racism of the time? The smoke, the dirt in the air? It's all rather superficially done. As Hemingway says at one point, it doesn't matter what the story is, so long as it's told well, and I don't think this was told very well.Carla Brunei puts in a good cameo, she's actually quite good.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

The plot has just the right amount of mystery to keep me interested and even has some important points about living your life in the past. All the performances were excellent with Owen Wilson and Marion Cotillard getting top marks from me.

It Glows.... Literally,"All men fear death. It's a natural fear that consumes us all,"" says a character in ""Midnight in Paris"" ""However, when you make love with a truly great woman, one that deserves the utmost respect in this world and one that makes you feel truly powerful, that fear of death completely disappears."" Paris is her name. She has seduced writers for centuries, and in ""Midnight in Paris"" writer/director Woody Allen makes love to her with his camera, in the most poetic of ways.  Or perhaps he's referring to art, to achieving such intimacy with your craft and such artistic climax that you become immortal, like Hemingway, Matisse, Fitzgerald, Picasso, Dali, or Allen himself.Gil Pender, the protagonist in Allen's new film, has never experienced that kind of artistic height. Played quite convincingly by Owen Wilson (in a surprising and refreshing role that Allen had to re-write for him), Gil is an aspiring novelist who is visiting Paris with his girlfriend (Rachel McAdams) and her parents. But while they prefer to shop and visit museums, Gil chooses to wonder about. ""No work of art can compare to a city,"" he says.Pender is actually mesmerized by the City of Lights and fantasizes about what he believes was Paris' Golden Age, the 1920s with the Lost Generation of American writers walking its streets, writing in sidewalk cafés, and frequenting smoky bars and flamboyant parties. One evening at midnight, trying to find his way back to the hotel, something magical happens to Gil. Really! But no reviewer should give that magic away.Getting lost in the city seems to be a symbol for how lost he really is, as a person and as a writer, and although he's somewhat insecure and anxious (he even carries a bottle of Valium with him), he's actually a likable guy and soon meets a few bohemian friends (played by Marion Cotillard, Kathy Bates, Adrien Brody, among others) who give him much-needed advice about life and the creative process.   From the beginning, ""Midnight in Paris"" grabs you with its witty and sophisticated dialogue about art, culture and literature, and in the second half the dialogue gets even better. For instance, my favorite line comes from one of the bohemian characters, who believes that: ""the job of the artist is not to succumb to despair but to find an antidote for the emptiness of existence."" Another piece of wisdom comes from one of the antagonists who criticizes Gil for being infatuated with the past: ""Nostalgia is denial  a flaw in the romantic imagination of people who find it difficult to cope with the present."" Think about that one while watching the film, for I believe, there lies the moral of this fabulous fable about the past and the present.At age 75—with more than 40 films under his belt—Allen has created a film that literally glows. Its dazzling cinematography, inventive plot, and Parisian score, combined with the top-notch acting and set-design, makes for an almost-perfect film, one that's not only clever and thought-provoking, but also entertaining and accessible—even to mainstream audiences",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Incredible,"This is easily one of my favorites! I love this movie to death, it's funny, insightful, passionate, meaningful, romantic. The directing is glorious, considering how flashy and dumb it could have been, Woody Allen makes this story seem so real and it comes so naturally. The cinematography is jaw dropping and the score is absolutely wonderful. You can just tell how much everyone working on this project was passionate about it and wanted to make it the best it could be. All the performances were astounding, and ensemble cast with not one standing out as an actor during the experience and easily Owen Wilson's best performance in my opinion. This film is so different and original and it plays it off so normal. There is a reason the film won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. The dialogue was excellent, feeling very real and as if characters were actually just people talking. The film inspires me as an artist, it really tries to be art and about art. But more than that: it is about love, understanding, dreams, our past and so much more! This film is so quirky but so beautiful at the same time. It is something that I would suggest anyone watch because my god is this film amazing!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

Further, the romantic Gil believes that the golden age of Paris was in the 20's and he loves to walk on the rain through the streets of the City of Light.When the shallow Inez meets her former boyfriend, the pseudo-intellectual Paul (Michael Sheen) with his girlfriend Carol (Nina Arianda), they spend sometime together visiting touristic places. In the night, they drink wine in a party and Paul invites the couple to go dancing with Carol and him. However, Gil prefers to return walking alone to the hotel. At midnight, an old car stops and the passengers invite him to go a party and sooner he realizes that he is back to the 20's, where he meets his favorite writers, musicians and artists and lives his dream.""Midnight in Paris"" is another little masterpiece of Woody Allen, who returns to the genre of fantasy of ""The Purple Rose to Cairo"" to disclose his alter-ego Gil that falls in love for Paris. The metaphoric tale uses the magic of Paris to help the writer Gil to find his connection with the unsatisfactory real world and to live the life that he really wants. He learns that what would be the golden age for him, might not be for those who live in those years since life is not perfect at all.The film begins with a tour through the wonderful Paris, and has a marvelous cinematography unusual in Woody Allen's films. The performances are top-notch, with cameo of great actors and actresses, but I loved Owen Wilson, who is speaking in the same way Woody Allen does, Marion Cotillard and Kathy Bates.The soundtrack with (1) Let's do it – Cole Porter; (2) Si tu vois ma mère – Sidney Bechet; (3) You do something to me – Cole Porter; (4) Ain't she sweet – Enoch Light and the Light Brigade (5) Charleston – Enoch Light and the Light Brigade; (6) La Conga Blicoti – Jospéhine Baker; (7) You've Got That Thing – Cole Porter (8) Cancan – Offenbach; and (9) Parlez moi d'Amour – Juliette Greco; is nostalgic and magnificent. There are many jokes and my favorite is Gil suggest Buñuel to think about a film with aristocrats trapped in a room without finding a way out. However, this film demands a minimum culture and sensitivity to be appreciated and this is probably the reason of a few bad reviews. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Meia-Noite em Paris"" (""Midnight in Paris"")Note: On 23 November 2016, I saw this film again.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
"Quality Cinema, Fun Movie, But A Few Things Missing.","Its Woody Allen shooting a movie about the struggles of 'the artist' in Paris. It can't be bad, and it isn't bad. But just how good is the film? My answer: pretty good, but far from great.Allen fixates upon the city as the muse of artists both past and present. His opening shots of Paris set the stage for the ongoing love affair his protagonist Gill (Owen Wilson) has with the city and the city's rich history as fertile ground for artistic endeavor. Owen as Gill, succeeds in playing a struggling writer who is trying to escape his success as a Hollywood actor in cookie-cutter movies. He waxes poetic to his fiancée, Inez (Rachel McAdams) about his desire to leave Pasadena and relocate to Paris permanently. This is where Allen creates the initial tension for our protagonist. Gill wants to walk the streets that Fitzgerald and Hemingway and Picasso walked. He wants to be a real artist, and he is confronted with this growing realization while trying to plan a life with Inez, who is the rich, soulless American caricature of Hollywood emptiness.On his midnight walks, Wilson delves into the Paris of the 1920s and with each evening he is pushed away from the reality of a life with Inez toward a life of Parisian wistful inspiration. Allen juggles some difficult plot devices that are wholly unbelievable but nonetheless enjoyable. To say that the 20s ""come to life"" for Wilson would be both physically and psychologically accurate. All the while, his fiancée and her Republican parents and snooty friends question his actions, spurn his artistic flightiness and serve to establish the materialistic sadness that blinds people from the sights that Gill cherishes, the beauty and inspiration of Paris that can't be discovered in the Museum but, instead, must be sought out on its streets, preferably in the rain.The theme of the present day artist yearning for the past glory periods of art whether it be the 1920s or 1890s is force fed to the viewer. Allen builds this theme up and slowly questions it as the movie drifts onward, but in delivering a verbal and concise conclusion on the issue, I felt he left little to the audiences imagination.Additionally, the conflict we want from an Allen movie, the inner turmoil, the multiple plot line craziness, the sexual and sensual aspects, all of these cinematic fingerprints that identify an Allen movie are largely washed out in this film. There is a growing sense of flow to the film that allows the viewer to know which way the wind is blowing and how things will conclude, and when they finally do, it makes for a nice story of art winning the day, but it lacks the whirlwind emotions so frequently associated with a Woody Allen movie. For literature fans, for Allen fans, and for general movie fans, its worth a viewing, but its not a mind blowing film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Most Original & Visionary Screenplay,"Woody Allen seems to be in his element after a long long while...a well deserved pause and I must say what an intellectual pause eh! A fabulous screenplay,the most original I have encountered till to date. Shooting Paris la' Manhattan was anticipated but execution is unpretentious...a difficult task in this age of high end computer graphics tantalizingly at your beck and call. Casting of '1920s Greats' was to the ""T"". 'Rhinoceros' Dali is the manifestation of wicked wicked Allen and you can imagine the understated 'throat clearing' pause from Woody whilst writing and filming 'Rhinoceros' scenes..Am a great fan of Woody and my bias may be glaring but I am proud of it. More power to him and his ilk. Am in nervous anticipation as to when he writes a script based on Indian sensibilities?!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

A Masterpiece,"I think Woody Allen is the greatest American screenwriter and director of this age - That if you can call him a director he admittedly does nothing but let the actors free to do their work, which is probably his greatest quality.He's been honing his skills for a long time now and at this point in his life has made countless works of art. He was close to perfection with Vicky Christina Barcelona, but perhaps that movie was way too passionate. The Purple Rose of Cairo was a great fantasy, but maybe too sugar coated. I think this time he got the recipe right. The movie is simple, but perfect.From the opening images you get the feeling he is up to some greatness. Mr. Allen presents us with a very unique and intimate portrait of Paris he shows us the roofs, the cafés, the people walking on the rain. All from very singular perspectives. A Paris I never seen on the postcards Images of the City of Lights that makes you feel you are there.The movie goes on unpretentious as Owen Wilson's character and adorable as Marion Cotillard's Adriana. A delicate masterpiece that I enjoyed for every second and as some great actors played some of my favorite artists in history, I slowly tasted every single little piece of it like a delicacy, hoping it would never end. This one deserves 10 stars.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
"MIDNIGHT IN Paris (Woody Allen, 2011) ***","This easily constitutes Allen's best work since MATCH POINT (2005), also signaling a welcome return to the historical/time-travel themes of ZELIG (1983) and THE PURPLE ROSE OF CAIRO (1985) respectively. Though it appears that Allen is meeting an increasing dearth of actors to work with (his films are usually peppered with top talent), it is admirable how this essentially modest company still manages to sink its teeth into his typically verbose, neurotic and amazingly informed script! By the way, I was surprised to see a plethora of Spanish companies behind this film – could it be that Allen is no longer a desirable commodity in his own country?!Anyway, here we get Hollywood hack screenwriter Owen Wilson setting his mind on penning The Great American Novel, with Paris (the mecca of the art world in an earlier age) supplying the ideal background to fire up his imagination. However, since he is accompanied by his predictably condescending fiancée' (a rather wasted Rachel McAdams) and her obviously conservative parents, he finds his creativity stifled – especially after she runs into an old friend (Michael Sheen), whose know-it-all attitude irks Wilson no end. So, he goes away by himself on a midnight stroll, wishing he were back in the 1920s (mind you, I harbored a particular kinship with his predicament – since I also believe that I was born too late and, consequently, feel out-of-touch with the current times!)and, lo and behold, an old-fashioned car comes along and whisks him away to rub shoulders with the likes of F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, Pablo Picasso, Cole Porter (whose songs are a constant on the soundtrack), Josephine Baker, Gertrude Stein (played by Kathy Bates), Alice B. Toklas, etc.! Here, he also meets and falls for a woman (Marion Cotillard, who typically walks off with the film) that is actually contended by both Picasso and Hemingway. Since he tries to fit in by presenting himself as an author, Hemingway tells him he will refer a draft of his novel to the matriarchal Stein but, as soon as he exits the bohemian establishment, the premises revert to their current state i.e. a laundry!Of course, McAdams does not believe a word he tells her, so she reluctantly agrees to accompany him the next night – but she quits in contempt before the proverbial 'taxi' arrives, precisely at the stroke of midnight. This time around, Wilson is introduced to Salvador Dali (an impressive and hilarious Adrien Brody, forever re-routing a conversation towards a discussion of rhinoceroses!) and Luis Bunuel: his initial contribution is very understated, as if Allen did not quite know how to use him – however, in a subsequent scene, we get an inspired moment in which Wilson sneakily suggests to the Surrealist master the germ of an idea that the latter would eventually develop into one of his greatest films, THE EXTERMINATING ANGEL (1962)but, naturally, he cannot quite grasp the absurd beauty of the situation presented to him so early into the game! While, at first, I was disappointed that Wilson does not walk in and out of the past at random (Allen opting for a Cinderella-type device), Cotillard herself pines for the so-called ""Belle Epoque"" i.e. the 1890s (even if her own era is known as ""L'Age D'Or"" – as it happens, the ironic title of one of Bunuel's most scathing efforts!) and, magically, we go back to the dives haunted by such world-renowned painters as Toulouse-Lautrec, Gaugin and Degas!In the end, even if this is more of a nostalgia trip than a dense time/space meditation a' la the films of Alain Resnais (incidentally, Allen had once decried never having made a truly great film!), we are nevertheless treated to a few choice nuggets of pure mystery: Carla Bruni – yes, Mrs. Sarkozy herself! – translating Cotillard's memoirs to Wilson, clearly published long before but where he unaccountably gets mentioned!; and a private detective, appointed by McAdams' father to follow Wilson on his after-hours 'trysts', falling foul of the time-warp himself and turning up – understandably befuddled – in the Middle Ages! Even so, the elaborate structure still allows for character growth, since Wilson ultimately attains serenity within his own epoch and, having broken up with McAdams (who admits to an affair with the insufferable Sheen), hooks up romantically with a new partner (a girl he had, time and again, conversed with at a flea-market and with whom he shares a fondness for Cole Porter) in a downpour – to him, Paris at its most expressive – at the conclusion.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Pablum for Narcissists,"This is Woody Allen at his most shallow and pretentious. As in all his movies, the central character is Woody Allen himself, his anxieties, his narcissism and his affectations. Whether he plays the main character himself or, as in this case, it is played by someone else, it's still the whiny, insecure, pathetic little pseudo-intellectual that by all indications is who he really is. All other characters in his movies are either clones of the Woody character or projections of his neuroses. What's most evident here is Woody's tin ear for comedy. Jokes fall flat, and worse, ruin any semblance of a mood or serious emotion among the characters. Woody is, and probably will always be, a frightened, insecure twelve year old boy with average intelligence who is desperate to appear smarter than he is. For some people that's funny; for me, it's just embarrassing.Here we have Gil, (Owen Wilson) another Woody clone visiting Paris with his dumb-blond wife, her parents, plus a pedantic professor and his equally pretentious and absurd wife. They are the epitome of East Coast liberals: insufferably arrogant and intellectually competitive. Gil has an added affliction besides his annoying nervous tics: he's obsessed by the Paris literary/art scene of the 1920s. In fact, he worships the celebrities of that era the same way the the clueless slobs in ""The King of Comedy"" worship their TV idols. Gil is a groupie. He has little feeling for art or writing but needs to somehow bask in the reflected glory that knowing their names will add to his resume.Raymond Chandler once wrote in reference to the people who go to Hollywood parties in hopes of rubbing elbows with celebrities: ""They are fearful of becoming the nobodies they never ceased to be."" That is Gil. One night (who knows how?) he is transported back to the 1920s where he is able to actually meet some of his heroes and heroines. This could be a sort of magical moment, a romantic fantasy realized on the screen. But in order for such a thing to work the audience must be convinced of the reality of the transformation from one time to another. Unfortunately Allen wrecks the suspension of disbelief at every opportunity with the intervention of the nervous and supercilious Gil who can't seem to keep his mouth shut. The artists too, such as Ernest Hemingway, Salvador Dali, Pablo PIcasso and Man Ray are merely cartoon stereotypes, often spouting quotes from their own work, or commenting on art in that phony-baloney way people in Woody Allen movies are wont to do. These artistic celebs welcome Gil into their midst, but you know right away the real artists these stereotypes are based on wouldn't have had anything to do with such an obvious loser.I could say more. Did I mention that there seems to be some kind of weird colorization in some of the Parisian cityscapes? What's that all about? But I hope I've said enough to warn you off this pile of sentimentality and drivel. Did I mention it's not funny?",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Nostalgia is beautiful,"What a beautiful film! Started it with little expectations and boy was I amazed! This movie is mainly for those who are nostalgic about a particular era. Since I also feel nostalgic about a particular era, I enjoyed it very much. I personally, just like Owen Wilson's character in this film, like to be lost in nostalgic thoughts sometimes. I guess it is one of the ways of the human mind to escape the harsh reality we often find ourselves in.

Woody like Paris,"At school, children are made to read Shakespeare and told that it is good for them.As you get older, critics tell you to watch Woody Allen films because it's good for you. While you think my word that was a chore and that is watching one of his more acclaimed film from the late 1970s and early 1980s.In the last decade Allen has spent more time making films in Europe with mixed results although I liked Match Point and Scoop.Midnight in Paris allows him to give us a picture postcard portrait of Paris.It is funny, whimsical, has time travel and concludes that it is better to live in the now than hark back to a distant, mythical golden age in the past.Owen Wilson plays an aspiring liberal novelist having a break in Paris with his fiancée and her wealthy Tea Party supporting parents.Whilst having a stroll on his own one evening and getting lost, he gets into a vintage car and is transported to the 1920s where he parties with Scott Fitzgerald, Cole Porter, Ernest Hemingway and the like.The events stir up his creative juices and realises that he needs to confront issues in his present life.Owen Wilson takes a break from his normal comedy films to do his turn for Woody Allen and acquits himself well. He is outshone by the cameos from Adrien Brody, Tom Hiddleston, Marion Cotillard, Kathy Bates who play famous artists and writers and muses from the past.Once the film gets going, it is enthralling, maybe too much of a tourist advert for Paris but it is nice to see Woody having casual fun.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

This movie is intelligently done, and all the actors do a tremendous job. I bet they had a lot of fun making this movie. It is a visual treat, so even if the plot or story gets tiresome (after three viewings in a year) it is still a beautiful homage to Paris, a glorious testament to all that is noble about humanity.

THIS FILM IS RELATED TO ME.,"This film is so very good, I don't know where to start. I don't know why I feel like I have a resemblance to Gil, I always think about things related to the past and find it really amazing.That's why I really like gil here, he shows someone who is very obsessed with the past but is against his own fiancé, gil also seems to have an anxiety disease when seen from his behavior that seems like someone who is always drunk. I think it's very natural, we can see Gil's character development here. Owel Wilsen really plays deep into Gil's character here. Oh yes Rachel McAdams never disappoints me, she managed to build a selfish woman figure that really describes the figure of most women today.The plot itself is very good, the story is simple but doesn't feel flat, there are lots of little comedies that tickle the stomach.The director of this film was great in making this film, sorry I mean everyone involved in this film was great, they all worked together and managed to make the atmosphere of the city of paris very perfect. In the morning it looks modern and the night is immediately replaced with the La Belle Epoque atmosphere that I really like.This film is very beautiful, especially the music, the music is able to build a beautiful Paris atmosphere and is able to bring the audience to feel it too.I always imagined there was a film that matched my fantasy, namely two lovers walking on a deserted sidewalk with the faint sound of vehicles and dim yellow lights, it turns out this is the film, I blame myself ""I always blame myself, where have i been all this time, why only now did I found a film like this."".Honestly I was a little worried about the ending because I thought this film would have a bad ending about the fate of Gil, but it didn't happen, the ending was very sweet and beautiful, I kept smiling until the film was finished, Woody Allen really understood what the audience was going to feel for the figure of Gil, he makes a beautiful ending, So, this film will be memorable after watching it.That's my little review about this film, this film is very beautiful, especially for those of you who really like the night atmosphere like me. That's all from me, Cheers.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Little more than an inventive romcom - even Owen Wilson is in it.,"An enchanting Parisian ode to the artisans of past. The ensemble cast is expertly used, making the audience simultaneously recognise the on-screen talent and the talent on-screen.Unfortunately Woody Allen's direction is utterly stagnant and unevocative - I would have much preferred an 'In the Mood for Love' approach to the film. But instead, a celebrous romp. Owen Wilson, I find placid and stolid (again), maybe good for the role, but maybe the wrong role for the film.Also, for a film about a man deeply entranced and influenced, Woody Allen's script is utterly uninspired and unevocative and only truly reminiscent. Dissolving into a half-assed abstract love triangle.Great for any lover of art (references), Paris and the 1920s though.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Allen's passion project for a golden city.,"Woody Allen crafts a delightful little love letter to Paris. The film certainly isn't without flaw, but for the most part it really is this nice piece of movie magic. It's a look back into a golden era combined with a nice message about being able to appreciate what you've got instead of constantly living in the past. Allen again puts together a wonderfully talented cast to delight his audience, although some of the characters here are written much better than others. It seemed like he put all of his attention into crafting the time that Gil (Owen Wilson as the Woody stand-in) travels back to at midnight, and just got sloppy when it came to writing the present day. The characters that Gil has surrounded himself with when we first meet him are just absurdly banal and shallow.Granted, I'm sure people like that do exist in real life, but there's just no way I could buy that someone as decent and good-hearted as Gil would put himself into a situation like that. Why on Earth would he be engaged to Inez (Rachel McAdams in a thankless role), the most vain and bothersome bitch in the world? It started off as a minor complaint, but the further the film went on the more it started to creep into scenes where Inez wasn't even around and continue to bother me. It all works itself out in the end, but it was just frustrating how we were supposed to believe he'd put himself in that engagement in the first place. It was lazy writing on Allen's part; instead of creating human beings he just created these blank shells to influence the main character.Fortunately, this is where my complaints on the film pretty much end. The second Gil goes back to 1920s Paris at the stroke of midnight, things are taken to a world of pure Woody Allen magic. The concept for the film is incredibly unique, I'm surprised no one had thought of it before, and feels very Woody right from the start. You take this ride back into the past and it feels so genuine. A concept like this could have been executed so poorly (time travel often is) but Allen doesn't spend too much time on the more scientific side of things and instead has Gil almost immediately embrace this experience; and why wouldn't he, he's getting the chance to live his largest fantasy. These characters are so wonderfully brought to life by this supporting cast here in the past.Every single one of them feels like you always knew they would be. You don't doubt for a second that these are the real people because these actors bring them to life so naturally. Alison Pill is a scene-stealing revelation as Zelda Fitzgerald, wild and out of control with her emotions. Tom Hiddleston is delightfully understated as her troubled hubby, F. Scott. Corey Stoll knocks it out of the park as the wild and blood-thirsty Ernest Hemingway. Adrien Brody absolutely steals his brief scene as Salvador Dali by creating one of the most hilarious moments of the year.The real star though, and the star of the film, is Marion Cotillard as a character who moves her way through these famous men's lives. Her Adriana is Gil's soulmate seemingly, a gorgeous and intelligent muse who herself feels like she is living in the wrong time and longs for a golden age. Adriana is supposed to be this kind of woman who just casts her spell and draws men in at every turn, and Cotillard makes you buy it immediately. The second we meet her you fall into her spell, she is so enchanting and wonderful it's impossible to resist. Watching Cotillard here, I felt like people must have felt in the '50s when watching Audrey Hepburn really come onto the scene. She is just so beautiful and ethereal here, making you feel exactly how it feels to fall head over heels in love. I think this is one of her best performances so far in her career.Owen Wilson pretty much does his usual Owen Wilson thing, just with a far superior script than he usually has, but the real treat of the film is this supporting cast back in time. In these trips to a golden age, Allen creates so many moments of genuine movie magic. They just take your heart in it's hand and make you feel alive and you really appreciate that life you have. My complaints with the supporting characters in the modern day were a big deal to me when I was watching the film, but since it ended all I've thought about are these moments that swept my heart away. That complaint feels pretty minor when the final product just makes me feel so good. Ultimately, the message about not living in the past is poured on way too thick, but it's a message that definitely made me think about my life when I came out of it. And boy, that ending is guaranteed to be the most purely blissful of the year. Really leaves you with a huge smile on your face.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

"The Sun Also Rises come to life, in a way...a fun, lightweight time trip","Midnight in Paris (2011)Total wish fulfillment. Who wouldn't want to drift back now and then and visit some cultural heroes in their own time--you know, Ernest Hemingway, Cole Porter, Picasso?Well, that's all this movie does. It does it brilliantly, and in the ""flashbacks"" which are really more like time travel scenes, the set design, music, and invented dialog of these icons is terrific. Like many people, I think Paris in the 1920s was the greatest cultural hot spot since Florence in the Renaissance.But that's all this movie really does, and if it's enough, you're going to love it. The plot laid over this, including a strained and irritating cast of early 21st Century ungrateful Ugly Americans, is painful. Not only does it seem false (like these are just ""types"" without real depth), but it's crudely filmed (lighting and camera-work) and actually badly acted, overall.You might think this was all on purpose, to contrast in every way then and now. Certainly it's the same crew, same writer (Woody Allen), and same director (Woody Allen) in both parts of the movie.And same lead actor, Owen Wilson, who is perfect in both roles (he is the one consistent presence). He's a dreamy writer who likes Paris in the rain. And he wishes he could just go back to those glory days when the arts were spilling out of the cafes at night on the Left Bank. So, by magic, he does, and so do we. If everything is a cliché, it almost has to be--Gertrude Stein played wonderfully by Kathy Bates, Zelda Fitzgerald by Alison Pill. There are some twenty famous people who show up (some briefly, like Man Ray, who is badly portrayed, and Josephine Baker, who doesn't get a speaking part, naturally). But they are all backdrop, in a way, to the idea, the time travel foremost but also the bigger idea that we sometimes think we'd be happier in another time.And the movie ends on the sweet note that in fact we just need to look around at what we have in our time and appreciate it.As a movie beyond just entertainment, it's easy to get frustrated. One good friend of mine, a true movie buff and not a Woody Allen fan, loved it. But he's a nostalgia freak. In the theater, two young women got up and left after half an hour, even while it was getting interesting. In my friend's case, he was taken in (as I was) by all the famous figures and what they might have been like (and what they might say). The two young women, I'm guessing, didn't know the references. They didn't know who Scott and Zelda, Cole, and maybe even Ernest were. Or didn't care.Which is an important truth in this kind of movie filled with references. Like a lot of post-modern art, it's only good for insiders. Unlike Allen's ""Zelig"" (a far more inventive and zany and complicated film, if imperfect, too), the references here are mostly for an older cultured crowd. There are hints of his ""The Purple Rose in Cairo"" as well, a fantasy to another world, a seemingly (or actually) better one, but that's a brilliant movie filled with pathos. ""Midnight in Paris"" is an extended trick, a one-liner, and as fun as it is, keep at least some of your expectations slim.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

Love the Literary Period,"I was really absorbed in this film. My loving connection with that Paris group got me off on the right foot. I know they are stock characters, but the pretentious idiocy of the future family of the Owen Wilson (Woody Allen) gives us a guy to root for. The tiresome being of the woman he is to marry would lead me to want her to be found floating face up in the Seine. Anyway, the fantasy world of the great writers is done charmingly with a second food in the present. It never gets silly and contrived with a limited amount of the conflict that other comedic directors could not handle. He slowly makes the rounds of his dreams and follows them, and the earth doesn't collapse. Actually, the woman in question really gets what she actually wanted. I won't spoil it by saying what that is. The characters vary in effectiveness. It was nice to see the portrayal of the young Hemingway with his bravado and insensitivity, even a touch of naiveté. There are romantic symbols and the cinematography is gorgeous. I know some think Owen Wilson is an odd choice for the protagonist, but I find him endearing and so patient. Also, there has been criticism that it's not edgy enough. The movie never tries to be a social statement. It's much more personal. When we leave the theater we feel that we have been involved in a little secret.

"""Wonderful but Forgettable""","""Wonderful but forgettable"", declared Gil - a ""Woody Allen type"" and our American-in-Paris protagonist on a movie he likely wrote. This could as well describe /Midnight in Paris/, which narrowly avoids insufferable, derivative dullness by a hair by not overstaying its welcome (running at a brisk one hour and a half). Saturated with sugary escapism into a beautiful Paris, it takes a light-hearted look at rosy retrospection, concluding somewhat placidly with a ""live in the moment"" mantra.Gil, an aspiring ""real"" writer, visits Paris with his fiancé and quarrelsome future in-laws only to find himself in a fantasy within a fantasy: transported back to 1920s Paris every midnight mingling with the creative geniuses of the day. It is impossible not to melt into the picture-perfect frames, gorgeous jewel-toned cinematography, and lush old Paris tunes despite realizing the image is an infertile imagination (likely borrowed from some 80s Tourism montage). Though satiating his fantasy of conversing with the likes of (good-humoredly parodied) Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Picasso, Dalí, and even striking up a love affair Picasso's belle Adriana, Gil reaches the epiphany that nostalgia is nothing more than a hedonic treadmill. ""Nostalgia is denial"", and the golden age thinking that another time period trumps the present is mere wishful imagination.There is the distinct Woody Allen-esque controlled-chaos energy sprucing up snappy exchanges. At one point, Gil feeds Luis Buñuel the idea for The Exterminating Angel (1962) to the baffled Surrealist.Sure, this is not a sophisticated, emotionally layered movie, but it never claimed to be. There is no harm in indulging in some sentimental simplicity from time to time, non?",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

Verging on Awful,"This movie was pretty awful. Woody Allen would obviously have loved to play the male lead but as he is nearing his dotage he seems to have made Owen Wilson into a clone of himself.

The movie as a whole was very predictable with lots of silliness including time traveling back to the 20s and late 1800s and being able to pay for dinner/drinks, I would love to see the face of a 1920s waiter when you offered to pay him in Euros!

A love letter to Paris,"It's no secret that Woody Allen is a lightning rod in an industry that is built on lightning rods. His films have a signature character about them that is not everyone's cup of tea. In 'Midnight in Paris,' we get a weird cocktail of mismatched leads (Owen Wilson and Rachel McAdams?), a head scratcher of a plot and a beautiful backdrop that is Paris. While these ingredients do not necessarily scream ""best picture nominee,"" there's something about 'Paris' that makes it kind of endearing.Wilson is not your typical dramady lead, as his previous film catalogue suggests. Here, he seems to embrace a more mellow role and comes across as relaxed, holding back on some of the over-the-top antics we've come to expect from him. McAdams does her best to tap into her inner ""mean girl"" as a spoiled fiancee, but the two of them just don't have much chemistry. Thankfully, we get to meet many other actors along the way, some of whom are more or less in cameos (Carla Bruni and Adrien Brody come to mind). That said, the real star of 'Paris' is, well, the city itself, which is showcased in all its glory, from the memorable establishing shots at the open to the evening walks along the Siene.Given so much of the subject matter at the heart of 'Midnight in Paris' is focused on art, it's not hard to make the observation that the film itself is sort of a work of art, in an offbeat, clumsy kind of way.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Unbelievably bad,"I really fail to see how this film can attract so many decent reviews. I'm no film buff but I've seen a fair few in my time and this is probably one of the worst. The scenes of Paris are more like a 1980s ministry of tourism project - if you want to see sumptuous Paris then look no further than Jean-Pierre Jeunet's Amelie. The plot is absurd - it's like a school film project - hey why don't we cram in as many famous people from the past as we can and then have the main character miraculously be able to go back in time whenever he wants! Even this could be tolerated if it weren't for all the cringeworthy lines such as when the main character walks into a room to meet Gertrude Stein and she leans over and says ""hey Pablo what yer paintin"" or something equally painful in order to shoehorn in another famous character.

"Oh! Paris, I love Paris!","A fantastic movie will make people fall in love with Paris. Woody Allen unabashedly showed the various eras of Paris.

"Paris, je t'aime...","This easy-going holiday through Paris and time sees its amicable, nostalgia-stricken protagonist wander through the streets at night, justifiably seeking a break from his demanding and altogether not-worth-it fiancée, until he somehow traverses back to the roaring twenties when the clock strikes midnight. 'Midnight In Paris (2011)' explores the kind of sliding nostalgia that seems to afflict every generation (right now, we're in a bit of an eighties and nineties fever), one that makes people think life was generally better before their birth. In reality, of course, 'now' always seems inferior to 'then' because we're acutely aware of our own day-to-day issues but not of those we admire; a different time just brings different problems. This is an interesting theme, the exploration of which fuels the central character's own arc, and it allows the flick to lose itself in the genuinely charming milieu of 1920s France. The picture is never particularly exciting or, even, moving, but it's a relatively enjoyable time throughout. Its conclusion brings everything together quite nicely and it leaves you with a smile on your face. It isn't something that will stay with you for days, but it does its job and is a distinctly relaxed - yet forward-moving - experience. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

What is Romantic Paris?,"Ever wonder what ""Romantic Paris"" is all about? The latest Woody creation showcases this hyped notion literally through a montage of photograph-like camera shots of various streets. The blatant depiction of the romanticized Paris does not get too tacky because Woody satirizes the great romantic played by Owen Wilson and the romantic in all of us; the American who wants to live in Paris, walk in the rain and write.Wisely making Paris as the setting is perfect for the American audience who at times regard Paris as the ultimate city of romance. Climaxing with a wonderful message to this romantic protagonist, we once again get Woody's amusing, societal effacing commentary.This is a fantastical film where the protagonist gets transported to Paris in the 1920 after midnight. He gets to briefly meet some of the great artists and writers who get to comment on him as a writer, an artist, a man, and a lover. This did get a bit cheesy but it was also a bit of fun. It is fun to see the modern man interacting with legendary people from the past but these characters from the past were mere characterizations of the great artists. Perhaps it was the intention to make these artists of the past how we envision them, containing the proper imagined eccentricities and that was OK since the modern man goes back and fantasizes about it as how he imagines them similar to how we imagine them. The charactertures and therefore not real people plagued all the characters of this film even the ones of the present. It was also not very believable that the protagonist and the fiancée ever got to the level of being on the verge of marriage since they were at such odds with each other and had such conflicting souls.Even though the characters weren't great this is another gem of Woody's witticisms, philosophies, and scenes of natural urban beauty. It is the perfect depiction of Romantic nostalgic Paris in the rain.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

"A Real Snorer, Stinker, and Waste","This is Allen's senile swan song. He has lost his muse and can no longer write or direct. Wilson is tough to like in this role, and the plot is a meandering slog of sentimental fantasy, a simple message, mediocre photography, boring script, sans ending. There is a cheap shot at the Tea Party and Allen has to be boorish with his worm's eye view of a conservative who is cast in a typical liberal, stereotypical manner. I nearly fell asleep at this movie, did not like any characters, especially all of them, loathed the stupid story and dead loose ends. Wilson shows no emotion, just his usual whiny, nasal drone you hear in every movie he makes. What a waste of time and film.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Lovely,"What a gorgeous film. A brilliant idea, wonderful dialogue with a backdrop of Paris.The story follows a young writer on vacation to Paris with his fiance and her parents. The writer (Owen Wilson) and his fiance don't seem to connect very well, though he is an affable character that doesn't seem to notice, until... he happens upon a sort of portal to another time - the 1920's Paris. There he meets his heroes from the past and gains new perspective on conflictions in his life.As always, the dialogue from Woody Allen is interesting, fast-paced, and witty. The story is captivating and unique.

Charming little romantic fantasy,"This is a lovely little film, extravagant in its visuals, with Paris serving as another character in the story, looking glorious of course. The photography alone is worth the price of admission. The premise is charming and is executed in a believable way. The filming of it is simple and effective, with no tricks, just as straightforward realism.The contemporary characters are out of Allen's stock barrel of characters. The two leads could be played by Allen and Diane Keaton, but they are now too old to play them, so the young actors serve as stand-ins for the two originals. Wilson has an interesting face but is too good-looking and too WASP-y to play the ""Allen character"". He does a spot on imitation of Allan's quirky mannerisms, vocal and physical, in this role. I wish he hadn't. I think a more original take on the ""Allen character"" might have been more effective. Here, he just seems like an imitation, and not a believable one.The writing is fair. The dialogue is Allen's usual ""realistic"" way of making his characters speak, which never seems like the way people talk, just someones Idea of how they talk.The best part of this film for me are the time travel scenes, populated by all of the main character's heroes from the past. They could be a dream, but they are executed with total realism. These roles are written and acted with more success than the 2010 characters, which all seem as if they actually belong in the 1970s, not the 2010s. All of the great people the hero meets in these episodes are done quite well, except for a stilted Hemingway (but how else could you portray a character who was mostly bluster and defensive pretense in real life?) Kathy Bates is the real standout as Gertrude Stein. She takes an underwritten part and creates a portrait of the iconic figure not at all as a caricature of her, but as real, breathing person, intelligent, savvy and believable.The real problem with this charming film is that it's too long for its slight story. This might have been better as a short or as one episode in a multiple-story film, which Allen has done before. Here, about halfway through, it starts to drag and you begin to wonder...I think this is a fine little picture, but not a great one, and not one of Allen's best. I think it is garnering the praise it's been getting because it's superb in contrast to most of the drek that's being released right now.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

If elevator music were a film.,"I've long tried to get into Woody Allen's films.

annoying exercise in name-dropping,"I am a Woody Allen fan and yet I must be the lone voice in the chorus of praise here. The gorgeous opening cinematic montage of Parisian scenes, accompanied by what I have to believe is Woody himself on clarinet in the musical accompaniment, leads us to believe we are in for a Gallic ""Manhattan."" But this movie is several steps down from Woody's brilliant love letter to New York. That movie had a credible and engaging - if morally questionable - plot, about a middle age man dating a high school girl (little did we know, at the time) But the story here, aside from its fantastic elements, is thin and without dramatic direction. Once the initial time travel back to the Paris of the 20's happens, there is very little else of consequence. And the film has to be completely meaningless to anyone without a solid historical knowledge of the intellectual scene in Paris in the Roaring 20's. As a matter of fact it doesn't take long before the film becomes a pretentious exercise in name-dropping that actually becomes annoying. Gee let's see if we can name the next writer/artist/playwright/musician that's going to walk in the door. And Allen's political beliefs, which, if they were touched on at all in previous movies, were treated with subtle whimsy, are here wielded like a two-by-four. And I find Owen Wilson completely unsuited for the role of Allen's alter ego. He just doesn't have the feel for the Allen persona, and I'm sorry, but he should get that broken nose fixed as all it does is distract.I was vastly disappointed, and am at a loss to explain the rave reviews this movie has received.",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

Opening scene with streets of Paris and jazz music are something I could watch separately over and over again.

Why does a man have to make wrong choices when the right ones are right in front of their eyes? Is there really a better time to be alive than the time we live in? How are we to find real joy in life when we are consumed by the daily struggles that relationships, careers and communities bring?The movie answers some of these questions in such an elegant fashion, with a humorous, sometimes sarcastic, and yet honest approach that makes you wanna rewind and hear the lines again, just to make sure. The questions left unanswered are done so intentionally, since the viewer is the one to come out with their own conclusion. Eventually, it's a film made to be interpreted. Not one that tells you what you need to think, feel or care for.I'm in no way an Allen fan, have never been in Paris and while i can say i love good art and city life, i don't sell out for good cinematography.

Midnight in Paris,"Midnight in Paris is about an engaged couple named Gil and Inez who go to Paris, France because her father is setting up a business deal there. Gil and Inez, we soon learn are very different people. He is a struggling author who loves the sights and sounds of Paris and finds it all very romantic and beautiful. His idea of a great time there would be to walk down the streets in the rain and capture the romance and beauty of the moment. Inez is more of a materialistic person who would much rather get a ride than walk in the rain and doesn't much care for Gil's opinions about art, or the different surroundings in Paris. One night while walking alone in the city, Gil is invited into an old vehicle and because he is drunk he accepts, and is then taken back to Paris in the 1920's where he gets to meet some of his favourite authors, artists and other very influential people in the field of art in the 1920's. He gets to be friends with them and for the evening gets to be with them in the 20's, but when he wakes up, he is back in 2010 with Inez. Gil goes back to the same spot every night and is taken back to his artist friends and soon meets a French woman who he starts to fall in love with, but how will he be able to stay in the 1920's permanently and what will he do about Inez? I absolutely loved Midnight in Paris. I have never actually been to Paris, or any parts in France, but have seen a lot of French films and pieces of art to know that it is a classy and beautiful city and this film captures that beauty and magic. It is a gorgeous looking film with it's cinematography as well as the sets and costumes. The film has tons of great one liners and made me smile frequently throughout the film. The whole cast is great and all do an excellent job here. The idea behind the movie is really intriguing and it makes for some very entertaining viewing and it sure made me feel good after I saw it. This is a film that is so light and funny and absolutely charming that I found it hard not to love every minute about it. The dialogue is great, the story is funny, romantic, fascinating and entertaining and it is definitely beautiful to look at as well. This film captures a lot of what is classic and sentimental from classic films by giving us a very original idea and humour and giving it class, innocence and beauty. I think fans of classic films will love this movie as well as anyone who enjoys good movies and comedies that are smart and do not rely on raunch, or bad language. Midnight in Paris really brightened up my evening and a certain joy came out of watching this film. I highly recommend it and I hope it is a hit at next year's Oscars because I think it is one of this year's best films and a true masterpiece.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Not the best...,"Am glad Woody Allen didn't also act in it. Something about this guy and the way he talks, doesn't gel well with me. As for the movie, it feels 100% Woody Allen, too Woody Allen actually. My criticism is that, the way the actors moved, posed, talked and even the camera pans, all felt like something I've seen time and time again. Call it his signature but I got bored in the end.The script was brilliant though, I really liked the concept. Am not a big Paris fan but I can't deny that it has a nice setting for making movies. London (my city) in comparison feels grim and low quality.I hated the blonde actress (Rachel McAdams). She was terrible (especially when she was stamping in and out of hotel rooms). I was scared about having Owen Wilson in a Woddy Allen comedy but he was great choice. No wonder the script had to be re-written to fit him, haha.On a BBC Radio4 programme, Woody Allen asked ""Why do People not go see his movies?"" (as in, his previous movies). My answer is that he should either Direct or Write. Given his age and experience, I would lean on the writing side. What I want to see from ageing actors or directors is their take on the life that they've lived, boxed into a neat movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

Strengths and weaknesses,"Midnight in Paris (2011) was written and directed by Woody Allen. The bad news about this movie is that the ""real"" plot is ridiculous. We are supposed to believe that Gil (played by Owen Wilson) would want to marry Inez (Rachel McAdams) despite the fact that Inez is spoiled, selfish, immature, and comes as part of a package that includes her unpleasant parents and obnoxious friends. Yes, Inez is attractive, but as a successful screenwriter, surely Gil could find other attractive women with whom he'd be more compatible.The other part of the ""real"" plot that doesn't compute is that Gil, a handsome, strapping, Californian, would be channeling Woody Allen's nebbish character. When Gil whines, ""That's crazy,"" in Allen's singsong voice, I just wanted to wince.The good news is that the ""fantasy"" part of the plot is great. Allen knows how to present cities to us in the best possible light (in both senses). Paris looks wonderful, the people in it look wonderful, and the ""conceit"" of going back in time worked for me.So, I recommend that you see this movie, ignore the ""real"" plot, and concentrate on Paris in an earlier era. As with most Woody Allen movies, this film will work on a small screen.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
The mentality of the city that never sleeps meets the beauty of city of lights.,"Woody Allen's first screenplay What's New Pussycat was produced in 1965 and I'm happy to say after forty six years and forty something films later...he's still ""gettin it done"". Midnight in Paris is the most recent Allen opus and like previous works Match Point, Scoop and Vicky Cristina Barcelona he utilizes a European back drop with the same visual charm he used on Manhattan for the first three quarters of his career. Ironically, the city of lights seems a natural fit for Allen's love of the artistic side of any large metropolis.The film stars Owen Wilson in a role that Allen himself could have played thirty years ago (a trend in many of Allen's newest works). As a Hollywood screenwriter longing for the art and romance of a bygone time, Wilson surprisingly inhabits the nebbish qualities of a typical Allen leading man. Rachel McAdams is his frustrated fiancé' and Oscar winner Marion Cotillard plays his ""muse"" or as Allen aficionados may call ithis Parisian ""Annie Hall"".The premise and characters are obviously similar to many Allen films, which of course is not a bad thing (if it's not broke, Woody doesn't fix it). However where it excels is its combination of a classic Allen theme with an exquisite period piece. In addition to the beautiful costumes, sets and production value the really fun aspect of the film is guessing just who may show up in 1920's Paris. Whether it's Kathy Bates' Gertrude Stein, Adrian Brody's Salvador Dali (and if you're keeping count that's two more Oscar winners) or Corey Stoll's Ernest Hemingway, the parade of colorful and historic people inhabiting the social scene of France is a literal who's who of artists, writers and dancers. Needless to say there is also a fair amount of verbal dry wit and humorous dialogue to balance out the beautiful setting and story.What this film demonstrates more than anything is Allen's durability in still putting out good films after over four decades as a filmmakera feat not easily accomplished, especially for comedies. He averages a film a year and even his contemporaries Mel Brooks and Mike Nichols, comic geniuses in their own right, have not had as much consistent success. Keep them coming Woody.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

"Entertains, but doesn't go any further","Midnight in Paris isn't an exciting movie, but entertains. Quite well, actually. For an hour and a half, we see the main character, played by Owen Wilson, enter a different world and realizing that that world might be better than his own reality. And that, of course, could only happen in Paris. It's an easy movie to watch, it doesn't makes us think too much; it makes us dream, just like the protagonist. Wilson isn't a sublime actor but gives us an easily likable character. A simple writer, he feels he was born at the wrong time and only wants the opportunity to live in another age. We can find some similarities with the seventies' Woody Allen... the way he walks, talks, the gestures... Maybe Allen intended that, by casting Wilson. Rachel McAdams plays his wife; arrogant, shallow, a bit naive, who isn't able to picture a a life beyond the one she knows. Michael Sheen plays McAdams ex-teacher, and it is when the couple crosses paths with Sheen's character that the incompatibilities between them become absolutely evident. But it's in the 'parallel' world of Wilson that we find the real interesting characters, with simple but effective performances by established actors, from Marion Cotillard to Kathy Bates, and 5 minutes of pure gold with Adrien Brody, as Dalí; and also good performances by less known actors such Corey Stoll or Allison Pill. Don't forget to check Carla Bruni's appearance, in a simple but charming role, that fits her quite well.Far from Allen's golden era, Midnight in Paris still scores by being different and original, which is something we can't always say about his movies. A picture with beautiful images and a plot capable of keeping us minimally interested for an hour and a half, but that does not go any further.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

One of Woody Allen's best,"This is one of Woody Allen's best. Full of artsy pretentiousness and over analysed romantic tangles.I have always enjoyed time travel films and this one works well, linking in numerous famous artists, musicians and writers.There are some great performances, Owen Wilson plays the Woody Allen role brilliantly. But, for me, Adrien Brody steals it, with a brief brief portrayal of Salvador Dali, where he rattles on about Rhinoceroses. The scene itself is beautifully surreal.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Allen Finds Another Purple Rose in Paris,"Woody Allen's 2011 contribution to cinema has been heralded as a return to form by many critics, and for a few shining moments at the outset, it looks like it might just as well be that way. Through a lovely montage of Parisian images by cinematographer Darius Khondji, Allen evokes the city's unabashed romanticism set to Sidney Bechet's nocturnally soulful saxophone on his composition ""Si Tu Vois Ma Mere"" much the same way the filmmaker captured the cosmopolitan energy of Manhattan set to Gershwin's grandiose ""Rhapsody in Blue"" in his 1979 masterwork. The camera finally lands on the lead characters as they visit Claude Monet's picture-perfect gardens at Giverny. From there, Allen treads familiar territory following the adventures of Gil Pender, Allen's alter-ego, a successful but unfulfilled Hollywood screenwriter on a trip to Paris with his fiancée Inez along with her wealthy, xenophobic parents who are funding the trip with typical bourgeoisie disdain.Longing to join the literary ranks of his heroes F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway, Gil, we discover, is working on his first novel much to Inez's chagrin. Enamored with the way Paris was during the 1920's, Gil soon finds himself in an alternate universe after midnight where he is rubbing elbows over martinis at jazz clubs with not only Fitzgerald and Hemingway but also influential figures like Gertrude Stein, Pablo Picasso, Cole Porter, and Salvador Dali. By the light of day, however, he faces the mundane reality of Inez and her family, who are completely indifferent to his flights of fancy. Matters get worse when Gil and Inez bump into Paul, an old college crush of hers, who has since become the type of intolerable pedant Allen skewered so well in the movie theater scene in ""Annie Hall"". Gil – as he toggles between present-day Paris and his idealized vision of the city's past - will likely remind Allen's fans of the shenanigans that occurred in ""The Purple Rose of Cairo"" down to the introduction of an out-of-sync love interest, this time a beautiful clothing designer named Adriana, who was Modigliani's mistress and has now become Picasso's embattled lover. Allen obviously enjoys regaling in Jazz Age-era Paris and presumes his viewers will have more than a passing familiarity with the period.Thankfully, I just saw the Steins Collect at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, so I received a primer on some of these seminal figures. You can tell Allen is less interested in the contemporary scenes, which are not as arresting with these characters coming across more like stereotypes despite a game cast. As the hapless Gil, Owen Wilson is a bit improbable as a writer with high literary aspirations, but his sincerity in the role helps win us over. Back in ""Mean Girls"" mode, Rachel McAdams isn't given that much to do as Inez except to express constant frustration. Usually playing sincere historical figures like Tony Blair and David Frost, Michael Sheen has a field day as the entirely unlikeable Paul. There's a predictably no-nonsense turn by Kathy Bates as Stein and an over-the-top one by Adrian Brody as Dali. As Scott and Zelda, Tom Hiddleston (the malevolent Loki in ""Thor"") and especially Alison Pill play their archetypes quite well, but among the real-life figures, Corey Stoll stands out as the pugnacious Hemingway. As Adriana, Marion Cotillard makes the most of her fantasy figure role. All in all, this is solid work from Allen but still a fair distance from his most accomplished.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
one of my favorite movies,"I love this movie, this is one of woody allen's best movies and owen wilson was amazing in it! I think he deserved at least an oscar nomination.By the way midnight in paris should have won best picture in the 2011's academy awards.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
A Mediocre Trip to the City of Love,"I suppose if I had seen ""Midnight in Paris"" back when it first came out, before the awards hype and hyperbolic praise started proclaiming it one of the best movies of the year, I would have thought it was a perfectly fine if unmemorable Woody Allen movie, certainly better than many of his most recent efforts but not nearly as good as some others. But expectations were high after it started appearing on 10-best lists and winning awards, and so instead of enjoying the film for its modest charms, I was left wondering what on earth people saw in this that warrants its rapturous response.I long ago accepted that Woody Allen is going to traffic in tired clichés for the rest of his career. But an artist falling in love with the charms of Paris has to be one of the most tired. There is some fun to be had in waiting to see what famous names Owen Wilson's author character is going to come across next, and I have to imagine that what critics are responding to is the idea of one artist being able to interact directly with those long-dead artists who serve as their muses. So some scenes with characters like Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, the Fitzgeralds, etc. offer some pleasant whimsy. But the real-life part of the screenplay, detailing Wilson's excruciatingly slow realization that he and his horrible fiancée (written as a completely unbelievable caricature and played as a simply despicable human being by Rachel MacAdams) are not meant for one another, takes up far too much time. Not only is this part of the movie tedious, it's badly written, one criticism I usually can't level at Allen's screenplays.Sure, Paris looks lovely, but it surely says something about the movie that the thing I most remember about it is the performance of Alison Pill, a scene stealer as Zelda Fitzgerald but who has exactly three minutes of screen time.Grade: B-",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

"Another cute, but somewhat over-rated, Allen film","Woody Allen, like most directors, has had some moments on pure perfection (""Match Point"") and pure garbage (""Shadows and Fog""), but as much as I have the utmost respect for the man, I wouldn't say I am a fan, I just have merely loved a couple of his movies, hated a few others, and there are many I am sure I haven't seen or are somewhat indifferent about.However, ""Midnight in Paris,"" for sure, despite being one of his most commercially successful films ever, is not one of his best works. Despite his Golden Globe win for Best Screenplay, this is not the best Screenplay of the year, nor is it one of Allen's best. And despite his Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor in a Comedy or Musical, Owen Wilson's performance is nothing more than acceptable. However, despite the inclusion of Rachel McAdams, I found this to be an alright little film.Wilson plays Gil, a screenplay writer who decides he wants to venture into more serious literature and write a novel. While in Paris with his new fiancée, Inez, and her parents, Gil begins to question how he really feels about his future wife, played by the always-annoying McAdams, after getting slightly drunk and being abandoned on the streets of Paris by her and her friends only to be randomly picked up by a strange taxi just after midnight, transporting him to Paris in the 20s...a period Gil has always fantasized about.While transported, he meets the likes of F.Scott Fitzgerald, Josephine Baker, Cole Porter, Salvador Dali, Ernest Hemingway, among others and even gets his novel critiqued by Gertrude Stein, all the while falling for a woman he meets named Adriana (played by the lovely Oscar-winning Marion Cotillard)...and thus leading him to wonder how he truly feels about the overbearing, non-too-supportive Inez.""Midnight in Paris"" is a cute little film, just like many Allen films, but is hardly a terribly significant cinematic entry and thus, I am not so sure the numerous accolades it has been given, including the Golden Globe, are really deserving. It's a fine film but, for me, ultimately forgettable.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Worth A Watch!,This film is very good. It truly captures the essence of Paris and life now and back 'then'. I think the message about being unsatisfied is very cleverly shown in the movie.

"Nostalgia and reality, America V Paris","An absolutely gorgeous film that's been given a really pleasing Blu-ray transfer. The picture is lovely, full of depth, colour and clarity, Paris looks incredible. Owen Wilson did a good job in the film. It's a typical Woody Allen story about a wealthy cultured protagonist questioning his life and what he really wants. The screenplay and dialogue is all quite funny and I thought all the casting was spot on. I didn't really see what was so bad about present day Paris but I suppose that's the point, all of us have a distorted view of the past and present. It's quite a sad film in some ways but the way it's portrayed is with lots of humour. This is one of those films where everyone dresses really well and look great.A trip to Pars for most tourists involves walking around in shorts, t-shirts, sunglasses, a hat with a ruck sack on your back and a bottle of water in your hand. Not so here though....

A Cinematic Love,"Sometimes in life, I believe that it's true that one can feel very confused at times. Very scared about what the future holds.

Why Would You Want To Travel Back In Time?,"Unlike Allen's many other films, 'Midnight in Paris' has a more surreal/dreamlike feel to it that couples well with the reality of it. The film opens with some postcard shots of Paris and the visuals continue to look stunning which adds to the dreamy feel (thanks to the special effects, cinematography and wonderful jazzy score). It has that same feeling of whimsy that most of Allen's other films have. The time-travelling theme has been marvelously explored in the story. This film is especially relevant to those who think that life in so-and-so year was easier, more exotic, more exciting more so and so than it is in present. For Allen analyzes this theme through his protagonist who is a writer dissatisfied with his novel and wishes he were living in the 20s.This time Allen's alterego is played by Owen Wilson who does a terrific job here (one of his best). He reunites with the lovely Rachel McAdams who is equally stupendous as the frivolous bitchy fiancée. Kurt Fuller, Mimi Kennedy, Michael Sheen and Kathy Bates provide great support. And what would 'Midnight In Paris' be without the luminous Marion Cotillard who can best be described as spellbinding?'Midnight in Paris' is colourful, elegant, surreal, funny and delightful. It ranks among Allen's best works. This is also his way of showing respect to the artists and writers he pays homage to.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Midnight in Paris (2011) **1/2,"Another small and charming romantic comedy from the always-reliable Woody Allen that's becoming harder to find in a sea of overblown, overlong, special effects bonanzas. It's a story of a young modern-day American writer named Gil (Owen Wilson), spending time in France with his fiancé (Rachel McAdams) and her parents, who is disenchanted with life in the 21st Century and longs for the better things of the past. His girl and prospective in-laws don't understand and are downright dismissive of him. One night Gil gets the unexpected thrill of his life when he boards a magical cab which time warps him back into the glorious 1920's where he becomes elated at meeting many of his idols all conveniently in the same place at the same time (Cole Porter, Pablo Picasso, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, Salvador Dali, Gertrude Stein). Owen Wilson is pretty good at playing what basically comes down to Woody Allen himself (I could easily see Allen in the part, but he's almost 80 these days so he has young actors doing his nebbish schtick for him). This is a cute enough movie that's worth seeing at least one time. Woody has tapped into similar romantic territory before, so it's not really very new for his regular fans. I can't say I agree with his unoriginal moral of the tale though: that in the long run, ""the good old days"" are supposedly a fantasy, and we will ultimately find out that the past was no great shakes either. (I'd beg to differ there, Woody.) **1/2 out of ****",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
An absolute gem,"If you haven't seen Midnight in Paris yet, don't talk to anyone about it. You can watch the preview, because thankfully it doesn't include any spoilers, but don't read any reviews or analysis. There's a special magic to the movie that needs to be experienced without any warning. All you need to know is it's one of Woody Allen's best films, and it feels infinitely more scripted than most of his others. It has a fantastic story, a timeless theme that can spark an endless debate between you and your friends, and a terrific cast.Owen Wilson is a struggling writer on vacation in Paris with his fiancé Rachel McAdams. She's spoiled and shallow, and he's more, well, like Woody Allen. He's insecure, he overthinks things, he delves into existential topics, and he's far happier listening to an old Cole Porter record than schmoozing at a cocktail party. But Rachel is so adorable! I just love her in this movie, from her classy clothes to her hilarious delivery and imitable expressions.There's really no way to know for sure, but the entire cast had such a great chemistry you can imagine they had a real blast making the movie. There are times when you get so immersed it's as if you're not even watching a movie, but instead just watching a group of friends hang out at a party. There are some definite ""Woody Allen moments"" that are quite charmingly sprinkled in, contributing to a few of the cutest cameos ever. To see Marion Cotillard, Tom Hiddleston, Michael Sheen, Allison Pill, Corey Stall, Kurt Fuller, Nina Arianda, Mimi Kennedy, Kathy Bates, and Adrien Brody all together in one movie, watch Woody Allen's absolute gem.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Very charming movie,"Midnight in Paris is definitely one of the best Woody Allen's pictures in 21st century. It's actually brilliant in any respect. Good cinematography, good editing, good directing, perfect and realistic performances by all the actors (literary all of them), great shots of Paris, beautiful music, funny jokes, well-made sets, interesting story and really Oscar-worthy script. I rarely see films which depict their characters in such a real way. They sound, look and act like real people, rather than actors reading their lines. This is so due to the elaborate script, of course. Some jokes were really funny, and none of them were vulgar, which is rare in modern movies. And of course, it makes you fall in love with Paris, cause it's represented in a very charming manner. I rate it lower than 9-10 only because it's not my favorite genre of movies, but I understand that it's almost perfect. So, if love romantic comedies more than I do, don't miss it in any case. And even if you're not this genre's fan, you won't be disappointed.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
why did this movie get such praise...,"I thought it was very mediocre approaching boring. Nothing exciting or funny or entertaining even happens.

So, he meets some of his favorite writers and artists, like Fitsgerald, Hemmingway, and Picasso. He also meets Picasso's girl,that he likes and this makes him see, he shouldn't marry his finance.And all this magic makes him want to movie to Paris, and he meets a new Parisan girl.

Midnight in Paris -- a clever delight,"Woody Allen yet again serves up a thought provoking, entertaining and brilliant film. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Have you ever wondered if it would have been better to have been born in a previous era? Woody Allen helps us answer that question by having us time travel a bit through the experiences of a young writer attempting to publish his first work which has as its setting a memorabilia shop filled with things of bygone eras which interest him. In this era, however, he travels with his shallow fiancé and her conservative condescending parents to Paris where the hero is smitten with its beauty and culture. What his fiancé does not know is that at the stroke of midnight our protagonist is transported to another era -- the Roaring Twenties – complete with Cole Porter music, Ernest Hemingway literature, Picasso art and Gertrude Stein as critic of the book he has just written.This is a wonderful film especially if one has a general familiarity of the art, literature and music of that era as well as a general understanding of cultural settings in times other than our own. The film is brilliant and clever as only Woody Allen can be. The protagonist could certainly have been Woody Allen himself as he has played similar roles in many of his earlier works and if it were in a different era perhaps 20 years ago then Woody would have played the lead role instead of Owen Wilson whom I think was excellent.Allen's talent will endure long after all who have enjoyed the genre of his films have left the scene. He brings a flavor to his films that is unique to him and yet carries with it something that touches all of us by trying to understand the human condition, its philosophical dilemmas, its heartaches, its romantic love, its joys, its fears, its failures and its triumphs.Which era would you want to return? I always say the late 60's but ""Midnight in Paris"" warns us each era has its problems and its vicissitudes as mankind tries to improve upon his historical condition from generation to generation. It, therefore, gives us pause for thought maybe the era in which we do live is the best era of all. It is surely the only one we know.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Getting lost with the Lost Generation,"Midnight in Paris is one of Woody Allen's better efforts over the past decade which for the most part has been repetitive and erratic. There are some bumpy moments and Allen sometimes allow his conceit to become a little too precious and stretched but Owen Wilson as his scruffy alter ego does a commendable job of playing guide to the ride to the past and Allen does a good job of disguising the outcome late into the film.Gil (Owen Wilson) is a Malibu screenwriter visiting Paris on a freebie with his fiancé's parents. Totally caught up in the past he pines for the romance of The Lost Generation and a desire to stay in the City of Lights and get caught in rain storms but squeeze Inez wants him back in sunny California churning out garbage for studios. One night, a bit tipsy, he takes a walk and gets lost. Attempting to get his bearings the clock strikes twelve and a vintage automobile pulls up with partying occupants who lure him in and back to Twenties Paris where he is introduced to the cream of the art world. He converses with the Fitgeralds, Hemingway, Picasso, Gertrude Stein among others as well as becoming infatuated with Pablo's mistress. Back in the Twenty-First Century things are becoming more abrasive with Inez and family. Gil now ponders whether he should return and remain in the previous century.Things move slowly in Midnight as Allen declares his total love for the City of Lights with a ponderous travelogue opening before going voice over into the credits to establish almost immediately the strain between Gil and Inez. Tagging along with another couple Inez keeps up her demeaning ways ad nausea until we are rescued by time travel with Gil and the Montparnesse crowd but the novelty begins to thin, that is until Gil hangs out with the Surrealists (Luis Bunuel, Man Ray and a terrific cameo turn by Adrien Brody as Salvador Dali) and the pace and humor begin to finally pick-up as Gil attempts to straighten his backbone. Allen name drops to no end with his legendary characters. Making some esoteric comic inferences such as explaining the plot of The Exterminating Angel to a confused Bunuel that may not resonate with the audience at large but one doesn't need to be up on his 20th century art and literature to find a decent amount of humor in Midnight.Owen Wilson is one of the best protagonist fits for Allen in some time but problems persist for his female characters with all three romantic interests ( Rachel McAdams, Marian Cotillard Nina Arianda) somewhat cliché and underdeveloped. Kurt Fuller and Mimi Kennedy as the parents do a fine job of allowing Allen to get in his jabs about conservative, ugly Americans while Corey Stoll as Papa Hemingway does a wonderfully stoic take on his macho ethos. Carla Bruni, wife of French President Sarkozy appears as a translator which is probably not a bad method of getting a country's cooperation to allow you to shoot a Keatonesque slap stick scene in Versailles Hall of Mirrors.Allen has done time and space travel before. He's done it better ( Zelig, The Purple Rose of Cairo) funnier (Sleeper) and worse (Scoop) but in today's era of devalued cinema Midnight in Paris offers decent respite from the frat house moronic humor and computer generated cuddly creatures monopolizing screens at the multiplex and perhaps reinforcing our understanding of why Gil wants out of these times.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Paris and literature taken to golden heights of intelligence and humour,"Have you ever wanted to see Owen Wilson play a modern day Alvy Singer and then transport him into the 1920s? I'm assuming that nobody other than Woody Allen has even thought about doing that. But trust me, now you'll want to see it. ""Midnight in Paris"" pairs ingenious casting with Allen's usual parade of characters (a neurotic writer, a right-wing Republican ignoramus, and a pedantic know-it-all) and places them in Paris.Woody Allen movies are typically described as a love affair with the city, but this one is just so much more. It's not just a love affair with Paris, but with the romanticism of Paris, and with the idea of the best years of the city, and a love affair that is too crazy to be real that we don't even call it cheating.Here we get a romantic comedy, and at the beginning, one that appears that it could be a very standard romantic comedy. But we flirt with philosophical notions of loving and living in the past, and of wanting to live in a time that has past, and then we heavily flirt and engage with the golden-age of literature. That's where the intelligence, education and Allen's pure intellect come in, but he makes it hilarious, not heavy.""Midnight in Paris"" is, quite literally, one of the smartest and funniest movies I have ever seen. It's almost as smart as ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" (1989) and just as funny as ""Annie Hall"" (1977). It will take a few more years and viewings before I can officially place it in that order of Woody Allen's best films, which for the most part is the same as the World's best films. But after the best night out at the cinema I have ever had, I have no doubt that's where ""Midnight in Paris"" will go.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

Funny in a nerdy kind of way,"This movie is great, begging to end. It's an original movie, it has themes like: Golden age thinking, denial and the real definition of success, which is not happiness.The cast is so wonderful. You would like to kill Rachel McAdams, or at least scream at her. Marion Cotillard is such a wonderful muse, Owen Wilson plays the lost dreamer perfectly and the 20's characters are so good too, they not only look like their parts but also act it very well. I saw an interview with Corey Stoll (Hemingway) and he said it was hard to play the confident macho surrounded by winning Oscar actresses. At least, he fooled me. I thought he was confidence personified.I read some reviews that said it wasn't funny. The only explanation I can give to that is the fact that it is a nerd movie. If you don't know who is Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Picasso and Dalí, don't watch it. It is impossible to relate to Gil (Owen Wilson) if you don't get the greatness of the people he is meeting. The first time I saw it I felt I was going to faint if I found Hemingway in a bar, and he is not even my favorite author, or how practical it would be to have surrealists as confidants.

A sad moment to witness for what was a great creative genius.The photography is indeed beautiful with various Paris scenes but the story plot is weak not only unbelievable but absurd.

Time to Retire Woody,"I understand that this picture is supposed to be a feel-good fantasy, with some mild intellectual insight. But I wanted to point out that the wildly Liberal Woody Allen doesn't show any minorities in his idealized version of the streets of Paris. Nor do most romantic comedies set in Paris or New York and geared toward an upper middle class, white professional audience.But given his politics, it seems ironic or telling, that he doesn't show groups of angry, young disaffected North African Muslims roaming the streets,nor images of black ghettos, Asian vendors, etc. To him, European Social Democracy is bliss, and Paris does not suffer from the plagues of urban decay that debase our cities in the U.S. Normally I would call him a liar and a hypocrite. Let's face it, he wants to live in a white, upper middle class world, no matter how virulently he jabs at Tea Party Republicans in this movie.Yes, he makes sure that his alter-ego, the main character, spews some vicious vitriol at his Republican in-laws-to-be. In addition, he portrays them as condescending, culture-less, materialists throughout.Owen Wilson does channel Woody Allen's neurotic persona to some degree, but I think that's o.k. It's Woody's film, and he used to play the main character in his films when he was younger. Wilson keeps it fresh, naive, and lovable, without conveying the cynicism of former characters played by Allen. I give both Allen and Wilson credit for this.The historical characters are over-the-top, comic book-like caricatures. I don't know whether Allen intended this. The plot device of time travel, while not unique, was mildly entertaining. I don't think the cinematography focused on the right images at all. Too many clichés, and not enough subtle hole-in-the-wall beauty.The dialog was nothing special, but the point made, about the past being overrated and relative, was more profound than what most modern movies serve us.I found the clarinet music obnoxious and oppressive, but I know that Allen plays the clarinet, and again, it's his movie. Maybe other people liked the music. That's fine with me.The bottom line is that Woody Allen is a Godless Liberal hypocrite, but he does have an endearing sense of romance and hope mixed in with his fear of death, and his loathing of half the human race.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

Excellent cinematography. Its a wonderful story of a young man who realizes that its not always greener on the other side of the hill. Its what you make of your life now that counts. Owen Wilson does a super job playing a somewhat befuddled young writer who is searching for happiness in his work and in his life.

"Mostly charming, too often cliché","What a coincidence: two of the films nominated for the 2012 Academy Awards Best Picture award--The Artist and Midnight in Paris--are magic-realism tributes from France to America and vice versa. The Artist does this elegantly, with a brilliantly original take on the classic riches-to-rags-to-riches redemption motif. Ironically, while fawning over Paris, Woody Allen had to spoil his movie by larding it with clichés about superficial, materialistic Californians. While The Artist was a pure and innocent celebration of Hollywood, Woody Allen is a typical young American effacing himself before superior European sophistication. Really quite sad, because the premise was clever, and charmingly carried out during those segments when the hero was soiréeing with historical cultural greats. I also love Paris, and also suffer the recurring fantasy of just simply...staying, maybe to write my book. My experience has been that haughty Parisians really are disarmed by Jerry Lewis-like Americans like me and Owen Wilson. ;) Call me another self-effacing young American, but a French director could have pulled off Midnight in Paris with grace and subtle humor while retaining his dignity.

If only real life could be a Woody Allen movie,"What can I say but bravo to the excellent story, writing, cast and movie specialists across the board. The story is told with such beauty and elegance. The period costumes were wonderful and the scenery and main character of Paris is sublime. As I'm watching the movie, I am wishing that I could travel to Paris and also travel in time to enjoy its story and history. I cannot congratulate Mr Woody Allen enough for producing such a wonderful experience for us all.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Light romantic comedy as told by the master,"ONE LINE REVIEW : Light romantic comedy as told by the master. RATING : Wait for the Instant Download (Ratings: ""See it in the theater"", ""Wait for the Instant Download"", ""Don't Bother"")NO SPOILERS""Midnight in Paris"" finds Gil (Owen Wilson), a successful screenwriter and script doctor, on vacation in Paris with his fiancé Inez (Rachel McAdams) and her parents (Kurt Fuller, Mimi Kennedy). Gil is taken with the city and contemplates living there and finishing his novel. (He imagines that he was born in the wrong time and should have been in Paris when the great writers lived and worked there.) Opposed to Paris, his fiancé wants to live in Malibu while Gil works in Hollywood. Gil likes to take long walks in Paris. During one of his walks he is picked up by an antique motor car that whisks him back to the 1920's where he meets his idols and a fetching young woman, Adriana (Marion Cotillard).This is a Nice Little Picture. Owen Wilson is basically playing Woody Allen, talking out loud what goes on in Allen's head, I presume. The jokes are mild (fair and balanced jabs at Republicans and retorts about Democrats). The characters are cartoonish, even stereotypical. And it is all very charming. Gil meets F. Scott Fitzgerald and his wife Zelda (the adorable Alison Pill), Picasso, Gertrude Stein (Kathy Bates), Ernest Hemmingway, and many other colorful characters. They all give Gil advice on what it is to be an artist.About the only thing I actually hated was Allen's explanation of the point of the film. We get a close up of Gil's face as he reasons it all out for us. I think most people who watch this film will be able to do the reckoning that is necessary to appreciate the message. My good friend Martin Bennett taught me the phrase ""on the nose"" – which is used when a writer has a character express their emotions for the audience. I hesitate (twice) to judge Woody Allen (who puts out a film about once a year), but I really think he should have let us take the message home ourselves, rather than dishing it out in stark terms.I liked this film, and I recommend it as a home viewing because it is classic Woody Allen. He plays here with time travel and gives no explanation of how it works – it is just the magic of Paris. And that is fine with me, and I think it will be fine with you as well.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
"A fun, and heartwarming fantasy tale","This film is about an American writer who travels to Paris with his fiancée. A chance encounter at midnight brings him back to the Paris in the 1920's.""Midnight in Paris"" is very unlike a Woody Allen film, as it lacks the non stop witty dialogs and sarcasm that are normally his trademarks. Still, ""Midnight in Paris"" is highly intellectual and enjoyable. The way it entertainingly weaves through so many artistic masterminds in a story is quite genius. It gives me the impulse to go and study art history! The cast is magnetic; Owen Wilson breathes life into this confused man, while Adrien Brody is particularly memorable as Salvador Dali. Even Carla Bruni is in the film, which is almost a official recognition by the French that ""Midnight in Paris"" is a great film.""Midnight in Paris"" might be the most commercial film Woody Allen has made in years. It is a fun, and heartwarming fantasy tale. I am glad that this has translated to box office success.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Good reflection,"This film manages to make you reflect if you are really doing what you really want and about looking for it in the present.The story of this movie has a good development, the direction makes us feel in the 20's and why the main character is so amazed by that time, also due to the excellent production design. The character development makes us see that despite wanting to live in the past, in the present we can find what we are looking for, we just have to find it, it also shows us how sometimes we feel prisoners of our own lives, when the only thing that we have to do is change the things we dislike or try to improve them. Good performances make us empathize with the main character and make this movie endearing and enjoyable.The character of Rachel McAdams is unbearable and selfish, but this makes us understand the point of view of the main character, some characters do not have a good closure, as well as some situations, but even so, the story is endearing and makes you question about if you are really living your life and not doing it at someone else's convenience.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
I was surprised at how easy this was to watch,"I had been putting this movie off for years (obviously), as Woody Allen movies usually have a certain tone and energy that you need to have to appreciate them. Yeah, Annie Hall is good, but I don't want to watch it after work on a Thursday. Midnight in Paris, though, was so easy to watch. I love the themes, the dialogue, and acting. The romantic part is perhaps a it expected, but I don't think it really matters for what the movie was trying to do. As far as the criticism of nostalgia and rose coloured glasses, it really connected with me. I tend to enjoy older things more than newer things, and feel like the current age can fail artistically at times. But this movie has a great message that really made me rethink my views. Personally, I really love that feeling... when a movie makes me introspect! Anyway, I also found it easy to watch and just basically enjoyable. I laughed pretty hard at a couple scenes as well. I imagine this will be Woody Allen's last great film, but it's worth watching and not as artsy as you'd think,",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Artsy time travel,"I really enjoyed watching this film multiple times. It's a great adventure with everything I love, art, writing, history, Paris, and phenomenal actors. I would have given it a 10, but I do not think it's necessary for filmmakers to bring their own personal political view as a jab to the other party. I get it, it is their right, and although they may get a good laugh about it, it takes away from the wonderful film this is. I think a lot of Hollywood has a problem with Conservatives and Christians And put them in a negative and demeaning light. It's time to stop that. Other than that I love this very well done film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Literary Fantasy not my taste but I won't hold it against the movie,"Gil (Owen Wilson) is on a trip to Paris with his fiancée Inez (Rachel McAdams) and her rich conservative family. One night, Gil takes a walk by himself as Inez goes dancing with her friends. A car stops and picks up Gil who is a little tipsy. He ends up in a party in the 1920s with some literary luminaries of the times. He's an amateur writer and is in awe of the company. He can't seem to take Inez there, but he goes back every night to see his new found friends especially Adriana (Marion Cotillard).This must be what a fantasy looks like to the literary set. There is a lack of tension. This is more lyrical and more whimsical. The real world holds no interest for me, and I couldn't care less if Gil walks away from it all. My solution would be to fuse the characters Gabrielle (Léa Seydoux) and Adriana together. The fantasy world isn't real enough for me. Gil is constantly in awe. It feels like a costume party with all the literary name dropping. It's not really my field of expertise and I may be missing a lot. It is however very well done with Owen Wilson's great wide-eyed character.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
"If you love Paris, the film is worth it for the opening montage alone","While I've caught most of Woody's last few films on NetFlix (I think the last one I saw in the theater was Match Point), I wanted to make sure to see Midnight in Paris on the big screen for the full effect. I was not disappointed -- I had tears streaming down my cheeks within the first two minutes, feeling as if I'd been transported to beautiful Paris for a couple of hours.I think this is a fine film, and it was certainly entertaining -- with a core message that I can understand and relate to. When you've seen most of Woody's films over the years, you immediately recognize the character ""types"" reappearing in slightly different situations with other actors in the rolls. That's a double-edged sword in that there's something familiar about the ebb and flow of his films, but it can also be somewhat trite and annoying. Fortunately, that didn't seem to bother me as much in this film because the historical characters helped to draw some attention away from the more formulaic ones, and really added a lot of spice.I don't think this is one of Woody's top five films, but it's certainly the best (and only) 2011 summer release I'm planning on seeing . . . it's slim pickings in the theater these days for people with a brain.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

Woody Allen adds a rather unique (and very good) movie to his filmography.,"""And actually, Paris is the most beautiful in the rain.""Probably the most charming and fanciful Woody Allen movies that I've seen, and also one of the most enjoyable. Owen Wilson is great as a proxy Allen, transported back to the streets of 1920's Paris and looking for his ""Golden Age"" amongst the famous writers and artists that wafted through the city at that time.I really don't have any criticisms about the movie. The script is trademark Woody Allen, full of musings about life and happiness, but it's more subtle and natural than his dialogue can often be. The cast is great (Corey Stoll as Earnest Hemingway and Adrien Brody as Salavador Dali being two of the most memorable examples), and Paris looks so beautiful that it often can distract from what's going on with the characters.Fully recommended for Woody fans, Wilson fans, romantics at heart, and those who love Paris (both past and present).",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
A Dull Affair,"I know negative reviews usually get the 'thumbs down' on IMDb and I understand that.However, how this movie got an overall score of 8.1 is beyond me. Unless you are a literary aficionado who takes great pleasure in 20th century stories and their authors, you will find no joy in this film.The main plot consists of a script writer attempting to get his book approved by famous authors who lived many years ago. If you, like me, take no joy in seeing F. Scott Fitzgerald amongst others portrayed on screen, I'd skip.The pace is slow and repetitive (he goes back in time every midnight at the same place, the only question is 'what will he do tonight?'. He doesn't do a whole lot if you're wondering.)The relationship between Owen Wilson's character and that of Rachel McAdam's is strained and watered-down to fit the short amount of time in the film that Wilson is in present day.Audience reaction: There were about 20 people in the theatre. There were several boos, not at the end of the film, but during the film itself! While audiences talking is usually frowned upon, several couples were chatting and nobody, including myself, seemed to care because their conversations were far more entertaining than the film anyway.Approach with an open and knowledgeable mind.",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
A Trip Down Memory Lane,"Midnight in Paris (2011)**** (out of 4)A writer (Owen Wilson) and his fiancé (Rachel McAdams) travel to Paris where his walk through the streets after midnight will eventually change his life. After deciding to walk alone, the writer eventually gets picked up and travels back to Paris in the 1920s and comes face to face with such famous personalities as Ernest Hemingway, Zelda and Scott Fitgerald, Cole Porter, Salvador Dali, Pablo Picasso and Luis Bunuel among others. After these fantasy meetings the writer begins to rethink his position in life and what he wants for his future. MIDNIGHT IN Paris isn't a masterpiece as there are quite a few flaws and it's certainly not higher level Woody Allen but there's no denying that it's one of the most magical, charming and fun movies he's ever made. The film really is a mixture of MANHATTAN and PLAY IT AGAIN SAM, which certainly isn't a bad thing. Those who have seen MANHATTAN will remember that the film started off with clips of the city and the same thing happens here as the movie opens with various lovely shots of Paris. The fantasy angle of the film is something we've seen from Allen in movies like PLAY IT AGAIN SAM and even EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU had a great fantasy sequence at the end. You can't help but think Allen must have had a field day writing the screenplay and I think the results really show on the screen because there's just a certain charm and joy that bleeds in every scene and I honestly don't remember a single second where I didn't have a big smile on my face. In an early scene we get a dialogue bit where the characters talk about Wilson's character being in love with the past and how he thinks the ""golden age"" was back in the 20s. I'm sure Allen fantasizes about this as well and this comes across in the screenplay because when the fantasy aspect kicks in and Wilson starts meeting all these famous people you can't help but fall in love with the scenery, the words and of course the streets of Paris. People have been talking this up as a romantic comedy and in many ways it is but at the same time you have to admire the way Allen works the reality and the fantasy and you can't help but think that he was saying that quite often the fantasy is much better than any reality you can put yourself in.Since Allen started taking major gaps in between his acting, there have been quite a few people try and fill his shoes and the results are always very hit and miss. Wilson perfectly nails this character because you can believe that naive nature of the guy but he's also relaxed enough to where you can get into the story and follow it. The screenplay bleeds with joy about meeting these famous people but Wilson really sells it and that astonished look he gets on his face when he meets these people helps sell the stories. Wilson is so great in the role that you can't help but wish he and Allen would do more films. McAdams is as charming as ever and plays that ""Allen female"" just fine. Adrien Brody is terrific as Salvador and Kathy Bates gets a good part as Gertrude Stein. As great as everyone is, it's Mario Cotillard who steals the film as Adriana, a mistress to Modigliani and Picasso and the one who really strikes it up with Wilson's character. Cotillard is so beautiful and her natural charm just leap off the screen and you can't help but fall in love with her as she's certainly one of the greatest characters in any recent Allen film. The chemistry between her and Wilson is terrific and she really does look and feel like someone from this era.I'm sure many people won't understand all the characters and I'm sure many people might watch MIDNIGHT IN Paris and be confused at who these famous faces are. Let's be real, in today's world not everyone is going to know these famous names and they're going to miss many jokes. There's even a terrific and hilarious bit about Bunuel's THE EXTERMINATING ANGEL that is going to be missed by some viewers but if you know the film then it's going to be a classic example of writing and comic timing. MIDNIGHT IN Paris clearly isn't meant to be taking overly serious since, after all, we're dealing with a man living out a fantasy in the 1920s Paris but Allen gives so much detail to his characters that you can't help but fall in love with them and the city. It's clearly a love letter to not only Paris but these wild characters who Allen wanted to have some fun with.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
"Utterly charming, beautifully filmed romantic classic","Of all the Woody Allen movies in all the art-house theaters in the world, this one is one of his truest, most engaging, most satisfying, and most existential. It's a gigantic treat to lovers of literature everywhere, but even if you don't know Toulouse-Lautrec from 2Pac, you should truly love either the tantalizing romantic angles or the mystery/fantasy underlying them all.Allen is getting too old to be playing himself in these movies, so the task falls to Owen Wilson (who doesn't have to change anything to do an Allen impression). Wilson plays Gil, a Hollywood writer engaged to Inez (Rachel McAdams), and they're tagging along with Inez's parents on their vacation to Paris. But while Inez is enamored with pretty, shiny objects and appearances, Gil instantly falls in love with the soul of Paris and wants nothing more than to wander its streets, particularly at night, to soak in its ambiance and perhaps get inspired to work on his burgeoning first novel. After all, such literary greats as Hemingway, Eliot, Fitzgerald, and Stein roamed those very streets; perhaps what they saw will help Gil.Now, the following is not a spoiler in least. A quick look at the list of characters should indicate a change in venue for Gil. One evening, a little drunk from a wine tasting, Gil sits on a church's steps; as the clock chimes midnight, an old car pulls up, exhorting him to come with them. Where? Why to the Fitzgeralds' of course. This leads Gil down quite the path of self-examination and inspiration.Along the way, Gil meets many of his literary heroes and discovers a little bit about what makes them tick. He's even able to make return visits by going to the same place at the same time. Of course, Inez doesn't believe him and is increasingly concerned with buying antique furniture with her bossy, snobby mother. The chasm between man and almost-wife widens.There are several reasons to recommend this movie. As usual, Allen's handpicked cast is up to its tasks. Some of these actors are known quantities to many people, but some are not; either way, they imbue their own characters with such a sense of reality that it's easy to imagine that actor truly is that icon. They deal not in caricatures but in realizations.Another huge plus is the way that the storyline is set up. On the one hand, you have the conflict between Inez and Gil, and on another you have his cathartic moments with his literary heroes. Along the way, Gil meets the Portugese Adriana (Marion Cotillard), a beauty who has inspired famous painters and who is in love with an earlier time – just as Gil is infatuated with his own earlier time. The moral that ties these two worlds and their inhabitants together is a simple one, and Allen delivers it with subtle grace and beauty.I have never been to Paris, a faraway land to me. But look at what Allen has done with the way the movie is shot. Paris is idyllic in the daytime, a combination of markets and boutiques, air-conditioned restaurants and street cafés. At night, the city comes alive, even in the rain; the movie is shot with such unerring detail and each raindrop seems a work of art symbolizing Gil's various quandaries.I think that Midnight in Paris is one of Allen's finest over the past 20 years, perhaps one of his best ever, and certainly I'm not saying so idly. The man has a long track record of delightful, funny comedies and romances. He knows his audience well. But here, I think he surpassed some expectations; his recent spate of Euro-centric movies (like Vicky Cristina Barcelona and Match Point) were fairly well received by most critics (ahem, not this one), but Midnight in Paris far exceeds them both – as well as just about anything Allen's done going back to the mid-1990s. It is a superlative film that's rich in texture, meaning, and elegance, and its ending is a little surprising but certainly plausible – the perfect ending.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
A charming story set in a charming city,"You have to be a little familiar with the golden age of the ""roaring 20's"", to be able to appreciate this dream-like movie: when Paris was the centre of a brilliant and explosive cultural environment and people like Hemingway, the Fitzgeralds and many other artistic geniuses strolled around the city in search for inspiration as well as pleasure. For me, it was one of the most charming literary period of all times, that's why I couldn't but enjoy this lively picture, which gets to render the enjoyable and intellectually brilliant atmosphere of those times. Let's admit that the subject and the setting could be enough to make a movie appealing, but Allen reveals once again to be the best director when trying to capture the spirit of a city: in this case, the magic of the ""ville lumière"" really springs out from every day-and night framing, making the viewer feel like being there.There's always the Allen character, Gil, partially neurotic but poetic at the same time, but the characters I liked most are those magically related to that literary past, in particular, Corey Stoll as Hemingway, Marillon Cotillard as Picasso's lover, but above all an extraordinarily convincing Cathy Bates as Gertrude Stein. There's some wisdom in the dialogues, mainly focused on the perpetual human dissatisfaction for the present, and the longing for a more intense and vivid past, and so the contemporary Gil longs for the jazz age, the Jazz age longs for the Belle époque, which in turn longs for the Renaissance.... to the conclusion that the present is the only possibly vivid time, only if we have the courage to live it. As I have already noticed in Allen's latest movie, the director is getting old and seems to be looking for some final comfort, as if, once abandoned the caustic tone of the past, he has turned to a more relaxed and peaceful one. With ""Midnight in Paris"", the story, and the way it is handled seems to confirm my impression, and the result is a pleasant, enjoyable, lively comedy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Owen Wilson Acts!,"What? This film is not a goofball comedy with Owen Wilson's whiney voice? OK, the voice is naturally whiney; but, Wilson really is a very good fit for this part.Is there great acting here? Not really - at least not by the major current day characters; but, go back to the turn of the century characters and it's wonderfully acted. Probably a function of more robust writing for the older scenes and a bit of a plodding script for current day.All that negativism behind me, this is really quite an enjoyable film - an interesting premise for a story, generally well written, excellent direction and amazing sets. How could they not be amazing, you say, after all, it is Paris. But, how many of us have seen Paris, let alone at the turn of the century.All in all, Woody Allen has done it again.

Gimmicky and meaningless!,"""Midnight in Paris"" was a massive disappointment.The film is full of beautiful shots of Paris and perhaps this may distract viewers from the fact that this movie is void of any real meaning whatsoever.The 'story' is about a writer Gil (Owen Wilson) who wants to stay in Paris and write. His fiancé (Rachel McAdams) and her family are wealthy superficial socialites. Every night, Gil 'time travels' back to Paris 1920s where he meets all his artistic and literary idols. This is little more than an exercising in name-dropping and talent-wasting. He meets a non-superficial woman (Marion Cotillard).I can't spoil the storyline because nothing happens. In what I suppose could be called the 'climax', the character Gil himself experiences what he describes as a ""minor epiphany"". It barely even qualifies minor. It's meaningless.The 'characters' are woefully under-developed, completely two-dimensional.Woody himself as described his film-making style as ""lazy"" and I have to say this is Woody at his laziest.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Tears in the eye of the rhinoceros,"With some films in you, you should probably now by now how to handle Woody Allen, what is or isn't worth your time; the visual imagination, beautiful or borrowed; the snarky wit, acerbic or whinging; the nervous tics and anxieties, relatable or complacent.I happen to not be attuned at all with him, and have only moderately enjoyed a few films a long time ago. He looks up to Bergman, I am an Antonioni person. So I will always resolve in favor of cessation, concentrated mind, detached perception, and the idea that the content of the mind does not matter one bit - which both him and Bergman anxiously probed about - so long as we get to understand the mechanisms that give rise to it and give rise to images with an eye on an awareness that liberates from them and opens up horizons.Here we have one such film about internal mind, and in a form that appeals to me; the look from inside the mirror, in an effort to give us actual in-sight of the mind weaving stories.For this to work, we need to be able to make concessions. We also need to be nostalgic for the golden afterglow to warm us. We need to be willing to be transported to where not everything makes sense. We need to give in a little to the fantasy as though it was our own.So for most of the film we get to wander around a dreamy 1920's Paris all in an effort to apprehend the circumstances that would provide inspiration and strength to overcome insecurities back in the waking world. Back where an airheaded blonde wife waits for us to have dinner in the fancy restaurant, the disapproving parents, the suave sexual antagonist; a cast of shrill stereotypes out of a Woody Allen film.The lesson that we fish inside the fantasy is the expected, the only one that can be valuable. It is a dangerous chimera to indulge the mind; now matters, there was never any other world, any world more beautiful.But it does remain on the whole a film where the fantasy is a superficial romp, with the important realization merely tucked at the end of a good time. As it turns out, there was nothing in the bottoms of this mind that is a shadow from the surface, or a particularly deep encounter, beyond of course getting to meet the woman of one's dreams. How poignant it would have been for example, if the anxieties above were recast inside the fantasy in forms that we know from movies? What Lynch has done so ingeniusly. There is none of that here, just the love letter already stamped.In the middle of so much art and so many encounters with the people who made it, the greatest art however remains this city of lights. It is truly a cinematic jewel, and Woody's virtual wandering is the best thing next to living in it.If the premise here appeals to you, I recommend that you seek out films by the filmmakers who inherited surrealism as the means to re-invent cinema. The journey from that short with the sliced eye from the period referenced here that Bunuel did with Dali to Welles who parodied that stuff at the time but used that eye to slice narrative, to how Raoul Ruiz transfigured Welles. Start with Ruiz, who recently passed away. Woody's film is breezy but decorative.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
The best Woody has done in a long while,"Truth be told, after following his career diligently through to the end of the 80s - 1990 is in fact the end of the 80s and Alice was the last I've seen of Woody's work without missing a single one. There were still some very good movies in the 90s but in recent years he seemed to be making a film a year because that's what he does. The last two I've seen though technically flawless lost the special soul and personality that was his trademark. Whatever Works of two years ago was nice and had a great Allen feel to it (it was an old script after all) but the plot was forced at many moments and never more so than at the end which gave the whole experience a bad after taste.Well I've heard this one was different, and after great deliberation decided to give Woody another shot. I wasn't disappointed, it is as the title said the best I've seen of him for a very long while. In fact the only flaw I did find in the movie was Owen Wilson whom I do like in many of his roles but I must say -despite looking almost like Woody without the glasses it felt like he was busy doing a Woody imitation and not playing the struggling writer he should have been. Every one else was perfect. The plot flowed seamlessly the cinematography was amazing and all the other actors were super. Even Carla Bruni played her tiny role perfectly (which wasn't as small as I thought it would be) thing is her real role is another Woody trick to make sure we always remember this is a movie. Just like Rembrandt made sure we could see his brush strokes, Woody makes sure we'd never forget none of it is real - it's all his movie and his vision. Altogether it's a real nice clever movie to watch, not a masterpiece but not a waste of time or a disappointment by any stretch.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

I love how each character had a purpose and everything seemed to flow as if it were the real people, themselves.

Midnight in Paris,"I'm not a firm buff of Woody Allen's films and also unable to catch up with his prolific filmography, I skipped his last two features YOU WILL MEET A TALL DARK STRANGER (2010) and WHATEVER WORKS (2009) after a delightfully absorbing VICKY CRISTINA BARCELONA (2008)MIDNIGHT IN Paris has been hyped to be a new pinnacle of Allen's late career (a career peak in the North American box-office too) since its release, maybe even nourish a slight chance for a BEST PICTURE Oscar nomination, which has been long overdue for any Woody's pictures since HANNAH AND HER SISTERS (1986), but after my viewing, I find it not so rosy on its Oscar path, I presume the sole possible chance is still Allen's strong suit, the screenplay and that will be all!I like the film by and large and I find the back-from-the-future plot is intriguing at first, then after the unorthodox Cinderella-esque midnight wander becomes the the inscrutable linchpin, the arrest deflates bit by bit while an intense concussion of bathos becomes presiding. Clearly the film is a love-letter (maybe a love-postcard) to Paris from Allen (strangely there is no French funds for the film, which is indeed a Spain-USA concoction), maybe I have no such approbation for Paris (a city doesn't tempt me for a must-see visit), so I feel neutrally immune to the cameos from those prominent artists of1920s (the only memorable presence is none other than Corey Stoll's chivalric Hemingway, who manages to exude a few wisdom from his sidelined character, his remark about a true hero's not-afraid-of-death-status is biased but contains Woody Allen's own sullen wit). Basically speaking, there is no single performance is outstanding like Woody's previous works (notable for its notorious hotbed for BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS nominations), but female characters' overpowering poise is always there, my personal penchant leans to Rachel McAdams' stereotypical mean woman caricature, repelling enough so as to that I adore her more, not the character but the acting per se. Marion Cotillard is being squandered drastically, but it will not hurt her charisma; other numerous secondary characters are all nothing but linear.The film proposes a contentious subject matter, a nostalgia addiction of the Golden Age, but in my opinion, why don't we just treasure art itself without encountering the artists (or asking yourself before make the move, ""am I sure I can handle a true artist?), but if you are aiming for a sizable discount, it would be a different cup of tea then.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

This film for me defines everything I have ever wished for in life and everything I have ever questioned or been curious about. It's horrendously predictable at times, but in a way that makes you gasp in amazement, as oppose to writing it off for being awful. I honestly think that without this film, my thoughts and boundaries if you will would be so much more limited and engulfed in what I believe is available to me, as this shows you that there is so much more to life, that we will never be able to reach, and we should accept that this is how we are living and must make the best of it, as in the future many people will wish they were us. For that, I thank the director, for creating something truly spectacular.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
All cowardice comes from lack of love or lack of love.,"Its romance is that you can go back to the past and meet with the master, firm the man of your dreams, and reap a new one even if the real love is lost. As said in the film, it seems that the golden age that everyone thinks is not the present, but a period of time that has passed away.

A cute throwaway,"It is good to a see a comedy not designed for cognitively impaired twenty-year olds. You don't have to be drunk or stoned to enjoy this film. It has a cute plot gimmick, one that would be appreciated by The Onion fans (I am one) Wilson plays the Woody Allen character very well, all the other performances are fine, except Carla Bruni, who looks like she has stumbled into the movie by mistake. Once in the scene, she seems to be searching for a quick escape route.The problem with this film is that those of us who followed the Allen brand since it's inception know that better films were made with similar plot lines: a fantasy character (or more) intervene in a character's life and change it.(Play It Again Sam, The Purple Rose of Cairo) However, in this movie there are numerous characters of the 1920s, all cartoons with with little joke lines. Gertrude Stein is a butch, curt lady and Hemingway pontificates, each is on screen for a couple of minutes, then goodbye. None of these ""characters"" actually interact in any meaningful way with Wilson, the protagonist. Then it is all wrapped up in a facile platitude and a happy ending.It could have been so much better.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Makes you want to visit Paris or read the classics,"I abandoned this years ago. Second attempt I really enjoyed it. Guess I have grown as a person since then, and my likes and knowledge of famous literary icons has improved.Paris is the real star of the show though. It's a beautifully shot film. The kind of film that makes you want to just walk around through Paris, or basically any city, daydreaming of a different time.It's got a comforting vibe about it, and warm colours, great music. It all combines to create a wonderful atmosphere. A fantastic form of escapism. If it doesn't inspire you to visit Paris, then it would surely inspire you to delve into the work of these creative geniuses depicted.The story works well and I enjoyed the ending. The annoying characters became less annoying as the film progressed. Owen Wilson was well suited to his role. Glad I gave it a second chance!",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Midnight reality,"In Woody Allen's latest, you meet this Hollywood script writer visiting Paris with his girlfriend and her vulgar conservative parents.

He also meets this girl, who instead of the 20s she's a part of, dreams of ""La Belle Epoque"".So what is nostalgia? A pleasant way of refusing to accept your own time and in the long run, your own life? That's the question which is put here.

Woody Allen Zzzzzzzz,"I really don't get the hype with Woody Allen. I really do feel that it's a case of "" The Emperors New Clothes"" with his films. Actors and critics alike fall over backwards to praise his work yet i find it all very bland.Midnight in Paris is an odd film about a writer who , while on vacation in Paris with his wife to be, finds a way to go back in time to meet famous artists , writers and musicians and he soon realises that this world is far better than the one he currently lives in.As is any Woody Allen movie , Midnight in Paris is very dialogue orientated , and i have no problem with that but what i don't like is the pretentiousness of it. Allen presumes the audience is aware of the characters on show and their history and that everyone is in love with their work. It's not the case with me. Owen Wilson is irritating ( as usual) as is the totally unbelievable Rachel McAdams. You never get the feeling that these are a real couple.This film is not terrible , just boring and that really is not a trait i want in a film",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Allen at his best!,"For those of us who like to idealize, this film is for you! You may not be surrounded by beautiful women or the greatest geniuses in your generation like lucky Gil, nor be rich and engaged to nice lady. Nevermind, some of us always think beauty/ perfection/ ""meaning"" lies elsewhere. Gil idealizes the past, our thing may be different, but the ""mental process"" is always the same. As Gil realizes not very quickly: we always find the present, whatever present, a bit dull, whereas the romanticized version of reality we choose is lacking all rough edges, dreary routine, limits to our ambitions. ""Maybe people in the Renaissance would have liked to live in the age of a Khan :)"". As GeneralUrsus (US) writes on IMDb: ""(perhaps) we are never truly content in whatever station we reside"".Maybe our narcissism tricks us into believing that ""if things were/ had been different, if we took this or that turn in life, etc."", THEN, we'd be happy. Gil isn't in love with dull Inez, who doesn't love nor even respect him, neither do her parents (at all), and probably even Inez in turn is holding high hopes for his pedantic friend who likes to be the only one talking.Owen Wilson was a surprise for me. I really thought he was a concession for marketing reasons but no, in a way it's a wise cast decision: a tanned Californian blonde may be as out of place in intellectual's France of the 20's to make him a true foreigner, so his being ""out of tune"" with reality may be honest after all. He is a good actor, making us empathize with his bewilderment, curiosity and insecurities about his work. McAdams is not as beautiful as we've seen her before, maybe it's she being tanned, dyed and with high heels, it was surprising to me.Just one quibble: maybe too ""didactic"" and stereotyped views of our famous authors, like Hemingway wanting to challenge everybody all the time, Dali looks like suffering from OCD with rhinoceros, etc. Or they addressing each other by surnames. But I am sure Woody is right: we are not all knowledgeable in the names of 1920's artists, let alone XIX century painters, etc. John and Helen are also stereotyped Republican dumb arrogant ultra rich Americans. We probably won't get to know anybody so rich in our lifetimes, but anyway, I feel they deserve a bit more ""fairness"" than what they get. But well, given this is Art, I found Helen's quip: ""What's cheap is cheap"" perfect for the ""insatiable mother-in-law"", in that she's almost universal :). Hemingway is particularly well cast, as familiar face Kathy Bates as Stein. I found Brody as Dali as somewhat distracting me from the real character, but that's probably me. Léa Seydoux and Marion Cotillard vie for our hearts of romantic movie goers, it's hard to choose, Gil says it right when looking at beautiful working women at Pigalle: ""I'm afraid I like them all :)"". Adriana is probably more of an alluring tragic character, you can feel sadness by the way she looks.My favourite character is Gad Elmaleh's private detective. A well known actor in France, from ""La doblure"" among others, here it's a clueless detective (!), a bit like all of us in this film, and maybe in life too. Paul is the funny to hate rival, a cautionary tale for all of us who think that trying to be intelligent and ""know about many things"" will make us interesting while it only transforms us into bores that even a tourist's guide will remember with a frown :). I'd have liked Carla a bit more of screen time, but her goddess charm adds light to any project she participates into. I hope she'll keep on acting :)!I could go on and on about this film but what I want to highlight is that while it's an ode to the past, nostalgia, and unfulfilled dreams, it also cries in a beautiful way: ""Seize the present!"" and ""Choose the best from what's available"" for it's the only thing that's real, the only thing that we'll ever have. The Woody Allen reader has a funny quote about steaks that says it better than we could ever do, in an American ""matter-of-fact"" way that is refreshing.Enjoy this movie, you just won't regret it!",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

Rating Midnight in Paris,"Midnight in Paris is a romance/fantasy movie that came out in 2011 and was written by Woody Allen. The movie starts by introducing the protagonist, Gil Pender (Owen Wilson), an author, visiting Paris, France with his fiance Inez (Racheal McAdams). Gil is on writer's block, so he takes a late-night walk to get some inspiration. One night, as he walks through the city of Paris, he encounters some strange people, who invited him to come with them. He soon learns that he has traveled back in time to the Jazz Age. They take him to a party, where they introduce him to well-known writers such as F. Scott Fitzgerald (Tom Hiddleston) and Ernest Hemingway (Corey Stoll). He talks to Ernest Hemingway who directs him to Gertrude Stein (Kathy Bates). She looks at his manuscript.When he travels back to the present, he wants to show this to Inez, but she believes Gil is sick and imagining these events. Gil has figured out how to travel back in time to bring his manuscript to Gertrude Stein . He meets a new artist, Picasso (Marcial Di Fonzo Bo). Gil also meets Adriana (Marion Cotillard), who has caught his attention. Gil continues to travel between his time and the Jazz Age and develops some close relationships with the people from the 1920's. These visits have left Gil realizing what he wants in life.This movie is good for the whole family to watch because it has fantasy, time travel, artistic cultural references, and romance. It brings the Jazz Age alive through the screen.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
C'est Si Bon,"This movie gets better with each repeat viewing. Clever concept of romanticizing the past and finding happiness in the present. Owen Wilson is not prime leading man material, but he does an excellent job as the Woody Allen stand-in (You can picture Woody in the part fifty years ago). Even better is Rachel McAdams as the fiancee from Hell. She's simply hilarious constantly cutting down Gil (Wilson). Key to the success of all Woody Allen films is the casting, and here he nails every last one, including the amusing celebrity lookalikes. The young Picasso is particularly on target, as is Adrien Brody as Dali. The gag about Luis Bunuel's ""The Exterminating Angel"" is a sublime ""in"" joke. Great location photography of beautiful Paris. Still can't figure out how they filmed Versailles without the mobs of tourists who swarm the place daily. Definitely one of Woody Allen's best efforts.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
astute and charming story,"""Midnight in Paris"" is different from the most recent Allen's stories, such as ""Match Point"" (telling about class), or ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona​"" (as celebratory about being hit by a European city). It is a well crafted fable about romance and the pleasures had when idealizing another artist's era. ""Midnight in Paris"" is truly charming and intelligent. The pseudo-cultured and provincial are perfectly rendered by Inez and her parents John and Helen. Actors Kurt Fuller​ and Mimi Kennedy​ deliver excellent performances, as well as Inez's friend Paul (Michael Sheen​). The filming location (Paris, first time in Allen's movie) gets to represent very effectively the magnificent stroll.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

I little piece of me died watching this,"Utter drivel. This is quite possibly the most dull, drifting, lifeless and try-hard pretentious movie I have ever seen. The plot is weak and poorly realised, the cast disjointed and lacking chemistry, and the constant blur of references to history's literary/art greats grates quicker than a parmesan-happy Italian waiter. Be prepared for pockets of smug snickering and the odd guffaw outburst - ""look Cuthbert, a fountain!!"", while the rest of us (the majority) look on in bewilderment at what is unfolding before our eyes - ""isn't that Owen Wilson? Isn't he normally quite good?"". Errr, non.In between pretending to gouge my own eyes out to my wife, I did notice the Dublin cinema we were in had an unusually high amount of ceiling vents for its size (23!) and that the seats had considerably more leg space than our Ryanair flight over. I would have left early, but I'd paid 5 for a pack of extra sour fizzy snakes and it felt like an endurance challenge. Interestingly I counted 47-and-a-half snakes in the bag. Not bad.I was hardly expecting the time travelling exploits of Bill & Ted (though that would've been far more enjoyable), but I do wish I could rewind time and go to the cinema next door where they were playing 'Afraid of the Dark'. Instead I watched this, and now I'm 'Afraid of Paris'. Merci, Woody.In summary, I did not like this film one bit and it makes me sad that I will never, ever see those two hours of my life again. On the plus side, I nailed that bag of fizzy snakes, so I guess everyone wins.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Highly original and one of the better Woody Allen movies of the last few years,"One of the more original movies I've seen in the last few years. The central plot - person gets magically transported back to Paris in the 1920s and meets some of the luminaries of the art world of that time - is very interesting and entertaining.However, after a while it gets a bit tedious. You start to expect famous characters at every turn, and lo and behold, there they are. Salvador Dali (played by Adrien Brody) appears, for no reason other than to have an arcane semi-funny musing about a rhinoceros!It also started to feel like everything was one big in-joke: you need to know the art world of the 1920s to follow some of the sub- plots and comments.Thankfully, just when it looks like it is going to degenerate into Woody Allen showing us how many famous people from the 1920s he can fit into one movie, he brings things back on track, and ultimately makes a very good point.One thing you cannot disparage about the movie is the dialogue. It contains all the usual Woody Allen neurosis and intellectual pondering, and the humour is as sharp as ever. With age, Woody Allen has become more content to reduce the number of jokes in his movies, but make them more impactful. Rather than just have a laugh-a-minute, he now takes extraordinary care and length in setting up his punchlines, so when the jokes come, they come out of the blue and with a vengeance.Little wonder then that Woody Allen won the Best Original Screenplay Oscar.Solid performances all round. I am not a fan of Owen Wilson, but he captured the usual Woody Allen leading character (neurotic, over- thinking, indecisive) well. Good performance too from Rachel McAdams. The supporting cast is quite star-studded - Michael Sheen, Marion Cotillard, Kathy Bates, Carla Bruni, Adrien Brody - and they don't put a foot wrong.Worth a watch.

This movie was beautiful even from the beginning of the film where they started off my showing snapshots of Paris, just astonishing.

However, this movie was the opposite and I think this film did a great job of portraying Paris during that time.

The film doesn't try too hard to be funny, not is the humor raunchy or overly.This film is quite tame with very little cursing either.

Write something awesome review,"""Bullfighting is the only art in which the artist is in danger of death"" - Ernest Hemingway. Once you watch ""Midnight in Paris"" you will want to travel to Paris as soon as possible . Woody Allen, the writer and director of this amazing film, gives us the romanticism of what Paris is to the eye of the artist. Falling in love with a city, especially a romantic city such as Paris where the famous artists and writers of the 20th century gathered. It's amazing that I'm not the only one that can be excited to see famous actors such as owen wilson, kathy bates, cory stolle, and many more playing famous artist/writers from the era of the ""lost generation"" of the 20s.""Midnight in Paris"" was filmed in Paris in 2011 with such imagery and music that made them win an oscar for the Best Writing, Original Screenplay. I love this film because it gives life to so many of my favorite artists of that era. Hemingway , Dali , Picasso ,and many more were portrayed wonderfully by these amazing actors who gave them life and became a great background story which immerses you within the film's main character who travels in time to meet his favorite writers living in Paris in the 1920s. Such wonderful surrealist thoughts of what one would do if we could encounter our favorite writers, artists, or anyone from that point in time. It is a must see movie, because it will give you chills and if you are an artist you for sure would want that of time traveling to meet your favorite people that are no longer alive.

A decent kind of job from Allen,"So often we hear that Woody Allen is ""back to his best"" and that he is producing work that maybe even matches that of his critically acclaimed works decades ago, this movie I feel though does not match those claims. Take nothing away from this film, it is a good one and it is pretty fun with some well created characters and a witty script, it isn't however a great movie and that I feel is the least it has to be if it is to be considered one of Allen's best. The story is a fantasy basically and how a Hollywood screenwriter visiting Paris (although with hopes to live there one day) is whisked back and forth at the stroke of midnight into the 1920's, full of famous faces.The film feels like it's Woody Allen not just from the pretty quirky story but just the music that is used, if you walked in on this film and had no idea what it was, the music I feel would show you it is one of Allen's. The film explores the Paris of the past that inspired the very best of writers, painters and entertainers and really brings at least a fresh story with it, one that is fairly un- generic as well. I don't think the movie excels massively in the comedy area but does have the odd good laugh and when most jokes are done they are smartly done, but not always though that laughable.Owen Wilson is Gil Pender the man who is travelling back, Wilson is pretty nice in the role and is extremely calm, I swear this is one of the most laid back acting performances ever. The cast is full of names like Michael Sheen, Kurt Fuller, Kathy Bates, and Marion Cotillard and also features Rachel McAdams who as Wilson's extremely annoying fiancée is really hard to like, but acted well though. Allen brings together a cast that can seem randomly placed, new people arrive around every corner and some are just never seen again, Allen paces this pretty fast but does manage to slow it down when it needs to be at least.You know Woody Allen doesn't do a bad job at all of directing and writing this but also at the same time doesn't make this fantastic, even with the nice fantasy element he fails to make this completely charming. There is no doubt Allen is considered one of the masters of the romantic comedy genre but here is no mastery, it is good work but is far from the level most expect of Allen, some may find this excellent but for me this is just straight good and no more. I don't think Allen makes mistakes but this I just feel is not made at a great enough quality as all.So Midnight in Paris is a Woody Allen work that probably won't rank highly in his catalogue but is easily a welcome addition and is recommendable, and not only to the fans of the man in the directors chair. I think it's the kind of thing that all can enjoy and it doesn't focus so much on the romantic element that it becomes bogged down in it, it mixes the fantasy into it very well too so that the story becomes nicely balanced, oh and add a little comedy to that balancing act too.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

The visuals!,"This dreamy film is especially moving due to its atmosphere, and I admit I didn't know how to explain it. Of course the visuals are stunning, but it's not just that. Obviously the 'artsy' premise is decisive for that magic feel. Even Owen Wilson, whom I usually don't like, added a touch of innocence and credibility, despite the fact that his character was a 21st century Allen (and well done, for that matter). It's very rare that a film suggests so strongly an atmosphere. I don't know how much has this artistic and idealized Paris in common with the one in the real world of today. But it's worth it.

An homage to Paris,"Mr. Allen had me at « Paris ». What a wonderful tour of this beautiful city, and the revived color of the Roaring Twenties and the Belle Epoque. The premise was great (for people like me, who are people like Gil in the movie). How many times have we dreamers envisioned ourselves living in a garret, lolling for hours in some little bistro while we sipped a glass of wine or a café allongé. Like Gil, every time I get to Paris, I wear myself out wandering little side streets and stopping at out-of-the way bistros and brasseries to rest while I sit and absorb atmosphere. Unfortunately, in my little randonnées I never managed to step through that magical curtain into the past. Much as I enjoyed the film, the story line and color, I do feel that the whole structure was somewhat contrived. Boy, this guy got a chance to visit with just about every artist, painter, writer, filmmaker available as well as their copines, throwing in a glimpse of Josephine Baker to boot. He even went farther into the past for a visit to the Moulin Rouge. Throwing aside any relationship to reality, this was an absorbing and fun movie to watch.

7.8?  Really?,"I remember when IMDb was the bastion of knowledgeable reviews of movies. I remember when I would choose which movie to watch by picking one from the IMDb Top 100. Inception confused me, it wasn't a very good movie, but it got a very good rating. But oh well. This on the other hand...I do not understand how a movie so devoid of any subtlety can be rated so highly. Each plot point was drawn out so crassly, so boringly, so artificially it was unbearable. No character was likable, as no character had even a semblance of depth. It was a parody of a parody, and not a good one at that. There was but one tiny laugh in the entire film.This movie was equivalent to a school project. To give it 7.8 out of 10 is to deceive the public of what is on offer. If you want a mindless rom com, then there are 101 other movies you can choose where the characters actually are human.This is the death knoll of the IMDb. To deceive such as this is beyond the pale.

Disappointing first time round but I fancy seeing it again,"I wrote the other day that a mediocre Woody Allen comedy is still a good comedy by any other standards (or something like that) and I stand by that, but this is only part comedy. I mean, you wouldn't call Sleeper a sci-fi comedy, it's a normal comedy set in the future, and you wouldn't call Curse of the Jade Scorpion a crime comedy (although it parodies detective films) or Love and Death a historical comedy, they're very witty, mildly absurd, satirical comedy films with different settings.Anyway, this isn't just a comedy in a different setting, it's a fantasy romance with comic elements, a weak lead character and dependent to a great degree on Americans' views of Paris. The comedy isn't always the main concern, the fantasy setting is a bit stereotyped but there's a twist or two, the romance is romantic enough, suspense is kept up well, Owen Wilson is OK but not a good enough actor to make up for the lack of snappy dialogue, the dullness of the character and being vastly and madly outperformed by a certain Mr Hemingway and a Snr Dali, among others. It seems to my European eyes that this is aimed again at US viewers, rather than just being Allen's personal vision. The 'Americans Abroad' perspective just doesn't work outside the US.Worth seeing but don't expect to laugh out loud more than 3 times.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

He can play goofy, cheesy roles, but is not really a strong character. Woody Allen found a way to make that work here, making the timid Wilson a strong lead.The film, of course, was nominated for best picture and won best screenplay. I think this is perfectly fair. Allen's strength is his writing. He is nothing more than an average director, but his scripts easily carry his films -- the intellectual dialogue is appealing without being pretentious.

"Magnificent, it is a love declaration for Paris.","With this film, Woody Allen makes, in the background, a love declaration for Paris, a city he already knows very well and for which he seems to feel a great affection. In addition to the beauty of the city, especially in the opening sequence, the script revisits the history and importance of the French city, as a meeting point for artists and writers.The film begins very well, introducing us to an American engaged couple who came to Paris on their father's business trip. From the start they seem a bit strange: she is quite frivolous and seems to feel that she is doing him a huge favor by marrying him, and it is perfectly obvious that her parents do not approve of the match; in turn, the young man is an aspiring writer who has grown tired of making Hollywood screenplays and wants to dedicate himself to writing and stay in Paris, ideas seen with disdain by the bride. However, everything will change when, after a disagreement, he walks back to the hotel and ends up having a meeting with a series of famous artists and writers from Paris in the 1920s: Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, Picasso, Dali, Buñuel, Gertrude Stein and others. That is, the film starts from a basic romantic comedy situation and creates a story where time travel ends up happening in a way that seems like the character is just dreaming, or in an illusion.Owen Wilson was impeccable in the lead role and gives us one of his best serious performances, which is no small feat. He is credible and convincing. Equally pleasant and sympathetic is Marion Cotillard, who gave life to the ""soul mate"" of Wilson's character, a dreamer and idealist who would rather live on a page of the past. In addition to being smart and sensitive, she is beautiful and attractive. Kathy Bates, Tom Hiddleston, Alisson Pill, Corey Stoll and Marcial Di Fonzo have given life to a series of artists and writers, each of whom played their part with aplomb and care. Rachel McAdams is good at her tiresome and irritating character.Technically, the film is flawless. The cinematography is exquisite, has ideal light and color, sharpness and depth. The city scenes are magnificent, and it's very easy to see the movie and want it all to be real. The sets are very good, and the same can be said for the choice of filming locations, made with care and method. Comedy is very present in the film and has elements with a certain quality, being in the dialogues and puns that it thrives. The entire film has a very good rhythm, which does not tire the audience or allow us to lose sight of it. Finally, a word of appreciation for the jazz soundtrack.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Enjoyable and nostalgic,"Midnight in Paris was an enjoyable film to watch, stories about time travel and great historical figures is always a treat to watch. The protagonist (Owen Wilson) perfectly fits into this story as a writer who fancies the past and the city of Paris. Woody Allen has shown his great talent through his direction, symbolism and letting the audience experience Paris in different times. It was fun ride to watch Gil (Wilson) travel back in time to the 1920s in Paris and Midnight and interact with some of history's memorable and significant figures. As the film progresses you see Gil's life and time become happier and more exciting but at the same time his life in the present is in decline. The first half of the film was magical and a joy to watch.The only criticism I have is the part where Marion Cotillard's character also has the opportunity to travel to an even earlier time in Paris in the same manner as Gil by accepting a ride at midnight. This somewhat made the film confusing and harder to buy into. How many people can slip back into time besides Gil so easily? While the past was celebrated well in the film the ease with which people could go back and possibly even change past events underscores its importance and significance it has played. I feel they could have omitted that element and it should have only been Gil's ability and journey. He could have still reached his epiphany that people in the present always look to the past and nostalgia is a feeling that each generation will continue to have. Overall still an enjoyable and creative film.7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

Pleasant But Not As Good As The Real Thing,"Woody Allen;s Midnight In paris had gotten quite a few positive reviews so I decided to give it a look. The film does basically look good, and as is usual for an Allen film, the score/music is right on as well. He toyed around a bit with the cast and offered up some fresh races here, and for the most part all of the performances were fine. While Midnight in Paris is pleasant and an easy watch, there was something lacking. Everything felt rather muted: there were touches of humor but nothing really funny. The script was very light but handled very matter-of-factly. None of the characters were interesting or developed enough to really care. There wasn't really any forward momentum or energy propelling the action forward for me. It was fine and worth seeing if you're an Allen fan, or maybe just a Paris fan you might it but not sure about that one. I really like Paris but am lukewarm on this film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Owen Wilson played the usual Woody Allen's part. And that's the good thing.,"30 years ago Woody would have played the protagonist himself and that would have been bad.Owen Wilson is closer to an average creative American circa 2011. It is easier to empathize with his character. Woody Allen is an outlier and his presence turns the show into a satire.I see how the film tells a story about a mythical Meta-Paris, a place and time where one feels happy, and empowered to control his environment and life.The upper class Californians are spot on. I have met such a family when visiting the famous Hitler's Eagle Nest. (I wish Wood Allen had time for a plot like that: Midnight at Berchtesgaden).I am giving only 8 stars because the American theme in the film is overblown and leaves no air for the European theme.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Can't imagine this movie got so many good reviews,"After reading reviews here, I have decided to watch this movie in Barcelona. Although I really did not like the way trailer has been put together, still wanted to give it a shot. Headed to a local cinema showing it in original language. As the trailer was telling me like ""don't go don't waste your time and money"", it was beyond belief that some people will rate this movie highly just because its an another ""master"" !? piece from Woody Allen.First of all movie is not a romantic comedy, its not a science fiction, its not a drama, its not a romantic drama nor its a comedy. Its a very creative idea of time traveling put in a very boring interrelated patterns.Acting is horrible as well. It could have been a great Hollywood comedy if directed better with better comedy lines. There was a single line which I laughed about Valium.

Just what the doctor ordered!,"American cinema of late has not produced memorable films. Out of a few hundred films that come out of Hollywood every year, most if not all are forgotten immediately.Just as I was starting to realize that golden era of filmmaking is long gone, that there will never be great acting and great stories told on the big screen, came ""Midnight in Paris"". What a joy to watch! Midnight in Paris is a film about a writer(played wonderfully well by Owen Wilson) who is on a trip to Paris with his fiancée (played equally well by Rachel McAdams) and who is longing for the ""good old times"" of early 20th century.It is probably best to know as little about this piece of magic filmmaking before watching it. Suffice it to say that one would be hard pressed to find a film which represents a more perfect combination of great story, with great sets and locations, great art direction and costumes, perfect performances by all actors including some surprises such as French first lady Carla Bruni, and beautiful music, photography, some of the best dialogues ever written for the big screen and above all - simple feeling of joy after watching a truly good film.All in all, this is a film that can be enjoyed many times over and in my book it gets a well deserved place among some of the best films ever made.If there are any regrets about it, it would be that it deserved many more Oscars than it got.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
"Owen Wilson gives a winner of a performance playing a character that the director might have done twenty, thirty years ago","The protagonist in ""Midnight in Paris"" is the sort of character than the film's writer/director, Woody Allen, might have played thirty years ago. Alas, Mr. Allen is now in his seventies, so the role had to go to somebody with somewhat shorter branches. Nevertheless, the director made a sane choice in casting Owen Wilson, an underrated actor who specializes at playing nebbish simpletons.Now the ads for ""Midnight in Paris"" are a first-class example of Hollywood's fiscal-minded schemes. You see Owen Wilson and Rachel McAdams strolling through Paris, smiling, arms around each other. If memory serves me correct, that only happens once in the film. The rest of the time, they are squabbling toward a non-reconciliation. The reason? One night, Mr. Wilson takes a drunken walk through the streets of Paris and is picked up by a mysterious yellow car. The car takes him, literally, back in time, allowing him to meet the great artists of the 1920s. Ernest Hemingway, Salvadore Dali, Pablo Picasso, and F. Scott Fitzgerald, just to name a few.The transitions where Mr. Wilson goes back and forth through time are a little skimpy and rough toward the beginning of the picture. They don't exactly convey a sense of mystery or bewilderment; as far as I was concerned, the protagonist was being duped. However, as the movie progresses, this lackluster mode of transition almost becomes suitable, if only because the filmmaker is allowing it to become familiar. In the midst of these fantastic adventures, during which Mr. Wilson falls in love with a French costume designer (Marion Cotillard), Woody Allen explores a common feeling among contemporary artists: the wish to have been born during a perceived ""golden age."" The ""golden age"" being determined by one's personal sense of admiration for those before him.Despite a somewhat uneven narrative and those pesky transitions, ""Midnight in Paris"" is still a modestly interesting experience. Most of the credit is due not to Mr. Allen's screenplay or direction (although both are just fine) but to Owen Wilson's flabbergasted, captivating performance. The actor gets inside his character's head and personality and blurts out complicated streams of dialogue without bloating into a hammy, nightstand performance. Miss McAdams, as his snotty fiancée, is also in fine form. Some very versatile talents also play the famous folk of the past, some only for very brief scenes. For instance, there is Adrien Brody playing Dali with a surprisingly good French accent. Marion Cotillard is also very good, but she's no stranger to praise from me.Perhaps the movie has too many characters. Too many romantic interests, chiefly. First of all, there's Miss McAdams, whose character I'm fine with. Then there's Miss Cotillard, who I liked the most. Then, however, there are two others: a tour guide played by Carla Bruni and Lea Seydoux as a Parisian record salesgirl. In all fairness, it was not a bad idea to provide a contemporary-era love interest for the hero, but these last two characters could have been all too easily combined into one person. Being separate, neither seems to have much purpose or development.The heroes of this film are Woody Allen and Owen Wilson. The latter does a stupendous job at playing the character, and the former sculpts the personality for him to play. The movie as a whole is also enjoyable in spite of its jumpy way of playing out its story. It also has a classic time-travel joke toward the end involving a gum-shoe and 1700s France. I'll let you check it out for yourself. About the only dreadful thing I could spot was an obnoxious music score, which unfortunately refused to stay in the background.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

He made what would be a nice sophisticated romance movie into a run-in-the-mill romantic comedy. At least romantic comedies are funny...

"Cute and quite enjoyable, but not much more","I'm not a big fan of Woody Allen's work, but this movie wasn't bad. However, I feel it was certainly not great, and felt rather flat in retrospection despite enjoying the majority of it.The movie begins with about four minutes of footage showing Paris in the rain, which in my opinion was a bit of a wasted time. It didn't further anything and didn't evoke any emotions toward the city. Later, we are introduced to our main character and his fiancé. They spend their time in a vacation in Paris, and we immediately understand how much our protagonist is in love with the city.Sadly, all the characters felt very shallow for me. There is the neurotic protagonist who doesn't really do anything and things just happen to him; we don't know a thing about the fiancé besides the fact she doesn't want to live in Paris and is in love with another sophisticated man; and all the other side characters show only one main quality rather than being three dimensional characters.The film doesn't try to present any logical themes about the time traveling stuff, but rather takes the time travels easily, which isn't a bad thing. The story doesn't make much sense and there are many plot holes which are not addressed, but it didn't bother me too much overall.The parts which I liked the most are the ones in Paris in the 1920's, and the various well known figures we meet there. It was pretty fun, and the characters were colorful enough to enjoy them. However, at some point towards the end of the movie, I realized there isn't a real emotional hook to keep me interested in the characters and what happens to them. I was left a little underwhelmed, and the moral of the story was shoved in the audience's throats. In the end, it was pretty enjoyable, but not much more than that.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Media Literacy,"Midnight in Paris was released in 2011. This film mixes comedy, fiction and love, all under the signature of Woody Allen. The film tries to reflect a utopian view of ""The City of Light"" where everything can happen if you dream, and of course, if you are a true romantic. The film is essentially about meeting with the past to be in peace with the present. It is interesting how the main point of the movie is not getting stuck in one glorious moment, to move on in life, yet it seems like the whole setting of the movie has an obsessive relationship with the city of Paris. All the shots of Paris, especially the ones from the 1920's, appear with a sense of gold color to build the image of a romantic, sensual city where anything can happen. The film definitely tries to give out the image of a place to fall in love. A little bit into the movie, Inez decides to leave Gil and go partying with Paul and his wife. When they get inside the taxi, Inez is the one sitting in between the couple which gives the audience the impression of some kind of adultery about to happen in between Inez and Paul. We can classify our protagonist (Gil) as a pure romantic, even when his wife has clearly cheated on him, he does not want to admit it until someone else tells him. He lives in his own little world of beauty and romance where everything seems to be more appreciated the older it becomes. He soon realizes that something is missing in his life as a Hollywood screenwriter, and he is not satisfied with his job, in his attempt to pursue something to make him happy he decides to start writing a novel. He doesn't realize that his novel is nothing else but the reflection of his own life. He lives in a perpetual stage of nostalgia, wishing to live in ""the good old times"". The main reason for this to happen is because of his non-fulfilling life that he definitely needs a change, and he comes to that conclusion in Paris. There is a very well defined classification of people in this movie. We find the empirical, unromantic and materialistic side of the world. This group is represented by Inez, her family, and Paul. On the other side we find the intellectual, idealist and romantic type of people. This group is represented by Gil and all the artists. Also at the end of the movie we see those two worlds collide, presenting the beautiful young woman who seems to be the perfect fit for Gil. She is a dreamer, she likes ""Paris under the rain"" and she is from the same decade as Gil which shows that at the end, people can find happiness if they keep their eyes open. It is quite obvious that the director tried to make the two different kinds of people very weighty in the movie. Inez strongly represents the empirical part of the society while Gil represents the complete opposite. Both personalities are exaggerated to show the division of the world between believers and non believers of love. This particular young couple has an interesting reaction to Paris. It is known that Paris is the city of love, many couples escape to that romantic place to fix their problems. The surprising component of this movie is that Paris does nothing but tear apart their relationship. They come to realize that they are complete opposite and that their relationship has no future. The city of love, teaches Gil that his love is not meant to be. There are certainly many different characters in this film. Sometimes it can even be a little confusing to keep track of all the people and everything that goes on, but it also seems like every one of those characters, with their different personalities and their different views of the world, have something to provide to the movie. Although they contribute to the film some of the character's view points are irrelevant to the story. What Gil believes is love at the start of the movie, progressively changes. He realizes that everything he thought was love is wrong. In order to find true love he had to find himself, which he did every midnight in Paris.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Woody Allen's unique tapestry of historical and intellectual interactions with 20th century's greatest creators.,"The word clever comes to mind – a word my 1920's-born mother used. Clever defines Midnight in Paris, which is about a struggling millennial writer visiting Paris with his bride-to-be and her family, juxtaposed with artists and writers in Paris in the 1920's and earlier. Woody Allen's brilliantly creative mind illuminates this work-of- art.Gil (Owen Wilson) negotiates his desire to please his bride-to-be, Inez (Rachel McAdams), with his longing to stay in Paris and write a novel. Tensions rise between Gil and Inez as ghosts of the past visit Gil, on several occasions, when he sits on cement steps of a building never revealed to the audience. When the church bells chime at midnight, Gil is invited to hang-out with artists and writers of the past.For example, Gil hangs out in bars and goes to parties on different occasions with Hemingway and Fitzgerald – who are hilarious together. The writers are keenly interested in Gil and his writing, and some of them offer critiques to help him out. Owens' portrayal of Gil is authentic, as Gil gets excited with each visitor and has trouble believing the appearance of each one – like ""How long have you been dating Picasomy God, did I really just say that?"" But Gil gets into trouble when he starts ditching his bride-to-be to hang out on the steps for more visits.The fun includes: F. Scott Fitzgerald (Tom Hiddleston) and his wife Zelda (Allison Pill), Ernest Hemingway (Cory Stoll), Gertrude Stein (Kathy Bates), Pablo Picaso (Marcial De Fonzo Bo), Cole Porter (Yves Heck), Salvatore Dali (Adrien Brody), T. S. Eliot (David Lowe), Henri Matisse (Yves-Antoine Spoto), Toulouse-Lautrec (Vincent Menjou Cortes), Paul Gauguin (Olivier Rabourdin), and Edgar Degas (Francois Rostain). And there are others.The movie is inspiring, and gives us a glimpse into the real-life struggles of these earlier artists and writers. Sure, the dialogue is re-created and well researched. When you hear how Brody repeats Dali's name in the movie, see if you don't chuckle the way I did, or the way Stoll speaks like Hemingway. The movie is moderately paced and catchy, and a nice tribute to these greats of the past.The only part I didn't like was Gertrude Stein (Kathy Bates) referring to ""Hemingway"" when she spoke about him and with him. I would have liked her calling him Ernest. And the audience can disregard the handicap sidewalks and curbs in the Paris streets, which would not have been there in the 1920's.I give this movie a 9: 4 for Woody Allen's creative writing and brilliant directing, 3 for the acting, and 2 for shooting in Paris.I watched on Netflix.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Elegant but rather dull,"'Midnight in Paris' has a certain charm and elegance about it, no doubt thanks to the delightful Parisian setting and magical atmosphere, which the film captured perfectly. I enjoyed the film primarily because of this, but also because it is significantly lacking in other areas.I can't say I was particularly impressed with Owen Wilson, playing Hollywood writer Gil. He didn't do the character justice and it felt like he was completely out of his comfort zone. For a romcom, it lacked much comedy. Amusing is probably the most appropriate word, but even then the amusing moments are few and far between.The short running time does the film a favour, otherwise this would have been a drag. 'Midnight in Paris' is a elegant but rather dull film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Woody Allen on top form,"Woody Allen just gets better. He really seems to have come into his own as a director during his European odyssey. A year ago we were all thrilled by Vicky Christina Barcelona which also got Penelope Cruz a deserved Oscar nod. He is certainly a better director than he is an actor. As an actor he brings a little too much of his hyper self- examination which can become tedious.Midnight in Paris is sweet and lively. It is full of pretentious characters but is an unpretentious film. The message is simple and delivered with consistent light humour.   Owen Wilson fits in perfectly, just as he does in Wes Anderson material.  Marion Cotillard is suitably beautiful and enigmatic. The rich Americans are pitch-perfect characters. Particularly fun is the agonising cultured intellectual who you just want to throttle, particularly when opining on wine, Monet and Versailles. There is also a great little semi- cameo turn from Carla Bruni.Allen doesn't try to be clever about Paris. All the clichés are there - the sights, the cafés and the romance but the French characters are cast in a favourable light. You really get the sense that he likes the French, even if he doesn't quite understand them.The basic premise of Midnight in Paris will make some wince. The way the starlets of the 20s are forced into the narrative is not all that natural and perhaps contrived. But for me it works and it is a necessary part of the concept. It does rely on the viewer knowing these characters from the 20s and 'getting' the joke about who they are portrayed.I think Woody Allen is one of the great auteurs. He doesn't create grand masterpieces but he does have an absolutely unique and consistent voice. The world would be a poorer place without him. for me the only other directors who are so instantly recognisable for their style are Almodóvar, Bergman and Spike Lee. Thirty seconds into a blind viewing and you can name the director. Roll-on more of the ""Woody Allen does Europe"" era!",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

Allen revisits the past,"Owen Wilson incarnates the younger Woody Allen borderline neurotic protagonist and acts with the same intonations of earlier Allen when he was acting. It was so eerie that I kept confusing them or seeing some Allen in Wilson most of the film.The open sequence is a cinematographic homage to Paris that works and gets you right into it. The film is as much a tribute to the city and to all vibrant cities as his earlier Manhanthan was for New York.Then humour, situation and great dialogue and acting starts. The engaged couple interaction between each other and with other couples (friends and parents) is typical great Woody Allen writing. This film is quirky and becomes even quirkier with time, only to work as a whole in the end.Woody's imagination is rampant and his love for previous artist who overshadow the love his protagonist has for his fiancé or vice versa go sometimes into the realm of masturbatory fictional writing and fantasizing, but shine through with the themes, including love, art and the concept of time and of a golden area.My favourite scene which I never tire of seeing is Adrian Brody being brilliant as the genius and eccentric Salvador Dali. He has this satirical version of Dali to perfection (with the quintessential help of Allen as the writer/director) and I could only have asked to see more of him than the brief scene in which he appears and appeal.Rachel McAdams, Kathy Bates and especially Marion Coillard also shine as actresses.Thanks again Woody!A moody and worthwhile revelation and mockery.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

"A likable, if snobbish, romantic comedy from Mr Allen","When Gil Pender (Owen Wilson) takes a stroll in Paris after midnight strange things happen and these strange things help him to revamp his life. It is another romance typical of Mr Allen which could have been a whole lot better had we not been treated to such a predictable array of opinion as to what Paris must have been like many years ago.As it is, and at face value, the story is helped by an almost good outing by Mr Wilson because whilst never convincing it seemed fitting that such a foppish twenty first century misfit should be so greeted by such predictable characters from earlier times. However it all seems a very complex way of getting to the point of what romance definitely isn't through seeing Mr Allen's idea of what it is. However with such an array of talent making up the support what is there not to like about the portrayal of such an average script? I have given it six because, as a romantic comedy, it has some sharp dialogue at times, but it is very uneven and this brings you down to earth with a bang much too frequently for it to be described as a good film.

See It for the Moveable Feast -- Ignore the Allenisms!,"Ever wondered what it might have been like to live in 1920s Paris and party with Hemingway, the Fitzgeralds, Gertrude Stein and all the other superstar bohemians who were there? Owen Wilson plays a 21st century screenwriter who visits Paris with his bride-to-be and is magically transported back to this fabled era -- but only between midnight and dawn. The results are hilarious,the portraits of the artists as young men and women are both wonderfully satiric and accurate. Owen Wilson is great interacting with these characters; I loved his slack-jawed disbelief and excitement. Lots of magical, beautiful romantic shots of Paris make this movie even more of a joy.Unfortunately, many other elements of this movie are a drag. Allen always gets the best actors, but here gives many of them nothing to work with. Wilson's fiancée and her parents are unfunny caricatures of materialistic, philistine Americans. Whenever Wilson is with them, he becomes an annoying California blonde version of whiny Woody. Another really familiar Allen target -- the pretentious pseudo-intellectual -- is portrayed by the usually wonderful Michael Sheen and the results are equally flat. Allen's been egging eggheads since the 1970s; it was really funny the first 20 times or so, but not anymore.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

Travelling on streets is good but travelling in time is marvelous.,"Travelling on streets is good but travelling in time is marvelous.I have heard of time travel in the film Shining but saw it happen one time after another in this film. Aptly titled, this film is about the mysterious life in Paris that revels in nostalgia. It still has the fragrance of those great artists that adored this great city from a Picasso to Hemingway to so many.Now there is our protagonist Gil Pender who loves the 1920's and very fluidly travels to 1920 and makes connections with the artists. Actually, there is not much of a story, but everything pops up in between, there is an artistis desire, there is infidelity there is an envy about another man and there is love for multiple woman. But all of that said, it's a journey of an artist.Oh, did I mention that this is a Woody Allen film, yes it is and its very Allenish. Now there can't be a movie without Allen so our hero Gil Pender (Owen Wilson) is the Allen of the film who is very subconsciously driven and speaks out long sentences that make little meaning to others (but I could make out what he meant). He dreams, and when he realizes he seems so very lost, he does not know what to do and again gets lost. He just knows, he wants to stay in Paris. His every move evokes love for the great city.The art direction if anything is superficial and I envy every bit of it coz the Hollywood for every story have superb technicians and the way they use technology is simply superb. The cinematography is simple for few scenes like a chat between the characters and terrific when it has to bring Paris alive. Yes, certainly Paris is a character of the movie and right in the first few frames I realized this and in fact those first shots were the best of the movie in terms of showing Paris. Did I tell there is infidelity as common theme as in an Allen movie.All through, I can see Allen and his hope for bringing out yet another film that says Art for Art's sake and he succeeds yet again and he cannot fail coz there is a protagonist so strong in him that we can vie for and woo for. We surely want him to simply follow his dreams.It's a charming and an enchanting film nevertheless but it's not a story that we shall for long remember I believe. It did not engage me much in terms of screenplay or characterization to say so except for the enticement caused by the camera.Hail Allen, I give it 3/5. A good one to go for sure.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Absolute treat,"I just LOVE this movie. It is funny, relax, sweet, full of good music, art history references and good actors, it's goofy and it doesn't push the idea of time travelling too hard. This movie is about finding inspiration and beauty. Time travel -theme just goes with it, it doesn't need much explanation to work. It is like a poem.

Good but Not Great,"I just watched this movie and was a little disappointed only because I'd heard such great things about it. I guess a lot of people love it and think it's really ingenious. It is not.I found nothing particularly new or overly intriguing here. Don't get me wrong, it is not a bad film at all. It is fun and entertaining and pretty different from most of what you see these days, but it's not really groundbreaking at all.I put off watching it all this time because I find Owen Wilson to be kind of annoying. I'm sure he's a nice guy, but I just don't like to watch him act. I don't know what it is exactly, maybe his voice. But he gave a pretty decent performance here, possibly even his best.Overall, this movie is above average but it still did not live up to the hype.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
A love letter to cinema,"Midnight in Paris is certainly one of the better Woody Allen films of the past 2 decades.He does not act in this one, but Owen Wilson steps in, in what is probably his finest role to date. The same nasal sound , but without the self-pity.A real improvement over the mediocre actor Allen.This is not a very subtle movie, adding stereotypes to hammering home a certain message. The stereotypes are there, but it is no nuisance, since so well timed. The message itself is quite clear after two-thirds into the movie. Hammering it home does not annoy either, so perfectly acted and timed.A couple of the historic personalities almost steal the show from the leads, with Corey Stoll on top.Midnight in Paris is a loveletter to cinema, completely balanced in terms of acting,script and cinematography. A film that invites you to view it each year. The type of movie that makes you wonder how Gil's Paris years would have come about.It is not a classic materpiece, just the sort of film that is just about right, radiating a warm glow. No car chases,nudity,profanity or action scenes. Just a fine script, flawless images and decent acting.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
mixed feelings but mainly irritation!,"I've never been a fan of Woody and this is not going to make me one.One of the problems, I think, is that all the characters are cardboard. Owen Wilson plays Woody and shows such great Romantic Enthusiasm that it wore me down after a while! (At least he didn't try to obviously imitate Woody's mannerisms as Kenneth Branagh did in ""Celebrity""!) Rachel McAdams plays his ""Crass Fiancée"" and Michael Sheen plays ""The Pedant"".Yes, we know Woody loves Paris but this too becomes oppressive in my opinion while becoming a near commercial for the city. And Woody has done the fantasy or time-travel shtick more than once before, most obviously in Zelig, Sleeper, and Purple Rose but these have all been done better by others.And finally, all the celebrities Owen meets are pretty much top of the pops: Cole, Ernest, Gertrude, Alice, Pablo, Luis, Salvador, Scott and Zelda, Man Ray, Josephine, T.S., Toulouse-Lautrec, Gaughuin, Matisse, Degas: they are all here!In short, a very superficial and obvious, if somewhat entertaining, film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Great story trumps odd casting and portrayals,"Free lance writer Wilson travels with fiancee McAdams to Paris while struggling with his latest masterpiece. While there he magically travels back in time and mixes with the expatriates and others of 1920's Paris. I loved the story and the characters involved (I watched the whole thing without even knowing Woody wrote and directed it!). Marion Cotillard steals the show as the enchanting muse of Picasso and others, and Rachel McAdams is good and attractive in the thankless role of the rich ditzy fiancee. Owens does well in portraying the enthusiasm with which his character finds the 20's personalities, but he seems more like a college sophomore than a struggling adult author. Someone with a little more sophisticated aura, like a Tom Everett Scott, might have fit the role better. I thought the portrayals of Stein and Hemingway shallow and uninteresting, in contrast to Cotillard's work, but some of the other parts like Brody as Dali were effective. It's all good fun with some unusual twists and turns that may surprise you. Recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
"strange and surreal, typical Woody Allen, yet not in NYC","This film is a love letter to Paris, a picture postcard of the city at it's most beautiful, even in the rain. Owen as hapless Gil Prender is the artistically minded writer who dreams of Paris in the 1920s and through a medium that isn't mentioned or explained, ends up there - in the 1920s and meets many of his heroes, and falls out of love with his fiancé along the way.At first intriguing and exciting, the film becomes a little lack-lustre as the characters from Gil's own belle epoque come thick and fast on the screen; Hemmingway, TS Elliot and F Scott Fitzgerald to name a few, and so it becomes a little silly. It's a philosophical (typical of Allen) existential piece with thought provoking monologues on man's inability to see the perfection of where he is now rather than hankering for a time long past and much is made of lights at night in the rain, and art and the artist's search for perfection and beautiful women. Quelle surprise! Owen was perfectly cast; hapless, romantic, a little of the underdog but still attractive and witty and with plenty to offer, although his current fiancé doesn't seem to see that. From the start they don't seem suited and his Inez played by Rachel McAddam, is instantly unlikeable. Comedic only in a dry Woody Allen-esque observational way, there are few laugh out loud moments but the film is humorous, uplifting and ultimately pleasing whereas the first two thirds you are stumped how it is going to pan out. Time travel aspects aside, there is much to enjoy, and whilst I enjoyed the time travel bit, it would have helped if there was some sort of explanation but Owen's disbelief, to incredulity to joy were good enough, and really well depicted.A strange ensemble cast of many familiar faces, and a very well directed and realised story. The dialogue was a little bit staccato in places but overall I enjoyed this film a lot and felt ""good"" after it. A sort of loss of romance romantic film... if you can imagine such a thing. Would watch again.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Disappointed,"Before sharing my reservations, let me note:1) Others in the theatre seemed to be enjoying this movie before I walked out 2) I've enjoyed some of Woody Allen's recent movies (Vicki Christina Barcelona, Whatever Works), so I think I had pretty fair expectations.I was looking forward to this movie based on all the reviews I read. One of them noted that Owen Wilson was a surprisingly excellent choice as the Woody Allen ""character""/mouthpiece.After the seductive opening of scenes of Paris (think of the valentine to NYC at the beginning of Manhattan), I found it incredibly jarring to hear what were basically the words and thoughts of a New York Jewish intellectual coming out of a lanky Texan (a problem which was not the case with Larry David in the same role in ""Whatever Works"").I tried to work with it when I ran into my second big problem with the movie - the fiancé. As written, the character is cartoonishly unappealing - I found it impossible to buy that these two people had gone on a second date, never mind gotten engaged. The problem really seemed to be with the writing - not with Rachel McAdams portrayal.When I walked out at the 30 minute mark, the fantasy aspects of the story had kicked in and I should note that most of the new characters seemed very well cast and acted. But the acceptance of fantasy requires the suspension of disbelief and the movie had squandered plausability for me at that point on these first two problems, I couldn't stick around for the ride.YMMV, and maybe if I had stuck it out it would have worked its magic on me. But since my assessment of Owen Wilson flies in the face of reviews I've read (and a few comments I've read here), I just wanted to voice a contrarian view to be considered by those thinking of checking this movie out.",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Delightful - one to watch again!,"Woody Allen is getting better and better. This is one of his best preferred it to Vicky Christina and some of the London based ones. All the historic encounters are so fascintaing it needs to be seen twice to appreciate all the detail. Makes you want to know more details about the different people he meets. It's one of those movies you wish could go on longer. Owen is typical Owen I think the role was made for his laid back charm. Rachel is pretty and hilarious. Such a versatile actress. The cameo actors are interesting to watch from Brody to a slightly inexpressive Bruni. It's not just about cultural differences, it's about the magical past of the city.

Plastic Movie - plastic people,"It took me several attempts to make it through this movie and I only finished it out of curiosity how Woody Allen would find a plausible ending to this ridiculous story.Ridiculous not because of the concept - but because of the way it was implemented. Had there not been quite so many famous people from the twenties trotted out for our perusal, an interesting idea could have been turned into an enchanting movie.Plastic prototypes almost shoved down our throats, all behaving exactly how someone like Woody Allen would have us believe they would. Notably awful was Corey Stoll as Hemingway, who delivered his lines as if he was reading them off a teleprompter.In order to enjoy a story such as this it is imperative to suspend disbelief and immerse oneself in the events as they unfold. Never for one moment did I come anywhere close to this in spite of the enchanting views of Paris and the music, which is probably the best thing in the film.In the past Allen gave us some wonderful trips back into the past, moments of unforgettable fantasy and characters who (although rather over-the-top) were engaging and believable.Midnight in Paris falls down on almost all of these factors and I am sure that if it had been made by anyone other than Woody Allen, it would have been a total flop.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

Lovely,"Highlights:Gorgeous shot of Paris, making the film practically a love letter to the city.Whimsical story-telling of magically going back to the Années folles (and La Belle Époque).The central message, that we're a little silly to look back on earlier eras as more preferable, that the present is ""a little unsatisfying because life is a little unsatisfying"" ... and also, how history repeats itself in this regard, with each age looking back at the past. It's ironic that it's the annoying pedantic guy (Michael Sheens) who points out the fallacy of ""golden-age thinking"" first.All of the cultural references and characterization of artists, authors, filmmakers etc., which tickled me. Kathy Bates as Gertrude Stein stands out.Beautiful soundtrack.Sweet ending. Léa Seydoux is lovely.This line: ""By the way, it's fine for your father and I to disagree. That's what a democracy is. Your father defends the right-wing of the Republican Party, and I happen to think you've almost got to be, like, a demented lunatic ... But it doesn't mean we don't respect each other's views, am I right?"" ... which so perfectly skewers both the far right and polarization in politics.Lowlights:Some of the characters, like the fiancé (Rachel McAdams) and Ernest Hemingway (Tom Hiddleston), are rather extreme.Many shots in Paris seemed cast in a warmer than normal color tint, making them look unnatural.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Allen fans will eat it up.,"'MIDNIGHT IN Paris': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Woody Allen's most critically acclaimed film in 6 years and his most financially successful movie ever (before adjusting for inflation). It's received 4 Academy Award nominations including 'Best Picture', 'Best Director', 'Best Original Screenplay' and 'Art Direction' but will be lucky to win one (most likely screenplay). The film is a fantasy comedy and for those who really like Allen it's sure to please, others could be lucky to find a little enjoyment.The film reunites Owen Wilson and Rachel McAdams for the first time since 2005's 'WEDDING CRASHERS'. They play a couple (Gil and Inez) who are vacationing with Inez's rich parents (Kurt Fuller and Mimi Kennedy) on their business trip in Paris. Gil is a popular screenwriter who's attempting to write his first novel but is suffering some severe writer's block. Gil has always been in love with Paris, especially it of yesteryear (specifically the 1920's), so he's hoping to find some much needed inspiration there. Inez thanks he's a dreamer and should go back to writing screenplays. One night while traveling the streets of Paris alone he finds something magical and possibly the inspiration he was looking for.I've never been a big Woody Allen fan so I don't usually seek his films out. I watched this film because of it's financial and critical success and found it slightly better than Allen's other work but still nothing too special. It is funny and witty in places, Wilson is great in the lead and he and the film are charming (in places) but for me that's about all the film had to offer.

Nostalgia ain't what it used to be,"This is an amusing tale about a time traveller in 1920s Paris, wrapped up in an irritating framing device about a group of obnoxious modern-day Americans staying in the city. Allen is fond of magical plots and, as in The Purple Rose of Cairo, his most successful venture in this genre, he does not waste time on explaining how the magic works. His protagonist, Gil, just has to sit on some steps in Monmartre when the clock strikes midnight and he is transported back to his golden age. The audience has an amusing time recognising the famous denizens of 1920s Monmartre before they identify themselves and there are a few good jokes. The one I liked best is Gil suggesting the plot of The Exterminating Angel to a bemused Louis Bunuel. Interestingly, Allen also referenced the Bunuel film in The Purple Rose of Cairo where the on-screen characters sit around in evening dress, unable to leave. The stand-out cameos in this section of the film are Adrian Brody as a rhinoceros-obsessed Salvador Dalí and Kathy Bates as an unfeasibly accommodating Gertrude Stein. But I did miss Henry Miller and Anaïs Nin.In the framing device Gil is staying in Paris with his airhead fiancée, her Tea Party Republican parents and two pretentious friends. This part of the film could usefully have been left on the cutting-room floor. Even more irritating is that it is shot in the style of a travelogue, rather like Vicky Cristina Barcelona. We see interminable shots of Parisian tourist attractions accompanied by mind-numbing, imitation Django Reinhardt music. I have to declare an interest here: I used to work in Paris and I am immune to its so-called charms. One of the characters says: ""That Paris exists and anyone could choose to live anywhere else in the world will always be a mystery to me"". One of the most irritating things that I found about Paris was that most of my Parisian colleagues would have agreed with that sentiment.It is amazing how even the most brilliant actors, when playing the lead in Allen's films, adopt his mannerisms, vocal tics and persona. Owen Wood is Gil and is by no means a brilliant actor but he produces the most accurate imitation of Woody Allen that I have yet seen on the screen. And I don't mean that in a nice way. Marion Cotillard is Adriana, his love interest from the 1920s. Her Golden Age is the Belle Epoque but when they go back there and meet Toulouse-Lautrec, Gauguin and Degas they are told that, no, the Golden Age is the Renaissance. Allen is making a small, but valid point here: that everyone hankers after an earlier period when everything was wonderful but, for the vast majority of people, now is the best of possible times. Eventually Gil comes to accept this, not least because he cannot envisage a world without painkillers and antibiotics. I tend to agree: in the 1920's I would not have been able to beam down this film from a satellite and watch it in the comfort of my own home.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
"Please retire, Woody","Woody's personality, and his films, have a powerful ability to irritate. This one, although casting as bland a set of actors as one can assemble, strikes out into territory where Allen simply hasn't a clue, leading to yet another example of Allen's misguided belief that one can ""figure out"" love. Allen's view of love is so ridiculously inane that it can only lead to what we have here - an inanely stupid romantic comedy. The jokes are second grade material, as usual, and the supposedly non-comedic part is just plain gooey trash, which tries unsuccessfully to avoid the goo by promoting his brainless ""lesson"" about life. Allen doesn't live life - he spends all his time trying to understand what it is. Ditto for love. So far, few have ever been so unsuccessful at doing so. I expect another dozen films from this serial filmmaker before he finally either goes totally senile, or passes away. Either would be welcomed news for theatergoers.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

The film's heart and soul lies in the past,"After having camera-masturbated his way through a romanticised Barcelona and all the beautiful actresses he could lure out there in Vicky Cristina Barcelona (and then making a couple of other films in the meantime), Woody Allen turns his focus to another European city which Americans hold in high esteem: Paris. Here we meet a vacationing semi-dysfunctional young couple named Gil and Inez who on the surface share an interest in art, writing and culture, but who most evidently are not on the same wavelength. The superficial Inez (Rachel McAdams) starts attending an endless array of clubs, museums and galleries with her friends Paul and Carol, while the neurotic, talkative Gil (played by Owen Wilson acting as Allen's hand puppet) begins to wander the streets of Paris, with a nostalgia for the history of the city. Then one midnight, he is picked up by a vintage car which effectively transfers him back to the 1920s, a time when artists such as F. Scott Fitzgerald, Cole Porter and Ernest Hemingway frequented the bars and streets of Paris.Like all of Woody Allen's films, Midnight in Paris is lightweight and quirky - and populated with some recurring characters whom some may still find funny and fascinating, but whom others may have wearied of by now. Still, and in stark contrast to Vicky Cristina Barcelona, Allen this time has both a good idea and something to say again; that is, something besides his ordinary comments about art, high-culture and love. And when he does, Allen still has the skill both as a director and as a writer to attract interest and make poignant observations. The main such in this film concerns nostalgia and romanticising; the counter-productiveness of it, but all the same our inclination for it.Allen's best achievement with Midnight in Paris is how vividly and vibrantly he recreates a period of time and a set of cultural celebrities from this period who obviously has meant a lot to the filmmaker. The performers in these roles, including a dashing Corey Stoll as Hemingway, a vigorous Kathy Bates as Gertrude Stein, and a hilarious Adrien Brody as Salvador Dalí, obviously had much fun acting out these personalities, and although Allen's intellectual message is that we should free ourselves from backward thinking and make the most out of the present, the film's heart and soul lies in the past, as Allen's rendition of present-day people and art is as uninspired as Gil's relationship with Inez. But who can really blame him? Woody just turned 75, and he's entitled to reminisce about a fine career and a life well lived - whether that be his or Hemingway's.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

Great fun from Woody Allen.,"Here is a wonderful guilty pleasure for you: Woody Allen's latest love letter to a beloved city. This time, it isn't Manhattan, but Paris, and although this isn't anywhere near the calibre of his earlier films (it is generally agreed that Allen is a director way past his heyday), it is still a lovely, warm, harmless piece of filmmaking.For all the ways that we can find to shout Woody Allen down, one think he absolutely excels at (now as ever) is filming a city. Paris has never looked more gorgeous – to look at some of the shots that open the film is to swoon headlong, cementing the French capital in our minds as the city of love.Owen Wilson's character, Gil, is a writer who, like many literary types before him, as fallen head over heels for the city. He is a hopeless romantic, and instantly adorable. He wants to take midnight strolls and walk in the rain – fascinated by the literary allure of Paris and the 1920s in particular. Unfortunately, his fiancée – Rachel McAdams – is slightly less impressed, and perfectly vexed when he starts to suggest moving there. Her parents – snotty, uptight individuals – hate his guts. Cue some mildly funny dinner exchanges.Three things make this film special and memorable. One is the fantasy element – I won't divulge too much, but suffice it to say that some degree of cultural knowledge will help immensely. Being a bookworm and a film buff, I loved Allen's exploration of the literary figureheads of yesteryear. Discussions that Gil has with a man called Dali and a man called Bunuel (get the hint?) are incredibly amusing, as is a short, witty scene involving a private detective and the Palace of Versailles. The second is the stellar cast – showcasing British talent (Michael Sheen crops up as a pedantic wannabe scholar, friend of Gil's fiancée), American stars (Kathy Bates and Adrien Brody in cameos both make an impression) and the ever brilliant Marion Cotillard, Allen has created an immensely watchable ensemble piece.The third, as previously hinted at, is the cinematography: 'Midnight In Paris' is simply gorgeous to look at, particularly as we are shown Paris in three different time periods. The film oozes style and opulence, and works well as a laid back fantasy rom-com. You have to hand it to Allen – he still has imagination.This isn't a masterpiece. Some will inevitably find it mediocre, or even boring. I have to say that it is utterly predictable and saccharine sweet; however, it never strays into the realm of the melodramatic, and Allen's imaginative style is utterly captivating and somewhat endearing in its innocent reverence for his beloved city. For everything else we can say about it, 'Midnight In Paris' is a charming, light, frothy piece of entertainment. Of course, it's absolute nonsense – but that's not always such a bad thing!",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Woody's wet dream serves no function to anyone else,"This movie feels like Woody Allen made it just to act out his fantasy of meeting all the great artists from 1920s Paris.

The artists represented are caricature cameos with no depth or reason for being in the film, other than to have Gil (Wilson) gush over them. In fact, most of the characters have no real reason for being in the film; Inez's family seems to be there only to enforce the impression that they're all snobby and too different from Gil; I especially dislike how they made Inez (McAdams) into an unlikeable shrew just so the audience would be ok with Gil wanting to leave and/or cheat on her. If she's really that bad, why were they together in the first place? Overall, not a worthwhile film.",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

A fine bit of magic from Mr.Allen,"I had my own Woody Allen 'moment' when going to see this movie early in the afternoon. I arrived 30 seconds late – I always try to avoid the ads – and in the darkness mistook an elderly gentleman's groin for the arm of my seat – twice! He did'nt complain the first time so I assumed I must be in the right place. I groped my way to the seat in front of him whispering apologies along the way and sat while the cinematic sun rose. I left delighted at having seen - at long last – a marvellous new film from Mr.Allen, delighted also at not having been jumped or beaten up.I think it would be pedantic to fault historical inaccuracies regarding the authors or painters encountered by Owen Wilson's character, begrudging to deny the pleasure of the turns given by Cotillard, Brody, and others, and simply mean to ignore the love and intelligence involved in the making of this film – that magic we recognise from Annie Hall, through The Purple Rose of Cairo, to Deconstucting Harry. Because this film, after all the dross since those great Allen films that we admire (I assume) , has that quality that would (as somebody said) 'send you'.... And that's all this film tries to be about, sending, or 'transporting' you – us. It's marvellous.I'll probably go and see it again, though I'll arrive a little earlier next time!",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
OK but could have been so much better,"Like the man at the movie's core, I was hoping to be transported to a different time and place while watching Woody Allen's universally acclaimed ""Midnight in Paris."" What I got instead was a sporadically charming but surprisingly earthbound little fantasy that had me pining away over lost opportunities with the Lost Generation.The conceit - not terribly original in and of itself but filled with promise and possibilities - involves an American writer visiting modern-day Paris who is whisked away every midnight to the 1920s where he hobnobs with many of the great writers, artists and thinkers of the time: F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, Cole Porter, Ernest Hemingway, Josephine Baker, Alice B. Toklas, Gertrude Stein, Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dali, Luis Bunuel, and others.So far, so good. Gil Pender (Owen Wilson) is portrayed as a hopeless romantic who, as we are too often wont to do, believes that life was better in a time before he was born - an idealized era where life was richer, simpler and somehow more satisfying than it is today. For Gil, that ideal period is the Paris of the 1920s, which he envisions as a scene of endless literary and intellectual discussions amongst a rarified elite. He's engaged to Inez (Rachel McAdams), a much more prosaic 21st Century woman, whose father (Kurt Fuller) is a right-wing tea-party type and whose mother (Mimi Kennedy) looks with disdain on her daughter's life choices, including the man she's picked to marry. No wonder Gil rushes back every night to that space/time continuum portal that allows him to be with the people he really likes and who seem to like and understand him.The main problem for me with ""Midnight in Paris"" is that it is unable to bring its roster of extraordinary historical figures to life. In fact, they emerge basically as some of the blandest people you are ever likely to meet, this century or last. They wouldn't even make a good cocktail party crowd. Not one of them says anything insightful or witty that would in any way indicate that they are world-famous artists and creators of lasting works. And without that dimension, Gil's trips to the past have all the excitement and authenticity of a dress-up ball that never ends.The scenes set in the present are scarcely any better. Inez' family and their pompous, know-it-all friend, played by Michael Sheen, are just the Ugly American writ large, and the humor is surprisingly toothless and lacking for a Woody Allen movie. Wilson, who has been effective in other roles, here feels too much like a stand-in for a younger version of Allen himself to make much of an impression of his own.So what of the glorious views of Paris that one would expect from such a film? Surely, those are worth the price of admission. Actually, not really, for the cinematographer, Darius Khonji, has, for some inexplicable reason, seen fit to cast the city in a strangely sickly yellowish glow that robs the place of much of its natural beauty and luster.So what is good about the film? Well, there are some genuinely tender moments between Gil and Adriana, the on-again/off-again mistress of Pablo Picasso, who suffers from Gil's idealization of the past, only to her, that rosier past lies in the era known as La Belle Epoque. And there's a very funny in-movie scene in which Gil gives a bemused and befuddled Luis Bunuel the idea for what the surrealist will later turn into ""The Exterminating Angel."" The movie also does a nice job fleshing out its theme - of the illusion of a Golden Age vs. the reality of a present day - in the final reel.More virtues like these and ""Midnight in Paris"" might have been the truly transporting charmer it was meant to be.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
"Let's Do It, Let's Fall in Love with The Present","''Midnight in Paris'' is magical realism at its finest. It simply bewitches me. The portrait of 20's Paris and the nostalgic mood Woody Allen created here makes me feel a certain kind of dreamlike happiness, as if I were dreaming or someone cast a spell over me. But my favorite fact is that the movie somehow manages to catch me in a thin, utopian thread of the past and in the end, when it finally lets me go, the thread is still there, pure as it was... only now there is a new, colorful one which pops up in the present. It's a change of perspective, not facts.I also had a really good laugh here. It's funny in a clever way. I wish I knew more about some of the intellectual world of the 20's but it's really not a disadvantage to taking delight in the beauty of the story and the ingenuity surrounding it. I also like movies who (subtly) mock themselves, like when the mother-character says something about a movie she has recently seen: ''I know it was moronic and infantile and utterly lacking in any wit or believability but John and I laughed in spite of that''. This quote perfectly describes the movie seen from a logical standpoint. Nevertheless, I personally prefer to guide myself based on a quote from a Streetcar Named Desire: ''I don't want realism. I want magic!'' .A 9,70 out of 10 from me.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Sidney Bechet: Si tu vois ma mère,"Midnight in Paris is yet another classic film by Woody Allen. It is a romantic comedy about a couple (Owen Wilson as Gil, and Rachel McAdams as Inez) who go for a family vacation in Paris, and the twist and turns of Gil's subconscious in a fantasy world filled with all his muse as a writer. The screenplay of this movie is top-notch. It was not surprising this film won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.
The screenplay solidifies the writing prowess of Woody.
Owen Wilson was perfect for the role with all his poetic ""bubbling"", and there was such great chemistry between him and Rachel McAdams. The ensemble cast was marvelous, and immensely contributed to the beauty of this film. The score and soundtrack captured the mood and scenes perfectly, producing a positive synergistic effect.
I think this film serves as a tribute to veteran writers like; Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Gertrude Stein etc.

"Enjoyed it, in spite of Woody Allen","I am NOT a Woody Allen fan. I don't like his direction, writing, or acting. But I did enjoy Midnight in Paris.I suppose the main reason I liked Midnight in Pairs is because I lived and worked in Paris from 1978 until 1981. Just seeing all of the views of the city nearly brought me to tears. There is no city in the world like Paris. It is unique in it's beauty, culture, shops, museums, and people.I watched the movie, even after I saw that Woody Allen was involved, just because of the Paris component. But I also found the story interesting, characters interesting, and casting on target.When the movie started I was surprised and disappointed in the choice of how the movie was shot in terms of the color reproduction. It was flat and dull. That made it a little difficult to watch. But I got lost in the characters and story which held together well through to the end.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Very cute whimsical love story in Paris!,"One of Woody Allen's best. This film is a love story to Paris and to the Artistic community who found themselves ensconced there in the 1920's.The story concept, about a writer being transported to the 1920's where his idols are currently enjoying nights on the town...when the clock strikes midnight, does feel a little like Cinderella in reverse, but it is very well executed!The music, the cinematography, everything is designed to show Paris at its very best! It is a very cute feel good romcom, and whilst delivering the comedy with his trademark whimsical style, he still manages to deliver the salient point of the movie.

An Awful Stuck In The Head Movie,"11 March 2012. I found Midnight in Paris unbelievable, unappealing, and unapproachable. Woody Allen's imprint is all over this movie, but his fantasy theme failed to carry over onto the movie screen. The dialogue and scenes were dissociated from any emotional connection and became more of visual and auditory reading of Woody Allen's own mental musings. He failed to capture the intense flavor and rhythm of Paris, insisting on his scripted words. He had Gil (performed by Owen Wilson) becoming a one-dimensional, monotone character who remains in an oblivious state throughout the movie. Add to Gil's unappealing character, an even more obnoxious fiancé who can't even be made to appear sexually seductive even needed. How can these two characters be together in the first place? This relationship is a mere a plot device, adding to the absurdity of the movie. Later Gil meets Adrianna played by Marion Cotillard's (the most important relationship) whose wonderful and delightful character watches helplessly with fewer script lines as Owen Wilson's character remains blank to the different surroundings that he takes in so nonchalantly at odds with the circumstances. If only Wooden Allen had made Marion Cotillard the primary character, then perhaps her performance or character itself might have been able to carry the movie sufficiently to make it bearable to watch. As it is, Gil unintentionally becomes a parody of the comedic Jerry Lewis or Don Knott's idiot character appearing as witless lout who cannot possibly be this amazing, creative writer.By a small stretch of the imagination, it seems like the characters in Midnight in Paris are, at times, just following Woody Allen's direction in a stylistic, deliberate way that don't reflect any authentic performance, many appearing as robotic on the screen. If only Gil had been inebriated or Woody Allen had incorporated Rod Serling's The Twilight Zone (1959-1964, television series), the movie might have been more approachable as a fantasy. The needed suspension of belief required in a fantasy is made even more difficult with Kathy Bate's character being like Kathy Bates. Even in her beginning scene seems as if she was reading her lines off a cue card or teleprompter. Midnight in Paris is scattered throughout with dialogue with so much lofty intellectual mumbo-jumbo as if being spoken from a script - or lifted from the old live radio theater which doesn't really transfer well onto film. There are the sudden shifts from modern-day Paris to the past and back against without any of mysterious, mesmerizing blending of eeriness. Over a quarter century earlier, director Fred Haines successfully created a more haunting, subtle, mystically surrealistic movie adaptation of Herman Hesse's Steppenwolf (1974).Woody Allen introduces extras like the zombie walking man pushing a hand-cart that only heightens the wooden feeling of and detachment of the movie. There's an irrelevant dog extra scene, an unnecessary stealing from the wife's jewelry case scene. There's the inclusion of the underdeveloped private investigator scenes that only serve Woody Allen's need to arrive at a more surprisingly common place American ending. Such devices are more the stuff of Peter Seller's slapstick comedy The Pink Panther (1963) instead of Woody Allen's more sophisticated romantic comedy New York-style. He then misses such opportunities of tapping into the magical appearance of a horse carriage. When it only takes an extra with brief scenes as a shop girl to carry the aliveness of the entire scene, her brief realness and easy flowing portrayal only serves to emphasize how lost and empty most of the main characters have become, especially Gil. Woody Allen's script only offers tantalizing glimpses of a multitude of famous people from the past, but they only seem to be inserted as cute cameos. The whole movie ends up to be drops of tid-bit fragments - of what psychologists would define as ""loosening of associations"" often associated with manic patients (Trzepacz and Baker, 1993). In a way, this movie is reminiscent of the award winning California Suite (1978) written by Neil Simon that didn't connect well with the audience or of the adapted screenplay movies Noises Off (1992) or Chorus Line (1985) neither of which transferred well to the movie screen.In some ways, Woody Allen's script is stuck in the past that is both predictable and not as spontaneously charming as it should be. Woody Allen continues passing up opportunity after opportunity to create a more gripping, raw, and compelling relational, morally intriguing movie. Instead he offers up only an odd and confusing choice between Gil's fiancé and Andrianna where there is really no suspense nor build up. Much more compelling and engaging movies are the more thought provoking Anthony Hopkins' Slipstream (2007), the more daring stark play-as-a-movie Dogville (2004), or more recent complex sci fi action romance Inception (2010). A better time travel movie that retains its charm is Kate & Leopold (2001) or the less well known Time After Time (1979) or The Lake House (2006) each of these movies having more appeal possessing captivating adventure and energy. Midnight in Paris instead is distance, jumping through haphazard scenes, underdeveloped plots, and character much like an unfinished jig saw puzzle that still leaves hundreds of individual or grouped pieces scattered about making the movie a disaster. Instead I would check out Time Bandits (1981), Pleasantville (1998), The Time Traveler's Wife (2009), Somewhere in Time (1980), Back to the Future (1985) or Peggy Sue Got Married (1986). Even the animated Caroline (2009) or Spirited Away (2001) offers similar but more involved, enchanting fantasies or a movie with the same foreign flavor and love essence, A Man and A Woman (1966) quietly dazzles and enriches with an intimately involving relationship.",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

"Charming, beautiful and really very funny","I knew nothing of this movie as I brought up the stream from Amazon IV this afternoon. But I love Paris. And I was bored. I didn't bother with any reviews, I just went for it..I actually groaned as the opening credits cited ""Written and Directed by Woody Allen"". I'm just not a fan of his work, being as I am a stage actor who's used to tight dialogue with no sign of improv. I'm also not big on Owen Wilson, who to me is a rather whiny, limp wristed actor. Perhaps that's why Allen chose him for the film.But Wilson actually does a very good job as the insecure writer, Gil, with lost puppy eyes who's run roughshod by his fiancée (Rachel McAdams) and her wealthy overbearing parents. In fact the cast is superbly chosen, from Michael Sheen's smarmy, pedantic, arrogant professor through to Adrien Brody's marvellously weird, rhino-obsessed Dali.And then there's Marion Cotillard, with whom I fell in love in A Good Year, and who never fails to bring a scene to life with her sultry smile, fabulous accent, and flawless delivery.It's a slow-starting film, with not a lot of substance until Gil drops back in time to the 1920's and starts bumping into his heroes. Then the wit and the charm come rolling forward, buoyed by some stunning sets and equally stunning costumery.If you like your art and lit, you'll love this.

Take you to paris,"Midnight in Paris talks about Gil Pender (Owen Wilson); a screenwriter and aspiring novelist. Vacationing in Paris with his fiancee (Rachel McAdams), he goes touring through the city alone. On one such late-night excursion, Gil encounters a group of strange -- yet familiar -- revelers, who sweep him along, apparently back in time, for a night with some of the Jazz Age's icons of art and literature. The more time Gil spends with these cultural heroes of the past, the more dissatisfied he becomes with the present.The visuals are amazing and the music works so good with the theme and cinematography of this movie.I really liked the idea of the movie and all the characters that we feel like we have known for a really long time (whether they're likeable or not) The film is pretty funny especially Owen Wilson, who does a great job portraying a great guy who doesn't seem to fit into his own ""great"" life, alongside the little cameos that were all perfect for the movie. Owen, additionally, has great chemistry with his co-star, Rachel McAdams who, in her turn, had a really good performance, but didn't get as much screen time as i expected.The movie is a pretty short one compared to modern day cinema. However, for a 1hr and a half movie, the transitional scenes are pretty long, and although those scenes are a treat to the eye, I found them to be kind of boring.The movie doesn't have any significant flaws, but at the same time, it doesn't have any remarkable elements that make the movie memorable (this doesn't necessarily mean it is totally forgetable). However, the ending was pretty controversial as some would find it satisfying but others won't, and the reason for that being is that the movie does a really good job connecting the audience to the characters in different ways.Score:7.5/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

"Can you forgive an old man his whimsy? If so then this is a good film, not a great film, but a fine piece of comedic fluff.","It has been quite a few years now but still every new Woody Allen film is greeted with praise of ""return to form"" just as surely as the next film will also be greeted the same way. Midnight in Paris is one such film although I wasn't so sure and although I like Woody Allen, I never got moved to actually watch it until recently. The film opens with a visual feast of Paris – which is a beautiful city but one I find too expensive and, contrary to this film, it is no fun at all when it is chucking down with rain. The opening shots are more than just to get you in the mood for a film that loves the place and the history, it tells you a lot about the film itself because this is a romantic fantasy where Allen loses himself into whimsy and lightness.The tone throughout is typical Allen, with the intellectual humor played out in the style you expect. I will not pretend to get all of the references but at least knew enough about the characters and their work to be able to keep up with it (ironically some of the people I know because of Allen's other work). It is never more than fluff though, so to enjoy it you do need to go with it and forgive the film for being what it is – if you are not in the mood for this then I think it will grate on you heavily. Personally I enjoyed it because of how light and easy to enjoy it was, but I did still need to forgive it its fantasy and muddled nature – the conclusion of the final few scenes sort of contradicts itself and is all too silly and romantic, but by that point you'll probably have warmed to it or switched it off.The cast buy into the whimsy pretty well. Wilson leads the cast well and his natural style actually fits the Allen-impression that every leading man ends up giving in one of his films. McAdams is really enjoyable next to him – again she fits that role that you see so often in Allen's films. Support is good from Cotillard (who really is a lovely presence as required by the character), Sheen, Hiddleson, Stoll, Brody, Bates and many others. Everyone has that light touch that fits so well with the tone and place of the film.Overall Midnight in Paris is not some wonderful return to form but it is a light and enjoyable piece of whimsy that fans of Allen will enjoy and forgive – but even they will need to have some forgiveness because it is fluffy and light. Those that dislike the man and his style will find a great deal to hate here but for me I liked it once I got into its tone and pace – it is as charming and as make-believe as the places our main characters jump to, but it works for what it is. A good film, not a great one unless you're in the mood, but it could be a fine comedy. And then Hemmingway punched me in the mouth.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
"Magical movie about Paris, making your own ""golden age"" and finding the right mate","RELEASED IN 2011 and written & directed by Woody Allen, ""Midnight in Paris"" chronicles events when an American writer (Owen Wison), his hot fiancée (Rachel McAdams) and her parents visit Paris. Incredibly, the nostalgic writer finds himself going back to the 1920s each midnight and meeting iconic artist/writers. Michael Sheen plays a ""pedantic"" academic.Allen's movies are the perfect antidote to conventional CGI-laden ""blockbuster"" drivel. ""Midnight in Paris"" is magical because (1.) Paris is such a charming city, which is thoroughly showcased, including the picturesque prologue, and (2.) the plot involves a fantasy element. Concerning the latter, there were 2 or 3 scenes where I didn't buy what was going on, but it was only for a moment and the movie quickly recovered (remember: movies are supposed to ""take you away"" to another place/time/situation and make you believe it through cinematic wizardry). In any case, the morals of the story are commendable and effectively driven home.Woody has a good eye for women without resorting to sleaze. And the charismatic McAdams is showcased in all her jaw-dropping glory; modest Léa Seydoux too, to a lesser degree. The ravishing Marion Cotillard is also on hand in a significant role, but her beauty is diminished by the 1920's look/apparel she's straddled with, but that's not really a problem.THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour & 34 minutes and was shot in Paris.

Is there possibly too much of Woody Allen in this film? I believe so.
But does it make you feel something, transport you to a different era? Absolutely.
An easy to recommend film for those looking for something a little more relaxed and visually stunning.To truly appreciate this movie you have to get lost yourself, climb into the cab and become Gil Pender.The modern-day characters revolving around Gil, his finance, her clan and parents, felt hollow and predictable only existing to belittle the protagonist and little else. It's a good thing this movie isn't about them, but instead Gil, a character you can get lost in.This moves nails making you feel something, especially if you're already a sucker for jazz, Paris, French culture, or the 20's. The protagonist is quite likable and easily understood. Though some of the exposition is quite on the nose the acting and visual storytelling makes up for it twofold.The theme itself, use the past not as an escape but as fuel for the present, was beautifully told in a moving way, leaving the viewer with food for thought once the movie ends.

"Not just a very, very silly film but downright embarrassing. Avoid","Is it OK to review a film of which you have seen only 40 minutes? Discuss. But on the assumption that I won't be shot at dawn for daring to do so, let me carry one (and confirm what I'm sure you already suspect) that for this viewer Midnight In Paris is another Woody Allen clunker. In fact, it is often so wooden, so badly directed, so trite, so superficial, so unconvincing and, finally, so downright bloody dull that you really wonder whether all those quite good Allen films you saw in the past are just rose-tinted false memories. Whoever coughs up the readies for Allen to produce this kind of silly dross must still be convinced the old phoney still has it, or perhaps it is merely a tax scam. Who knows? Who cares?The idea behind Midnight In Paris is not a bad one, but it needed a script and direction by someone with less of a dead hand than Allen to carry it off. As it is the whole exercise is an embarrassing waste of time.The script: it might well have been written by a would-be filmmaker of minimal talent it's so threadbare and thin. (And by the way at the time the film was set Hemingway had not yet published his first novel and only published two very slim volumes of short stories, and had not yet ever gone big-game hunting so he would not have known any 'rhino hunters'. As for Hemingway's reference to a battle in which he fought the Germans, that, too, is complete tosh - he did not fight but served as an ambulance driver after the US army, navy and marines turned him down because of an eye defect - though as Hemingway was something of a self-aggrandising mythomaniac, at least his account of battle is in character.)The direction is equally amateurish: two-dimensional, static, flat and - yet again - dull, just how did Allen ever gain his reputation in the first place?
So there you have it: if this review appears I shall know that charitably (they probably also disliked Midnight In Paris) IMDB's editors have allowed it to slip through even though this writer could not bring himself to see the whole film.My advice to you is don't even bother to see any of it. Find something else to do, wash up, clean the house, memorise the Bible - all three and many other pastimes will be far more appealing and satisfying.",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Fun!,"Just enough of an intellectual angle to make it interesting, but really just a fun movie. It's fun to think of the what-ifs of meeting the bygone's famous, and to ponder the question: is life really greener on the other side of the time-continuum? and does everyone of every era feel this way? I loved the characterizations of past's characters -- just the way I'd pictured them (except maybe Pablo). Marion Cotillard absolutely devours the camera until there is no camera between you and her. You are invited into her presence, and it is just her and you and you are feeling and hearing what the receiving character is hearing and feeling. She is luminous.Weaknesses: I thought Wilson's performance was good, but there was no reason for him to be in this role other than star-power. Someone else could have given this role a new dimension, and perhaps the movie a new dimension as well. Same with McAdam's. I think she is a great actress, but maybe only took this part for a chance to be in a Woody movie. Even a one dimensional character needs more than one dimension, but still, I don't think the problem here was with her performance, as much as with casting. Just my opinion.Overall, I liked it very much.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Would recommend!,"Fell in love with Paris thru this film. It's great for a laugh, but not shallow at all. The atmosphere in this movie is amazing and very inspiring.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
A brilliant way of getting connected to the past,"Gil is a writer fascinated by the life style of the intellectuals and artists during the twenties in Paris. During his stay in Paris, with his fiancée and her parents, he seeks for inspiration and try to connect to the spirit of those years. During the nights, instead of going out with his bride, her parents and friends, who don't present any interest to him, he prefers to walk through the streets of Paris. During these walks, he connects to the things which fascinate him. This is the point I want to stress: the way that Woody Allen found to show this connection is brilliant. More precisely, Gil takes a ride with people of the twenties, in a car of the twenties which passes on the street where he is. This ride takes him to the places where important people get together: parties, reunions etc. In these events, he meets Cole Porter, who plays and sings, he talks to the couple Fitzgerald, Pablo Picasso, Luis Bunel, Salvador Dali and so on. The interaction with these characters from the twenties helps him find himself. At the end of the film, he annul his engagement with his rich and boring fiancée from his rich bride and boring and decides to stay in Paris, in the company of a girl from Paris, that has the simple style that inspires him.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
"Not Much Other Than ""Cute""","Pros: Woody Allen's famously witty and neurotic tendencies are made more human and approachable by Owen Wilson, whose Gil is a very familiar character to the ones he's played in the past and strikes me as a good stepping stone into the world of Allen. I really appreciate the fact that this movie is a statement on this year's Academy Awards, where only one nominee for best picture is firmly grounded in the present. Allen really couldn't have picked a better year to make this into an Academy-worthy film, as its overarching theme serves to incredulously point out the irony of its inclusion in the nominees this year in particular.Cons: As much as I can appreciate most of Gil's personality, I just can't relate to his unabashed love of the city of Paris. Since I've never been there, I will admit that this might have to do with my deep-seated reactionary attitude toward all things French. But honestly, what's so great about every street, building, sign, and cobblestone in that city? Also, pretty much every character in this movie not named Gil could stand to receive a hearty punch in the face. I probably wouldn't have fared very well in the 1920s, listening to speech patterns like that all the time. Speaking of the 1920s, I felt like I could have stood to know a bit more about that generation of writers, musicians, and artists to really appreciate a good deal of the portrayals and references littered throughout the movie. Although if Hemingway reads like he spoke in this, I'm glad I haven't read his books after all.Overall: I won't say I disliked watching the movie, and there were a number of moments that made me actually laugh out loud (something I'm not typically wont to do alone in a dark room). However, I spent most of the movie wondering if it would arrive at an eventual point and whether I would care. Ultimately it did wind up with a theme that I believe ought to be quite strenuously stressed with some people, but it wasn't enough to make me think of it as anything other than a ""cute"" film that really only garners a best picture mention due to this particular year's crop of nominees. After some wrestling with an eight rating, I eventually settled on a 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Underrated,"This film has everything - beautiful Parisian scenery, a great story line, wonderful acting and superb wardrobe and backdrop all round.

"Endearing and memorable, if imperfectly written and acted.","This is a compact movie with a simple conceit that initially looks to be hokey but ends up driving home its payoff quite memorably. Were the writing and acting better, it could have been a classic, but alas it falls well short of that mark. Owen Wilson was an acting high point, but even then his performance was just OK - nobody else was in the least bit identifiable as an actual human rather than an actor playing to a script. True, some of the the 'historical' figures were supposed to be caricatures, but even beyond this, the 'deeper' characters had no depth or chemistry. Worst of all, for a movie supposedly set around Paris, all I saw was a really poor American take on Paris; very little reminded me of that city which I know quite well. Heck, the ""French"" characters' ""Frenglish"" accents were barely identifiable as such.A real pity, since, as I said, the payoff and the idea were very decent for a compact movie like this. I did not dislike it, but thought the acting and writing let the whole thing down quite a bit. A 90 minute good date movie for an undergraduate trying to impress a girl who fancies herself an intellectual but has never been to Paris.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Sells Paris But Little Else,"I had no idea what to expect when I rented this movie. I actually decided to rent it because I LOVE Rachel McAdams. Unfortunately, her character was not likable in this movie and her role was not all that important in the grand scheme of the movie either.This movie was different to say the least. I found the parts that took place in the past to be the most interesting. Although I understand what this movie was saying, basically ""the grass is always greener on the other side"", that is not the aspect that pulled me in. The storyline was interesting, and I was intrigued by the famous people of history brought in.The downside of this movie is that it isn't all that entertaining. I wouldn't watch it again out of any fond love for this flick or for entertainment value. I would absolutely never consider this movie a comedy. I didn't laugh once. If anything it is a romance/drama. I really don't get the huge success of this hardly heard of film either. It just doesn't stand out as a great film to me, although the ones that win awards rarely do.The one lovely aspect of watching this film is that I absolutely want to visit Paris now.

A film for those not fond of the usual Allen tripe,"Most enjoyable Woody Allen film I've ever seen. It actually has a story to tell (I know, I was surprised too!), a honest to god plot and some intersting ideas. Not just a the usual semi relationship cringiness and bunch of self-important, boring, pseudo-intellectual drivel.I highly reccommend giving this movie a chance, especially if you usually wouldn't even touch a Woody Allen movie. Yes, it's cheesy as hell, but it has some great actors, people to hate and fall in love with and some light humor.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
This Coach Is Just a Pumpkin,"""Midnight in Paris"" is a time travel fantasy with a taxi as the means of conveyance, like H.G. Wells' time machine or the pumpkin carriage that transports Cinderella to the ball. Gil (Owen Wilson) travels back to 1920's ""Lost Generation"" Paris where he hobnobs with his arts and letters heroes, and even to ""la belle époque"" of the 1890's. Me, I'd like to visit the '40's and '50's. There's a few famous folks I'd like to meet. I should have liked ""Midnight in Paris"", but it, mostly, left me cold, and I wasn't charmed by its many quaint artifices.People I've spoken to who have seen this movie are quite tickled by its whimsical premise. It's a pretty, dreamy soufflé that, unfortunately, sinks and congeals very quickly. I, myself, was quite eager to follow our wide-eyed hero as he tumbled down the rabbit-hole, bumping into the celebrities of the day, the likes of Fitzgerald, Hemingway, Bunuel, Baker, Porter, Picasso, Dali, Gauguin, Toulouse-Lautrec and on and on and on. There were so many celebs that I'm surprised that Woody Allen didn't simply roll out a red carpet.And what a dull, boring, inane lot they all are! They're not characters, or even caricatures – they're cardboard cut-outs (or cut-ups), and Allen hasn't penned a memorable line of dialogue for any of them. In fact, the screenplay is devoid of any wit, and the characters (all of them) lack any flesh or blood, depth or weight. Shouldn't great artists be just a little bit dangerous, if not in their behaviour, at least in their ideas? In one pointless scene Gil and Adriana (Marion Cotillard, easily the best thing in the film) encounter a suicidal Zelda Fitzgerald by the Seine. Just so that Gil can draw upon historical knowledge and convince her that F. Scott really loves her (""I know. Take my word for it"") and offer her a Valium. Suicide? Just a gag.Why must Woody Allen write protagonists who are merely variations of the Woody Allen screen persona? This often bothered me with Owen Wilson's Gil, who I didn't, for a moment, believe was a successful Hollywood screenwriter, hack or no hack. And as for his relationship with the shrew played by Rachel McAdams – that strained credibility even further. By the way – I just have to ask – wouldn't Gil do re-writes on a computer, and what font do you suppose he used in the original manuscript he presents to Gertrude Stein? Just a thought.""Midnight in Paris"" is a one-note wonder with a script that is lazy and shallow. It's practically an insult to the great men and women of arts and letters who litter its scenes. Around the time that I saw ""Midnight in Paris"" I also caught Richard Linklater's dreamy, but alive, ""Before Sunrise"". Now, there's magic for you.",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
First Impression,"I think it is a very ""delighful"" film that conveys a message that says "" follow your instinct "" and you won't see this image of the the movie until you reach the end, and that is the beauty of this movie when you realize and see what it intends to convey at the end.I wish i could describe this movie in very few words but, unfortunately, the policy of website does not allow to say no more.However, let me say that whether you're into comedy,action,horror,science fiction, or anything, you should not miss the opportunity to see such an inspiring movie that opens and awakens your mind to a lot of things happening in your life.

Paris - city of love,"I have never been a fan of Woody Allen or his films, BUT Midnight in Paris was so amazing!! Paris is wonderful, the characters are wonderful, the lessons learned are wonderful probably because of their simplicity, and their in your face common sense. The 1920's in Paris was a highlight of that city's history, although Allen presents history in the most delightful way possible. The only point I found jarring was seeing French women wearing blue jeans in public. That was a new one for me, as all the French women I have ever seen, even the ones working in small shops, dress. The blue jeans had to have been some sort of attempt to make the film palatable to Americans. I am going to go see the film a 2nd time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
The past is beautiful; the present is ugly,"POSITIVES:1) Marion Cotillard's performance is so heartfelt; she steals the film for me
2) The cinematography and direction are both magnificent. The city of Paris is shot in a way where it feels alive and becomes a character of its own in the film. It is clear that Woody Allen is in love with the city
3) I'm a sucker for classic literature and the theological discussions that great writers have, so the film really really worked for me on that levelNEGATIVES:1) The first 15 minutes were excruciating. The film opens with 3 minutes and 40 seconds (yes I counted it) of random shots of Paris. This is then followed by the credits which made me wanna scream ""could the credits not have been on during the 3 minutes and 40 seconds of random shots of Paris?!?!""
2) The film really hits you over the head too much with the message of the past being beautiful and the present being ugly. The main way this is done is by making every single character from the present day some of the most annoying characters in the history of film. I hate when films deliberately make their characters excruciatingly annoying
3) I couldn't help but question how the 1920s car that picks Owen Wilson up every night can exist in the same frame as all the modern cars on the street. It just makes no sense?",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Surrealism on Film,"I hesitated watching this film for a long time, I don't know why. But boy was this film a treat for classical oafs like me. The film opens with a series of montage of contemporary Paris: the Eiffel, the Louvre, the Arc de Triomphe, the Notre-Dame, as well as little corners of the city. The fact that they are contemporary says that it's both Paris and not Paris at the same time.Hence, the film follows up with this fantasy odyssey of our protagonist Gil into this dream-like and back-in-time world meeting artists like Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Stein, Picasso, Salvador Dali, the jazz age fashion, the falling in love in the streets of Paris etc. - all of which is a tribute to the classiness and classical of Paris. You can say it gives us the audience a sense of nostalgia - which is interesting because a line from the film suggests that nostalgia is ultimately denial of the present and indulging in this inner yearning for a time long gone. I wonder if this was a playful detail by Woody Allen haha.Speaking of the man, Woody Allen wrote and directed the film like it was a novel, the dialogues are so amusing to follow. He uses the static shots provide that sense of easing and mesmerizing to watch, making it feels like dreaming a beautiful and mischievous dream ruminating and reminiscing back in time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Allen's best. Period!,"Woody Allen made some well known films in the 70s. I watched some of them and I had mixed feelings about them.Midnight in Paris changed my view of maestro Allen because it touched me personally.I often think about how it would be like living in the 1920s or the middle ages or during the antiques. These epoches have something magical on them I love. Just take architecture: Modern architecture is lifeless rubbish. The 1920s had some of the best.Woody Allen finds a perfect answer for this dilemma. Every generation thinks a generation before them was the best. Ariadne, the woman Gil meets in the 1920s wants to live during the belle epoque. He coming from the 2010s thinks the 1920s are the best. And so it goes on and on.The message of this movie is, that while it does not always seems to be the greatest period, the present is not worse than the past. But it is also not always better than the past. Every generation had something special, the others will never have.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
A glorious fairy tale,"Woody Allen plugs along decade after decade, stolidly churning out films. Every once in a while, he catches lightning in a bottle. This film is beautiful to look at, beautifully paced, beautifully acted, and pure pleasure from beginning to end. The lead dresses like Woody, although he has a physicality that makes his attraction to women more plausible. Is it just me, or does he sound like Jimmy Stewart? The women are absolutely gorgeous; Woody has not lost his knack for bathing women in a transcendent light. The bad guys(a pompous professor, the fiancée and her parents) are brutally sketched with perfect telling details. And best of all is Paris itself, looking at least as beautiful and magical as the New York of Allen's classic films of generations past. It is a movie about nostalgia, idealism, and those of us who feel out of place in our own time, and it is nearly perfect.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
"""Why don't we make a Jewish movie set in Paris with Christian characters?""","Starting with Owen Wilson's twitchy ongoing imitation of Woody Allen himself as Gil, every situation involving his grabby neurotic fiancée Inez (a perfect JAP if there ever was one), and her supposedly WASPY Tea Party parents (who come off more like a suspicious Scarsdale dentist and his shrewish Haddassah wife) MIDNIGHT IN Paris is an amusing ethnic exercise primarily because Woody Allen doesn't know that's what he has written.It would be nice if Wilson's ""blastoff into the past"" didn't include constant ahistorical errors like ""Hemingway"" interrupting spouts of unintentionally parodic passages of Hemingway prose to discuss rhino hunting and bullfighting years before he had any exposure to either, and decamping to Kilimanjaro with Wilson's love interest (Marie Cotilard), years before he had ever been to Africa and while he was still living happily with first wife Hadley whose trust fund checks were barely keeping them alive.But what the hell. Watching Wilson/Woody Allen's constant bug-eyed ""Gee whizzes"" as each celeb from the past (Fitzgerald, Dali, etc.) went into their star turn was unintentionally hilarious... rather like a reprise of the beginning of the guided tour of Jurassic Park, but the one truly touching sequence when Wilson/Woody somehow caught the right carriage to take a Marie Cotillard to her dream ""golden age"" to Maxim's and the Moulin Rouge of the Belle epoque made it all almost worth it.Worth an Academy Award for the blurry postcard color of daytime Paris and the ability to pull the Woody Allen claque together behind a far inferior movie to the marvelous VICKY CRISTINA BARCELONA... .THis is a lousy movie, but given the ethnic makeup of Hollywood, it is over-praised and at least Woody made some money this time.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Heavily underrated film,"I think, what I need to get off my chest is that I would no way get on well with Gil Pender. He's an out and out democrat that openly criticises Republicans calling them 'insane'. Today, JFK would be a Republican. I'm not a Republican, I'm a libertarian, but we are also to the right side of the political pendulum. I simply would hate this guy in real life.However, that is a minor distraction. What I think medianoche en Paris (the movie inspired me to use one of the seven languages I speak) does well, is it transports us to a more simple time. Today, men are the most dominate sex in female sports, our media no longer tells us the truth, we are given false narrative after false narrative, everyday. Wherever it be that COVID is a deadly virus, a man is a biological woman or that genocidal maniac Ukraine president Zelensky is a good person, we live in a time where our government, our medical establishments (big pharma) and our press are out to enslave us in every possible way.Watching a movie involving Dali, Picasso, Hemingway, Buñuel etc, it just shows us a time when life was more simple. Not many critics highly praised the film; - it's impossible to argue with them. They considered it a very good, but not great movie. I think it really depends on how romantic you are, whether you enjoy or really enjoy Polnoc w Paryzu (IMDB doesn't allow me to use Polish characters)I for one really enjoyed it. I knew all of the ancient stars in the picture and I enjoyed witnessing them exist. I think the performances are respectful and fair. Adrian Brody, Owen Wilson, Marion Cotillard and Kathy Bates really show the screenplay some respect, whilst Woody Allen directs the production in a comfortable way for the viewer. The script lacks spice; - and making Owen Wilson into a mini Woody Allen, I found slightly disrespectful.The film works though and all in all I can only highly recommend it. I think one of the key things about the feature that will decide if you like it, is your age. A modern 18 year old will not know any one of the featured characters. Western education is so bad today, they just won't be aware of these legendary humans. 40+ age groups will really become a part of the whole story and that's a beautiful thing.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
One of the best Woody Allen works of the past 10 years,"As a big Woody Allen fan I haven't missed any of his releases of the past 10 years, however I must admit that some of his recent works have failed to impress me.It is a completely different story with this one - mesmerizing and magic, inspiring and inspirational, sad and happy, charming and breathtaking - it is all of those and more. My only regret is that I have waited so long since its release to watch it!

An American optimist in Paris,"On a vacation in Paris with his fiancée a dissatisfied writer finds the ability to step back in time to the 1920s literary heyday of that city and explores his passions ...Amusing fantasy that relies on the good natured sweetness of its lead actor. The conceit is nice, although the set pieces with the famous figures of the past didn't make me laugh out loud. The main themes are wrapped up well - nostalgia inducing a sense of grass-is-always-greener and the responsibility of art to overcome despair - while the pacing helps achieve a lightness of touch.The lead actor does channel the Woody Allen persona, but there's nothing whiny in his performance and he delivers a very likable romantic hero. Other performances are good, Kathy Bates being the standout, but nothing remarkable. The streets and architecture of the city add great charm, and the director obviously has a tourist's love of the sheen of the cobblestones in the rain.Music is mostly Cole Porter.Overall: Upbeat and airy, a gentle comedy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

The Deeper meaning makes this film,"I love Woody Allen, and although I don't think this is his best work, I still think it was a good watch. The thing that really caught my attention was the deeper meaning of this film, or the theme of being bored in your own present and being nostalgic about the past and other times, which is a feeling that the majority of people feel every ones in a while. I think that without this, the film would have felt empty and would have just been a waste of what could be achieved with this story, just full of name dropping and so on.In conclusion, I really liked this movie and would recommend it to anyone who is a big Woody Allen fan as almost all the themes he uses in his other films (Jazz music, romance etc.) are all present.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

Young Owen Wilson has the lead role, plays the part of a writer with girlfriend problems and job problems...all comic ones...same as Woody when he used to star in his own movies.Documentary part of the DVD I got shows Woody at a press conference in 2011 at Cannes, and his looks very fragile and unhealthy...his skin is very yellow and pasty looking, and one eye looks bad, like a man who had a stroke...and his speech isn't clear at times......but...he keeps on going like old man river.He really is one of the great figures in cinema....like D. W. Griffith, I think. I met him face to face in NYC in 1972 at a place where he played his clarinet several times weekly with the house jazz band...called ""Michael's Pub"" as I remember. I was living in Manhattan then, selling educational movies....had a jazzy apt. in the easy 60's near the place where Woody played...went to see him one afternoon with a girlfriend who knew about it.

Just What the Doctor Ordered,"I liked every single little thing about Midnight in Paris. Woody Allen, one of the most astonishingly prolific writer-directors in American film history, after a consecutive string of anxiety-induced dramas about the cruel indifference of life, he has finally given release to a well-deserved and surprising reflection. Believe me, reflection is the right word. Without compromising his signature melancholy longing, Woody has woven an utterly breezy, life-affirming and still personal and hilarious comedy, populated by a charming and sometimes joyfully surprising cast who look to be enjoying themselves, and the buzz is infectious. In a now rare ecstatic mood, he daydreams about youth and the excitement a young writer urgently wants to preserve before it becomes smothered in the dehumanizing daily grind, takes that stress and calmly, confidently drifts into a world he romanticizes with such warm, savory atmosphere and a true master's storytelling economy, and coming to a perfectly aimed close, where the story should and must end, and with tidy reconciliation it does, and boy, do we hate coming back to reality when the lights go up.As per his usual, Woody provides one more couple at the apex of marriage and finds conflict in that universal clash between security and passion. Hollywood screenwriter Gil and fiancée Inez have accompanied her parents to Paris and the excursion shows up their differences in a most prickly manner. She's all about shopping for priceless chairs while he wants to take midnight saunters in the rain. Indeed, he loves Paris so much he wants to move there, an idea she rejects like he's nuts. Meanwhile, she grows impressed by an conceited, know-it-all professor, who precludes every pontification with ""if I'm not mistaken,"" the satire being that his enlightenments are usually untrue. One evening at midnight, dismayed by the seeming trajectory of his life, Gil bails on her to walk alone. As he sits down to pull himself together, an antique car drives up.Revealing any more would be a cruel deprivation of your pleasure taken by the amazing grace of the film's fluid, elegant surprises. The crisp pace, firm cutting and old-fashioned invisible style leave you longing for more as the movie whooshes by in 94 minutes of enchanting pleasure, what they always meant when they used to say ""movie magic."" The indomitable soundtrack includes some of Cole Porter's most remarkable songs. The smart period and present-day chic wardrobe and sumptuously arranged interiors are also entitled to year-end awards acknowledgment. Woody, who claims indifference to his work so frankly, clearly takes delicate care of the filming of his stories.Characters in his 42nd film, aside from but not exclusive of Gil himself, have a sole crucial attribute which really provides the actors scope to have loads of fun with their roles. The ensemble is enormously exuberant in their typecast character parts. Cotillard is the right choice for the charming pixie-like spirit who distills and unravels Gil's passion, but McAdams has the high-maintenance modern young American woman down pat. She is the ideal distillation of how most of Europe views us, and brings real emotions to Inez that inspire our genuine reactions. No surprise. Woody's invariably above marginalizing female roles.Surprise is in the welcome familiar faces we stumble upon throughout. Adrien Brody's priceless take on a certain Spanish cultural icon, for instance, is delectably memorable. But it's a gem in a convention of gems. Wilson is Woody's best-ever casting of someone else to personify his customary self-doubting and hung-up character. Expressing obsessive sentiment with witty jousting and the ubiquitous dread of death are consistent with the deep-rooted Allen opus. You surprisingly don't wish he were a young Woody instead as he injects lots of wide-eyed ingenuousness along with just the right dash of the director's classic nebbish.Wilson makes Gil so genuine, so keen, about his hero worship of the experiences he's mysteriously introduced to. He can't believe them, the refreshing humility and worldly genius of them. Essentially, he's leading with his nose here. Both it and his performance are engagingly bent, as is commented on subtly in the most brilliant in-joke manner in Brody's scene. That's it. Starting now, no more spoilers of any kind. This is hard for me, but necessary. The trailers don't spoil it, but now the reviews are everywhere and audiences have flocked to it. But by jove I'm doing my part to preserve it for whatever it's worth.I think of aged burgundy or antique clocks in regard to the spirit of this hilarious and exciting little film. It begins with a montage of postcard-worthy tableaux of the City of Lights in the sunlight, in the rain, and then in the sunlight again. It's a musing, a reverie, clearly. But what gives it such an ebullient sense of wonder is its eternal central theme. The story, in its clear-cut but understated way, proposes that no matter what period we're in, we take its value for granted. So we reflect and see superior days gone by. And yesteryear, naturally, is a discriminatory daydream. Allen's profound esteem for the film's deliciously romantic universe doesn't stop him from giving it an old comic pro's joshing as well. It all works self-assuredly and sublimely on its own conditions.One would think some moviegoers might be baffled by this annual release from the filmmaker, just as they deeply are by one out of your average three Woody Allen films, since cultural literacy is hardly ever brought to the movies anymore, to say the least. And yet, it's success in theatres is wonderful. Perhaps in an economy like this, just as screwball romantic comedies were celebrated in the Depression, this is the pure ideal for what the movies need more of right now. So many moviegoers take Allen for granted, though Midnight in Paris has and will captivate even the most worn-out old-hand moviegoers. There's nothing not to love about it. Either you relate to it or not.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Carpe Diem in Paris,"When I was recommended to watch this Woody Allen gem, I was immediately drawn in by the star-studded cast. How could I have missed a movie that features the likes of Kathy Bates (as the wise Gertrude Stein), Michael Sheen (as the hateful Paul), Tom Hiddleston (as Scott Fitzgerald), Corey Still (as the passionate Hemingway), Marion Cottilard (as the beautiful, mysterious but ultimately tragic Adriana), Adrien Brody (as literally surreal Salvador Dali), Lea Sydoux (as the hopeful Gabrielle), and many more? The movie is led by the journey of Owen Wilson's writer character, Gil.In terms of production value, this movie is gorgeous and meticulously filmed. It's definitely Woody Allen's love letter to Paris and what it represents.The movie feels structured like a theater play. At first, I thought it would become a drama, even a tragedy. But it ended up being an uplifting story-even poetic.It's a lovely movie. I truly loved it because it feels what I feel. It's a simple but honest critique-an allegory and a twist on Plato's allegory of the cave.It's a clash of three eras: the present, the past, and the future. You shouldn't conform to a safe, easy, but ultimately unfulfilling future. But you shouldn't also dream of the romantic past and live there. You can choose the right now and shape it yourself without denying the past and without sacrificing the future.Basically, Carpe Diem over the lovely rainy Parisian background.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
"Elusive Perfection: Enchanting, Likable Inspiration","""Elusive Perfection: Enchanting, Likable Inspiration"" Woody Allen directs a mish mash of great actors and actresses in ""Midnight in Paris"" bringing them together to create a story about a man's enchantment in Paris. The best Woody Allen movie made in years is much more majestic than his previous work and feels much more lighthearted than his typical films. Shadows of the charm of ""Annie Hall's"" success are present, as Owen Wilson (""Hall Pass"") becomes a star once again. Wilson's happy-go-lucky attitude combined with his early artsy roots of ""Bottle Rocket"" make his interpretation of a successful, laidback Hollywood writer Gil the most likable character of the year. Gil is in love with the city of Paris and wishes and is infatuated with life in an earlier time period (the 1920s). Consequently, when Gil and his fiancé Inez (Rachel McAdams, ""Sherlock Holmes"") travel to Paris with Inez's parents, he becomes lost in the city as he struggles to finish writing his first novel. Gil is searching for inspiration stumbling upon a routine of walking through Paris after midnight. Inez does not support his ambitions and instead goes out with her old stereotypical snobbish French cultured friend Paul Bates (Michael Sheen, ""Tron: Legacy"") and his wife Carol (Nina Arianda, ""Win Win""). None of this really matters though as the golden art of cinema is revealed with Gil's story as he meets various characters played by Adrian Brody (""Predators""), Marion Coltiard (""Inception""), Tom Hiddleston (""Thor""), Alison Phil (""Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World), and Kathy Bates (""The Blindside"") in the illusion of his night pursuits.Owen Wilson has one of the year's best performances creating one of the most likable characters to ever be on the silver screen. Owen Wilson's personality was perfect for the role, however, his success is ascribed by his ability to delve deeper into his character creating a subtle Oscar worthy performance. The rest of the cast speaks for itself with a handful of contemporary A-list stars guided by an articulate original screenplay of believable imagination. Lastly, praise for the city of Paris is well deserved because without the city where would the movie be? Woody Allen makes one cliché mistake with the development of Rachel McAdam's character Inez. McAdams has a solid performance; the problem is that Inez is portrayed as a complete selfish bitch throughout the film's entirety. Therefore, this brings up questions about why Gil and Inez are together in the first place.An elusive rom-com about a man's discovery of inner harmony allowing him to find someone that understands him.

a young couple goes to Paris before their marriage and this city changes their lives,"at first I can say that the idea of the poster is really great , you can feel the movie even by seeing its poster. I liked the way this movie pictured Paris , as a city to fall in love , as a city that you won't like to leave ! as you watch the movie you will say : wow can I see this beautiful and amazing city once ( of course if you haven't been there before , like me ). but somehow I wanted it to seem more real , not the story , the acts. I somehow think that Owen Wilson wasn't the best chance to act this role although I believe he really did it great. I don't know maybe I'm wrong but I expected them to be more surprised in some parts or even see happiness in their faces.I was going to forget to mention the exceptional music which really makes you feel that you're not in this world .",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Magical,"This is a film which I will not tell you much about, storywise, because you need to be surprised when you see it, as I was. On a cold winter day I grabbed a few dvds from the local bookmobile and this is one of them. Figuring if Woody Allen' name is on something, I probably won't hate it. Au Contraire! I loved it! This film starts out with a picture-post card view of Paris and the film warms up from there. Mr. Allen shows why he is one of our finest filmmakers. In an interview, he says that when starting out, he just had the title with no story to go with it. What a neat story he concocted! I'd like to tell you more, but that would only spoil the fun for you.

"Midnight in Paris Review: ""Actually, Paris is the most beautiful in the rain.""","Ahhh Mr Woody Allen, you either hate his work or love his work. I wouldn't necessarily call myself a big Woody Allen fan but I've seen a lot of his films (2000 and up) and I either really enjoy them or find them a complete waste of time (usually cause of the way it ends), there's hardly ever a middle ground. Match Point—loved it, Scoop—hated it, Cassandra's Dream—hated it, Vicky Cristina Barcelona—loved it...Midnight in Paris—loved it.Midnight in Paris comes stacked with a very impressive cast. I'm surprised with the choice of Owen Wilson as the lead protagonist especially with Allen's recent history of casting, how we say, more alpha male, less goofy type male leads in the likes of Ewan McGregor, Colin Farrel, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Hugh Jackman...you get the picture, Owen Wilson simply doesn't really fit that list. Having said that, I felt Owen Wilson's soft hearted, goofy boyish charm worked really well for the character of Gil. Rest of the cast includes Rachel McAdams, Kurt Fuller, Mimi Kennedy, Michael Sheen, Alison Pill, Tom Hiddleston, Kathy Bates, Adrien Brody, Léa Seydoux and my very personal favorite, the very beautiful and talented Marion Cotillard. Cotillard plays Adriana, a beautiful women that catches the eye of Gil (as well as many others).The story is quite simple, Gil (Owen Wilson, Hall Pass) and his fiancé, Inez (Rachel McAdams, The Notebook) and her parents are visiting Paris for business. Gil, a writer who feels a little bit uninspired as of late, feels like he needs to live in Paris for a little while to suck in the artsy and romantic culture to become inspired so he can finish his novel but Inez doesn't share the same perspective. I don't want to reveal anymore to the story because I went into this movie reading only the brief synopsis listed on IMDb which basically reveals nothing and I was pleasantly surprised. I will say this though, it was a interesting, different and very simple approach that Woody Allen used to execute his concept for this story and I thought it worked very well and in a very suitable Woody Allen fashion.The only hint I would give is the film involves a lot of discussions involving historical characters such as Zelda Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway and Pablo Picasso, to name a few. Is it important that you know your history for this film? It'll probably be a bonus but it wont distract you from the main story and the message that Woody Allen is trying to convey. At the heart of Midnight in Paris is of course, like all Woody Allen films, a romantic love story but its also about people living in the past, people who find the present boring and unfulfilling, people who crave nostalgia and blame the emptiness of the present simply because they are afraid to face the future. Something I feel that we can all relate to, at least once in our life.Overall I really enjoyed my viewing experience with this film. Paris was perfectly chosen to capture the art, culture and romance to tell this story. The variety of very talented actors and characters kept things very interesting and made me want to learn more and more about each character. I loved the presence that Marion Cotillard's character, Adriana brought to the screen. Her outgoing, contagious charm and flirtatiousness was the total opposite of Inez and it created quite a bi-polar dynamic when you see each of the characters interact with the lead character, giving us a chance to see how Gil reacts to two very different love interests. I'm surprised I'm saying this, but I really enjoyed the chemistry between Gil and Adriana, if you were just to tell me to compare the two actors, I would've never believed it but just goes to show how well the writing was done (I'd love to see another Woody Allen film with Marion Cotillard as the lead but I digress). The dialogue in all their late night walking scenes were really well written and well shot. Midnight in Paris is a solid movie, full of diverse characters, with an interesting concept executed in a simple but enjoyable way that oozes Woody Allen—suffice to say, if you are a fan of the director's work, you will enjoy this film.You can read the full review along with other movie reviews at: http://goo.gl/8KgJN or www.theTVSamurai.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

If you like literature and art...,"I've read many reviews here saying if you don't like literature and art, don't waste your time going to see this movie. I'd like to add something to that: if you DO like literature and art, don't waste your time going to see this movie (or you should just go ahead, like me, because you can't imagine how bad it is if you haven't seen it). The premise of the movie seems promising: a struggling writer going back to the past to chat with important artists of the 20's (The Lost Generation) in Paris, and he has an epiphany at the end about life, art, or what have you, but the whole thing turns out to be a ridiculous mess. I bet you'd be better off at home reading your Hemingway than listening to the Hemingway in Midnight in Paris give a speech about life, death, and whatever that needs to happen in between, though.There are names that pop in and out of the movie all.the.times. Salvador Dalí, Luis Buñuel, Gertrude Stein, F. Scott Fitzgerald (and Zelda). They converse, they talk about life and philosophy and art, and it feels like History of art 101 freshman year of college all over. Except you can't really learn much about art or literature or cinema or anything for that matter in 2 hours, so reading the first 3 lines in each Wikipedia article will give you more information than Midnight in Paris ever will.I can't believe the characters in this movie were so shallow and flat, especially the protagonist's fiancée (only 1 hour after the viewing and I can't recall the characters' names. Not that I want to.) She is just unbelievably crazy and demanding, but is that really necessary?Well, I was wondering what the movie is all about, but I finally found out at the end because guess what? The protagonist outright gives a lecture on treasuring the present and not being so nostalgic about the past. Thank you very much, I would never have figured out the message if the lecture hadn't been given. Being lectured is never fun, but I particularly detest it in movies; it feels like the director has no respect for the audience's intellectual ability. But hey, if you know who Luis Buñuel is and whom Pablo Picasso had an affair with (and whom that lady had affairs with previously), and your friend doesn't, might as well invite them to the movie and make them feel bad for not knowing such important people. There's no better way to spend a Saturday night.I have to admit though, there was that part where Owen Wilson talks about Valium and Zithromax and antibiotics, and being someone who works in a related field, I found it pretty funny. But it was just because of the drugs. Maybe I would have liked it even more if Viagra was honorably mentioned.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

A  beautifully filmed picture postcard of Paris now and in the past,"A frustrated American writer (Owen Wilson playing a role Allen would have played himself 30 years ago)on his hols in Paris with his obnoxious, materialistic fiancé finds his midnight strolls turning into time travel back to Paris' golden years of the 1920s and the 1880s and along the way meets all manner of artistic and literary greats from Paris' past such as Dali, Scott-Fitzgerald, Hemingway,Metisse etc and in the doing so realises that the past isn't as important as now.

Woody's Wild Strawberries,"Woody Allen can utilize his satire to be original, his romantic comedy to stimulate, and his drama to make a point. Midnight in Paris is shaped by his vision of a Bergman style drama. His obsession with Bergman extends to his movies where he cracks jokes about his love for the Swedes. In Bananas (1971), Woody Allen becomes President of San Marcos and declares that the official language be Swedish. This is no doubt an homage to Ingmar Bergman, a writer/director who has more influence on Woody Allen's film career than anyone. This style is formed around tortured characters who live out their internal struggle by reliving past and fictional memories. When I saw that Rachel McAdams hair is blonde in Midnight in Paris, I thought, with a smirk on my face, ""Ingrid Thulin.""Woody Allen's 41st movie is Midnight in Paris (2011). It's aroma is of The Purple Rose of Cairo (1985) mixed with hints of Deconstructing Harry (1997). The Purple Rose of Cairo comparison comes from the want of a character to be in another time. This template usually starts by defining two realities, which we will separate into the crushing reality of existence and the illusions.The crushing reality comes in contact with the illusions, be it the allure of stars of film characters in classic cinema (The Purple Rose of Cairo) or the nostalgia of 1920's Paris in the rain and the artists and writers of the Jazz Age (Midnight in Paris). The characters are faced with a decision to reject or accept the illusions, the driving catalyst which propels the story forward.The illusions are fantasy, this fiction life where wish fulfillment is the norm. The main characters struggle with illusions of romance, no doubt delusions. With these delusions, Woody Allen gives a nod to such Bergman films as Through a Glass Darkly (1961) and Cries and Whispers (1972).The Deconstructing Harry comparison is the storyline of the writer who has fictional characters to haunt him. Harry Block remembers scenes from his book as well as his past. In Midnight in Paris, it is a fantasy for a different life which draws Gil to the streets of Paris. In Bergman's Wild Strawberries (1957), Dr. Isak Borg is visited by a flood of illusions on his way to receive an honorary degree. Bergman beautifully displays the hidden places in Borg's mind. Woody Allen shows us his own version of Wild Strawberries, as the visit to Paris takes us into the fantasies of Gil's mind.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
HK Neo Reviews: Midnight in Paris,"Even the bravest fans of Woody Allen will say that he misses his mark for a good decade already. However in his 41st film, Allen shows us the qualities that make us fall in love with him for. Witty dialogue, cynical nature, feeling out of place in society, life and everything in general, Midnight in Paris is a perfect dose of dream, reality and fiction. Allen's films are never for everyone and despite my nativity of the works of 1920s artists, the film simply intrigue me immensely. Owen Wilson impresses me and every minute movement reminds me of Woody Allen and in particular revokes one of his greatest achievement in Annie Hall. Marion Cotillard is simply breathtakingly beautiful, with brilliant on-screen presence and single-handedly lifts the film above its genre conventions. Cotillard is one amazing actress and it's difficult not to see why Wilson is falling head over heels over her. All in all, Midnight in Paris reminds those of us who feel as though we belong in another era. Then again at the same time, allude to us that people always get carried away about the past generation achievements of the Einsteins and the Shakespeares, when they themselves are the ones who can become the next Steve Jobs. As Allen puts it: ""That's what the present is. It's a little unsatisfying because life is unsatisfying."" At least the film is satisfyingNeo rates it 9/10.www.thehkneo.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Another Horrible Woody Allen picture,"I just don't get how anyone can really like Woody Allen pictures. They are almost ALL universally Booooring!!!And while I like the romantic concept of this movie, the only thing romantic in this movie is Paris. Which is spectacular... But that's all this movie has going for it.The concept of this script is interesting, but the characters come off dull, weak and boorish. And I like Owen Wilson, Rachel McAdams, and Marion Cotillard, whom I fell in love with in Ridley Scott's ""The Good Year"".But not in this movie. Only Woody Allen could direct Owen Wilson and turn him into a weak pathetic version of himself..in other words...he turned Owen into Woody Allen.BTW, I just noticed that Marion Cotillard doesn't appear prominently in the IMDb credits of either movie and yet she is prominent in this movie(maybe the only actor who stands out) or the ""The Good Year"" where she plays the female lead. Is is it because she is French? Curious....hmmmmmmm.I've never met a man with any testosterone that liked Woody Allen, I'm thrilled that I haven't had to go to a movie with him in it for a long time...something I've had to do for girlfriends and wives....whom he seems to have universal appeal.

A film that spoke to moi,"Words fail me to describe what a joyous, extravagant, and unbelievably beautiful experience Midnight in Paris gave me. Not only did it immerse me inside its world of fantasy, whimsicality, and gentleness, but it gave me a strong superficial aspect I believe only myself, aspiring journalists, and veteran journalists will be able to extract from it. It's a close to home work of ravishing art.Owen Wilson is the Woody Allen character here. In almost every Woody Allen film, the main male character connects in some way with Allen himself. This time we supposedly see the romantic version of Woody who is shy, naive, and unassuming in his destiny to ""make things click."" Wilson plays Gil, a self-proclaimed ""hack"" Hollywood screenwriter who has been working on a novel his fiancée Inez (McAdams) has dubbed ""a romantic daydream."" They are visiting Paris with Inez's parents, and Gil is desperately seeking motivation to finish his novel at the same time bask in the glory of his favorite city in the world.One night, Gil takes a walk and as soon as the clock strikes midnight he becomes ultimately transported into his nostalgic fantasy, 1920's Paris. The transportation isn't the cartoony skit we would've thought. It happens instantaneously, without any clear change except for the setting and the characters. He meets many of his idols including F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway.After having one night of incredible, indescribable circumstances, Gil takes another midnight walk the next day to be transported back to the 20's. Over time, he falls in love with the lovely Adrianna (Cotillard), who is dating Pablo Picasso. Adrianna is everything Inez isn't. Tolerable, easygoing, and supportive of his work. Inez seems to preoccupied after running into an old College flame shortly in their trip.Being an aspiring journalist, Midnight in Paris spoke to me using words that would be void of meaning if came from an actual person. Here's a man that escapes reality by visiting a time period he was never able to experience, talking to his idols he never got to know personally. I would love to go to the eighties and nineties and see my personal idols like Corey Feldman, Corey Haim, Gene Siskel, Kevin Smith, and John Waters in action during their heyday.But I digress. Inez's College flame pokes fun at Gil's unconditional love for nostalgia calling it ""denial."" Nostalgia isn't denial to me. It's more of a period appreciation complimented with a wish for it to return and a subtle pessimism because one may think great, landmark things won't be able to be achieved in the present. We all know that is untrue, but look at the eighties and all the political and pop culture accomplishments and tell me they're inferior to those of today. I suppose if we're talking the technological field they are, but it was more simplistic and more basic. Everything is so difficult now almost everywhere you look.This brings me to my next point. The film works as a form of escapism for literary writers. Think of it this way; Gil is in love with the period of the twenties in Paris and the idols that came out of it. He probably dreamt up his own fantasies with Hemingway and others before meeting them in person. When he finds them in real life, it's his own way of writer escapism. Some writers take more unhealthy practices such as drinking and drug use, but Gil frolics with Ernest and F. Scott. Maybe Woody Allen does in his dreams as well. Who wouldn't want to hear their idols' thoughts on their work in present day? As for the film itself, the art direction and acting, especially from Wilson, is effervescent, welcomed, and extraordinary. The opening sequence, which clocks in at almost four and a half minutes, features beautiful music and a slideshow of footage from Paris. It doesn't feel like a postcard as much as it does a scenic foreshadowing to the events we are about to be blessed with. Owen Wilson has also proved that when given the proper script and character he can be a marvelous and compelling character actor.I fell in love with Midnight in Paris early on for its excellent commentary on modernism vs. nostalgia factors. I became even more sold when the film decided to become close to home for me when discussing writing styles and escapism. Woody Allen has proved himself worthy of the title ""cinema genius"" with this after a string of films critics and audiences found mediocre to fair. Here, it is the direct opposite. Critics were overjoyed and most audiences were astounded. Some people need to just step out in the rain once in a while. Midnight in Paris is the film that makes you.Starring: Owen Wilson, Rachel McAdams, Marion Cotillard, Kathy Bates, Adrien Brody, Carla Bruni, and Michael Sheen.

Midnight in Paris - Reality becomes Fantasy,"At first I wasn't sure what to think. As the movie started out beautifully filmed, great musical score.

Woody Allen's ultimate masterpiece!,"I really didn't expect that 80 years old Woody after 40+ movies would be able to produce something like this, but he did. Without any question - Midnight In Paris IS the best piece of his entire catalog (and yes I've seen them all). I never even liked Woody's movies that much since they were mostly the same funny/relationship clones (with a few beautiful exceptions like Cassandra's Dream), but with this one he topped himself, everything went right - smart and funny story, beautiful Paris locations, great music, precise actors and magic concept. If you are an artist, or at least you love art and you're a romantic soul you're gonna LOVE this. I'm not surprised by all the awards and by the fact that this became by far his commercially most successful film because it's all so alluring, you can watch this over and over without getting bored. Some of the scenes like the first meeting with Hemmingway, or the dialog with surreal guys are absolutely priceless.

Midnight in Paris (2011) - Sit Back! Relax! Enjoy the Sights and Sounds of this Beautiful City of Paris!,"Writer-director Woody Allen makes one of the best movies in his career, after changing cinema with his award-winning motion pictures from ""Annie Hall"" to ""Hannah and Her Sisters"". Now, one of cinema's smartest directors has made a movie showing the beauty and grace of the city of Paris, with an all-star cast including Owen Wilson, Rachel McAdams, Marion Cotillard, Kathy Bates, Adrien Brody, Carla Bruni, and Michael Sheen. The movie is set in the middle of Paris, where Wilson plays a screenwriter on holiday, with a beautiful fiancée, distracted by the magical experiences of the beautiful city. Until he discovers the true magic of the city, every night at midnight, when he travels back in time to the era of the 20s and discovers the magic beneath when he meets his life-long artistic and literary heroes, and falls in love with Marion Cotillard as Adriana. This movie also brings a heartwarming message about if we had created a more brighter and creative society, life would be much sweeter. Director Woody Allen has provided one of his best movies to date. He has made such a well-written script with comedy, charm, and charisma. The casting ensemble is something to die for. Owen Wilson deserves total Oscar consideration for his excellent performance, Rachel McAdams was just awesome, and Marion Cotillard was just plain lovely. Every moment is plain laughable, from Wilson discovering the 20s every midnight, to acting like a maniac when talking about meeting famous icons from the past. Those moments are handled in such a unique way, and those laughs are deserving. It was safe to say that this movie wasn't a sequel, remake, or reboot. But it's an original romantic comedy, and it's truly entertaining and excellent. This is a movie with a hilarious premise, an excellent cast, and a smart director like Woody Allen. ""Midnight in Paris"" is by far one of the best movies of 2011, or probably any other year. Woody Allen deserves Oscar consideration for writing and directing this masterpiece, and this will be a nominee for the Best Picture of 2011.

Bravo Woody! Welcome back.,I have always been a Woody Allen fan but let's face it his decade-long European sabbatical has hardly produced anything remotely memorable until now. The switch in genre from those uninspiring melodramas to romantic fantasy works perfectly. It can be no coincidence that Owen Wilson was chosen to play the leading man for a part that Allen clearly wrote with himself in mind. Without ever consciously mimicking Allen Wilson manages to put across that same angst and self-doubt in an amusing and totally charming performance. Indeed it is difficult to think of another actor attempting it without resorting to impersonation. Marion Cotillard lit up the screen as usual. Has that woman ever appeared in a bad film? The photography was also worthy of comment. Paris was made to look the centre of the universe and even in pouring rain it looked completely irresistible.Woody Allen should receive the freedom of the city for his contribution to French tourism.,,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
A moment of pure joy,"I was about to write in the summary the following qualification for this magical movie: 'intellectual orgasm' but I was afraid of both words. The word 'intellectual' might scare some people away when it simply means that watching this film is a dessert for the brain and a visual orgy (Paris of today, Paris of yesterday) and the word 'orgasm' would scare the other people away because of its sexual connotation. However, the qualification refers here (once again) to the brain. We share the same astonishment as Wilson's character as he meets Legends of the Arts and we just go along the ride with an exhilarating feeling. You can feel that Allen has a deep knowledge and passion for both these luminaries and Paris and we are happy to share it with him. He also make us think about the respective values of one's fulfillment through materialism or spiritual (through literary inspiration). And that's probably why he is more popular in Europe and particularly in France than in the US...And I have to say that Marion Cotillard is once again a treat to watch and for me she might be one day compared to the best actress in the world: Meryl Streep! In this movie, she is literally the incarnation of the City of Light.I got out of the theater very thankful to Woody Allen for producing such an inspired and funny intellectual and visual treat.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Woody Allen at his blissful best,"The opening of 'Midnight in Paris' is not promising. The 41st film from Woody Allen begins with a montage that practically revels in the world of cliché with its depiction of Paris – there's people sitting outside cafés, some smooth jazz, flower shops, art galleries, berets, affluence, the Eiffel Tower; the only thing missing is a man in a striped top carrying a baguette. Then it's only ten minutes before Carla Bruni shows up. Essentially, it's an opening that is the polar opposite to the beginning of 'La Haine'. After this gorgeously-shot montage which felt almost like a tourist advertisement, I was uncertain about how the remainder of the film would pan out. Thankfully, any worry quickly evaporated as I found myself irresistibly charmed by it.In line with Allen's 'The Purple Rose of Cairo' it sees the prolific filmmaker once again venturing into fantastical territory, as Gil (Owen Wilson), a Hollywood screenwriter holidays to Paris with his beau, Inez (Rachel McAdams) in the hope of successfully completing his debut novel, only to find himself magically whirled back in time, coincidentally to his favourite era – the Roaring Twenties. Here, he gets swept up in meeting a host of significant figures from the Parisian Café Society.These twenties-set scenes were the shining highlights in all-round wonderful film. Tom Hiddleston's F. Scott Fitzgerald is tailored and well-spoken with an affinity for the phrase ""old sport"". Alison Pill's Zelda Fitzgerald is unpredictable and somewhat uncontrollable with a fondness for alcohol. Corey Stoll's Ernest Hemmingway spouts profound literary advice while retaining love for a good fisticuff (""You box?""). Adrian Brody's Salvador Dalí is expectedly eccentric and insists of the proper pronunciation of his name (""Da-lee!""). The movie is full of other such people that appear only briefly, but if like me, you share Gil's love for Café Society culture, you'll struggle not to smile when they show up.I never really thought much of Owen Wilson as an actor, but here - essentially inhabiting the Woody Allen role - he proves to be a charming leading main and much like the film itself, very likable, because even though 'Midnight in Paris' is undeniably clichéd in its portrayal of Paris and the various historical figures, this all adds to the delightful charms of the movie. It is very light and even frothy entertainment, but this is a cracking little film that left a huge smile on my face. To use that saying Allen loves so dearly, it's ""amusing"". But y'know what? It's actually more than that, it's pure brilliance.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
A Second Masterpiece,"I remember leaving the theater the night I saw Annie Hall. In that movie, everything had come together. To me, Woody Allen had done something akin to Bob Beamon's long jump at the Mexico City Summer Olympics: a leap so much further than anyone had ever jumped before that the technique could not be comprehended; the act could only astonish. I gave up hoping Allen would make another movie as good as Annie Hall about 10 years later. That's when he started his homages to other film makers. It got worse. He started his existential preaching phase. To be fair, there were some good movies he would film periodically (e.g. Bullets Over Broadway; Manhattan Murder Mystery; Small Time Crooks). But I'd lost hope he would ever deliver on his talent. But he did. For me, this is a second masterpiece. Midnight in Paris is a comedy, a fantasy, and a love story. The performances are uniformly excellent. Special credit to Adrien Brody as Salvador Dali.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Another cutie from Woody,"Woody has a way of making romantic comedies so attractive in person and in location that you always want to be there too. I would bet that tourism to Paris increases this summer due to this film. And, Paris never looked lovelier, as the first 3 minutes of the film was a running postcard of still-shots of Paris' greatest and most beautiful sights. Just an inspired leadoff for a film full of great shots.The idea was that the Woody character, this time the well-rumpled Owen Wilson as Gil, a frustrated novelist and Hollywood screenwriter, was half of an engaged couple who, along with his fiancé Inez' elitist parents, visit Paris. For many good reasons, he opts out of doing the sights with her parents and ends up going walking alone at midnight. He, as in a fantasy, meets a strange classic limo that stops, people inside beckon for him to get in, which he does, and he is instantly transported back to the Paris of the 20's, the era in which he always longed to live. He does this same midnight escapade again and again, and in time he wondrously meets all of the famous Paris artists of that day. These fantastic adventures determined the course of the story, which also included Michael Sheen as an arrogant, pedantic college professor friend of his fiancé that Woody, I mean Owen as Gil, detested. His fiancé? Far from it, as you will see. And, Adrien Brody was hilarious as Salvador Dali, as in ""Dali!!!"" and ""Rhinocerous!"" That part was priceless.Gil as Woody(let's just use Woody OK?)met a couple of gorgeous women interested in a romance with him, one of them being the terminally cute Marion Cotillard(Adriana)on his visits to the 20's, and a sweet antique dealer in the present time. After finally resolving his life's troubles caused by his fiancé and by his many trips to his fantasy 20's world, Woody ended up as he should have with the right partner and the right life's direction, and apparently is still in Paris living happily ever after.Ah, if it all could be so grand and ending just as it should, as it always does in Woody's fantasies.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
A man returns to the 1920s in Paris...and I want to return the Blu-ray,"Midnight in Paris is one of the only movies lucky enough to be rented out by me and not returned with an expected refund...in respect for this supposedly good title I merely stopped the DVD less than an hour in, ejected it and placed it calmly back into its case. Now I understand the concept of the film, it's quite a cool concept, however apart from it already being unbelievable, as most movies are, making it believable should have been the director's primary aim, unfortunately it undoubtedly was and yet I didn't see it.Luckily for director Woody Allen it was set in the beautiful Paris which sold the title to me in the first place, I was looking forward too seeing the stunning French backdrop to reminisce on my recent travels...and the horrendous long introduction covered this, and then began the script and the character introduction;In short, the main characters, Gil (Owen Wilson) and the other one...his fiancé i think she was supposed to be (Rachel McAdams) are two people who live in the States and travel to Paris often, despite the obvious and constantly expressed dislike McAdams feels for the place which makes no sense to me at all. Gil, a script writer and keen novelist adores the city however and has a love for writing, art and the 1920s. So he often goes off without his fiancé which is the most believable part of the whole film as I do not understand how anyone would want to be around her, and at midnight every night he finds himself back into the 20s era spending time with Hemingway, Picasso and a bunch of other famous people he admires. Blah blah blah whats-her-name doesn't believe him but he keeps going back to get his novel proof read by some woman that's played by Cathy Bates of course and he finds out history's secrets and has a near affair with some chick who's with Picasso, whom we liked because she wasn't a winy brat like the other chick...OK, I didn't like her, much less whatever the wardrobe department kept dressing her in which included some horrific belts...never mind it was awful but um tangent city....Now, not that I continued watching once I discovered the story had no peaks or troughs, just a monotone that started at the bottom and stayed there, I realized that for the type of movie it was, it had the worst possible casting. Clearly the famous names and setting for the film were its only selling point; however had they been unknown actors it would have been far better in my opinion...Wilson is a funny guy...and always the same funny guy, he was so not needed here, and McAdam's was just there to look pretty, but her character's attitude didn't suit her and i feel sorry for her that she thought she had to star in this.All I really remember from this experience was turning to my boyfriend and sincerely apologizing for my choice of movie for which I begged but that's it! I have no idea what happened at the end of the film, or in the middle...but if anyone has the strength to find out it'd be nice to know if it actually ever went anywhere. Also, if you can stand the stupid (sorry) script, the uncomfortably annoying relationship between the main characters and Rachel's outfits then I commend you..but if you truly love Paris, maybe just watch the film on mute because it doesn't have much else going for it.C'est Fini.",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
The Magic of Mr.Cinema!,"Woody Allen aka Mr.Cinema proves his supremacy yet again in his recent critical & commercial smash 'Midnight in Paris'. Allen, LIKE ALWAYS, delivers a magical film, that takes imagination & passion to a new level. I sometimes wonder, minus Allen, would've Cinema ever explored it's actual beauty?'Midnight in Paris' centers on a small group of Americans visiting the French capital for business and pleasure. The protagonist, a screenwriter, is forced to confront the shortcomings of his relationship with his fiancée and their divergent goals due to his magical experiences in the city beginning each night at midnight.'Midnight in Paris' explores themes of nostalgia and modernism. Allen this time takes us to a joyride he believes will be akin to a roller-coaster ride, and o boy, it turns out to be just that. 'Midnight in Paris' is one of his Greatest Films to date, because it's a magical story, that is so well-told. Allen brings in characters he likes to watch, and presents them the way they should be. He justifies them beautifully via dialogue & executes their journey with great imagination. Allen is in top-form!Performance-Wise: Owen Wilson makes a wonderful protagonist & he delivers one of his best performances in here. Rachel McAdams has NEVER been so good before. Marion Cotillard is a delight to watch, as always. Michael Sheen is appropriate. Carla Bruni is charming. Kathy Bates leaves a mark. Adrien Brody appears in a very brief role. Others lend good support.On the whole, 'Midnight in Paris' is Allen Cinema at it's very best! Now, We're Talking Cinema!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Allen back to his best,"For anyone who has romance in his/ her soul then you want to see this film. The casting is very good and Owen Wilson makes for a very engaging lead character. The scenes after Midnight are a delight and there are stand-out performances, particularly Adrien Brody as Salvador Dali. Paris is made to look like a place you would long to be in, ignoring the horrendous traffic. There are some great one-liners and casual asides - watch out for the riff on Matisse. It is always said that if a film seems to pass quickly, its a hallmark of a good, engrossing film. This one seemed to last for an instant and yet lasted in the memory for hours. Woody has rediscovered his mojo in Paris and the after Midnight club is the best place to be.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Definitely belongs among Woody's Best and also the best of the year,"Woody Allen does what very few filmmakers can do. He makes you fall in love with the characters. All of his movies have been character driven films and they all have a certain flare about them that separates his films from everyone else and in Midnight in Paris it really shows. The films stars just like all of his other films a huge cast of talented actors. Owen Wilson, Rachael Mcadams, Marion Cotillard, Kurt Filler, Alison Pill, and Tom Hiddleston. They all shine in this film and even when some of the actors have small roles they leave a lasting impression.If you love Paris you will differently love this love letter to the wonderful city. Woody Allen continues to prove why he is considered one of the best filmmakers around with this movie. Also Owen Wilson plays a fantastic Woody Allen and gives the best performance of his career. Alison Pill is wonderful with the southern accent and really shines in her role as does Tom Hiddleston. Also There's the always great Rachael Mcadams who's as talented as beautiful. Woody Allen shot Paris quite wonderfully and makes want to live in Paris in the 20's in the rain. The script which was written in the mid 2000's and Woody Allen tried to get this film made but it was to expensive so he had time to work on this script and it really shows because like some of his recent movies like Cassendra's Dream it probably would have been better with a little more work on the script and here is prime example why.If this film does not get any accolades by the end of the year it would quite shocking. Especially for the acting which everyone deserves recognition. With its great acting and its wonderful writing and directing this defiantly is one of the best films of the year.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
An instant classic!,"Being a Woody Allen fan doesn't make me the most objective of reviewers, but after seeing this I have to admit it: Woody Allen has done it again! Contrary to his most recent films (and mind you I thought Vicky Christina Barcelona was really mediocre) Midnight in Paris leaves you with the most pleasant flavour of bittersweet nostalgia that makes your heart beat at a faster pace. With an incredible plot vehicle, remarkable acting and a marvellous scenery, the film is bound to entertain, with the real sense of the word. The humour is a bit difficult to catch for anyone who skipped his Art and Modern History classes, yet it manages to provoke laughter even if you don't take all the jokes. Owen Wilson is great as the ""Woody"" character, Marion Cotillard is extraordinary as always, and the rest of the cast ensemble is also in great shape. I loved Adrian Brody's scene, while I also enjoyed very much Kathy Bates, who is an incredible character actor. The idea behind the film is very clever, reminiscent of the Purple Rose of Cairo but taking it to a whole new level, and also quite thought-provocative. All in all a great film certainly not one to miss!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
I Wish I Could Appreciate Woody Allen Movies,"I failed to make it beyond the first 20 minutes of Midnight In Paris. That miserable time was filled with a ever-increasing pity for such hopelessly self-absorbed people. Sadly, every Woody Allen movie I have seen, which is by no means all, has been populated exclusively with characters devoid of the quality that I cherish in real people; a recognition of some thing which is greater than themselves. Allen's characters always seem to follow the same, circular, shallow lives: It starts with conflicting introspection, then false-awareness, always followed by the deep, wallowing creep of a search for a self-induced problem that would not have existed had their self-absorption not been their best quality. Is Allen incapable of writing a character that has faith? Surely he must have met a person in his life to draw upon, SOMEWHERE, that was not endlessly bumping into other people's psyches, constantly wondering what is wrong with themselves! Well, maybe not...",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
A Tapestry of brilliance,"Where has he been - Woody Allen? I thought he'd retired but I would just like to think he was having a rest before bringing out this gem of a movie and it is a gem. Well up there and surpassing Annie Hall The main protagonist Gil (Owen Wilson) plays his role superbly (as well as the great cast that Woody Allen always seems to find and take from roles you had normally seen them in to roles you would never imagine they could perform)- he essentially has come to Paris with his fiancé and her parents who are as materialistic about life as well as being insincere. Gil wants inspiration to write a book and his fiancé just wants to buy half of France! But at Midnight in Paris Gil is transported back in time to meet all his idols writers and musicians and painters and he re thinks his book and re thinks his life as a consequence. As the story develops nicely before our eyes we see how he struggles with his present relationship and the one he imagines in the past. The film has everything humour, poignant moments and above all is thought provoking. Simply Woody Allen at his best a possible Oscar Candidate and a Tapestry of brilliance.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Midnight in Paris - brilliance in movie making,"Well, Woody Allen finally found a Bogart in him . :)It's been a while since I posted something for having not found a worthy work of art and also because of my belief that worthiness is subjective and immeasurable. Midnight is Paris is not just a movie, it is a dream. As a movie, it exceeds expectations and as a dream, it (contrastingly) looks real. In 1979, Woody Allen wrote ""The Kugelmass episodes"" in the New Yorker, wherein the protagonist escapes into the past, whilst striving to attain sanity in the present. Although similar in thought, Midnight in Paris is much more than just a fantasy. It is brilliance in movie making. At this point in time, one can most assuredly say that Woody Allen has matched the likes of Fellini and shifted the epicenter of perfectionism towards the West. I shall not attempt to tell the story, but articulate myself on the subject given the fact that no one is ever going to read this.The movie is about the protagonist's journey into his fantasy, thus paving the way for realizing a sane, fulfilling life in his present.Owen Wilson is a complete surprise. One can see a young, vibrant Woody Allen in him. Even his style of delivery has been matched to that of Allen. The character is absolutely fantastic. Having to express notions like cognitive dissonance, disbelief, paranoia and a need to escape the realms of the present, Owen Wilson delivers. He is believable and aptly cast. Marion Cotillard, as always, is perfect as Adriana, Picasso's lover, who has married the likes of Braque and Modigliani, and may (or may not) fall in love with Owen Wilson's character, Gil.As his character grows and escapes into the delusions of fantasy, suspension of disbelief kicks in. This is probably one of the greatest examples of how 'suspension of disbelief' can effectively be used to convey ideas that are simple (contrast to complex notions like Science fiction), in scenarios that are amusing and far-fletched. The only concern about the movie is Kathy Bates playing the role of Gertrude Stein. That, to me was the moment I suspended believing in disbelief. Probably because of her huge body of work, but it is arguable that she was miscast.If you aren't aware of the Fitzgeralds, Alice B. Toklas, Ernest Hemmingway, Gertrude Stein, Dali, Cole Porter, the movie is still amusing and inspiring in a way. Some of the dialogues are absolutely brilliant. It is irresistible to quote some lines from the movie.Ernest Hemingway: All men fear death. It's a natural fear that consumes us all. We fear death because we feel that we haven't loved well enough or loved at all, which ultimately are one and the same. However, when you make love with a truly great woman, one that deserves the utmost respect in this world and one that makes you feel truly powerful, that fear of death completely disappears. Because when you are sharing your body and heart with a great woman the world fades away. You two are the only ones in the entire universe. You conquer what most lesser men have never conquered before, you have conquered a great woman's heart, the most vulnerable thing she can offer to another. Death no longer lingers in the mind. Fear no longer clouds your heart. Only passion for living, and for loving, become your sole reality. This is no easy task for it takes insurmountable courage. But remember this, for that moment when you are making love with a woman of true greatness you will feel immortal. (Courtesy of IMDb) Ernest Hemingway: No subject is terrible if the story is true, if the prose is clean and honest, and if it affirms courage and grace under pressure.(Courtesy of IMDb) And the most brilliant of them all, reserved for Gertrude Stein from Allen, We all fear death and question our place in the Universe. The artist's job is not to succumb to despair but to provide an antidote for the emptiness of existence. (I typed it) Woody Allen is probably the best American writer in the past decade. He has elevated, once again, the benchmark of perfection. The writing is simple, unlike his other works which makes it more compelling to watch. The subtle humor that comes along with every single character, the typical Allen mannerisms and above it all, Paris, makes it a movie-goer's dream- a great one at that.Rating : 9.5 on 10 .This review has not been corrected for grammatical errors or popular opinion.Visit http://upenreviews.blogspot.com/2011/08/midnight-in-paris-review.html for more.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Allen does it again.,"Yes, Woody Allen has written and directed another hit film that is funny and nostalgic and socially meaningful. Indeed, ""Midnight in Paris"" is so enticing that it outshines even some of his most recent hits. Owen Wilson is a prince of a character as Gil, the present day writer who is carried back to the years of the great impressionists and interacts with them as easily as if he were transported by a time machine. This is a romantic comedy that will entertain you while it also brings to question relationships and the meaning of life: common themes in Allen's works. None of his fans should miss this masterpiece. Don't let it slip by unless you are home bound and wish to pick up the DVD or Blu Ray at a later date. One may find that Vickie Christina Barcelona was funnier, but this cinema is both clever and deep in meaning. It is a top film of Woody Allen's and a first class film of quality and intellect.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
"Just like the 20's, this film dazzles in every way.","The trailer for Midnight In Paris is so deceiving, I saw the trailer and thought oh great another film about Paris, the city everyone but me seems to love, but the when I sat down to watch it I was so pleasantly surprised at just how different this movie is to what you would expect.Firstly I have to say that the story of a man traveling to another era after midnight is terribly clever, it took me a second to realize that the main character has actually time traveled and hasn't just run into people who are dressed in 20's attire for the evening. It's even different to the usual Woody Allen material, it's highly original in every way imaginable.The cast in this movie is exceptional, I'm not usually an Owen Wilson fan but I found him wonderfully likable, he is so at home in this type of film, it's nice to see him in an intelligent comedy and not a cheap silly one. The entire supporting cast are wonderful, Rachel McAdams playing against character is great at making you dislike her character almost instantly, the same can be said for Michael Sheen, the 2 supporting cast members who were the best were Alison Pill as Zelda Fitzgerald, she's hilarious and just plain fantastic, Marion Cotillard is lovely and sweet as well, all of them are great, they all get a great scene, another worth mentioning is Adrian Brody as Dali, another hilarious encounter. Woody Allen sure knows how to write fir all his characters, no one is left unmemorable.It's kinda hard not to like this movie, I loved it in every way, I hope you will too.

A Midnight magical feast!,"I would encourage every cinema lover to take a stroll and walk into Woody Allen's latest gem ""Midnight in Paris"". Woody's 7,204th film (OK OK maybe he has not helmed that many) is an elegant nostalgic film that mentally transports you to another time & place; and isn't that what movies are primarily supposed to do! It's also an admirable love letter to the ""city of lights"" which will illuminate Paris to those who love Pari and even to those who have marked the city off their ""favorites"" map. Even if you're an ""anti-Pari"", how could you not want to visit Paris after a viewing of ""Midnight""! So before it gets to midnight, let me not prolong this review any more and cut to the narrative chase. Owen Wilson stars as Gil, a disillusioned but successful Hollywood screenwriter working on a nostalgic novel, and who also longs to live in Paris. Californian Gil and his girlfriend Inez visit Paris on a leisure trip, and also occasionally meet with fellow Paris travelers John & Helen; who happen to be Inez's parents. Inez is a looker of a girlfriend for Gil but does not encompass the literary free-spirit and nostalgic demeanor that he possesses. She is also a domineering complainer who does not respect Gil's artistic passions. Gil is into the past, most notably the Golden Age of the 1920's including many of the artistic & literary legends that came out of that period. While in Paris, Gil is uninterested in spending time with Inez and her judgmental parents. To make matters worse, Gil also despises Paul, who is a supercilious American friend of Inez who also happens to run into Gil & Inez in Paris travels. Consequently, Gil decides to take solo walking strolls of Paris; and what he ends up encountering is beyond a ""blast from the past"" in the streets of Paris. To detail Gil's ""media noche"" Paris encounters would be an exercise of futility, because it does require a ""see it for yourself"" experience. I will however provide a Midnight clue: if you are a literary and art aficionado of the Golden Age, you are going to definitely think those scenes struck gold. There were hardly any hysterics in ""Midnight Paris"", and I am glad that there wasn't because that would have taken away from the film's magical magnitude. Woody Allen masterfully scribes & directs ""Midnight in Paris"" with lively ingenuity and sheer stylishness. Woody might be a little ""French fried"" by showcasing Paris a bit too often, but it actually plays well within the film's premise and narrative; and last I checked, the movie is called ""Midnight in Paris"". Owen Wilson has never been better, he is deserving of a Best Actor Oscar nomination for his captivating performance as Gil. Yes, I said it; Owen Wilson and Oscar did play out in the same sentence. Rachel McAdams was terrific as the superficial Inez. Michael Sheen delivered yet another exceptional performance here with his portrayal of Paul; remind me why Sheen has never been nominated for an Oscar? This is the Sheen that is winning with his acting! But the scene-stealer of ""Midnight in Paris"" is Adrien Brody who only appears for five minutes in the movie, but I guarantee you will have a ""Dali"" good time watching it. Johanna Debas and Darius Khondji should be shoo-ins for a Best Cinematography Oscar nomination for their picture-Paris-perfect cinematic photography of ""Midnight in Paris"". To be France I mean frank with you, this is the best movie I have seen so far in 2011. So go and catch a midnight show, a matinée, or any scheduled theatrical showing of ""Midnight in Paris"". You will have a golden time! ***** Excellent",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Boring as h---!,"I fell asleep half way through. No elegant review or justification. It just sucked. Owen Wilson is a terrible choice as the protagonist. He weasels (yes, Pauly Shore or Spicoli) his way through the film like a surfer high on weed. He adds no debt to the film. If he would be quiet for a while, I might just like it. His incessant talking is annoying and distracting. His character's introversion is another very annoying factor in this film. Why people are fawning over it is just another example of padding the imperfect. Sometimes I think the studio is pumping up films. Jennifer Anniston being named as the sexiest lady for 2011 comes to mind, especially after she just jumped the shark (ie stole somebody else's man.)",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Thanks to Allen,"As others wrote before me, this is one of the best Allen movies. Although it never explains how Pender manages to get back to ""normal"" Paris (something which only occurred to me several days after seeing the film), it raises again the usual Allen topics, fans or haters will not be disappointed. What struck me is the fact that this film has the same love for Paris as some illustrious predecessors. ""Funny face"" (Astaire/Hepburn) and ""An American in Paris"" spring to mind. Allen's version of Paris is possibly too ""postcard-ish"", but this is cinema and optimistic cinema anyway. Great thanks must be awarded to Allen for wonderfully advertising Paris as a vacation resort and also for his use of a great cast of French supporting actors who might get this way more visibility in the USA (I don't include Cotillard and Bruni in that bunch - but for quite different reasons)",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Escaping the present,"Lately it looks like I am only watching one movie a year in the movie theatre and that is the one Woody Allen puts out. Especially the American movie industry seems to be determined to produce only movies I am not interested in. I have never been a big fan of Paris, so I did not see the movie for the city unlike the movie Vicky, Christina Barcelona, which I mainly went to see because of Barcelona. But I have always loved period films and like everybody else I dream about having been born at a different time and place, ignoring of course the problems of times passed.Midnight in Paris transports you back in time to show you only the positive side: the greatest artists, the most beautiful women in wonderful clothes, delightful music and joie de vivre in a beautiful city. So sit back and enjoy the ride. This is what movies are supposed to do. Transport you to another time and place and let you forget the present for the time of the movie. Plus you do not forget the movie immediately because the thought behind it stays with you.Bravo, Woody Allen.

"Classic Allen outing, his best after Matchpoint.","""That's what the present is. It's a little unsatisfying because life is unsatisfying."": GilMovie opens with a loving & surreal montage of Paris with honeyed Saxophone playing in the background and bam! You are lost. Woody Allen's Midnight In Paris is mystical, risible, wistful and nervously romantic movie which makes you fall in love with Paris. This is Woody Allen at its best, finally giving life to his nostalgic reflection and mesmerizing us with the romanticism of characters.Gil, our Protagonist here (very aptly played by Owen Wilson) is a dissatisfied Hollywood screenwriter and a failed novelist from Beverly Hills. He's accompanying his fiancée Inez (Rachel McAdams) and her parents in Paris for a holiday. Gil is actually a laid-back materialization of Allen's persona. He is fervently in love with everything pertaining to Paris. He has always been nostalgic & moony also. Gil regards era of 1920s in Paris as a golden period of History and strongly desires to have lived in that era when all the prominent artists, writers & musicians of the world donned the streets & clubs of Paris. Gil after years of perpetual dissatisfaction as a no-substance Hollywood screenwriter is also trying to pen a novel.As per his usual, Mr Allen provides us with a very diverse and occupying mix of supporting cast. Inez is an all-about shopping for priceless chairs girl, who is completely gaga over a pedantic know-it-all professor ""Paul"", who starts his every sentence with a conceited ""If I'm not mistaken"" remark. And as if that isn't enough, Gil has to endure his uptight soon to be in-laws also. One evening at midnight, disheartened by his humdrum life, Gil decides to bail on Inez to walk alone. What unravels next is a magical experience you wouldn't have even dreamt of. Revealing anything more than this will be a cruel act of depriving you of the pleasures of elegant surprises. But I still can't stop myself from spilling out ""some"" beans namely Fitzgerald, Hemingway & Picasso.Coming to the technical aspects of the movie, everything from direction to soundtrack was first-rate with Classic Allen written all over it. Cinematography was awesome; it was not just an expression when I wrote that movie is going to make you fall in love with Paris. No complaints for the casting and acting department also, you couldn't have selected a better cast ensemble than this. Marion Cotillard was lovely as a confused French beauty & Owen Wilson was at his hilarious best as Gil.In the end, Midnight In Paris is a lyrically crafted fable about romance, nostalgia and pleasures which leaves you feeling rhapsodic.http://flickyfriday.wordpress.com/2011/11/04/midnight-in-paris-2011/",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Midnight in Paris,"Woody Allen's charm is here in full effect. Watching Owen Wilson walking down the beautiful streets of Paris and transport back in time is very ""Allen-esque."" Owen Wilson plays Gil, who is soon to be married. He wants to stay in Paris, but his fiancé, Inez, doesn't which causes Gil to wander the streets at midnight, where he is taken to the 1920's, where he always wanted to live. It is a simple plot, with a simple, and can I say cute, message. Owen Wilson is on the top of his game here, and he contributes to the funny moments of the movie. The rest of the cast was fine, playing the roles to predictable. The characters that Gil are introduced to us are each unique, and interesting. Especially Brody's cameo, which was done very well.The best part apart this movie is the cinematography.

Why not just ask the Paris Tourist Bureau that he would do it for them at a discounted rate, so he can indulge into something he wanted to do in a proper context?

The grass is always greener,"One of Woody Allen's best.An ostensibly simple tale of an engaged American couple (Owen Wilson and Rachel McMadams) holidaying in Paris with her parents. Of course, they are unsuited. Of course, Wilson's character is a writer. He would like nothing better than to retreat into another world, another time, and maybe to live in Paris. Cinderella-like, at the stroke of twelve each night he finds what he is looking for in an imaginative, Spielberg-esque way.This is a clever allegory into the essence of dissatisfaction, and Allen does not hesitate to name-drop (and character-drop) in the most delightful way throughout the film.Michael Sheen is good as the professor you love to hate, the know-it-all to whom Owen's fiancée appears very much in thrall.One of Owen Wilson's best performances in any film, this shows his softer more human side. And watch out for a superb cameo appearance by Adrien Brody...the word 'rhinoceros' will never sound the same ever again.Simply outstanding. I didn't actually want the film to end.Nine stars.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Woody Allen's Most Entertaining Film Ever,"Woody Allen's latest film might be his most entertaining and rewarding ever. Midnight in Paris is hardly new material for Allen. Many people have long accused him of recycling old ideas. At the same time, Allen's newest creation touches on familiar ground but still seems refreshing all the same.Gil Pender (Owen Wilson) is a successful Hollywood screenwriter spending some free time with his fiancée Inez (Rachal McAdams) in the French capital. They too are a classic mismatched couple familiar to Allen fans. Gil an aspiring novelist hopes the inspiration of Paris will help him complete his first novel. Inez on the other hand is content spending time shopping and dancing with a 'pedantic' old flame named Paul played by Michael Sheen.Gil believes that he is wasting his talent at screen writing and dreams up a story revolving around a nostalgic shop. He is particularly fascinated with Paris in the 1920s when it was home to many great artists, poets, writers and even filmmakers of that time. Michael Sheen's character Paul refers to it as 'golden age thinking,' that your personality is best suited in a specific time frame of the past.The film explores the idea that many people think that their lives would be easier or more fruitful if they had been born at another time. But in reality the people of any so called golden age likely long for a different time frame. It is mostly found in people with a deep intellectual curiosity. Perhaps the idea is erroneous like Paul says. But Woody Allen's film seems to say,'So what?' Perhaps it is not the allure of Paris in the 1920s that is so engrossing Allen. Perhaps it is the bleak pessimism of the present that is so troubling to Allen. Gil's materialistic fiancée, her right wing Republican parents and the pretentious pseudo-intellectual played by Martin Sheen are clearly archetypes of people in his own time.Midnight in Paris is typical of many Allen films. There are bad romances. There are true romances that could never be fulfilled. This film is not as multi-layered as Annie Hall and Manhattan, widely held to be his best work. But you will not care.You will not really care to know why exactly he is picked up at the same corner of Paris by a classic Peugeot every night at midnight either. Midnight in Paris might just be the most entertaining Allen film ever. It is as mesmerizing and full of charm as the people he meets in his adventures.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
I was blown away!,"After reading other reviews/opinions ~ I must add mine as well. When I saw the trailer (via computer & IMDb) I KNEW I had to see this film. the lines outside the theatre were around the block. We were next in line for the following show . . yeah, that popular. My 1st impression of it had me oohing and aahing, and laughing as well with the rest of the audience. I love ""time-travel"", love Paris, love Woody Allen, so naturally, this movie swept me away. My original thought of ""why Owen Wilson""? was quickly quelled when I realized he's the perfect Southern Calif. man from 2011. He played it to the hilt! It gave all the other actors a special patina of another era. And Woody wrapped it up nicely, even if we suspected this might occur. I want to see it again!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
This is it everyone.,"No one knows the American character like Allen, no one manages to bring it on screen like him either. This film is his best, there are way too many layers to bring everything here because there are several stories going on and the audience can pick and choose which one they will follow. They can be the American tourists in Paris ""getting some art"" and shopping and consequently follow the little love story Allen has utilized to tell his bigger story – that of Western thought and the role of literature in Western civilization. Sad that one has to add glitter to a film to convey a more meaningful story – but in this case his managed it well in that it doesn't take over the story. Nostalgia is one of the central themes of the movie as something that Allen has been consumed with always but now he manages to peal the onion more academically by bringing in authorities in the field who he identifies with from Hemingway (who he trivializes a little with his American bravado) to Gertrude Stein – all of whom give their 2 cents on nostalgia, life, art and existence in the terms that Allen has been obsessing throughout his career. Why would anyone give this film less than maximum points is beyond me, not because Allen is the greatest living American thinker but because no other film, at least in the last few years, has managed to capture what 21st century humans have become in the context of timeneurotic, anxious and superficial.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Typical Woody Allen Setup,"If nebbish nerdy males and female partners who are shallow, self-absorbed, and clueless strike your fancy, you obviously enjoy films by Woody Allen. This is so much in the recycled Allen genre that it does not warrant anything other than a nod to great Paris locations and period costumes. Always a fan of period jazz, this film does not disappoint either, but Cole Porter was done a few years ago with Kevin Klein, so ""Let's Fall In Love"" doesn't have the unexpected flashback. Even the introduction of La Belle Epoque, Maxim's and the Moulin Rouge with Lautrec, Gaugin and Degas, to Piccaso, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Dali, Man Ray, and Gertrude Stein is nostalgia light. Allen's retro-vision of the past is still too convenient, too clean, too ""golden"" to hold attention, or even want to invest a second viewing.Performances of Kathy Bates as third-eye Gertrude Stein and Marion Cotillard are marvelous, but this is more a walking man's tour of the Paris cityscape than a story which hold the interest to the end, and is ultimately formulaic and predictable. Equitable in irritation are the performances of Owen Wilson and Rachel McAdams as the mismatched couple whose relationship is brought asunder by the city of romance and lights. Sorry Woody lovers but other films are more intriguing at this time.",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
"Not bad, but still an arm's length from great(ness)","There are so many copycatting like ingredients tossed into the scenarios and storyline, mixed up and dissolved into this Woody Allen's movie: ""Cinderella"" the cartoon, ""Somewhere in Time"", ""Time Traveler's Wife"", and so many other Sci-fi and romantic movies and novels. The 12 o'clock midnight charm is definitely from Cinderella, the big antique car is like the chariot from a pumpkin; meeting a dream woman and becoming so obsessed is just like what the male met his fatal female in ""somewhere in Time"", the only thing turns out better is the guy in Midnight in Paris didn't become a tragic character in the end but a happy one instead.I often questioned the overly exaggeration of making Paris the most romantic city in the world. Seems everything in Paris is exquisite and sublime. This is obviously a scam manipulated by the international tourism and the French. A city actually is no different from other cities in any country, people live in it shitting, crapping, eating, fornicating, urinating, sneezing, coughing....as any other city dwellers doing daily. What's the big deal? Walking in the rain falling in Paris is more romantic than falling in other cities? Maybe just a little better than the rain that falls in China, less acid and pollution? The movie also would only resonant to those who know a little bit of French and American literature, some basic common knowledge of the art world, about Picasso, Dali, Manet. Without knowing these fundamental French/American Literature For The Dummies and Art History 101, I really doubt those majority video gamers would give a rat arse about this movie. And I am quite sure that this movie is only for the people who still read and not even the kind who really read on Kindle.With all things considered and said, I have to say signing Owen Wilson up to do this character was 50/50 good and bad at the same time. The way he talks, the way he spit out the dialog is not quite likable, as his mouth and lips often twisted in a weird way, and exactly sounds like what his fiancée's father said: ""There's part of his brain missing"". He doesn't look convincing and believable as a writer and sometimes a bit immature, childish and lukewarm. There are many characters played by other actors and actresses are very convincing, but the character played by him, unfortunately, nobody but Owen Wilson, with a funny nose and mouth.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Woody at his peak,"""Midnight in Paris"" is the best Woody Allen film I know, by several miles. The night before seeing it I happened to see another of Woody's films, ""Deconstructing Harry,"" and the proximity was convenient for telling the difference. ""Midnight in Paris"" is based on an act of imagination, with Allen's quirky humor placed at the service of it. ""Deconstructing Harry,"" like pretty much everything else Allen has made, is a long string of one-liners inspired by Woody's self-regarding. It seems that Woody has finally learned to take himself out of the frame and to create a structure that gives something of value to the viewer.Is it a great film? Let's see how it plays in the memory. I knew I was hooked when I felt the wonder experienced by Owen Wilson's character. That moment breathes authentically; and Woody's persona is nowhere near. The film has its share of flaws but many more beauties. I especially respect the film for ending at precisely the place it should. How many of today's films or fictions can make that claim, or would bother to?",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

The only truly sad moment with films such as these is the profound loss at having them end together with the fact this kind of love only exists on screen.

Love this movie!!!!!,"I knew one minute into this film when they spoke of my favorite book, 'A Moveable Feast' by Ernest Hemingway, that this movie was going to be something special...and I was NOT disappointed!!!Owen Wilson plays Gil Pender, an aspirating novelist vacationing in Paris with his shallow fiancée (Rachel McAdams). He has a romantic side that yearns to walk through the Parisian boulevards in the rain ~ which she totally dismisses as 'boring'. This leads him to wander the streets at night by himself...which is when all the magic happens!Gil is transported by an 'old' Peugeot to 1920's Paris each evening ~ where he encounters the likes of everyone from Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, to Gertrude Stein, to Hemingway himself! It was so much fun to see what historical figure would appear next ~ and sharing Gil's joy in meeting everyone from Pablo Picasso to T.S Eliot!I was certain that Woody Allen's movie 'Zelig' was my all-time favorite film of his...but if so, 'Midnight in Paris' certainly runs a very CLOSE second!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
"Woody Allen defining ""Art"" and ""Artist"" taking you back to the ""Golden Era"" of Paris","Escaping his life as a successful and under-demand Hollywood screenwriter, Gil Pender (Owen Wilson) travels with his fiancé Inez (Rachel McAdams) to Paris trying to write a novel and make a real contribution to art, only to find himself going back a 100 years of time, to be surrounded by the artists of the ""Golden Era"".In his 41st movie, director and screenwriter Woody Allen leaves his most common two topics (love and death) aside, to discuss the art and the definition of the artist. And in order to achieve his purpose and deliver his idea, he uses, as usual, a stars-full and perfectly selected cast, from Adrien Brody playing Salvador Dali, to Kathy Bates playing Gertrude Stein.The costumes and decoration was chosen very properly to go along with the setting, which is Paris at the 20's. The Soundtrack was also chosen the same way, with an elegant mixture of classic Cole Porter and Sydney Bechet. But my favorite part was the Oscar-winning screenplay that succeeded to present a huge amount of valuable ideas using nothing more than a smooth, down to earth, day-to-day chats between very well-drawn characters.In total, Midnight in Paris is one of Allen's best movies, mixing all sorts of art in a smooth enjoyable way.

"Enlightening, beautiful and funny....all at the same time","Something very surprising about Woody Allen films is that you never even know when they're released......let alone even know he's directing them. The past three Woody Allen movies i have seen have all been great, and it strikes me as odd to see that his movies are not highly publicized. I mean, the guy has been directing movies for almost 30 years now. You would figure that his movies would be everywhere.Once again, Woody Allen has impressed the hell out of me. He does such an amazing job of taking something so simplistic, and making it beautiful and extraordinary. The main character Gil, played by Owen Wilson (who i normally hate, but actually liked in this movie), is a struggling writer who walks the streets of Paris at night, and is somehow thrown back in time each night and has chance encounters with some of the most notable artist and writers of that time period. I know it may sound somewhat bazaar, but Allen sells it in the most entertaining fashion.Confronting Dali, Hemmingway, Picaso, Scott Fitzgerald, T.S. Elliot.....these are all people who appreciate the arts dream of conversing with. Allen knows this, and creates this romantic yet humorous cloud around each of these chance encounters. If you have any appreciation for the arts or fine literature, you will love the set-up of this movie.As far as acting, it's pretty damn good. I know earlier i said how i normally hate Owen Wilson but i loved him this picture. But the real bread winner in this movie is Marion Cotillard. In the past, Woody has always done a fine job of making his lead female 'oh so' very seductive and erotic. The writing for her character is there......but Marion took it and did something truly incredible with it. Every frame she was in made my mouth fall flat to the floor. The way she spoke and the way she evoked emotion with her eyes......it was almost too much for me to handle. Im my opinion, she is the front runner for best actress so far this year.Bottom Line.....it was a very enjoyable piece of work. One of the best i have seen so far this year. Since this movie wasn't heavily publicized, it felt like discovering a little gem that not everyone knows about, and it makes it a little more fun. And in the long run, i think that's why Woody doesn't go for the main stream theater.....he goes for the romance of watching a movie. And this movie definitely proves that point.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
MIDNIGHT IN Paris-A Valentine to the City of Lights,"One of the most productive and sought after directors (by actors), Woody Allen, has made dozens of films that deal with the often turbulent relationships between men and women. Almost exclusively a New Yorker by heart, Allen has begun a renaissance of sorts with his exploration of European settings in particular Paris, France, and although his films of the past decade have varied in quality, his latest, Midnight in Paris, is a standout and represents the writer/director at the top of his game.Opening with a spectacular collage of vignettes, Paris never looked more enticing or romantic (Manhattan redux). At the fabled Giverny, Monet's source of inspiration, an American couple, Gil (Owen Wilson) and Inez (Rachel McAdams) are engaged to be married and yet squabble constantly. An idealist, He is smitten by the culture and history of Paris, and one night while strolling the streets alone, a vintage car drives by and gives him a ride to a café. Gil realizes that he has been transported to 1920's Paris and is mingling with the celebrities of its heyday including some famous American ex-patriots like Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, and F. Scott Fitzgerald. Gil is struggling with a novel and needs some advice, so who better than Gertrude Stein (amusingly played by Kathy Bates) to critique the manuscript? Upon his return to present day Paris, Gil wonders if it was all a dream but the scene repeats itself the next evening at midnight when he meets Pablo Picasso and the beautiful Adriana (Marion Cotillard), who captures Gil's fancy. Thinking that Gil has lost his mind, Inez begins to show interest in another male friend. Meanwhile Gil is obsessed with Adriana, and as the couple visits the Moulin Rouge, they find themselves transported to an even earlier, romantic period in French history. Gil finds that Adriana has her own ideas about life, and he is about to find true love in the unlikeliest of places.This is Allen in high gear and, though it does not necessarily rank among his best, it certainly is a throwback to his vintage period of Manhattan and the film that this will be most compared to The Purple Rose of Cairo, with its similar combination of wistful fantasy, storybook romance, and sophisticated comedy. You do wonder how Gil and Inez could ever become a couple considering how much they bicker about most everything. It's also interesting how Allen uses a bit of sleight of hand by focusing our attention on Gil and Adriana that we miss an obvious connection. Such is love.Gil is a surrogate for Allen's inner voice. (One could even picture a younger Allen actually performing the role.) He is also a romantic in contrast to Inez's friends who are intellectuals. As for Paris, it plays a supporting role as its landmarks are adoringly featured throughout the film without detracting from the characters or story. It is clear Allen is smitten with the City of Lights as he was with his home base of New York City.There are some amusing scenes including the fate of a private investigator hired to follow Gil and ends up caught up in a different time running for his life. When Gil listens to old Cole Porter recordings or sees Picasso paintings in a museum, the joke is that he actually has met these men in real life! In another scene, Gil suggests to a young director, Luis Bunuel, a film idea which is the plot to The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie that he will make many years later (and win an Oscar). As Salvador Dali, Adrien Brody hams it up to great effect in a brief scene.Sure Allen has made some good films recently like Match Point and Vicky Cristina Barcelona, but it's been a long while since he made anything as imaginative, comedic, and romantic at the same time. Vive le Woody Allen!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Love outflanks Nostalgia,"This was a movie both frivolous and serious – a profound fantasy. You might say a typical Woody Allen movie, but this one is one of his better attempts at serio-romantic comedy. Gil (Owen Wilson) is a Woody Allen avatar as he explores two themes, nostalgia and the meaning of love. Gil, a Hollywood screen writer who hankers to be a novelist is engaged to Inez (Rachel McAdam) but when they go to Paris with her parents Gil starts having doubts, fuelled by contact with various famous literary figures of Paris in the 20's who magically appear to Gil as he walks the streets after midnight. F Scott Fitzgerald and Zelda (Tom Hiddleston and Alison Pill), Ernest Hemingway (Corey Stoll), Cole Porter (Yves Heck), Gertrude Stein (Kathy Bates) and numerous others all put in an appearance, most of them surprisingly ready to help Gil with his novel and his love life.Obviously you have to suspend your disbelief here – but the portrayals of these figures by various actors, though uneven, mostly ring true. Gil may well have been dreaming but he finds that the ""golden age"" of Paris in the twenties is not necessarily better than today – ""nostalgia ain't what it used to be"", and that love is what conquers death.Owen Wilson fits the Woody character like a glove, though Woody is not really a Hollywood hack writer. He is complemented by Marion Cotillard as Adriana, his guide through the twenties, from whom he learns about love.There is a lot of fun along the way, and some minor characters to keep us entertained such as Paul (Michael Sheen) a know-all friend of the couple and a celebrity museum guide (Carla Bruni – President Sarkozy's spouse). Paris is also a character, photogenic, and presented in strong light for the day bits and warm yellow tones after dark. The film will certainly not discourage tourism there, at least at the deluxe end of the market – the hotels are 5 star and limos are everywhere. The scripts sparkles - Woody seeks to entertain as well as philosophise - and here he succeeds at both.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
empty deepness,"Maybe because it is one of the most recent narrative creating devices, cinema is probably the most powerful we've ever invented. Certainly the one that still flashes in people's minds more easily these days. We know storytelling is probably as old as language, and language in our very peculiar human sense is as old as Humans themselves. Some filmmakers, out of the blue, constantly remind us how still little explored are the narrative power of cinema as a medium. Méliès, Welles, Kurosawa, Hitchcock, Kar Wai, Park, Tarkovsky and a handful of others, each gave us invaluable break-throughs, new ways to tell things, new forms to feel. But few have questions the limits of narrative as the structured soul of a film as Woody. Many accuse him of repeating himself. Always the same pseudo-intellectual characters, babbling empty people with trifle lives, nothing serious to say or do. Broken marriages, adultery, and so on. That's all true because those are the superficial elements on which Woody builds most of his films. But in everyone of them, he tries something he hasn't tried before, sometimes repeating some other filmmakers experiences, other times trying stuff no one has ever tried before. He misses some chances, he hits a few more, but i know he always tries. And for that reason i'll always want to see his films, made or to be made.Here he makes something that superficially resembles his celebrated Purple Rose of Cairo. But this is quite a different breed. What he tries is a highly complex experience in parallel inter-related worlds. Parallel realities where where (or when!) what happens in one, affects the other. The film begins in a recognizable present, establishes itself on other fantasy level, and finds its resolution in yet another deeper layer. Each layer is nested on the previous one, all of them rooted in Paris, and its clichés for each moment. Same space, same character, different dynamics of it. A solid triangular structure, where the same typical Allen elements find a new place to breath.In the way we find Marion Cotillard, whom we have seen in Inception, a similarly structured film about finding realities buried deep in the previous level, there mapped into dreams, and who knows, maybe here this is all mapped into the dreams of Owen's character. Inception also rooted the whole thing in Paris, one of the most filmed places ever, and one of those whose clichés are more built by films. And there also, Marion was the invented subconscious lover, who's very existence as a character was questionable.By now, its a perfectly assumed and natural thing that every film is in one way or another a blink of eye to the audiences via the reference to other films or to cinema in general. The french new wavers introduced that in film vocabulary as a common practice, so natural that you almost can't live without it today. Woody starts here with a character who Is a film writer trying to move into literature fiction. He goes to Paris, he gives us an initial montage of Paris and its recognizable places, less vigorous but much in the way of the initial sequence in Manhattan. And he places his layers, his ""golden ages"" in similarly cinematic moments in time. The intellectuals and artist celebrities are there more than anything to color the human landscape, although the joke on Buñuel's film is great.If you need to find another self-referential ""meaning"" to all this, than i suppose woody himself observes his new-york high empty class of intellectuals and sees it as he puts Sheen's character here: full of words but ultimately empty, boring, and utterly uninteresting. It's as if he had lived all his life trying to move up (or down) to his personal golden age, he the nostalgic for the new orleans big bands (which he uses in the initial soundtrack). You can go there and explore it like that. I like to contemplate the structure.Among the people i went to see this with, there was some discussion about why the main poster would reference Van Gogh without him even showing up in the film. I would say, maybe in a superficial way, that Van Gogh had similar aspirations to most of his paintings than Woody had for this film: painting what he saw, and layering on it a distorted vision of it, many times tormented, but always rooted in some inexistent world. In doing so he gave us transcendental figurative art (in his case fueled by absinthe and his own madness). Colors were Vincent's narrative tools. Narrative structure itself is Woody's very fabric for his films.My opinion: 3/5 another tile in woody's mosaic. What's next?",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

Owen Wilson plays Woody Allen in a total repudiation of Allen's 1990s movies,"""Midnight in Paris"" confirms what I've always thought: Woody Allen's best movies are the ones in which he goes straight for comedy. With Owen Wilson as a neurotic writer on vacation in the French capital and traveling back to the 1920s to meet the American writers who lived there at the time, it's one of Allen's cleverest movies. I felt like I was never going to forgive him after he made the über-atrocious ""Everyone Says I Love You"" (about which there was NOTHING to love), but his movies got better after that (I especially liked ""The Curse of the Jade Scorpion"" and ""Scoop""). But this one is the cream of the crop. Allen definitely needs to make more of these. I'd also like to see him make another sci-fi flick like ""Sleeper"". Maybe even his very own slasher flick (he would presumably play a neurotic guy who rambles about intellectualism while butchering depraved teens).Anyway, this is a really good movie.

It delivered what it promised - a romantic, comedy, fantasy film.Casting Owen Wilson as the lead role threw me off at first, but he definitely rose to the challenge. This has always been (I believe) one of Allen's greatest gifts - that is, as an actor's director. He seems to be able to bring out the best in them.The only setback for some watching this film may be the various real life characters that Gil Pender (Owen Wilson) runs into who were supposedly hanging out in Paris during the 20's. Though this does not distract at all from the feel and flow of the film, some of the subtler humour may be missed.For me, this is not a Annie Hall or a Manhattan, but it definitely hints at much of Allen's spirit and wit I've come to love.The film went on to win both the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay and the Golden Globe Awards for Best Screenplay; and was nominated for three other Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Art Direction",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

The lady herself had lived most of her life in Paris; her father George introduced Christiane to cafe society in 1946 at the tender age of 6 years....her father particularly asked her to remember Jean Cocteau: I think this is why I am so endeared to this film -the French way of life that conjured magic and freedom?'Midnight in Paris' is a film very much full of fun and nostalgia - Owen Wilson's character is enchanted to the magic that will follow him....the present to the past is very surreal: The film itself is beautiful; present in portrayal of pictures, paintings - and thoughts - and writing, of course...the passion of life and love ...hope you enjoy the film -it is a merry carousel in the funfair of life?Some critics may abhor this style of past reflection that is compressed into fun -without the reality of struggles to succeed in life....but after all, this is a film that is remarkable in magic -and should be dedicated to Parisian lovers.Ha! I am happy to have deleted my original review, to have now revised in truthful inspiration of what I had originally found difficult to express in the first place?Again, one of my favourite films....

Great Woody Allen Picture,"I don't love Owen Wilson, but I think this role gets every good quality out of him possible, and his charm really drives the film forward. Midnight is the perfect Woody pic because it has lightness, comedy, human neurosis, philosophical drivel, and hatred for the same philosophical drivel, all wrapped up together. I love the more Apatow sort of comedies that dominate today, but this was a more classic and thought-provoking sort of film that I think raises the standard and refreshes the palette. I think it is great when a comedy can be nominated for best picture, and this one certainly deserves to be this year. Go see it for date night, and if you are with the right sort of woman when you do, you should marry her.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Awful!,"My God! 8.0?!! An average score of 8.0??!!! I often wonder how poor movies gain rave reviews. Yes, this is a very poor movie... with a good cast. After 20 minutes waiting for the film to start, in came the magical nonsense and the film bimbled around the 5/6 mark til it finished, not quickly enough.I guess it was slightly redeemed by decent enough cinematography but it would have taken a miracle for it to reach 8.0. I was expecting a good movie and went to bed wishing I'd have seen one.I can only surmise that the first reviews of movies like this are written by the film's PR company or paid entourage and the remainder blindly follow suit. If you want to see a good movie, skip this one.My 14 yo daughter went to bed after 15 minutes, bored senseless, yet we sat it out expecting it to eventually dazzle.

A Nutshell Review: Midnight in Paris,"I have to confess I've only picked up on Woody Allen's work faithfully from Match Point onwards, just about the time he was getting out of his New York comfort zone and putting his stories into his European sojourn, except that distributors here didn't quite buy into meeting a tall dark stranger. But no fret since Midnight in Paris captures everything superficially wonderful about the city of lights, in an opening montage that brings us to almost every piece of tourist attraction on offer, before deep diving into one of the best Woody Allen offerings in recent years.It's a romantic comedy of sorts, the kind that Allen excels in creating, and we join the couple Inez (Rachel McAdams) and Gil played by Owen Wilson, the latter whose writer character would have been played by Wooden Allen himself being Woody Allen in a film once upon a time, talky and full of wit. In Paris on the graces of Inez's parents John (Kurt Fuller) and Helen (Mimi Kennedy), what would have been an awesome period of time spent in the romantic city was quickly ruined by the arrival of Inez's friends Paul (Michael Sheen) and Carol (Nina Arianda), especially since it's so obvious that Inez holds a candle to Paul's intellect, at the expense of almost always putting down Gil, who feels threatened by the presence of another man in her life, one who seem to be able to capture the imagination and attention of his girlfriend.Departing from the group who decided to go dancing, Gil's drunken trek around the streets of Paris at night inexplicably led him to the 20s, where he encounters many literary and artistic greats, such as F Scott Fitzgerald (Tom Hiddleston) and Zelda Fitzgerald (Alison Pill), Ernest Hemingway (Corey Stoll) and in multiple midnight strolls waiting for that antiqued car to come pick him up, other personalities which give rise to plenty of casting cameos, such as Josephine Baker (Sonia Rolland), Juan Belmonte (Daniel Lundh), Gertrude Stein (Kathy Bates) whom he had read his draft manuscript for his next novel, Salvador Dali (Adrien Brody), Pablo Picasso (Marcial Di Fonzo Bo) and his muse of the moment, the lovely Adriana (Marion Cotillard), with whom Gil forms a strong bond with, and in a way puts him off course from his own girlfriend.It's quite clear that this is a tale about chances, and of people who don't know they are currently unhappy with their love lives, and are seeking an outlet of some sorts for emotional release. It's about people who subconsciously can't stand their present and want to escape from it, and what more than to enter a period of nostalgia, and fantasize about being one amongst our idols and heroes. In this case, cracks between Gil and Inez are quite pronounced, with the mounting tension and suspicion brought on by the presence of Paul, especially when comparisons begin and the crystal clarity in their differences in temperament and character, which if not for Gil's success in his career raking both fame and fortune, would have been doomed from the start, if it ever took off in the first place. Gil enters this zone of bliss to be amongst those he aspires to be one day. And with Adriana, a romantic rendezvous each night proves to be quite a pull factor.Owen Wilson becomes almost like a Woody Allen avatar in the way his mannerisms in the film pick up from the usual characters that Allen plays, while yet possessing enough of the Wilson persona's cheekiness, especially in the final third of the film where he discovers Adriana's journal in the present day, and looked for clues as to how a potential relationship between him and her could have developed. Marion Cottilard of course scores as the damsel who's tired of the kind of treatment from men like Picasso and even Hemingway, and like Paul, epitomizes that similar down and out feeling that creates similar zones into which to escape to, bringing together some fantastic, science fiction like moments in this story that will thrill any writer or avid reader when the ensemble cast take on roles of famous people from the past.Allen's truly back to form here with a story that's brilliantly written, with fine dialogue and structure, and bringing out the best of mimicry from his cast of many, starting from having Owen Wilson talk and walk very much like his persona, if not himself, being the central mouthpiece in this film. And look out for Carla Bruni too in quite a major supporting role as the Museum Guide to whom Gil goes to for a little help with some French translation. Highly recommended!",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Exquisite,"Just watched "" Midnight in Paris "" . Honestly and surprisingly too , I have never watched any of Allen's movies before and i don't know how i lost all my freaking last years without hitting any of his movies . The opening shots of the movie that depicting the city of lights were very splendid. The camera within few seconds was creatively able to get you there instantly . Clouds , uniquely beautiful streets , alleys , french architecture , boulevards , rains and everything . Allen took Paris into its era of glory and magic .The well-written screenplay was a vivid of fantasy and romance like a fascinating dream you don't wanna wake up from . And it could list Allen as one of the greatest screenwriters all the time without any doubts . Life is so sophisticated and humans beings are more and more , that's one of the movie messages that Woody focused to convey to viewers and he did . Let's not forget the soundtracks which were such classical and unique .And here's the element which worth the most flattering , the casting choice . I talk here in particular about Owen Wilson as Gil and Marion cotillard as lovely Adriana . This couple played an exceptional remarkable role . Owen was hilariously convincing even though the Gil character was very complicated, he did a great job indeed . I'm so lucky i have loads of Allen's movies unwatched to keep them as a treasure and check just one movie per year .",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Funny and brilliant are just a couple words to describe this Woody Allen cinematic treasure,"Woody Allen is really one of those film guys that you either leave or take, hate or like. And, Midnight in Paris follows that exact same proposed formula. Here's a romantic-comedy that questions love and belonging with a bit of fantasy involved.Both written and directed by Woody Allen, this is a film that really engages his ideas and thoughts. We see some political talk, some romantic babble, and philosophical reasoning for belonging.I haven't seen much of any Woody Allen films (which will change!) so it's hard for me to do a comparison. But, I have seen selected clips, heard about the guy, and kind of familiar with his work. With that being said, I'm sure that Owen Wilson will remind viewers of Wood Allen to some sort of degree; I'm unsure how extreme it truly is.The comedy aspect of this film truly comes from the character development and interactions of Owen Wilson's character, Gil. Wilson fans and even those non-Wilson fans alike should enjoy. I hope.Perhaps the only problem I had with this film was the question of how Owen Wilson's character, Gil, travels in time. At first it seems to be a hallucination. But, if that's the only problem you have, just ignore it and take it for what it is.This feature is an English major's dream, especially those concentrating on American Lit.Although successful, Hollywood hack writer Gil (Owen Wilson) is on a vacation with his lovely fiancé Inez (Rachel McAdams) and her parents (Kurt Fuller and Mimi Kennedy). Before we see them, a wonderful opening montage scene of Paris, France is shown to the audience. It was quite pleasant right after the opening credits. It really set the tone for the movie. Beautiful scenery and music. We then hear Gil's voice accentuating the praise for Paris by quoting something regarding how the 1920s and the rain really bring up it's beauty. Inez is not pleased.Side note: Gil kind of reminded me of a more reserved Hank Moody (David Duchovny) from Showtime's Californication.We see from the very start of the film that Inez and Gil seem to be deeply in love, but perhaps Gil loves something else entirely: Paris. Inez plans on living the American Dream in Malibu, California with hopes that Gil will continue to be a successful Hollywood screenwriter. Gil disapproves of this and dreams of settling down in Paris to write his books.****This is where the spoilers may start, so continue at your own risk.***Gil and Inez go out to a wine tasting with Inez's friends, Paul (Michael Sheen) and Carol (Nina Arianda). To Gil's dismay and Inez's pleasure, Paul invites them to go dancing for the evening. While Inez accepts, Gil denies, and the two split off for the rest of the night. It's obvious that Gil is frustrated by Paul's inaccurate knowledge of Paris. Gil decides to head back to the hotel, but eventually finds himself lost in an alley. Then, an old looking vehicle of some kind pulls up and insists that he joins them. He then meets those that he deems to be idols like, Ernest Hemingway (Corey Stoll), Cole Porter (Yves Heck), Joesphine Barker (Sonia Rolland), F. Scott Fitzgerald (Tom Hiddleston), Zelda Fitzgerald (Alison Pill), and later on Gertrude Stein (Kathy Bates), Pablo Picasso (Marcial Di Fonzo Bo), and Picasso's mistress Adriana (Marion Cotillard)(more on her later). You can see why an American Lit enthusiast would be overly joyous. All the aforementioned actors did a great job, with the chief mention going to Bate's portrayal of Stein. You'll see many other '1920ers' in the film too and perhaps even some famous individuals from an even earlier time.Then one night, with such exuberant excitement and by the reluctance of his fiancé, Gil urges her to join him the next time he goes ""back in time"" in the alley. Gil has told Inez that he has been inspired by late night walks around Paris. Inez leaves before the bells strike midnight and Inez's frustration is fueled even further. Her conservative parents are also annoyed by Gil.Gil continues to ride the old '20s vehicle every night and finds his current novel is well liked during that time. It treats him like a drug.Perhaps Gil found love in someone other than his fiancé and Paris. Adriana and Gil have an ongoing conversation throughout the film about how each of them wishes to live in a ""simpler time."" Being the 1920s for Gil and the late-1800s for Adriana. They come to the conclusion that nobody will ever be able to live in a time before their own. At this point in the movie I could sympathize with the main message of Woody Allen, since I too would want to have grown up in the 1980s or possibly 1990s. A time when jobs were flourishing and the radio was acceptable and when people didn't text during a personal oral conversation. I really enjoyed this message of mystery brings enlightenment by Allen.At the end of the film we see Gil walk off with a street market vendor he met earlier, Gabrielle (Léa Seydoux). They walk off in the rain and seem to spark a relationship.Woody Allen did an all-around phenomenal job with this film. I'm glad to see that he's still got it.I highly recommend you take your significant other to go and see it. Have an open-mind and enjoy some great cinema.9/10 Stars.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
A broken down one trick pony that should have been taken out the back and shot,"In Annie Hall 40 years ago, Woody Allen constructs a scene in which he and Dianne Keaton are standing in line for a movie listening to an obnoxious idiot in front of them discussing media guru Marshall Mcluhan. Woody's character can't resist himself and confronts the idiot trying to put him right on Mcluhan's view. The argument escalates. Woody settles the argument by dragging Mcluhan into the scene from off camera and having Mcluhan finish the argument and put the idiot in his place. Woody steps up to the camera and says, ""boy, if life were only like this."" It's one of the most memorable scenes in the film.Fortunately, in Annie Hall, the film moves on from that one trick, amusing and entertaining through it was.In Midnight in Paris, a variation of the trick is resurrected, the trick is performed, but the movie doesn't move on once the trick is over.20 minutes or so into the film, Owen Wilson's character, Gil, is out for a midnight stroll and eventually finds himself meeting F. Scott Fitzgerald in a club. Yes, amusing and an interesting premise. But ... that's it. That's pretty much the entire film. Owen going for midnight strolls in Paris and meeting famous characters from the 1920s and other eras. The Fitzgeralds, Hemingway, Picasso, Dali, and on and on an on ad infinitum. If they were famous and in Paris back in the 1920s, you'll find them recreated in this film.But that's it. Sure, they inevitably help a little in resolving his feelings about his fiancé. And Gertrude Stein makes a few useful suggestions as to how Gil can improve his novel. But the entire film is a one-trick pony thats done its single trick long before the first 30 minutes are up and then spends the next hour just repeating the trick. I spent the next hour wondering what the point of the final hour actually was.The whole thing could have been done in a 30 minute episode of the Twilight Zone and saved us a very painful evening. My wife gave up and read a book after 45 minutes. I should have done the same and saved myself the agony of watching the final 10 minutes. Without giving away the plot, let's just say the ending deteriorates into the kind of story line with the love interest that I would have expected one of my 10 year old students to have come up with.What a stinker.",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

Bring in the heavyweights please.Even an older cast would have worked too!but of course the studios would never allow that.Lovely film but...the story was contrived at parts,though there was a gem of a good idea in there.For me,not woody allens best work.but a couple of nice observations into human character traits and flaws in parts towards the end.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
One of My Favorite Movies,"Midnight in Paris has been one of my favorite films for a long time. It is a beautiful, thoughtful and artistic movie with a lot of fantasy, humor and irony. It impressed me and made me think about life in a very different way than any other movies have before because this movie taught me the importance of the present. It is even difficult to describe all the emotions I had after watching it.In this movie directed by Woody Allen, Owen Wilson plays the role of Gil Pender who is an American screenwriter who travels to Paris with his fiancée and her family. Wilson is amazing in the role of the nostalgic and romantic writer who is longing for living in a different era and tries to write a novel. One night, as Gil is walking around on the streets of Paris, he finds himself on a magical journey back to the 1920s which is his favorite historical time. From this time on, he goes back to the 1920s every night at midnight. He meets Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, Picasso, Hemingway, Dali, Gertrude Stein and many more famous artists that he loves and idolizes. The artists are all played by amazing actors such as Adrien Brody and Kathy Bates. Gil Pender also meets a beautiful lady, Adriana, and they start to have romantic feelings for each other. However he realizes that he cannot live in the past anymore and should embrace and accept the time he lives in. I think this movie is on the fine line between a romantic comedy and an art film with a beauty of color that we can see in most of Woody Allen's movies.I would recommend Midnight in Paris to people who would like to see a peculiar movie with a fantasy world that takes us back to the past. It is very interesting to imagine and see how the most famous artists lived their everyday lives, but it is also important to have some background knowledge to fully understand and appreciate this movie. It is definitely not for everyone and may be even boring for people without enough background information. However, by the end of this movie I think we can better appreciate our present and see how important it is to stay more realistic and work for our goals in our everyday life.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Everything seems better in the old times,"There was a time when Woody Allen was just as closely related to New York as Aki Kaurismäki was to Helsinki. ""Midnight in Paris (2011) is the first film I saw from him that is situated in another city, but there were earlier films such as ""Match Point"" (2005, London) and ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" (2008). The city often plays an important role in an Allen film and so he takes his time to introduce it. Think of the marvellous introduction of New York in ""Manhattan"" (1979). In ""Midnight in Paris"" Allen also takes his time to introduce Paris, but instead of introducing a living city (like the intro of ""Manhattan"") this time its the view of an American tourist with a sort of sequence of postcards. The meaning of this becomes clear very quickly.""Midnight in Paris"" is a film with two themes: relationship issues and particularly time travel.Let's begin with the first theme. Gil (Owen Wilson) is a successful screenwriter who dreams of writing a novel. He is prepared to sacrifice some earnings for this. His fiancee Inez (Rachel McAdams), dreaming from a life in a luxurious suburb, however disagrees. Visiting Paris Inez is mainly interested in shopping and doing the ""obliged"" cultural bucketlist. With this bucketlist she is supported by her former classmate Paul (Michael Sheen), an arrogant know-it-all who (as Wikipedia puts it mildly) ""speaks with great authority but questionable accuracy"". Gil on the other hand is more interest in discovering the essence of Paris. Very early on it is clear to the viewer that this relationship is doomed, even before the couple gets married.The most important theme of the film is however time travel. The vehicle used for time travelling is a car and this reminds us of ""Back to the future"" (1985, Robert Zemeckis). In ""Midnight to Paris"" the appearance of the car is however taken from the era of arrival and not from the era of departure. There also isn't a professor who has invented the car. It's just there, leaving open the possibility of dreaming on the side of Gil.The era of arrival is Paris during the roaring twenties. The film continues with an impressive ""Who is Who"" during this era. I happened to have read the novel ""A moveable feast"" (1964, Ernest Hemingway) and this turned out to be a great help during this part of the film.The real message of the time travelling theme is however that nostalgia is something of all times. While Gil is enjoying the roaring twenties some of its inhabitants would prefer to be in the ""belle epoque"" (approximately 1875). Everything seems better in the old times. In reality it is more useful to put your energy in improving the current times. That's exactly what Gil does at the end of the film, at least regarding his own relationship.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
A film as beautiful as Paris,"""The artist's job is not to succumb to despair but to find an antidote for the emptiness of existence.""Woody Allen does exactly that with this film, he made this cinematic masterpiece an 'antidote for the emptiness of existence'. Other than the cinematography of this masterpiece, the emotions of the characters portrayed by the actors are also sensational, the juxtaposed rawness of the lines delivered in certain scenes are riveting. Each character portrays beguiling and captivating aura which sets them apart but also acts as a link of connection throughout the film.The film is a well put together exercise in the pleasures and pitfalls of nostalgia being both whimsical and melancholic.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Midnight in Paris (2011),"Midnight in Paris had so much hoopla surrounding it, that I was wary of approaching it. As someone that enjoys writing myself, the story of a writer could easily connect with me, or it could have annoyed me. Luckily it did the former. Wilson plays a Hollywood screenwriter that wants to work on his novel while in Paris. Unfortunately, and I never thought I'd say this, he is engaged to Rachel McAdams. She has become comfortable with his lifestyle, and doesn't want him to give everything up for something he may struggle with. WHile in Paris they meet up with Michael Sheen, playing a pedantic ass to perfection. I just wanted to cave his head in, and Wilson played off him exactly the way I would have done. Sheen's so called knowledge is the sauce of humour during the early half of the movie, as he gets his facts mixed up. Wilson soon winds up in the 1920's and meets his own literary heroes. Finally feeling appreciated, he spends every evening with his new found friends. This is certainly a film about writing, art, creativity, and being accepted. But it also goes further, looking at how all past is glamorised to a certain degree. This was a lovely film, with my only gripe being McAdams' character. She was simply so unappealing, that I had no idea as to why herself and Wilson were together. There was no chemistry, and not even a hint at anything resembling love. Luckily, such a poor relationship made it easier to accept some of Wilsons' actions. A great lot of co-starring roles are filled out by A-Listers having a lot of fun as classic artists from the past. Midnight in Paris, really is for those that love to walk in the rain.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Perhaps Woody's Finest,"I just saw this wonderful film in the perfect place, Montparnasse in Paris. It was showing at the Lucernaire at 53 rue Notre Dame des Champs, that cosy and quaint cineplex with its own café and theatres. Afterwards, my wife and I strolled up to the Dome and sat on the pavement (as it was summer), looking across at the Rotonde and sipping vermouth cassis, the favourite drink of the old Montparnassians of the 1920s. Then we walked back past the apartment of Gertrude Stein on rue de Fleurus, and Hemingway's last Paris apartment on Rue Ferou, as well as Man Ray's studio in the same little street (though they did not live there at the same time). All three of these people appear in the film. Kathy Bates is sensational as Gertie, and sits beneath her own portrait by Picasso, in a salon just like in the old photos of it. The film is full of cultural in jokes which those unfamiliar with the period will not get, and period details. For instance, Hemingway says he likes Picasso's work 'but he is no Miro'. Woody must have studied Hemingway's A MOVEABLE FEAST very closely and knew that the only major painting Hemingway was able to afford in Paris was 'The Farm' by Joan Miro, the painter whom he admired above all others. At one point the lead actor Owen Wilson is told he has just been dancing with Djuna Barnes, and he wisecracks 'No wonder she wanted to lead.' Only those aware of who Djuna Barnes was and of her inclinations would get the joke. The story features a young American, played brilliantly by Owen Wilson, who takes the place of Woody, who is now too old to play his own lead character, who visits Paris in modern times. He is accompanied by the fiancée from hell, played hellishly by Rachel McAdams with such fervour that one wants to strangle her as well as her horrible parents. Wilson is a writer and a dreamer who begins to go on late walks around Paris, with which he becomes infatuated. He goes to a certain magic place where at the stroke of midnight (hence the film's title), an old car drives up and he is urged to get in. This car transports him back into the golden age of the Montparnasse Era. He meets Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, Cole Porter, Josephine Baker, and many of the other leading cultural figures who were there at the time. As my wife said, 'it is a ridiculous idea but it works because it comes from the heart'. Rarely has Woody risked any filmic device quite so hazardous as this. The fact that he successfully pulls off this outrageous idea is a testament to his skill as a filmmaker. He both wrote and directed this film, which clearly means a great deal to him. (He also must have played the clarinet in that wonderful jazz at the beginning and end of the film soundtrack, though he modestly kept his name off the credits.) My wife and I thought we recognised the magic place where the car picked Owen Wilson up every night, so the next evening we strolled over there to confirm our suspicions, and we were correct. It is the charming little street called rue de la Montagne Saint Genevieve, in the 5th arrondissement, near the Pantheon, and on the right (which you cannot make out in the film) is my favourite little classical music CD shop, La Dame Blanche. The steps on which Owen Wilson sits are those of the side entrance to the Church of Saint Genevieve, which in the middle ages was the Church of Saint Stephen but changed its name. No magic car appeared to pick us up, but then we were there before midnight and hence too early for it. The only one of the 1920s characters in the film whom I ever met personally was Salvador Dali, and I would say that Adrien Brody captures him and his outrageous mannerisms to perfection, even though I only knew Dali four decades later. Corey Stoll does a superb job as Hemingway, Tom Hiddleston and Alison Pill are excellent as Scott and Zelda, Yves-Antoine Spoto looks exactly like Matisse, Marcial Di Fonzo Bo looks and behaves eerily like Picasso, and so on. But the whole film is suffused with the warm glow and delicious charm of the incomparable Marion Cotillard, who plays the fictitious character 'Adriana', with whom Owen Wilson falls in love. And one can understand why he cannot resist her! The other woman in his life is the delightful Parisian beauty Léa Seydoux, another in the seemingly endless stream of cinematic talent of the Seydoux family, which is responsible for such a large proportion of what happens in the French film business. Is there simply no end to them? They just keep coming, generation after generation, like the Gallimards in publishing. This film has profound messages for us, presented as usual in comedic form, but behind all the jokes we sense a very serious Woody this time who is really trying to communicate essential things to us. Owen and Cotillard magically go back to the turn of the century, the Belle Époque, and meet Degas, Gauguin, and an uncannily convincing Toulouse-Lautrec (Vincent Menjou Cortes). Cotillard decides to stay behind, as to her this is her 'golden age', just as the 1920s is Owen's. They discover that Degas and Gauguin believe the Renaissance was a golden age, and they wish to go back to it. The message is that everyone imagines a different golden age depending on when they live, but we must learn to make the best of our own. The film is funny, heart-warming, deeply satisfying, and a wonderful evocation of the dreams we all have of seeking for fulfillment, whether in the past, or in the present. This may be the finest film that Woody Allen has ever made.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Loved this film!,"I must say that I felt a bit out of my element. I don't know much about European authors/painters/etc! There were a lot of names I didn't recognize. But it made me want to learn about who they were. My partner(from UK) on the other hand wasn't familiar with Fitzgerald so that made me feel a bit better. I loved the cinematography! Paris is such a beautiful city and I feel much like Gil, I could live there & walk in the rain! It was very funny. Very entertaining. My family all loved it ages 16-60!

"""Isn't It Romantic?""","This film will appeal to individuals with a certain orientation and background. If you feel the term ""romantic"" applies in your case, you will likely enjoy this movie. And if you are steeped in the romance of the Jazz Age and Belle Epoque you will likely love it. I saw it around the time it came out and just now again. Watching it this time, I appreciated the fact that Mr. Allen cast another actor to be his protagonist. The persona he affected on the screen was limiting as the novelty wore off. Having someone else in the lead makes him much more an Everyman given the context. I found the other actors successful in their roles but, as the late Roger Ebert pointed out, Kathy Bates is especially outstanding as Gertrude Stein completely fulfilling my idea of what Stein must have been like.

"Oscar buzz, when Woody Allen plus talks of movies in movies is involved.","If you don't know some of the historic icons that deeply influenced art and literature of our decade like Pablo Picasso, Ernest Hemingway, Cole Porter, or Gertrude Stein. . . than it really doesn't matter. . . much. To be honest I have not heard of half the characters in the film, i'm not a literature junkie nor had i read any of their works in class, so it was a bit hard to follow Gil's state of astonishment when he met them. I do however love Woody Allen's films and this film is definitely worth seeing.I'm sure you've read the synopsis and the movie is so much more than that! I won't include spoilers, but a hint: after midnight is when the magic really starts happening. The film transports you to another time, specifically the 1920s in Paris, and it is amazing. I am dying to go to Paris after this movie because you really fall in love with the city. The film showcases the best parts of Paris with great acting from Owen Wilson, Marion Cotillard, and surprisingly Rachel McAdams. (I did not like McAdam's character in this movie but she did it nicely, a more annoying version of Regina from Mean Girls)The actors that played the Fitzgeralds were amazing, Alison Pill and Tom Hiddleston, though i don't know how they really acted but it was a good interpretation. After seeing the characters you really understand Gil's fascination to learn more from them and just hang out with them. This movie has been a great nostalgic learning experience and it's something that I highly recommend to every romantic out there.

"EVERYTHING CHANGES AFTER THE MIDNIGHT, especially in Paris ...","During their trip to Paris, Gil and his fiancée, Inez are passing through a crisis. They find out some faults in each other, which prevent them from spending this visit in the city of love in a romantic way. As a result, the couple use the charms of Paris separately and then discover that they have very different expectations and needs.In brand-new Woody Allen's romantic comedy, Midnight in Paris, the main character, unfulfilled writer Gil Pender (Owen Wilson) literally finds his place in the twenties. He is time traveling to his favorite epoch, where he meets new companion. Honest to the bone and impulsive Hemingway, Fitzgerald devoted to his crazy wife, Picasso's muse – Adrianna (Marion Cotillard), who of course turns Gil's head, and warmhearted Gertrude Stein (Kathy Bates) – his own reviewer, become an inspiration to his novel. Every midnight Pender abandons Inez (Rachel McAdams) and her sophisticated friends, so as to escape into the world of his dreams.While accompanying Gil in his night trips through the streets of Paris, the spectators can truly feel the atmosphere of the city with all senses. For instance, we admire the view of beautifully illuminated alleys and obviously breathtaking Eiffel Tower. Our ears are coddled with the French music of the 1920s. We can even smell the perfumes of elegant ladies, who enjoyed themselves at the same party as Gil did, or taste ""the diamond whiskey sour"" drunk by Hemingway in one of the bars.Once again Woody Allen says about love from another point of view. He notes that true love is when we are accepted as we are and have support in fulfillment of our dreams. The main idea of the movie is to show that pretending to be someone else and cheating ourselves won't make us happy. The key is being yourself and waiting for the person who will share our interests.I really recommend Midnight in Paris to anyone, who would appreciate an intense plot filled with a pinch of romance and also a little bit of adventure, which takes place in the romantic capital of Europe. I was delighted by the idea of putting such a beautiful message in a comedy with the elements of fantasy. What's more, for those who are fond of 1920s, the brand-new Allen's movie is a great opportunity to observe the profiles of the then artists, who were, in my opinion, perfectly played. By the way, applause for Adrien Brody as Salvador Dali!",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Welcome to the French Surrealism,"Human being has a nature that he can't satisfy himself at any condition. When a man think that there's something missing in his world than there's always an unexpected event waiting down for him to change his course of life.MIDNIGHT IN Paris is a simple story of a man named Gil(Owen Wilson) who thought that his Hollywood world is not that quiet exciting and not fulfilling his writer skills as he wanted to write novels. Than he gets the chance to go to Paris with his beautiful girlfriend(Rachel McAdams) and her family for a business trip. He always knew that Paris is the land of LOVE and ART but he felt that when he encountered that place. Beautiful views of streets, rivers, lamps, landmarks etc makes protagonist fall in love with Paris. He decides to stay here forever but not everyone feel good about that. His great love for Paris leads him to some beautiful illusions which in the end makes him realize that this is what he was missing in his life i.e. ART and LOVE.Allen's cinematographers never compromised to show how beautiful Paris is, every single view into the screen is in detailed form and showed with spectacular camera work. Especially the ending scene when Eiffel Tower was lightning beautifully.Whole screenplay is one the best part of the movie. Exciting Story-line helps to meet some of the beautiful characters who keeps us engaged till the end. Dialogues are good and written very well keeping a view of French-France in mind.As expected, all the performers are superb. From leading actor Wilson to supporting actor Adrien Brody all are superb. Special remarks for Marion Cotillard, she is looking so beautiful and stealing every second she is on the screen.First movie of the year which i felt is Technically natural. Filmed in old fashioned style which is refreshingly cool. U have never seen Paris that beautiful in any past Hollywood films. Movie takes place in my year's top 5. With Wonderful direction of the great Woody Allen and comical-adventurous journey of Paris this movie deserves 10/10.

"Midnight in Paris — Do what you love, love what you do, and work on it now","Midnight in Paris is a charming, surprising, and light movie. It's about being lost, then finding your way by magic and complete serendipity.I think this Woody Allen piece works because of the overt innocence of Owen Wilson's character. The fact that he is trampled by his controlling wife, played by Rachel McAdams, adds to his likability. His strange encounters are put together in a very simple manner with very little fanfare. The result is that we are transported without us breaking our suspension of disbelief. The fact that Paris is almost timeless also helps.The sets, costumes, score, and editing are just right. The well chosen cast also gives us a solid performance.Overall, there's very little negative to say, except maybe that the conclusion lacks a little bit of substance. It's simply that the transition when he finally understand is dropped on us very suddenly and he cuts off his ties quickly. It's very mature and realistic, in a way, but slightly unsatisfying. More over, the beginning of the film is a bit rough, but you get in to the beat quite rapidly.It's good, see it if you like low-key productions.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

Both have a similar output, upwards of 60+ movies.

A fantasy which sedated me with sensuousness..,"Who wouldn't love Paris! Who doesn't love fantasy! And if you are in love with both of them, Midnight in Paris would be the fantasy you would hate to come out of. And i too felt the same, I never wanted to come out of the dream I was in, i was sedated with sensuousness walking along with Owen Wilson through the streets of Paris, meeting eminent artists whom i always loved to meet, and finally getting someone whom i could walk in the rain with, talking about everything which I love about.Woody Allen was never my favorite until i saw ""Midnight in Paris"". Owen Wilson was cute - I really would like to see more of him in meaty roles like this rather than in silly romcoms, Marion Cotillard was sweet & gorgeous.

Woody Allen gives fans a true dose of nostalgia,"Nostalgia. Now that's a word not uncommon around a Woody Allen picture. His films have always oozed of it, and now that his filmmaking legacy spans more than 40 years, to some people, an Allen film equates to it. ""Midnight in Paris"" falls under both categories. Remarkably, only Woody has been able to riff on the same themes, characters, ideas, etc. for decades and manage to still churn out thoughtful, funny and heartwarming pictures (when making a comedy, of course, not one of his tragedies). Perhaps ""Midnight in Paris"" derives its warranted praise and acclaim merely for freshly emulating Allen's beloved past work. Call him a cheater if you like for simply whipping up a new modern context for the same shtick, but ""Midnight in Paris"" could charm a tweed jacket and thick-rimmed spectacles onto almost anyone.A breezy summer romance, ""Midnight in Paris"" hearkens back to Allen's work in the early-to- mid '80s with films such as ""Stardust Memories"" and ""The Purple Rose of Cairo."" His trademark ""intellectual"" dialogue functions in the capacity of what purpose it serves rather than a need to understand what it means, and with exception of main character Gil Pender (Owen Wilson), all the supporting cast members are role players in this fairy tale of sorts rather than complex multi-subplot characters.Gil Pender is your typical Allen-would've-played-him-had-this-been-30-years-ago protagonist, a screenwriter manufacturing soulless Hollywood material who hopes that his planned novel will benefit inspirationally from a city that has moved so many great artists before him — Paris. He travels with his fiancée, Inez (Rachel McAdams), who yearns to learn from Paris the more practical way and criticizes Gil's lack of sociability. While Inez spends her days learning Paris from uber-intellectual Paul (Michael Sheen), a caricature of Allen's most pretentious characters, Gil takes to the streets at night for an intangible inspiration. What he finds in Paris after midnight changes everything, including an alluring young French woman named Adriana (Marion Cotillard).The only character other than Gil to receive any attention is the city herself. Paris takes on this amorphous identity as defined by the characters who perceive it. For Gil, Paris is magic, and as such that's what it becomes for the viewer. As we later come to learn, a city's ability to cradle the history of its impermanent people and absorb their stories is what constructs its aura. This geographical timelessness evokes the emotions of those who seek inspiration from something greater than themselves.Without diving into the details of Gil's late-night adventures, Gil does learn something that challenges his desire to cling to nostalgia. The challenge of any great writer or artist is to capture and express the uncomfortable, troubling and intangible void that is the present. To keep things simple in making this point, the other characters serve to magnify Gil's journey to enlightenment. Even, Inez, who we expect more from considering McAdams' ability to turn fluff into substance, becomes a deplorable and one-sided character quite rapidly. But despite Inez being written so harshly, she does help convey the fairy tale feel of the film, which Allen clearly aimed for and struck the bullseye.There's definitely a sense that Allen purposefully sidestepped any serious drama or consequences for Gil's actions or those of anyone in the film, frankly. Knowing Allen's capability to add an a powerful gravity to relationship conflict, it's surprising he chooses to exercise none of it when the film could've been better for it or at least his ideas more resonant. Instead, he chooses to let the story float about as this postcard from Paris, one signed with love and addressed to his fans, those who've pined to recapture the Woody of old. Yet with impeccable self-awareness as usual, the great filmmaker adds a postscript in the form of a thematic reminder that dwelling in the past constitutes nothing but an escape unless we use it to understand and empower our present. That, of course, is what Woody's done with ""Midnight in Paris.""~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

The Best Paris Advertisement Ever Filmed,"This movie opens intentionally kitschy; it couldn't be more boring: travelogue shots of Paris in sunny weather, in rainy weather, and so forth. The movie then proceeds to move along a different dimension: temporal, in exploring the city's glorious past, especially regarding the many celebrities of arts and letters who used to live and create there in various epochs. There again, Woody Allen comes dangerously close to kitsch -- but safely avoids slipping into that quagmire every time yet another superstar is introduced in the most typical fashion that one might expect to encounter him or her. How do you show Hemingway as ""virile"", and calling Paris ""a movable feast"", when all of this is so well-known and has been thrashed to death in countless articles and books and movies? Well, Allen relies on his unusual, ""fantasy"" story, bringing a new twist to everything that is overly familiar, and on fabulous performances by the entire cast, including Corey Stoll as Hemingway. Stoll's portrayal of Hemingway is so true-to-life and convincing you forget it should be kitschy due to your having known all of this about Hemingway before; Stoll's portrayal of Hemingway is the real thing, and no caricature typical of a comedy movie -- except in the sense that life itself can often be seen as a caricature or comedy. An equally superb performance is given by Kathy Bates as Gertrude Stein; or by the trio (or quintet) of impossibly bourgeois US visitors, led by fantastic Rachel McAdams as the main character's fiancée. Owen Wilson is outstanding and authentic as an imitation Woody Allen; he has Woody's intonation and nervous, confused enunciation down pat, so that in many moments, you could have sworn you're watching Woody Allen, the actor, himself. It doesn't hurt that Owen is more handsome than Allen ever was, which makes the story's romantic angle more believable. The movie offers very nice philosophic overtones, in Gil affirming, leaning on Faulkner's words, that ""the past is not even past""; and realizing that everything except for the present day is illusionary. And so, the movie is not only a celebration of the physical location of Paris in various time periods -- but also a powerful affirmation of the illusionary nature of *time* itself. While at the same time being philosophic and fantasy (resembling Allen's _The Purple Rose of Cairo_ of 1985), the movie also manages to be vintage Woody Allen comedy, with many amusing situations and even a few that made me laugh out loud. Congratulations to Woody Allen on such youthful effervescence at his advanced age!",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Superb,"A Hollywood screenwriter, unsatisfied with his job and working on a novel, accompanies his fiancée (also from southern California ) and her wealthy parents in Paris on a business trip. He grows further from his fiancée as he awakens to the magic of Paris and some remarkable time-travel adventures that take place from a certain location each midnight.The magician behind this fine film is the great Woody Allen who is back in fine form. His greatest period is 1977-1994 before his films decreased in quality. In the past decade, he showed improvement with ""Match Point"". With ""Midnight in Paris "", he is back in full swing.Allen takes a few enjoyable swipes at some of his compatriot American archetypes. These include vulgar, materialistic, wealthy types (the fiancée and her parents) and pompous know-it-all academics (a friend of the fiancée). In fairness, the latter archetype could belong to any country. There were great moments of subtle but accurate dialogue of North American travelers in Europe trying to upstage each other.""Midnight in Paris "" uses a few themes from previous Allen films. These include Americans awakening to a different cultural mindset while travelling in a cosmopolitan European city (""Vicky Christina Barcelona"") and the magical ability to switch dimensions (""The Purple Rose of Cairo"").The greatest gem of this film is something rare in most movies these days: a powerful screenplay with a consistent theme. While the desire to live in another place and time is understandable, there might be other ways to fill this gap while living in current times.The film might have benefitted more by continuing beyond the ending to show what happens after a turning point. A scene including Salvador Dali and Luis Bunuel also seemed unnecessary. But these gripes don't stop this film from being one of the best in 2011. - dbamateurcriticRating: 9 out of 10Award-worthy Achievement : Screenplay by Woody AllenPS For any other Woody Allen fans, here is my list of favourites:Top Tier: Annie Hall, The Purple Rose of CairoNext Tier: Broadway Danny Rose, Zelig, Hannah and her Sisters, Bullets over BroadwayNext Tier: Crimes and Misdemeanours, Midnight in ParisNext Tier: Interiors, Match Point.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Dreams Of a Golden Age...,You definitely need to be in the right mood for this-luckily I was and enjoyed it throughout and could have watched for longer. Of course the characterisations of the famous historical figures must be taken with a pinch of salt. Yet it felt like a celebration of these figures and also introduced me to the wonders of alternative filmmaker Luis Bunuel which is certainly not a bad thing. As with many of his films if Allen doesn't play the lead role then whoever does seems to be doing an impression of him. Wilson did do this but had enough charisma and ability to shine through. McAdams also does a good job and of course so does the beautiful Paris.,9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

It Blew Me Away,"Most certainly, ""Midnight in Paris"" DID blow me away because Woody Allen's a proved genius; Owen Wilson is far better than the kook seen in his other films; the melodies ""Si tu vois ma mère"" and ""Bistro Fada"" were haunting and the entire story line was so unique and mesmerizing, I'll see it again next week. Even though we are close to four months away from Jan.1st, this mid-summer release will win for Mr. Allen either or both the Best Director of the Year and Best Original Screen Play Not Based on a Book. Are you a nostalgiaphile as I am? If so, you'll go ape over this movie--totally bonkers by the way Mr. Allen weaved the past into the present and it happens so unexpectedly, the viewer is taken by storm and held until the end. Its the best picture I've seen thus far in '11 and say it's one of the best, if not the best film Allen's ever done. And let's not forget about ""Match Point"" either.

One of my favorites of 2011 so far,"OK, how about I start this review in a classic way, by promoting the film. Ladies and gentleman this is a movie directed and written by none other than Woody Allen. Just to give you a short resume of his, he has won an Academy Award for Best Director for Annie Hall and has earned another 5 nominations for Best Director. He has won 2 Academy Awards for Best Original Screenplay for the movies Annie Hall and Hannah and Her Sisters. He has been nominated another 12 times for this award. He also has a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role, also for Annie Hall. I think you can figure out a conclusion from all I just mentioned in this paragraph.Now to get into the film. This is a beautiful romantic comedy, and probably the best I've seen all year. Owen Wilson gave one of his best performances ever, but I still do not consider it Oscar material. Michael Sheen as Paul Bates probably gave his best performance of the year. But, to be honest, all of the actors that worked on this project were great in their roles. Also I thought the script was great, beautiful and is probably going to gain Woody Allen his 15th Academy Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay. For me, it is the best screenplay of the year so far.OK, now I usually don't say this but Owen Wilson does not deserve Rachel McAdams(talking about the characters). He deserves better than that broad. Just wanted to mention this.One of the things I really liked was Adrien Brody's cameo appearance. What, his name is written alongside the other main characters of the film?! NOPE. His screen time was exactly 3 minutes and 25 seconds. But I have to say, he was one of my favourite things about this film. I just laughed the whole time he was on screen.To sum up this is a great film and surely one of the best of 2011.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

Whimsical trip through nostalgia-land.,"This movie is a whimsical fantasy that succeeds as a movie. The main character, admirably played by Owen Wilson, is on a quest for something that is a mirage, but to him is real. The movie deals with escapism and its pitfalls. Yes, it can be fun to let our imagination take us to all the beautiful places we crave to go to for happiness, but ultimately we're stuck in the present which sooner or later comes back to bite us. Nevertheless, the world of make believe can seem so real that once you're there, you never want to leave and that is the start of madness. This movie takes the audience to the brink of madness. The main character is so open to suggestion and so desperate to be appreciated and understood that he wants to flee present, which makes this movie so appealing. For who doesn't think about wanting to escape to a better place? Who doesn't daydream? The rest of the cast is excellent. As for the cinematography, the opening shots of Paris are superb.

A Classic Nostalgic Woody Allen Charmer,"When I first heard the lead character of ""Midnight in Paris"" talk, I thought it was Woody Allen talking. But when I looked at the screen, I saw Owen Wilson! I do not know if Owen was purposely doing it, but he was channeling Woody Allen perfectly in intonation and diction. Maybe it was the characteristic style Woody Allen wrote his script, I don't know but it was so uncanny and this added to my enjoyment of this film.""Midnight in Paris"" is about a movie scriptwriter and struggling novelist Gil (Owen Wilson) who was trapped in a stifling relationship with his snooty fiancée Inez (Rachel Mc Adams). This becomes more evident during their supposedly romantic vacation in Paris, when Inez spending more time with her snobbish parents and her ""pseudo- intellectual pedantic"" male friend Paul (Michael Sheen). To escape, Gil takes a midnight walk in the side streets of Paris, and was magically transported to the 1920s where he encounters his literary heroes like Ernest Hemingway (Corey Stoll), and Gertrude Stein (Kathy Bates). He also meets and falls in love with Pablo Picasso's muse Adriana (Marion Cotillard). How Gil faces and resolves this unusual situation is the unique premise of this delightful little Woody Allen masterpiece.""Midnight in Paris"" is a very charming movie. It is about yearning for something much better than what you have now. It had me from the get- go, very interesting right away. The initial five minutes of beautiful Parisian scenes and music will put you in the proper mood right away and never let you go. People who loves literature and the arts will certainly share Gil's excitement and fascination about actually meeting these authors in the flesh. Cameos by Dali (a funny turn by Adrien Brody), Fitzgerald, Bunuel, Matisse, and even Toulouse-Lautrec, Degas and Gauguin further add to the nostalgia. I have some quibbles only about Gil finding Adriana's book, but that is minor. Only Woody Allen can make an off-the-wall movie like this and get away with it!

A sweetly sentimental movie with an excellent cast and script.,"Woody Allen's script is an impressive one. One that he clearly took his time with. Midnight in Paris features an impressive cast of characters, an array of interesting sub plots, and a very sweet sense of nostalgia. The sequences of the roaring 20's after midnight are magical stuff set up with care by Allen. They balance sentimentality, comedy, romance, and drama on perfect keel. The movie places us under an irresistible spell, and the whole thing just flies by, never getting boring.The way that Allen also writes his characters is wonderful stuff, and his incredible ensemble cast (Including Owen Wilson, Marion Cotillard, Kathy Bates, Corey Stoll, Michael Sheen, and especially Alison Pill... the list goes on) bring out the most of their characters with total conviction. In particular, Adrien Brody has a hilarious cameo as a rhinoceros obsessed Salvador Dali.The backdrop of Paris only heightens the movie's charm. Allen begins the film with a lovely, but somewhat draggy, four minute montage of the city, but I can't deny that it's a nice way to establish ambiance. Allen chooses fascinating aesthetic styles to further enhance the movie's nostalgic effect. The element that truly brings this out is Darius Khondji's cinematography, which Allen wanted to have a very wide range of warm colors to give a very flattering light. The color spectrum is gorgeous, no less than such a city as Paris deserves.***1/2 out of ****",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
A Love Poem to Paris,"Midnight in ParisMy experience of this film is of a beautifully presented love poem to Paris, lovely, delightful, introduced at its outset through sensitive cinema portraits of the City accompanied by Sidney Bechet's affectionate call and response duet, gently carrying us along, saying, 'Abide with me, Gentle Viewer - This is a love story'.I understand that the story-teller's art may emphasize Plot, Character, or Setting, in any combination of related qualities, with blend and emphasis varying throughout the work.While there is sufficient plot in this narrative to carry the armchair viewer along, I'm thinking that the story line in our film serves mainly as a supporting vehicle, providing a milieu lending meaning to the essential spirit of the piece: the author's delight in Paris, his desire to share his sense of wonder in the art, culture, history, the spirit of the city and its people. Plot and Character are minimal interests here; this is a work celebrating its Setting, the Social and Cultural Environment of the City of Paris.As an artist's purpose is through their craft to stimulate in the viewer, listener or reader an experience sympathetic with their own, our author and director was thoroughly successful with me; I come from this experience now, in love with Paris. I am eager to share this film with friends. Thank you, Mr. Allen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

Oooh, aaah, what shallow codswallop, no character or dramatic or narrative depth, just endless blink and you've missed them cameos. It's like an Easter parade, not a film. Wilson makes a passable job of playing the ""protagonist"", Allen's alter ego with his pathetic little self-obssessions. All Allen's films are about that. Biiig Yawwwn! Then the facile resolution, the present is really the time you need to make the most of, and the adolescent fade out of walking into the rainy Parisian night with an adorable young thing who doesn't mind ""getting wet"". In your dreams, Woody! How embarrassing, to have ""serious"" critics fawn over this stuff.

Amazingly, the step from reality into fantasy is not to difficult after the first car ride. As it is easy to join in on the journey - as we meet the talented, the beautiful & charismatic.

satisfying romantic comedy,"To fully enjoy ""Midnight in Paris"" it helps to have some knowledge of the world of arts and letters as it unfolded in Paris during the years between the first and second World Wars. Without such knowledge, the steady stream of verbal references and incarnations of past celebrities may wear you out. Writer-director Woody Allen develops comic momentum by transporting a young writer (Owen Wilson) back in time where he encounters one famous Golden Age figure after another, starting with F. Scott Fitzgerald and Zelda, then Cole and Linda Porter, Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, Luis Bunuel, Salvador Dali and others. Sometimes the portrayals hit the bull's eye and at other times fly off to nowhere. For one reason or another Kathy Bates and Adrien Brody, both capable performers, bring nothing fresh or compelling to Stein and Dali, respectively. Michael Sheen is, as usual, outstanding as an egotistical intellectual in the 2010 segments, delivering his lines with an impeccable American accent.It's filled with Allen's wisdom, insight and irony, and of course cascades of conversation, most of it scintillatingly observant, funny, surprising and lively. He has a way of scoring a witticism and then undercutting it before it has a chance to sit there and draw attention to its impressiveness. His insistent puncturing of pretense and falsehood is intact. Allen has set many movies in the past (""The Purple Rose of Cairo,"" ""Zelig,"" ""A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy"" to name a few) but here he takes the time travel one step further by going back even further into the past while already there, exploring the human longing for the golden age that never really was. And throughout we are presented with numberless views of Paris at all times of the day and night, rain and shine, all tied up with a beautiful romantic ribbon at the end.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
"Ah, Paree! Ah, Woody Allen!","This film is highly recommended.There are those who live in the past, those who celebrate life in the present, and those who look to the future for happiness. Director and screenwriter Woody Allen poses many questions in his sophisticated romantic comedy, Midnight in Paris : Do we romanticize the past to make our present and future seem bleak and remote? Can we ever appreciate the present and view it with the same glorious rose-colored glasses of the past? Does our sense of reality become impaired with what was, what is, and what will be? Can we ever learn to accept the time and place in which we live? Interesting musings persist in this amusing and clever film.Filling in for Allen and giving a fairly accurate impression of the comedic actor down to his halted speech patterns and sardonic demeanor is Owen Wilson as Gil, an American writer and tourist inspired with the Parisian way of life and nostalgic for the Golden Age of yore. He and his shrewish fiancée, Inez ( well acted by Rachel McAdams ), are there meeting her well-to-do conservative parents on holiday. This engaged couple really are opposites from the start: she prefers socializing, hobnobbing, and parties; he enjoys the arts, solitude, and introspective moments. At an elite party, Inez meets a pompous college professor ( a note perfect Michael Sheen ) with whom she becomes infatuated while Gil becomes alienated and exasperated by the whole social jet set.That evening, around midnight, Gil walks the rain soaked streets of the City of Lights and becomes lost. He stumbles across some partygoers who magically transport him back in time to the twenties, his favorite idealized time era, where he later meets his romantic muse, Adriana, mistress to Picasso, Modigliani, and his personal guide to the better life. Adriana is perfectly cast by the charming and lovely Marion Cotillard who brings such grace and enchantment to her pivotal role.Once touched by the romance of a bygone era, Gil eagerly goes it alone whenever the witching hour approaches, in hopes of mingling with the likes of literary celebrities and artists of the past: F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway (Corey Stall as the writer gets to deliver some of the script's best lines), Salvador Dali, Gertrude Stein, etc. There is much name dropping and celebrity stereotyping as Gil timehops to the past which gets to be a bit of a monotonous plot device; yet it gives the film its intellectual and aesthetic appeal and emphasizes Allen's unique spin, ironic wit, and sparkling dialogue.Just as the director's earlier masterpiece Manhattan was his cinematic love letter to New York City, Midnight in Paris becomes one of his best films in years, It is his personal rendezvous with one of Europe's most romantic of destinations and Allen shows the city in all its glorious splendor. Yes, the city and his dreams successfully seduce Gil in this delightful flight of fancy ( or fantasy, in this case ) and Allen has thoroughly bewitched his audience with his magical modern day fairy tale of love and romance.

Magical love story with Woodly Allen written all over it!,"I just loved this movie. The premise was truly interesting and kept me wanting to see more and more. The characters were likable except for the fiancé and parents, but were selected appropriately for the roles. You must enjoy the wordiness of Mr. Allen and the tongue-in-cheek comedy. Pure magic from beginning to end. What a pleasure to see a good movie. You are taken by surprise and taken back in time to a happy and giddy time when people laughed and danced. I have been a Woody Allen fan for a long time and especially liked Vicki Christina Barcelona, so I knew I would like this as well. This man has a fanciful mind and seems never to be at a loss for words. If you like Woody Allen, you must see this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
"Allen is back, with a Parisian Delight!!","I'm a big Woody Allen fan... so my review may seem biased.But you have to agree the movie has good new concept, and the characters performed by an amazing string of brilliant actors. It is funny, entertaining and delightful. It keeps you guessing - the reasons for the occurrence of certain events, until the truth is revealed. I don't know why, but the movie makes you fall in love with Paris even more (If you don't love it yet, sorry, you have no taste). It's an endearing and thought provoking film that will whisk you away into a sublime magical world. It's certainly one of Woody Allen's better films in the recent years...",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
C'est magnifique!,"Woody Allen's best movie in years, happily reminiscent of PURPLE ROSE OF CAIRO, the most endearing of his collaborations with Mia Farrow. Owen Wilson, standing-in for Allen himself, is klutzy without being self-pitying. Marion Cotillard is totally ravishing as Picasso's latest squeeze - as Wilson observes, she gives a whole new meaning to ""art groupie"".Kathy Bates was probably chosen to play Gertrude Stein because of her, ahem, physique but she dives into the role with relish. Corey Stoll's Hemingway not only looks a lot like old (or rather, young) Ernie but he is given the movie's best lines: he talks like he writes, short sentences with a lot of ""ands"" and frequent references to guns, booze, lions and women. Cole Porter mostly sings. Zelda Fitzgerald mostly drinks while Scott frets. There are some good gags at the expense of Michael Sheen's annoying know-it-all art expert in the modern storyline when Wilson comes back with stories from the artists and models themselves. Wilson's airhead fiancée and his future in-laws-from-hell stop just short of caricature in a movie that relies for its existence on finding the balancing spot between parody and affectionate tribute.The transitions from Today to (more than one) Yesterday are achieved without any resort to special effects, the Paris locations and sets are simply ""magnifique"", the music (lots of accordion) is almost too good. The mood is kept light and the whole film teeters on the brink of being lightweight without ever becoming crass.This would be a great comedy in any era.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
