timeless terror,"Even though The Shining is over a quarter of a century old, I challenge anyone to not get freaked out by Jack Nicholson's descent into madness. This is a rare example of something so unique that no one has been able to rip it off; instead it has been referenced time and again in pop culture. The twins, the elevator of blood, RedRum, the crazy nonsense ""writing""... this should be seen, if for nothing else, to understand all the allusions to it in daily life. The film is simultaneously scary, suspenseful, beautiful, and psychologically intriguing. It has the classic mystery of Hitchcock and the terror of a modern thriller. And it has what horror movies usually lack: a great script.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Amazing achievement in filmmaking and the art of terror.,"Chilling, majestic piece of cinematic fright, this film combines all the great elements of an intellectual thriller, with the grand vision of a director who has the instinctual capacity to pace a moody horror flick within the realm of his filmmaking genius that includes an eye for the original shot, an ice-cold soundtrack and an overall sense of dehumanization. This movie cuts through all the typical horror movies like a red-poker through a human eye, as it allows the viewer to not only feel the violence and psychosis of its protagonist, but appreciate the seed from which the derangement stems. One of the scariest things for people to face is the unknown and this film presents its plotting with just that thought in mind. The setting is perfect, in a desolate winter hideaway. The quietness of the moment is a character in itself, as the fermenting aggressor in Jack Torrance's mind wallows in this idle time, and breeds the devil's new playground. I always felt like the presence of evil was dormant in all of our minds, with only the circumstances of the moment, and the reasons given therein, needed to wake its violent ass and pounce over its unsuspecting victims. This film is a perfect example of this very thought.And it is within this film's subtle touches of the canvas, the clackity-clacks of the young boy's big wheel riding along the empty hallways of the hotel, the labyrinthian garden representing the mind's fine line between sane and insane, Kubrick's purposely transfixed editing inconsistencies, continuity errors and set mis-arrangements, that we discover a world guided by the righteous and tangible, but coaxed away by the powerful and unknown. I have never read the book upon which the film is based, but without that as a comparison point, I am proud to say that this is one of the most terrifying films that I have ever seen. I thought that the runtime of the film could've been cut by a little bit, but then again, I am not one of the most acclaimed directors in the history of film, so maybe I should keep my two-cent criticisms over a superb film, to myself. All in all, this movie captures your attention with its grand form and vision, ropes you in with some terror and eccentric direction, and ties you down and stabs you in the heart with its cold-eyed view of the man's mind gone overboard, creepy atmosphere and the loss of humanity.Rating: 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Amazing Watch!,"One of those films that is a classic for a reason.It's been on my list of movies to watch forever and a day and I finally got to it in 2023.This is an experience, masterfully shot and some of the most intense and engaging performances I have ever seen.Nicholson and Duvall have a complex chemistry that works at so many levels, which is essential to the make up of this story and anchors the first class direction.This is cinematically spectacular, the sets and the the design of this film is isolating, terrifying and captivatingly beautiful all at the same time.Worth all of the accolades and hype, even at 43 years old this film delivers in spades.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
"Forty years on, and it's still outstanding.","Kubrick, King and Nicholson, the writing was literally on the wall, and I don't mean RedRum, forty years on, and The Shining is still a masterpiece.Kubrick takes King's fantastic book, and builds on it, bringing the story to life in his own inimitable way. It's dark, it's bleak, it's terrifying, a masterpiece in storytelling. You watch as the central character's mental collapse is played out in a spine chilling fashion.Gorgeous camera work, incredible visuals, that opening is iconic. So many incredible, visual moments, the twins, lift, barman etc, no wonder it's been parodied multiple times over the years, famously by The Simpsons.An iconic role for Jack Nicholson, he is incredible, well supported by a terrific cast.It's a classic, 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Best Horror Film I've Ever Seen,"When this film first came out in 1980, I remember going to see it on opening night. The sheer terror that I experienced in viewing ""The Shining"" was enough to make me go to bed with the lights turned ON every night for an entire summer. This movie just scared the life out of me, which is what still happens every time I rent the video for a re-watch. I have seen The Shining at least six or seven times, and I still believe it to be simultaneously and paradoxically one of the most frightening and yet funniest films I've ever seen. Frightening because of the extraordinarily effective use of long shots to create feelings of isolation, convex lens shots to enhance surrealism, and meticulously scored music to bring tension levels to virtually unbearable levels. And ""funny"" because of Jack Nicholson's outrageous and in many cases ad-libbed onscreen antics. It never ceases to amaze me how The Shining is actually two films in one, both a comedy AND a horror flick. Ghostly apparitions of a strikingly menacing nature haunt much of the first half of the film, which gradually evolve into ever more serious physical threats as time progresses. Be that as it may, there is surprisingly little violence given the apparent intensity, but that is little comfort for the feint of heart as much of the terror is more implied than manifest. The Shining is a truly frightening movie that works symbolically on many levels, but is basically about human shortcomings and the way they can be exploited by unconscious forces combined with weakness of will. This film scares the most just by using suggestion to turn your own imagination against you. The Shining is a brilliant cinematic masterpiece, the likes of which have never been seen before or since. Highly, highly recommended. - Paul",,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
An absolute classic. Even if it does stray away from the novel.,"While I can understand a lot of Stephen King's arguments over Kubrick's vision, including casting Jack Nicholson who instead of a descent into madness looks insane from the first frame.

Straight Up,"The sound, editing, camera and mise en scene are all utilized perfectly. A perfect score, framing, cinematography, camera work, set, production design, acting, storytelling, and not only just a perfect horror movie, but a perfect film. This film is what all great films STRIVE to be. The highest of film standards.The Shining is a masterwork of creating mood, setting tone, and developing an atmosphere. The score is one of the best and most iconic scores of all time. As well as the most eerie.This is honestly my favorite of all Stanley Kubrick's films. The Shining is a masterpiece of cinema *chefs kiss*The only thing that is a negative imo is that if your not completely invested in the movie and ready to sit down and watch, you will get bored. It's lengthy, but worth it once your totally engrossed in the film. Especially for your first viewing. You gotta pay attention.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
A MASTERPIECE LIKE NO OTHER,"Whenever we hear the name Stanley Kubrick, the poster, scene or a shot from The Shining will come to our mind - most probably "" Here's Johnny!"". For a legendary filmmaker like Kubrick who has multiple masterpieces to his credit, would still be fine if he had never even made this film. But still, there would be some great missing which will be felt! That's because of The Shining's ability to penetrate the viewer's mind, even the subconscious, and imprint an influence in its deeper depths. How the movie hooks the viewer with its horror which is created from several dimensions is a remarkable factor that makes this film an all-perfect masterpiece that is thrilling and exciting even after watching it umpteen times.How Kubrick created the horror, just one among the many factors that make the film a great one (still a very important one though), is so deep and mind-blowing, he builds tension in the viewer with enough substance written in the screenplay to showcase on the screen, and perfectly well-tuned and tastefully directed horror. Most importantly, the background music and sounds have immense depth with its structuring crafted to the innermost core and the finely touched upper layers. The actors give performances that are dramatically aesthetic and showcase facial expressions that are realistic to the utmost extent. As the film progresses the anticipation for something scary to expect in the upcoming scenes is created successfully and the anticipation that it created is also executed by scaring the viewer with horrors of huge intensity.One thing that is found in this film is something of a variety. It's the portrayal of the supernatural in a very realistic manner, which is done in a subtle way that doesn't let the viewer know that it's a realistic portrayal of the supernatural he won't even care to notice it. Because that's how successfully it's done. And what's the use of it? It has an impact on the viewer which affects how he perceives the film, and that too which will be something of an advantage for the filmmaker.I don't intend to say anything about the story of the film, whether it's supernatural horror or the breakdown of a madman's mind, is still debated among cinephiles, even 40 years after the film's release. And that's also a thing which makes the film a great one! Rather than just showing what the maker wants to show, Kubrick lets the viewer decide what the film is, by making him analyse the film from his perspective and come up with an interpretation. This is a form of interactive cinema, an indirect one though.The Shining is one of the greatest horror masterpieces or even one of the best films of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Cabin Fever,"Stephen King was so horrified at what Stanley Kubrick did to his 1977 novel he felt it necessary to later write his own alternative version for TV. Dismissed at the time as an anticlimax the pendulum of history quickly swung in the opposite direction, where it remains today.Seldom commented upon is the obvious influence on Kubrick of 'Last Year in Marienbad' - already apparent in '2001' - with its endless tracks through an enormous soulless hotel in the middle of nowhere to the accompaniment of a glacial music score, within which Kubrick stages at least two moments worthy of his name for which the film has been carefully preparing us for over an hour: the discovery by Shelly Duvall exactly what her husband (played by Jack Nicholson as if he's auditioning for the role of Richard III) has been labouring on since his arrival and that she and her son are trapped in the middle of nowhere completely at the mercy of a maniac, and the final track into the photograph of Nicholson among the revellers on July 4th 1921 which is quite an ending but - like so much else in the film - to which there is probably far less than meets the eye.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
I can see why people like it,"My expectation were to high. I expected a masterpiece, but in the end I found it just mediocre. Dont get me wrong the acting and the camera work are great.

A masterpiece of psychological horror,"""The Shining"" by Stanley Kubrick explores the question of who is the reliable observer and whose ideas of events can be trusted. The opening scene at a job interview introduces Jack Torrance, a man who plans to live in solitude with his wife and son at the snowbound Overlook Hotel. His employer warns him about a former caretaker who murdered his wife and two daughters, but Jack assures him that this will not happen. His wife, a confirmed ghost story and horror film addict, is likely to be fascinated by the story. Jack, Wendy, and Danny move into a hotel during winter shutdown, where the chef, Dick Hallorann, explains the food storage locker. They are left alone, and Jack works tirelessly at his typewriter, while Wendy and Danny create a routine of everyday life, including breakfast cereal, toys, and TV. The three don't seem to function as a loving family, as they are constantly occupied with their daily routines. The question remains whether people will talk about real tragedies or if Jack will ever tell his wife about it. Danny, a reliable witness, is influenced by Tony, who channels psychic input, including a vision of blood spilling from hotel elevators and two matching girls. However, these visions may not accurately represent the actual events. Wendy, a companion and playmate for Danny, has a matter-of-fact banality similar to Shelley Duvall's ""3 Women."" She tries to cheer Jack up until he abruptly stops interrupting his work. Wendy later discovers the reality of his work, and is reliable at that moment and later when she bolts Jack into the food locker after he becomes violent. The opening shots of Jack wending his way up the Colorado mountains are a sign of what's to come. The eerie Moog interpretation of Hector Berlioz's Symphonie fantastique, the mirroring of the landscape against a placid lake, and the breathless whoosh of the camera are all signs of what's to come. With Steadicam mounts, Kubrick experiments with how a constantly roving camera can unmoor an audience. Even in the benign early scenes of Jack heading to the interview or the Torrance clan getting a tour of the hotel, it feels like a game of chicken. As the Torrances settle into The Overlook for the winter and a snowstorm severs their connection to the outside world, the madness that quickly seizes Jack ramps up a whole strategy of disorientation. Kubrick makes a joke out of titles announcing different days of the week, as if time has any meaning in isolation. The geography of The Overlook is impossible to map, with the kitchen, living quarters, Gold Room, upper floors, and Room 237 all distinct spaces that are impossible to connect.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
The book is better,"Watching this after reading the book I can see why Stephen king was annoyed with it.Jack Nicholson looked unhinged from the beginning which means there isn't much difference in his decent into madness.Certain characters from the book are left out, where are the bees? Where are the moving ani mail bushes? The boiler is barely mentioned.The direction is brilliant and I love the blood down the elevator shaft scene.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Equivocation,"This is a difficult review to write. You see, I've just posted comments on Ella Enchanted where I comment that, as someone who has never read the book, the film is absolutely fine. But it's difficult for me to approach Stanley Kubrick's The Shining on that basis because, you see, I've read Stephen King's The Shining.If I do my absolute best to put the book out of my mind, I suppose that the film must be acknowledged as a tolerable horror, with two major flaws - one, it's overlong, and what should be a slow burn loaded with increasing dread becomes simply boring, and two, Jack Nicholson's established screen persona means that there is absolutely no suspense in his development from decent though flawed father/husband to scenery-chewing maniac - the final madness is there from the first frame he appears in.If you've never read the book and you're a horror fan, then you'll probably enjoy it - no huge surprises, but it ticks most of the boxes. And it looks very good.But what a missed opportunity! Stanley Kubrick's The Shining is a film about a man who goes mad in a haunted hotel. Stephen King's The Shining is a novel about an evil entity which inhabits a hotel, and which wants to consume a boy's psychic power: the boy is strong enough to resist it, so it works on the weakest link, the father, and gradually erodes everything which made him a good, decent man. Jack's transition from the decent though weak man he starts out as, to the point where the Overlook is in control of his every action, is absolutely central to Stephen King's The Shining, and it could only have worked on screen if Jack was portrayed by an actor who was initially credible as a decent, gentle man. Not Nicholson - I love him, but he was (in my view) a spectacular piece of miscasting for this movie. Picture Dustin Hoffman, Harrison Ford, or someone similar, and how dramatic and shocking their descent to axe-wielding maniachood would have been.The contrast is essential to Stephen King's story: with Nicholson, there was no contrast.It is also worth commenting that King's The Shining is about a man who loves his family: Kubrick's The Shining is stated, by the screenwriter in one of the DVD documentaries, to be about a man who hates his family. A fairly fundamental difference, yes?Ah well. ""What if""s never got us anywhere. Go and see Stanley Kubrick's The Shining anyway, and enjoy Jack Nicholson chewing scenery. The scenery's pretty good eye candy and, besides, he does it so well.",5.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Favourite horror as a kid but a masterpiece now that i am grown,"The Shining was my favourite horror movie as a kid. Born in 1988 i think i watched this movie more than 10 times. But being a kid i offcourse did not understand the psychological drama behind it in full. I am now watching this after 15+ years again with my 12 year old son, who is obsessed with the horror genre. But is more of the type of horror like Saw. Not even 30 minutes into the movie, with actually nothing really happening, he is scared to death. And even me, who watched this movie so many times, but not for a very long time, have a scary feeling in my stomach. The music is really the best actor in this whole movie. All the time you are wondering what is going to happen next. Even though at the beginning, nothing is really happening. The actors are perfect for their roles. The whole movie you have this uncomfortable feeling, but you can't really place it. The Shining really shows that you dont need a lot of scary stuff and action in a movie to make it scary.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
One of the scariest movies ever---8/10,"I was never a big fan of horror movies. They usually try cheap tricks to scare their audiences like loud noises and creepy children. They usually lack originality and contain overacting galore. The only horror movie i like was Stir of Echoes with Kevin Bacon. It was well-acted, and had a great story. But it has been joined and maybe even surpassed by Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, quite possibly the scariest movie ever.The movie follows a writer (Jack Nicholson) and his family who agree to watch over a hotel while it is closed for the winter. There were rumors of the place being haunted and the last resident went crazy and murdered his family. But Jack is convinced it will be OK and he can use the quiet to overcome his writer's block. After months of solitude and silence however, Jack becomes a grumpy and later violent. Is it cabin fever or is there something in the hotel that is driving him mad?One of the creepiest parts about the movie is the feeling of isolation that Kubrick makes. The hotel is very silent, and the rooms are huge, yet always empty. It is also eerily calm when Jack's son is riding his bike through the barren hallways. Jack Nicholson's performance is also one of his very best, scaring the hell out of me and making me sure to get out once in awhile. My favorite scene is when he is talking to a ghost from inside a walk-in refrigerator.The Shining is tops for horror movies in my opinion, beating the snot out of crap like the Ring and The Blair Witch Project. It may be a oldie, but is definitely a goodie. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
The best creepy horror movie involving isolation n eeriness. Also it captured the fear of the unseen in one of the best way.,"I first saw this in the late 80s on a vhs, then again in the early 2k on a dvd which I own. Revisited the 144 mins director's cut recently as i am anxious to check out Doctor Sleep n the tv version of The Shining.Everything has already been said about this film n there seems to be little left to say but as a fan of horror movies (especially to do with isolation n eeriness), lemme contribute by praising how good this film is n at the same time why it doesn't deserve a full 10.The film has solid amount of tension n scare factor.The vast isolation, the snow capped peaks, the valleys, the mountains, the narrow, winding roads, the snow covered roads, the eerie corridors, they all add to the film's narration.The start scene wher Jack is driving and the background music, itself gives goosebumps n a sign that something sinister is awaiting.On a technical level this film is gr8, the music, the visuals, the camera angles, etc all add to it except the lead actor Nicholson.Nicholson was already well known for playing unstable characters and his character Jack in this film is shown to be a bit wierd from the beginning.They shud have asked him to potray a normal family loving person in the beginning n later show the gradual transition into madness n possession.Who wud discuss Donner Party in front of a kid?Also the way Jack gives an evilish smile when his kid tells about watching cannibalism on tv.What kinda parent wud approve of that?Also most of the time Jack's behavior is more laughable.Even when he is hit on the head by his wife n he falls down, it is a big lol.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"

Not so scary incredible film,"Horror films are not my cup of tea. But The Shining has gotten me to reconsider this preference. With an incredible performance by Jack Nicholson as Jack Torrance, I might even say it is one of the best I've ever seen. Meanwhile, considering this movie is a horror film, it always keeps you on your toes. While also being a compact story and with few actors making the film more intriguing and heart wrenching.The Shining is a disturbing film from the 80s. It's not so much scary for the audience, but there's always a creepy feeling luring over you. With Jack Nicholson in the lead role, performing one of the best roles I've seen. Playing a so convincing role It's almost frightening. With so many memorable scenes it's impressive how well the actors performed.Meanwhile, the storyline during the entire film is disturbing and alluring, it also manages to be beautiful. Director Stanley Kubrick managed to create a masterpiece. With beautiful angels, use of lightning and scenes. I can tell you that there is no error in the creation of this masterpiece.I highly recommend you watch The Shining. Truly one of the best horror films ever made. And if you don't like horror movies or fear them The Shining is not so frightening.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
A major disappointment.,"This has got to be the most overrated movie in the history of film. I just watched it for the first time, expecting the best of the best, and it was quite a letdown. The sets and music are great, of course, but Kubrick seems to have forgotten one very important thing: to make a horror movie horrifying, you have to have likable characters. That way, when bad things start happening, the audience feels for them.What we have here, however, is a documentary on the most dysfunctional family in the world. Isn't this supposed to be about a loving husband and father who goes insane? Jack Nicholson is brilliant at portraying total insanity, but there's no gradual shift into at all. He looks like he's about to snap from scene one. His wife is a whimpering, nervous wreck who does not seem to trust him at any point throughout the movie. And the kid, Danny, is just a weird little nut. Who can identify with these people?Another major problem is that there is no clear storyline here. The whole first half of the movie is about the kid's psychic abilities, and then it does a total switch and focuses on Jack Nicholson being crazy. What was the point of spending all that time on Danny? It seems like it is foreshadowing something, but it never amounts to anything. I guess Danny is the first one to see ghosts in the house, but that is not a big enough plot point to spend the entire first half of the movie on.Other than some incredibly creepy music and sets, there is nothing really scary in this movie. It is fun to see Jack Nicholson ham it up, of course, but there is no scariness involved when you spend the entire movie waiting listlessly for him to pick up an ax, rather than being shocked when he goes from lovable to psychotic. Instead, he goes from obviously-wanting-to-release-a-ton-of-built-up-aggression to psychotic, which is extremely inferior.6/10 stars, and that is being generous.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Effective horror almost dependant on the performance of Jack Nicholson,"(1980) The Shining
PSYCHOLOGICAL HORRORCo-produced co-written and directed by Stanley Kubrick that has Jack(Jack Nicholson) along with his wife, Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and their son, Danny (Danny Llyod) moving into an expensive abandoned and isolated resort to help him finish his novel, but holding with this resort are some sinister dark secrets turning him into a lunatic! Co-written from Stephen King and adapted from his own novel of the same name, despite not faithful to King's book, the reason is that it showcases psychologically how a normal human being can be driven into madness, incorporated by a past with it's goal is it to destroy anybody who decide to reside there. And by using a lot of brilliant props, such as the maze and the hordes of blood theirs a great a great deal of creativeness that is unlike on any other horror film til this day and of course without Nicholson's performance this movie wouldn't have worked!",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"

Overrated,"Once again, I decided to check out a highly regarded ""cinematic masterpiece"" and was left kinda disappointed. Scariest movie of all time? No, not really. It wasn't even particularly scary.Admittedly, a lot of it was well done. The little girls were the best part. They were great. The steadicam shots through the hallways were pretty cool. There was a good sense of ""What horrors could be lurking around the corner?"" as the camera follows the kid through the halls.But aside from those things, much of the movie didn't work so well. Jack Nicholson was more hilarious than menacing. Was that intentional? His witty dialogue provided many laughs, but watching him slowly stumbling around holding an axe was hardly what I'd call horror.The story was completely nonsensical. What was any of that? There's no explanation for almost everything that happens in the movie! Here's where I'll probably get derided by the movie's fans for not ""getting it,"" but I'm convinced this is really a case where the movie-makers themselves had no clue what it all meant. They just threw all this random imagery at us just to confuse us and convince us that it's actually brilliant (because if we can't comprehend any of it, it must be brilliant, right?) but really it just makes zero sense.I don't get why this is so highly rated.",5.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
A masterpiece of psychological horror,"Stephen King may have said the master director knew nothing about horror, but that simply is not true. That is a too biased opinion for anyone to go on given that he wrote the book, which Kubrick based his wonderful film ever so loosely on. And at any rate, faithful or not, KUBRICK's Shining-the BEST crafted genre film of the 80's- performs it's duty as a fright flick, and then some.There are appropriately no words strong enough to convey the haunting beauty of the visuals showcased throughout the movie, from the drive to the Overlook to the final chase in the hedgemaze the movie is a feast for the eyes as it is for the mind. And it IS a feast for the mind as The Shining is as psychological as horror gets, toying relentlessly, and expertly with your emotions and expectations(some could even say SADISTICALLY), throwing something in that's completely out of left field and never, ever letting you catch your breath between the now classic shocks as the movie speeds toward it's memorable conclusion in the last half hour.Kudos are in order for Kubrick, a director of the old school style, who builds an eerie atmosphere by exercising total control over the filmic environment, manipulating everything down to the tiniest detail to suit the needs of the picture, yet filming with a coldly detatched, objective eye, as though Kubrick were making a documentary about these events. This would account for the dialouge, which-thankfully-is not the typical phoney balloney Hollywood banter (Kubrick detractors/King purists usually bitch about this the most, having been weaned on the phony nature of 'Hollywood talk', which is usually nothing at all like real talk. Many of us speak 'on the nose', and do not try to convey subtext through use of carefully chosen words that articulate our state of being without being direct.) In this light, Shelley Duvall must be commended for her performance which is very naturalistic. It does not seem like acting at all. She is not concerned with glamour, nor does she clutter her performance with typical acting chops, but rather she is solely focussed on hitting the emotional highpoints of her character as 'Wendy' gradually comes to realize that her husband is a madman. And let's face it folks, how many of us would like a million bucks when placed in a situation like that? Who does NOT look like a blubbering idiot when they are hysterical? That's what I thought, so what did you expect? She was great. To say nothing of the rest of the cast.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
"I hate horror, but I love this movie!","The Shining is a masterclass in film-making and a staple of popular culture. I, personally, cannot stand horror films. I don't like to feel scared, and I don't like to have my emotions manipulated by scary monsters, scary music, scary lighting, etc. I feel like horror is an easy genre - it's easy to scare some people, and people go to movies hoping to feel something, so why not fear?But, I had heard a lot about The Shining. I decided I would look up the plot and watch some clips so I wouldn't be caught off-guard by anything, and I could just appreciate the characters, directing, cinematography, etc.Despite knowing everything that would happen, the film was unbelievably engaging. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. Jack Nicholson, of course, steals the show with one of the most iconic performances ever, and the other actors were decent, but the real star was Kubrick himself. Every shot, every set, the sound design, and everything has his fingerprints all over it, and it is such a delight to watch. When Jack advances up the stairs demanding the bat from Shelley Duval, I grinned from ear to ear because everything in that moment was just perfect in film.The movie, like all others, has problems. In my opinion, the Grady girls and the bloody elevator do not hold up. I knew they were coming from the summaries I had read, so I knew what to expect, so the only reason I could see them as being scary or unsettling is if the viewer was caught off-guard. If you're pretty feminist, you're not going to like Shelley Duval's character, as she is a pretty weak character.All in all, this film is fantastically-made, a cinematic and acting delight, and a gripping horror film that is considered a classic for a reason.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"

What a disappointment,"I had heard so much about how brilliant this movie was. I finally watched it and I hated it.I give it 4 stars and not 1 because I thought it was filmed beautifully and the three leads gave great performances.But now here's what I didn't like.My main criticism is that this movie does not make sense. The story is incoherent and incomprehensible. There are visuals that look like symbolism, but are not related to anything. It looks like a movie that was supposed to be twice as long and was heavily cut, losing its meaning in the process. Maybe that's what happened?Another thing that annoyed me, especially in the first part of the movie, is the editing. Why so many dissolves? It was seriously making me dizzy. Also, the editing of all the dialogue scenes at the beginning, which are already very slow, got on my nerves. This unchanging alternance of reverse shots was making me crazy. In fact, I even wondered if all of this was a conscious choice to unsettle the viewer. But I was mainly annoyed.Last, but not least, this movie isn't scary! Why did I wait all these years to watch it, for fear of being traumatized? Sure there were very good jump scares. But making me jump is not the same as scaring me. Some of the ""scary"" visuals, as I already complained earlier, were so unrelated to anything that they made me laugh rather than scaring me. And I didn't feel any tension because nothing in the story made sense to me. It was all disjointed and weird.",4.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
A classic horror from a master director,"When Jack Torrance (Nicholson) is offered a job as winter caretaker for the Overlook Hotel he accepts it as an opportunity to work on his novel in an isolated environment. He is told stories of the last caretaker going mad and butchering his family but isn't deterred. He arrives at the Overlook Hotel with his wife (Duvall) and child Danny (Lloyd) and is shown around the hotel by the cook (Scatman Crothers) who has the gift of perception. The cook warns Danny that the hotel can be of particular danger for those with the gift. It's only a matter of time before Jack begins to act increasingly erratic.This is one of Jack Nicholson's finest roles, his increasingly unhinged character is amusing and terrifying in almost equal measures. Duvall plays the role of the terrorised wife quite well - she does look like she's genuinely filled with fear - but doesn't have much else to do. Lloyd is excellent as the boy, although he doesn't have too much emotion to express. However no doubt that this is Jack's show.The story doesn't stick to King's novel and is better for it; this is Kubrick's Shining. The film has plenty of genuinely scary moments but manages to keep a creepy atmosphere all through - especially as the ghosts come out and Jack begins to move between his reality and the reality that is gradually claiming him.Kubrick is excellent here, his cold direction adds to the overall creep factor of the film. It's one of the best examples of his masterful touch.Overall this is an excellent horror movie - because the focus is on horror and fear rather than gore alone (as with modern horrors). Jack is excellent in one of his best roles ever and the whole package is delivered in a cold creepy manner by a sadly lost director.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
"No jump scares, but it sends chills down your spine","Kubrick totally nails it with the creepy and suffocating vibe in the movie. The Overlook Hotel is like a character in itself, and those twisty hallways add to the mounting tension.Jack Nicholson goes down in history with his bone-chilling performance as Jack Torrance. He goes from normal to nuts in a way that's both horrifying and mesmerizing. He's basically the face of the movie's unsettling vibes.This film is all about messing with your head. It slowly peels back the sanity layers of its characters, keeping you guessing whether what you're seeing is real or just madness playing tricks on you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Well done 👏,"The two Gradys
At the beginning of the film, Stuart Ullman tells Jack about a former hotel keeper named Charles Grady, who killed his family with an ax and then killed himself. Later, Jack meets a ghostly butler named Grady. He tells him that he knows about the murders, but he tells him that his name is Delbert Grady. This detail is often associated with the image of Jack himself. How one of his essences is that of a father, a husband, a writer, and the other is actually the man in the 4th of July photo. It is a mistake to think that this shot at the end of the film is proof that the events were predetermined. Jack finds himself in countless situations where how he acts depends only on his choices. However, he makes these choices of his own, driven by fear and weakness, which perhaps leads to the horrific end result. Perhaps even Jack had the opportunity to escape his role as a hotel keeper, not to inherit the terrible fate of his predecessor, but he simply did not make the right choices. This is the tragedy of the whole story. The idea is that Delbert Grady, the 1920 butler, and Charles Grady, the security guard, may or may not be the same person. Perhaps what brought them together was not the supernatural power of the hotel, but their tragic decisions. Here comes the idea that the Jack Torrance of the photo is not the same Jack Torrance of the present, but he is not a completely different person either.The picture
At the end of the film, the camera pans slowly along the wall and stops on a 1921 photograph of Jack Torrance. In his interview, Kubrick said that this was proof that Jack from the present was the reincarnation of another hotel employee who lived much earlier. However, this does not prevent alternative ""readings"" of the film, including one that Jack is ""absorbed"" by the hotel. Film critic Jonathan Romney supports this theory by referring to Grade's ghost's words to Jack: ""You're a keeper, sir. You've always been a keeper."" But if Jack's photo from 1921 was there all along how did no one notice it? The effect this question has on the viewer is powerful. Because the inexplicable and unthinkable was before everyone's eyes, and they did not notice it. Right in front of their eyes, yet invisible.The space in ""Overlook Hotel""
The space in ""Overlook Hotel""
Much has already been said about the spatial inconsistencies in The Shining. There are rooms with windows that shouldn't be there. Doors that lead nowhere. Rooms that appear in one place in one scene and another in another scene. Wax figures and furniture appear or disappear in different scenes. Props are moved from one room to another. Because of these details, the overall layout of the hotel loses its physical meaning. Even the ballroom wouldn't have to fit in the space allotted to it. Han Brooks of The Guardian said: ""People say The Shining doesn't make sense. Well noted! The Shining is a ghost movie. It shouldn't make sense.""

Here's Johnny!........how horror should be,"Horror films are associated with extreme and sickening violence/gore, lunatic killers and mostly focus on teenagers. They are mostly just poor excuses to put extreme violence on film to appeal to younger people, and nearly all, with a few exceptions such as Saw, are totally crap. Violence doesn't make a film good. In making The Shining, Stanley Kubrick has shown the world how horror films should be made.There are none of the predictable bad-guy-jumps-out-of-the-dark scenes to try and scare you. Instead Kubrick builds up suspense with the chilling musical score, and Jack Torrance gradually gets driven insane. Jack Nicholson is perfect to portray the character of Torrance. Not only is he a brilliant actor anyway, but he looks perfect for the part. He isn't your stereotyped perfect-looks actor, I don't think someone like Brad Pitt would be as effective playing his part. Pitt is a great actor, but you can't imagine someone like him going insane in a weird hotel! I think the cast is important to this film. Kubrick cast a proper leading actor and actress, rather than the randomly assembled casts of young 20 year olds you get in most horror films. And hey! The result is way better.There are a perfect amount of genuine horror scenes, such as the famous axe scene, and the scene in the maze, and it never goes over the top. There is also some unique horror scenes, such as when Jack writes about 1,000 pages of the same words, and the visions of the blood from the elevator and the little girls. They are bizarre but very effective in building suspense.The storyline is also much more effective than the usual story of teenagers being pursued by a lunatic murderer. A man stuck in a hotel for the winter with just his family who gradually goes insane is much more original and much much much more effective. Horror films are meant to be scary, and this really is. There are many scenes showing Jack's willingness to give in to temptation, and how he wants to get away from his wife and weird son. The camera-work is also excellent, as it builds up tension by moving along the corridors, and it also emphasises that Jack is feeling confined in the hotel.Stephen King didn't like Kubrick's interpretation of his novel, I can't believe how. Kubrick just made it better! This is a top film and is a landmark for horror films.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
One of the few films that impressed beyond my best expectations,"Besides the fact that my list of favorite movie makers is: 1)Stanley Kubrick 2)God Allmighty 3)the rest... this movie actually is better than the book (and the TV miniseries though this is an easy feat, considering the director). The flawless filming stile, the acting and (Kubrick's all time number one skill) the music - make it THE masterpiece of horror. I watched the TV miniseries a few years ago and liked the story and I had my hopes about this when I got a hold of it. IT BLEW ME AWAY!!! It is far better than I ever imagined it. It starts slow (Kubrick trademark) and has a lot of downtime that builds up the suspense. The intro scene is a classic by all means and I watched it about 20 times just for the shear atmosphere it induces to the whole film. Also the film doesn't offer a lot of gore (it has just enough and it is by no means tasteless) a trend that I hate in recent day horror films. Just watch it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Good...but not as good as some say.,"I liked this movie, but how it is ranked so high is beyond me.  There are some pretty scary images in the movie, but on the whole it is not that scary.  In fact, for the most part it is just watching people putter around a hotel by themselves and one of them goes insane.  The boys powers are for the most part ignored, and it is a major part of the book.  Though I myself would have loved to have driven around on a big wheel through a hotel at that age it doesn't really belong in this movie either, what the kid can't be walking and discover stuff?  Jack though does a great job as the father, though he seems a bit to insane at the beginning so him going crazy is definately not a surprise.  All in all a few scary scenes here and there, but this one to me is just an ok movie, not the scariest movie by any stretch of the imagination.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Music and psychology,"A frustrated writer takes a job as caretaker at a deserted hotel, undisturbed at the news of the location's murderous past, and seals himself up through the bleak winter with his wife and son. But the past never leaves the present ...Plenty of comprehensive reviews for this masterpiece, so I'll make just two points.Music makes up about half the effect of a horror movie, but this baby goes even further. Apart from a couple of quiet scenes near the beginning, it never lets up yet never overwhelms. The opening drive through the mountains is full of ominous synth, and the first act is all atonal and unsettling. We switch in preparation for going through the looking glass - Room 237 - when the music becomes orchestral and structured, with multiplying tritones struck in ghastly sequence as Danny first notices the key in the lock. The music returns to atonal, but orchestral this time, as the evil worms its way into the characters. At the climax, we're hit with a satanic choir, and finish off with eerie dance music from the '20s. Add in the sound design, with the wheels on carpet and board, Tony's mutterings, the chilling rhythm of the dialogue in the red toilet and the stairway scenes, and it all works brilliantly.Second, many say this is a psychological horror, but I disagree. It's clear from the off that Jack Torrance is a man with no centre - a pleaser and a conniver and a bully - so it's a question of when, not if, he loses control, and there's no pyschological progression. I imagine Kubrick would have considered that trite, and preferred instead to use the characters as one of many frames to create the effect of evil, so it becomes a total cinematic horror. Essential that we go through the looking glass, and this is where we get the progression, from the music at the moment Danny passes the room, through the sound effect at Jack's falling into a nightmare, to Wendy's close up on discovering the typed pages, and to the point where she herself experiences the visions, not just Danny and Jack. To finish off, we're literally taken into a frame that confirms this is not some guy going off on one, but a circle of hell.Stephen King is said to have dismissed this as a travesty of his work, and I guess we're dealing with two very different views of what makes horror. I dunno about the writer, but the film-maker dun made a horror.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
It's just a little dated...,"I'll only really understand praise for this movie of and in its time. I'm not some huge horror fan but I do appreciate a good horror movie. This just wasn't that scary. I'm sure it probably did much for the horror genre but I feel it's been surpassed by some of Kubricks horror-oriented protégés, Jordan Peele for example.Beautifully shot with very eerie, weird and effective imagery and atmosphere and great performances all around. I thought some of the quieter scenes were some of the more effective. The scene with Jack and the apparent ghost of the previous hotel keeper in the bathroom was particularly well constructed, with the reveal of what's going on coming slowly but surely. But that's where the hype ends for me.It's definitely not a bad movie. I just get the impression that there are more people hopelessly nostalgic over it, than sincerely believe it holds up today. Nostalgia from older generations has a tendency to influence younger generations (""Maaan, I wish I grew up in the 80's!"")",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Eeriness surpassed by class,"Sometimes all good horror needs is a good idea. But sometimes, rarely indeed, a horror masterpiece will reach us by the hand of a Kubrick, with the adept, elusive touch of a great artist to guide the vision, and we know what separates it from all else.Okay, the story has enough promise that even a hired gun would have to try to fail. Heck, even Stephen King himself didn't fare so bad. It's how Kubrick perceives King's universe however, how he fills the frame with it, that renders THE SHINING a feast for the senses.Horror that will reach us through the mind and body alike, an assault as it were, tending eventually its pitch to a crescendo, yet curiously not without a delicate lull.Kubrick's cinema is, as usually, a sight to behold. We get the adventurous camera that prowls through the lavish corridors of the Overlook Hotel like it is some kind of mystic labyrinth rife for exploration, linear tracking shots exposing impeccably decorated interiors in symmetric grandeur. The geometrical approach in how Kubrick perceives space reminds me very much of Japanese directors of some 10 years before. In that what is depicted in the frame, the elements of narrative, is borderline inconsequential to how they all balance and harmonize together.Certain images stand out in this. The first shot of Jack's typewriter, ominously accompanied by the off-screen thumps of a ball, drums of doom that seem to emanate from the very walls or the typewriter itself, an instrument of doom in itself as is later shown. A red river flowing through the hotel's elevators in a poetry of slow motions. Jack hitting the door with the axe, the camera moving along with him, tracking the action as it happens, as though it's the camera piercing through the door and not the axe. The ultra fast zoom in the kid's face violently thrusting us inside his head before we see the two dead girls from his POV. And of course, the epochal bathroom scene.Much has been said of Jack Nicholson's obtrusive overacting. His mad is not entirely successful, because, well, he's Jack Nicholson. The guy looks half-mad anyway. Playing mad turns him into an exaggerated caricature of himself. Shelley Duvall on the other hand is one of the most inspired casting choices Kubrick ever made. Coming from a streak of fantastic performances for Robert Altman in the seventies (3 WOMEN, THIEVES LIKE US, NASHVILLE), she brings to her character the right amounts of swanlike fragility and emotional distress.

King Shining,"I have not yet watched the TV version of the Shining. You know the one Stephen King actually likes and prefers to Kubricks version of his novel. But I cannot imagine it being better than this one. And while I have not read the book King wrote (and therefor cannot tell you the differences of how you should feel about King not liking it), I do like this movie very much.Saying there is attention to detail would be one major understatement. There is a documentary who interprets all the details of the film and goes quite far out at times, but more on that elsewhere. The movie at hand has powerhouse performances. Watching some behind the scenes footage, gives you quite the feeling of what went on.Some may have had issues with the way Kubrick went on to do things, the amount of takes he demanded, the way he behaved allegedly and much more. But the results on the screen speak for themselves. You may not like horror movies and yet still find something here. You also may like horror movies and think this isn't a horror movie at all.

"Whether you want black comedy or horror, Kubrick delivers it all with this one.","... This isn't the first time Stanley blurred the distinction between genres to such great effect, either. In Dr. Strangelove you had a comedy about a horrific situation, and here the basis is a terrifying scenario which actually yields some very funny moments. Slow-burning madness and attempting to kill one's family isn't hilarious of course, but the dialogue is very knowing (""five months of peace is just what I want... "") and there is a terrific drinking scene which would be riotous if you included just one type of spirit, but is spine-chilling when you factor in the other.I disagree with those who say that the hotel has a negligible effect on Jack Torrance in the filmed version. The cues Nicholson provides the audience as an actor merely hint at the potential for madness, which is only reinforced when we learn that the head of the family has struggled with alcoholism and is emotionally distant from his wife and son. The environment that he is in, however, then absorbs those personality defects and unleashes them upon his consciousness. In much the same way as buildings are sometimes thought to soak up events that happen there, the hotel feeds on the frailties of a troubled but sane man, and uses his weaknesses against him to eventually take him beyond the point of no return. He may have dormant flaws in his personality before he arrives, but to me the Overlook itself is the trigger that sets them off.Kubrick's cold and detached approach to directing works splendidly for a chilly horror film, and the unpredictable force of nature that is Jack Nicholson teeters all the time between making you giggle and scaring the wits out of you. When he explodes, you won't be sure how far he can go. Together they made a great team and with a blend of their talents gave us a classic.

A Push Past the Source Material to Something Greater,"All alone in a hotel for months on end, nothing but you your family and the ghosts of the family murdered there. (The Shining) is known as the greatest horror film ever and it has earned that title. This film is able to get you closer and closer to the edge of your with every second passing and keep you guessing at every turn. Terror seeps from just the title of this not only due to the horror themes but because of the direction, story telling, acting, and imagery.
A recovering drunk is trying to land a job to support his wife and five year old wife, so he gets an interview to be the caretaker of the Overlook Hotel. The ensuing months at the hotel turn out to be a little more than the family can take at this hotel. Accompanying the Jack Torrance (the recovering alcoholic) is his wife Wendy who is a typical housewife and their son Danny who happens to have special power. There are a couple other characters in the film but only that plays a role into the story, Halloran. He is the cook of the hotel who happens to share the same ability as Danny.
This movie is not only seen as the greatest horror film but as a great film among all genres. This film is absolutely brilliant it Kubrick hits on every note here. He has a very interesting way of making his films that I find odd sometimes, I like some of his films while I hate some of his others but I love this one and the direction that he took King's story. However the biggest the part of this movie that has stuck with me since first watch and is part of what made me want to be in film is Jack Nicholson's performance. The progression of his character was so perfect and made for such a nail biter. There is in a scene in this movie that made my skin crawl due to his his portrait of Jack Torrance, the ""dull boy"" scene. I saw this movie at a very young age it was never the scariest movie for me upon the first couple viewings but as I got older I started to appreciate the filming techniques used and the acting and the brilliant imagery.
Next to the performances in the movie my favorite part of (The Shining) is the setting. The narrow hallways and open lounging rooms feel very small. Something that I love more anything in horror films is isolation. (The Thing), (Invasion of the Body Snatchers) and even (The Exorcist) all of them create such a tight feeling of isolation. This feeling is created here ten fold with the family being in this huge hotel you wouldn't think so but the surrounding snow keeping them in and having someone in the hotel start to lose it as well as the thoughts that someone might be in the hotel with you harming your child, makes the hotel a lot smaller and smaller. Kubrick made the this place so small and awful for the characters. When the characters have nowhere to run to and nowhere to hide than the viewers feel the same way trapped and stuck and this was felt very strongly for Wendy and Danny.
There is a lot that kubrick added to this story that made it the film the that it is today. A big thing that Kubrick added that King didn't have in the book was the feeling of suspense, the feeling made by unanswered questions. He leaves so many things unknown as far as the mystery of what is going on and what is happening in the hotel. This is what makes the movie a horror film for me. It leaves so much to keep you thinking then all of the sudden another curve ball is thrown and you have to find out what is going on this time.
There is one message that stuck with me throughout this film and was solidified in the end shot is the message that you can not escape your fate. This feels very strong throughout the film as things progress, and it can be seen in some of the characters. I can not get to much into this message or any message without giving away some of the movie for those that have yet to see it.
Before I rewatched this movie the other day I read the novel, I had always wanted to read the novel to see what all the fuse that Stephen King put up about he film. After finishing it I can understand why there was a lot of stuff that was left out including some of the turmoil that Jack Torrance felt about his addiction to alcohol. So I understand why he was upset but I felt Kubrick enhanced the story to make an amazing adaptation of this film. I have seen the film countless times and I love films So naturally I draw more towards them than books but I have read and watched a lot of the greatest horror stories and have liked a lot of the books more and I do not understand how moving the story to the silver screen could mess it up that bad. Watching this movie and reading the book I get why there is a large group that is lead by King in the hate for the adaptation. With all of that being said I felt as though King was spoon feeding me every little detail that he thought of so I am and have always loved the film more that is not to say that I didn't like book I just happen to love the movie.
This is one of the greats. The shining was groundbreaking for films, not just on the horror side of it. The cinematography in this movie is some of the best I have ever scene and the way we are able to dive into a crashing mind to see what is going on is brilliant in this movie there are some thing that happen towards the end of the movie that upset some people but I loved it and I feel it adds to the feeling of the Overlook Hotel as a character. The acting in this movie was amazing and almost perfect. One flaw I had with the movie was Shelley Duvall as Wendy, she played very well when she was terrified but for the scenes when she is calm and happy I find her acting very out of place and like she has the script in her hands to deliver those lines. That is the only problem I can see in this movie though, it ""Shines"" on every other level for me. With only one flaw it is hard to rate this movie on a scale of one to five, so I would give Stanley Kubrick's (The Shining) a 9.5/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
All play and no work makes Jack (Nicholson) a VERY dull boy. . .,"It's certainly not a new complaint in relation to this film, but I must register it anyway: Jack Nicholson's acting here is all wrong for the material. Instead of a slow buildup from banality to insanity - which, given the movie's otherwise brilliant creepiness of tone and style - could have been truly horrific to watch, we get Jack Torrance as the nutjob Big Bad Wolf right from the very beginning. It's weird: it's as if Kubrick is indeed making the ultimate horror film, and Nicholson is sabotaging it every step of the way by enacting the ultimate horror film *parody*. Each on its own terms is immensely enjoyable, but they effectively cancel each other out. I've never seen the styles of director and star diverge so emphatically (A minor comparison would be the first ""Fletch"" movie, where Michael Ritchie's taut direction is appropriate to a gritty crime thriller, but where star Chevy Chase waltzes through the vehicle glibly throwing darts into every dramatic setup).However, there's no point in blaming Nicholson for the mess - this was clearly the way Kubrick wanted the part to be played. Perfectionist and control freak that he was, you don't believe for a minute that any inch of a Kubrick film isn't exactly how he wanted it; he certainly wouldn't allow a mere *actor* to steamroll his well-laid plans, not even one as forceful and magnetic as Jack Nicholson. Still, this movie - together with Batman, and even One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest - soured me on Jack for a long time; I found in him an actor far too willing to coast on his personality and to ham it up mercilessly, rather than bother to actually create a recognizable human being. Such a technique is fine, even commendable, for farceurs like Jim Carrey or Paul Reubens (either one of which would probably have been just as effective as Nicholson is here at being Jack Torrance) but we should expect more from our so-called Dramatic Actors. It wasn't until I saw some of his more restrained, nuanced work in such films as Ironweed, Wolf, The King of Marvin's Gardens, and even (amazingly) Easy Rider that I realized what a truly fine performer Nicholson can be when he is forced to, as it were, paint in between the lines (by the way, no complaints from me about his Oscar for As Good As It Gets - he's the only actor alive who could have made that part work the way it did). It's just too bad Kubrick didn't decide to use him this way; watching Jack Torrance go from a diffident, restrained man (watch the first part of Wolf to see how surprisingly well Nicholson can play such a character) to a rampaging lunatic would have been truly frightening (even with the extra bit of campiness Nicholson throws in - ""Heeere's Johnny!"", etc). It would have been as if the Overlook Hotel unleashed some primordial demon from the depths of an essentially decent man. The way it plays now, Jack's evil and insanity are loudly telegraphed from the very beginning (those dancing eyebrows of his NEVER stop!) - all that's left is to go through the motions.Of course, there are some pretty startling motions to go through in this movie; Kubrick's technical brilliance and his ability to create an engrossing mise en scene ensure that the film can never be seen as a total failure. In fact, when Nicholson is offscreen, the goosebump factor here is actually pretty high. The long tracking shots of Danny riding his Big Wheel through the winding hotel corridors are justly famous, as is the very design of the Overlook's wide open - yet paradoxically oppressive - map room (where Jack does his ""writing""): these sequences effectively make the Overlook into a character itself. The isolation of it, its stillness and quiet, and most importantly its labyrinthian hugeness serve to overwhelm the tiny family and break down whatever bond they may have (which, again, would have been so much more effective if we felt this family was ever bonded in the first place). Kubrick ingeniously avoids shock devices, for the most part, and creates his spooky atmosphere through an almost inhuman stillness and quiet - which effectively creates an undertow of dread and expectation in the viewer. Quite simply, there are images and flash-cuts in this movie that will get under your skin and that you will never be able to shake - they will haunt your subconscience forever (deliciously). None more so than the truly classic moment where Wendy, the wife, finally discovers what it is Jack has been ""writing"" all this time: I can think of few movie moments in history that are so gut-bustingly hilarious and at one and the same time so bone-chillingly frightening and perverse. For this one moment alone, the film demands a viewing.It's simply too bad that Kubrick felt the need to invade the sanctity of his gothic cathedral like setting with the over the top rantings and ravings of the town lunatic. Not that that lunatic is not one devil of a fun guy to hiss and laugh at, it's just that he belongs in a different movie - the Evil Dead flicks, maybe, or one of Freddy Krueger's opuses. This conflict in styles between star and director ultimately make The Shining, for me at least, a frustrating experience: I keep wishing one of them would just get out of the other's way. The Shining could have been one of the hammiest and most enjoyable grand guignol horror experiences ever, or it could have been perhaps the most finely crafted and subtly shaded psychological thriller of all time. Alas, it cannot be both - and in trying to do so, it effectively undermines itself at every turn.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Horrid Movie,"Stephen King is one of the greatest American novelists in the past century. While he is dubbed a ""horror writer,"" he is much more than that. He is a character writer, and while his novels are intended to scare, characters are the central point of the novels. They rely so heavily on backstory that the characters are practically real. However, this is very hard to do on film and it can result in making the story seem unimportant. So, as you can expect, I was not eager to see how they could ruin The Shining. Well, after reading the spectacular novel, I moved onto the film. After watching the film, I was flaming mad. The film The Shining does not fail from their overuse of backstory. These characters are completely shallow and you don't care about them. King novels are hard to adapt, but they can be done well. Carrie is an example of that. However, this movie is an awful adaptation. Kubrick basically took some character names, some locations, and made his own ""scary hotel"" movie. Why he couldn't just make his own ""scary hotel"" movie, I don't know. The acting is, for the most part, garbage. Shelley Duvall gives one of the worst performances I've ever seen. She's just so awful that you want her to get killed, as opposed to the novel. I just felt that I didn't care about anybody in this film. It felt empty and like there was no point to anything in the end. King said that he doesn't like the film because it doesn't make you feel. I agree completely with that. I felt nothing other than lack of interest when I watched this stinker. It wasn't even passable as a good stand-alone film. I hated every minute of this film. It was supposedly psychological horror, but it didn't make me think at all.

Aswell with the continuous heartbeat which makes it uncomfortable and ads to the atmosphere of the film.Its very well put together, intense and complicated, but very well made. One of the best psychological horrorfilms out there!It has moments where it gets a bit too much and exaggerated. But those are very few scenes.Did also expect a more clearer storyline.Very good and interesting ending! Trapped in a cycle of violence that continues throughout generations.I really recommend this great piece! A must watch!",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
What to say....,"Don't get me wrong, the originality of the story is great, mainly because it was done before all of those abandoned but ""haunted"" hotels, motels, houses, whatever kind of building scenario. But I thought the movie moved at a time dragging pace, the whole shot of Danny Torrence rolling around on his tricycle left me wondering...""What was the director thinking?"" A lot of the things that happened in the movie made no sense to me really. The book I thought was much more clear and less abstract on the transformation of Jack Torrence. I also thought the betrayal of Jack Torrence's character was wrong. We essentially knew nothing about him or his family, other than Danny was having bad dreams, then it starts with the Torrence's taking over of the hotel for the winter and Jack has lost his mind.I loved how it was done in the book, you got a good feel for who Jack was and where he had come from and you felt good about him. When they go to the hotel the symptoms Jack experienced where eye widening. He was chewing on the aspirin, losing his temper and getting major headaches, all conclusive to when he was drinking, but he wasn't. I thought the movie missed a little on that. The movie by itself however seemed to want to breath a life of it's own rather than paying homage to the novel it came from. I guess when it came down to it, I really had no care for the wife and child. Danny walking around saying redrum was really one of the most annoying things I have ever had to watch. But because the film was so slow to progress that when the climax finally showed up it failed to make up for lost time and attention.All in all, an O.K. movie, but I really don't see what the hype was all about in the this other than the famous ""Here's JOHNNY!"" line. Watch it if you wish, obviously it has a 8.5 on IMDb for a reason...",5.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Jack Torrance Meets David Bowman,"What can I say about the scariest movie I have ever seen that has not already been said by others more articulate than yours truly?  Do not view this film expecting to see a screen version of the Stephen King novel. Rather, this is a Stanley Kubrick film, and to fully appreciate it one should judge it within the context of Kubrick's entire body of work as a serious filmmaker.  Thematically, THE SHINING relates most closely to 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, though flourishes of PATHS OF GLORY, A CLOCKWORK ORANGE and BARRY LYNDON do manage to figure prominently in the film's overall technique.In a nutshell (no pun intended), Jack Nicholson and Shelly Duvall co-star with Oregon's Timberline Lodge - enlisted to portray the exterior of the Overlook Hotel - in a story that appears on the surface to be about ghosts and insanity, but deals with issues of child abuse, immortality and duality.What the film might lack initially in terms of coherence is more than made up for in technique.  Garrett Brown (the male voice in those old Molson Golden commercials), inventor of the Steadicam, chases young Danny Lloyd through hotel corridors and an amazing snow maze, providing magic-carpet-ride fluidity to scenes that ten years earlier would have been impossible to accomplish.  If the film starts off too slow, remember who the director is.  This man likes to take his time, and the results are well worth it: incredible aerial shots of the Overlook Hotel; horrific Diane Arbus-inspired twins staring directly at us; portentous room 237 and its treasure trove of terrible secrets; elevators that gush rivers of blood in slow-motion; Jack Torrance's immortality found via the hotel (akin to David Bowman's journey through the Space Gate); and some of the best use of pre-existing music ever assembled for a motion picture.It would take a book to examine and defend the film's strong points and drawbacks.  If you've never seen it, you owe it to yourself to watch it alone with the lights off, with no interruptions, and make sure that it's raining.  This is a cinematic experience that changed my life at the age of 14.  Makes a great double feature with Robert Wise's 1963 thriller THE HAUNTING.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
The Shining Is A Scary Horror Thriller,"The Shining is a scary horror thriller from the late acclaimed director Stanley Kurbick whose admirable in making this movie based on a book by Stephen King by giving audiences almost everything they could except from this kind of genre. Jack Nicholson turns in a great performance of Jack Torrence a writer who slowly begins to slip into insanity because he's being influenced by the dark evil spiritual forces that haunt an isolated hotel in the mountains of Colorado where he and his family are staying as caretakers during the winter. Nicholson is convincing as Jack playing a man whose losing his mind because of the evil spirits that haunt the hotel. Shelley Duvuall is okay as Jack's wife Wendy but nothing memorable. None offense. The rest of the cast including the young boy who played their son are good in their roles as well. The Shining has enough scares, suspense, creepy moments, and surprises. The music seemed to sync well with the tone of the film. It also added to the suspense and creep factor. The running time of over two and a half hours does make it feel a little long but the rest makes up for the movies few flaws. With it's few flaws aside The Shining is definitely one of the best horror films out there and I recommend this to any fan of the genre if you can get past the long running rime. Overall The Shining is an effective horror thriller with suspense, scares, anticipation, creepy moments, surprises, and good performances by the cast especially Nicholson who make this movie worth the time to watch.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Eerie Stanley Kubrick and Stephen King masterpiece!,"Spiraling madness done best in the most convoluted way! Among Jack Nicholson's best performances, so meticulous and sticks with you like molasses in the brain. The long shots are true art in film and Jack losing his mind is one of my favorite things ever! It shakes you to your core every time, I have seen it at least 6 times; it's always shocking.

"May Not Be Kubrick's Masterpiece, But It's Still a Masterpiece","Kubrick spent his 40+ year career proving that no matter what the genre he will, not only do it well, but will dominate it. The Shining is no exception. A filmed nightmare, it's a naturalistically still and insistently surreal mixture of thick mood and rich story. A maze of surprises even after multiple viewings, its terror hovers right under the surface before exploding onto our brains. A masterpiece of hypnotic horror that's as insidiously, mind-bogglingly creepy as ever. At the center is the ever-menacing presence of Nicholson. Presenting a sobering lesson in how to not be a husband / father (and not just because of the violent climax), his dementia begins unraveling from moment one. Despite his iconically villainous turn, I'm not sure he's even the best of the bunch. Crothers brings beautiful lightness when needed, and his darker moments that much more powerful; and Lloyd walks a brilliant tightrope between creepy-horror-kid, average boyhood, and haunting sadness. Above all, Duvall's compelling and deeply broken turn as forlorn wife / mother is beyond perfect. These performers are given a directorial assuredness to play in rarely matched outside of Kubrick. The plight of these characters is captured with such empathy, we're given a personal view of what could easily have been a cold experience. Every detail is so intentionally and perfectly placed to draw us into the growing madness of the Overlook Hotel: The blood-flood, the dead-eyed stares, the symmetry of the twins, the normally-calm camera ferociously following the swinging axe. Meticulously crafted, intellectually provocative, emotionally penetrating, and dementedly entertaining, though Shining may not be Kubrick's best, it would be most filmmakers magnum opus.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
One of the greatest films ever!,"The Shining is a thought-provoking meditation on madness, isolation and paranoia that presents the demanding perfectionist that is Stanley Kubrick in majestic form, as it defies everything that was usually a norm in the genre of horror back then yet puts on screen a cinema that is now regarded as the definitive example of atmospheric horror. Immortal for its contribution to horror, a staple of pop culture, and a classic amalgamation of superb direction, deft writing, innovative camerawork, skillful editing, menacing score and steadfast performances featuring one of the greatest of all time with Jack Nicholson's, The Shining remains one of the greatest achievements of its genre and the cinematic artform in general. It's only getting better with every passing year, and definitely ranks amongst Stanley Kubrick's finest works.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"

The Grand Opera Of Horror Films,"What can I say about this film? The first time I saw this was many years ago as a teenager, a few friends and I were up drinking, watching movies, when my friend suggested this, said he heard it was scary, none of us had seen it, and seeing as it was gone midnight, we thought why not, it scared the hell out of us, it was fantastic, I've seen the film countless times since then and while it no longer creeps me out in the same way as a young fresh faced teen, it still entertains me nonetheless.From the opening scenes of the movie, I was hooked straight away, the cinematography and the films score were absolutely hypnotic, really draws you into the whole eerie atmosphere and sense of impending doom.The film starts with Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) being offered a job as caretaker of the Overlook Hotel during the winter months, his son Danny already seems to know he has been offered the job, being told so by Tony, his seemingly imaginary friend who lives in his throat.Jack, his wife Wendy and Danny travel to the Overlook Hotel on its last day open before the shutdown, getting their as the guests and members of staff are leaving.
They meet with Manager Mr Ullman and the Overlook Chef, Dick Halloran, who has an instant connection with Danny due to certain abilities they both share, Halloran calls it ""Shining"", they can see certain things, speak to each other telepathically and even sense impending danger, Danny senses something bad in the Overlook and Halloran warns him to stay away from one room in particular.After a short period, Jack himself is starting to become more withdrawn, and his behaviour strange, it seems the bad things Danny sensed are starting to affect Jack, and some very strange and sinister forces are at work within the Overlook, and they don't like Danny's gift.This for me is an absolute cinematic masterpiece in horror, Kubrick's whole style here may not be for everyone (Stephen King himself hated what Kubrick did to his excellent Novel), but it works wonders for me, the music, the suspense, the cinematography, the overlook itself is a wonderfully isolated and creepy building whom no-one in their right mind would want to spend the winter months their amidst all the madness, some complain about the acting but for me it's not a problem, this is a horror film a bit of over the top and hammy is fine by me.This will be always hold a place in my heart, and will always be one of my all time favourite horrors, turn off the lights, and enjoy.10/10.

This movie has stood the test of time and will forever be praised as one of the greatest achievements in cinema,"The Shining is directed by Stanley Kubrick and is a horror movie based on the novel by Steven King. In reviewing this film, there's probably nothing I can say that hasn't already been said about this masterpiece. This movie has stood the test of time and will forever be praised as one of the greatest achievements in cinema. From the production design, to the performances, the movie is unmatched. The atmosphere Kubrick creates in The Shining is in my opinion, the reason why this movie has suck around as long as it has. The Overlook Hotel is a character in itself. The way the music in the opening credits establishes the feeling of this setting whilst the camera travels through nature leading to to hotel, just instantly impacts the audience, immediately immersing them into the world. Once you enter the hotel, you feel as though you are really there living through the characters. Jack Nicholson's performance as Jack Torrance is beyond perfect. He presents the slow progression of insanity so authentically, which ultimately leads to one of the most iconic climaxes of all time. His wife played my Shelley Duvall does an amazing job with a performance so over the top is actually works. The son, Danny Torrance is probably my favourite character in the movie. He easily could have ruined the film but he does a fantastic job in delivering some absurd lines which I still genuinely get so creeped out by. The Shining is a film lovers dream. And whilst Steven king didn't like the film, how can one not marvel at all the symmetry, vibrant colour palette and perfect set design. Seriously I know the Overlook Hotel is haunted, but I would check into that place any day. To walk through the ballroom, see the iconic carpet and use that unusually modern red bathroom would be a dream. The Shining is one of my favourites movies ever. And whilst this review probably doesn't mean anything because this film has already seen enough praise, I'm still going to give it a 10/10. If you haven't seen The Shining get off your phone and go watch it right now. Seriously it's a classic how haven't you watched it yet?",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
One of The Best Horror Films Ever,"I was kinda surprised when I heard that Stanly Kubrick had made a horror film and that it was The Shinning was a big shock to me. Kubrick is one of my favorite film makers and after I saw 2001 and Clockwork Orange I had to see his other movies. I had heard a lot about this movie and kinda a lot of the scenes but I really didn't remember this movie that well. So I rent the movie and watch it as soon as I got home and loved it. This is one of my favorite movies even though I really do not like the horror movies. Jack Nicholson give his best performance(have not seen One Flow Over The Cuckoo's Nest).Sherry Duvall and Danny Loyd do better good but I didn't like their performances. The thing I didn't like about this movie is that the shinning in the story is wear the Danny can do a lot of telepathic things with his head, which I thought was kinda random. Even though that the things I didn't like about this movie really bug me I still love this movie. This is a great movie if like to see another Stanley Kubrick film or just want to watch the one of the best horror films out there.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Overrated Horror,"Unfortunately it did not, but now I know what I don't like most about these movies: it's the terrible pacing. Despite having all the time in the world, Kubrick is simply incapable of escalating the tension gradually. I felt the same thing during A Space Odyssey where nothing happened for hours and then the computer went crazy in a span of 5 minutes.Here, Jack Torrance who is obviously supposed to go crazy gradually during their stay seems to be mad right from the start, so the director basically skips the interesting part. This also means that he can't really take the character any further and even Jack Nicholson's cartoonish overacting gets boring after a while, and you're just waiting for the never-ending chase scene to be over so you can move on to other things.Simply, overrated.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
The Shining - Better Than Average Horror Satire,"Jack Nicholson gives the best tongue-in-cheek satire performance of his career, as he resurrects his early day role in Little Shop of Horrors, another fine horror satire. His co-star, Olive Oyl, I mean Shelley Duvall, is very good as the clueless wife. The real star of this film, however, is the director and his camera work; very few, if any, directors, could match Stanley Kubrick as a body of work. His camera angles and creation of atmosphere are second to none, in this tale about a man who takes a job he can't handle.Although the plot is mundane, Kubrick raises it out of the ordinary kaka of the horror genre, to a genuinely spooky film. However, despite everyone's fine efforts to make this a classic; it falls short. Not that there is anything wrong with that (apologies to Seinfeld).",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
If only Kubrick's ability to write matched his visuals......,"Well, this just didn't work. Like Stephen King once said, it's all beautiful on the outside, but it has no essence (I am paraphrasing).First of all, the cast. No disrespect to anyone, but no one sold their character to me. I've only seen Jack Nicholson in other movies, and he is usually a terrific actor. But his portrayal here, I'm afraid to say, sucked. Duvall actually did a better job here, in my opinion, but her character also needed work.Next, the script. Awful. They took the premise of the book and placed it in their vision of a scary hotel. They didn't even try to make sense of it, they just scrambled a bunch of scenes from the book with a couple of scary scenes, that heavily rely on Kubrick's director skills, and we are left with this mess.This is actually the first Kubrick movie I've seen. And, he is a good director. Cinematography and soundtrack are really exceptional and iconic. But, he lacks talent to make a good story (and believable characters) and connect it with visual masterpiece he envisioned.I'm rating it 3/10 for the cinematography and soundtrack, that really deliver the horror. But, everything else in this movie is simply bad and needed a lot of work. If it was made by someone who is aware of their strengths (visuals) and weaknesses (story and characters), this would probably be one of my favourite films. This way, I'm left with a few beautiful images and disappointment for the potential they wasted.",3.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"

Deserves its reputation as one of the best Horror movies.,"I did not have very high expectations from this movie before watching it, as many popular and famous films turn out to be not as good as claimed by their fans. But Shining actually turned out to be as good as most viewers has described it. This is not one of the scariest movies but it still has very unique and eerie atmosphere which it maintains through out the whole duration of the movie. Performances of everyone are quite good, especially that of Jack Nicholson. I also have to praise the performances of two actors Joe Turkel & Philip Stone who played relatively minor roles but both stole their respective scenes through their awesome acting. Script of the film is just fantastic. There are so many powerful scenes that give a highly creepy vibe without the use of excessive blood or gore. This movie can work as both a psychological horror as well as supernatural thriller. Overall, this is a masterpiece by Stanley Kubrick. I wish he had made more horror movies.In the end, I would say, as long as you are not expecting a lot of gore, this is a must watch for every horror fan.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Amazing horror movie that still haunts its viewers even after 41 years!,"I had always been curious about this movie because it's considered by many among the greatest horror movies of all time (even tho some think it has aged a lot) and I have always liked Jack Nicholson as I consider him among the best actors that has ever lived. So on Halloween Night two years ago I saw it, and yes, it both haunted me and made me appreciate the performances and its style.Jack Torrance (Nicholson) is a former school teacher that has problems of alcoholism and retired in order to become a writer. After a meeting in an office he accepts the job of being the keeper of the Overlook Hotel for the winter with his wife Wendy and child Danny. Jack sees this as a golden opportunity as being in such a large building all by himself will help him in writing his new book. However trouble is behind the corner as after a while it begins to snow heavily to the point that they will be stuck there for at least 6 months and there isn't a drink in sight as Jack is an alcoholic in recovery. And the entire place is so scary and haunting that it severely afflicts both father and son and especially Jack has hallucinating visions and even can't continue his book. I won't spoil the rest if you hadn't seen it yet.So what I loved about the movie? I loved the soundtrack because it added a lot to the scare factor and it really causes goosebumps in the scariest moments of the movie. The cinematography and athmosphere were quite tense and it's so innovating for 1980s standards especially in the long shots.Jack Nicholson here gives probably one of his greatest performances of his career. For some he seriously over-acted and it looks a bit buffoonish, but for me he was great as a man who slowly descends to madness and I especially loved when he finds Wendy in the living room and he smashes the door with an axe, leading to the most iconic scene in the movie ''Here's Johnny!''. The wife and kid look so frightened about the scary presences that are there (such as the two twins or the river of blood falling down the stairs) and the viewer can feel their sheer fear.I have to point out that this movie is very for adults. The language (with a few profanities here and there) and the disturbing and graphic scenes (like when Jack is in the living room and imagines to discuss with a ghostly bartender) are really something you should consider if you are very young or you have kids and want to watch this movie.So, since I gave a 9, it's clear that I really liked the movie. Sure the scares were at times too much (and I was even having dinner while watching it so imagine the scene!) but the acting was great and I know that many even today are half scared to death after they watch it. I sometimes watch horrors and I have to say it, this really achieves its goal well!Even with its shortcomings, it's one of those movies that has to be seen at least once not only because it has been parodied on lots of TV shows (such as THE SIMPSONS or FAMILY GUY) but also because of its greatness. I recommend it especially to horror fans.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"

"9.3/10 - Swelling, Swelling Madness","""I'm sorry to differ with you sir, but *you*...are the caretaker. You've always been the caretaker. I should know, sir. I've *always* been here.""The Shining just became my favorite Kubrick film up to this date, and one of my favorite films in general.The film (which is based on a Stephen King novel) follows a family who moves into an isolated hotel for the winter (as the caretakers of the hotel for the season). As time goes on, they realize that something's wrong with the hotel. Something is watching, pumping, waiting for blood as the madness starts to crawl in.I'm telling you guys, that's the first time that I'm totally blown away by a horror film. Everything here is just phenomenal.The score, for example, is used in a brilliant, precise way to emphasize moments, draw you into the film, give it an eerie feeling, swells as things are getting more and more intense, synchronized with the movement of the characters at time. It's amazing.Jack Nicholson also blew me away here. His performance may seem a little awkward at first, but don't let that fool you. He delivers every line perfectly, giving life to the father of the family, Jack Torrance.Talking about precision, it's so insane to think about the amount of things to unpack here. You can totally enjoy this film without diving into the little hints in the cinematography, the motifs, the meaning of it all, but when you do dive in - well, that's what makes this film so great in my opinion. Everything is so dense and layered, in the best way possible. The Shining will send a chill down your spine one way or another, but diving into it really made it much, much better.I'd recommend specifically to check out Rob Ager's site or videos, he has some brilliant observations about this film.And also, to be honest, I don't really have any noteable issue with this film. I think that the only thing might be how the pacing is a little weird by the end (cutting between the Overlook to another place), but it's so minor and insignificant that I think I mentioned only to give this film SOME criticism XDBut seriously, this film is amazing. It's a dense, eerie and psychological horror film. And it's a slow, slow burn, but when you feel the heat, the swelling madness, the chill that crawls down your spine again...well. You realize how brilliant it is. I'm giving The Shining a 9.3/10. Do yourself a favor and watch this film, especially if you like horror or psychological films.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Never gets old,"Perfect movie for Halloween. One of my favourites of all time. Unsettling without the jump scares. Intriguing and mysterious. It's style assures it will always be a classic.That said, it is not a solid adaptation of Stephen King's novel and his fans should be aware of this fact. The movie itself is perfect, but it does change a bit. There is too little time used to show the humanity and struggles of Jack Torrance. Nicholson's acting does not help out. Even if the male lead is charismatic, his expressions alone make him much more of a psycho than what he was in the book. This adaptation should be taken as loosely based on a popular book. It's own twist on the story. In that way it's, as I wrote previously, a real classic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Ponderous but visually effective,"An American psychological horror; A story about an aspiring writer who takes a caretaking job at a remote mountain hotel in the off-season, but his sanity is destroyed by visions which put his family in danger. This gothic film has a very effective setting for a sense of foreboding and intrigue, and it is brilliantly photographed with many scenes that can be savoured for their stylish composition. Stanley Kubrick's flawless technical direction calls attention to itself by its slow pacing which results in a Distancing Effect which does not serve the horror genre well; the viewer needs to be totally immersed. The psychological tension is slowly brought to a tautness, but Jack Nicholson's manic and jumpy side is revealed too early for any mystery to take hold. Kubrick aims for a metaphysical statement about evil and primal fear rather than give his audience characters to relate to, which is interesting, but his meaning, and the explanation for the psychological strain of a man's long months of isolation, is left to viewer interpretation with few clues.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
A Cold and Heartless Film,"I'm firmly under the impression that people judge films purely on single scenes and iconic imagery rather than actual depth and storytelling. Case and point: this film.
The imagery is breathtaking. So many iconic scenes and images that leave a lasting impression on your mind. And this is what people remember.
But then, you start to think about the actual story. Jack Torrence's slow decent into madness was neither slow, surprising or influenced by his environment. And that's what really kills this movie. I can honestly say, if the Overlook was not haunted, this movie, as presented, would have had the exact same ending. It is really a look into an imbittered drunk who goes mad from cabin fever. Everything that goes on around him is irrelevant. Is that the point? If so, it is truely a wasted opportunity as now any adaptation that is made in the future will be judged against this and be panned for telling an actual story.

A true masterpiece and must see,"The Shining (1980) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently rewatched on HBOMAX. The storyline follows a writer who agrees to overlook a hotel in Colorado during the winter months when it's closed down. His son has an imaginary friend that helps him see things. When the family arrives at the hotel he tries to warn the family something is off but they feel it's just him adjusting. The hotel brings lies and secrets about the family to the surface. When a snowstorm hits the hotel that won't let anyone in or out the families hope for surviving the winter diminishes.This movie is directed by icon Stanley Kubrick (A Clockwork Orange) and stars Jack Nicholson (Chinatown), Shelley Duvall (Popeye), Danny Lloyd (Doctor Sleep), Scatman Crothers (One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest) and Joe Turkel (Bladerunner).The cinematography and soundtrack for this is legendary. The ability to capture the daunting landscape of the circumstances and portray the intensity of the isolation with background music is magnificent. The acting is out of this world and Nicholson, Duvall and Lloyd deliver all time great performances. Nicholson's evolution as a character is perfectly portrayed. Kubrick had to be very clever with the times and how he portrayed Nicholsons childhood abuses as well as how Nicholson was sexually abusing Danny. It's very subtle but smart simultaneously. There will never be a time that the talking finger and blood elevator isn't creepy and the use of redrum will be a catch phrase for eternity. Every second of this movie is a masterpiece but the last 20 minutes will go down as one of the best finales to any movie ever, in and out of the horror genre.Overall, this is an all time great movie of any genre. Kubrick really put everything into this picture, more than the audience can even capture with the imagination. A true masterpiece and a must see. I would score this a 10/10 and consider it required viewing for anyone who enjoys movies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Much-maligned but still a great horror film,"First of all, I loved the book. It remains my favorite Stephen King novel. Secondly, the TV adaption was well done. Still, I think Kubrick did a great job at creating the atmopshere necessary for a good, scary movie. It's full of incredible visuals, and great tracking shots (especially when we follow Danny riding on his big wheel through the hotel hallways). Sure, Nicholson gives an over-the-top performance but...that's what he does in almost every movie he's in. Have you ever heard of him giving a ""restrained"" performance? Shelley Duvall is okay. Actually, Rebecca DeMornay was a big improvement in the TV movie. I know King fans who absolutely hate this movie. They say Kubrick changed too many plot points and ruined the whole thing. I say there's more than one way to tell a good story. King did it very well, and so did Kubrick...just in a different way. I'd rank The Shining up there with the best horror films of all time, along side ""The Bride of Frankenstein"", ""Psycho"", and ""The Exorcist"", among others. It actually reminds me of another superb haunted house movie: ""The Haunting"", from the early '60s. Both movies create that sense of isolation; the fear of turning the next corner or opening the door everyone is afraid to open.

Not Exactly the Novel but Very Good,"While this movie version of the Stephen King novel is not exactly pure in its telling of the original work it is still very, very good. In fact, it created a defining and memorable look at horror that has Kubrick's stamp all over it. Jack Nicholson masterfully plays the lead role. The visuals and the cinematography are so eerie and so memorable they are haunting. Kubrick does wonders with images. This film is no exception. The music is eery.

Wasn't really scared,I decided to watch this movie for Halloween since it's considered one of the best horror movies out there. I really don't have any complaints on this movie except that it was long and there were no scary moments in it for me.I was expecting more of the weird scary moments that you saw in the middle and kind of at the end. It would have been nice if we could have dove more into the history and background of this hotel because that was the interesting side of things. I just didn't really feel scared I didn't feel like I was watching much of a horror movie.I will agree that everyone played their part well I just think there could have been scarier moments put into it. But then again I wouldn't really know what to consider scary since I can't remember the last time I was scared in a movie.,7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
"Good film, bad adaptation","I know The Shining has a special place in the hearts of many cinema lovers, and I understand why-there are so many excellent elements in this film.While I don't think Kubrick delivers his best movie here, he certainly does a commendable job. Actors like Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall give outstanding performances-in fact, the entire cast is impressive.However, I think the film's biggest weakness is its pacing over the two-hour runtime, especially for those who have read the book. For example, the character of Dick Hallorann feels underutilized; he's so minimized in the movie that removing him wouldn't affect the plot much, which is unfortunate. In the novel, he's crucial, particularly for Danny's development.Is it scary? Personally, I don't find it frightening, but the film does have many captivating scenes. They don't exactly scare you, but they do hold your attention with Kubrick's mesmerizing style. That bathroom scene with Jack, for example-when I was younger, it genuinely scared me. I suppose I've become desensitized after watching so many horror films, so that's possible too.Despite some drawbacks, I still think The Shining is worth watching, even though, after reading the book, the movie can feel a bit slow for several reasons.Oh, and a shout-out to the characters' wardrobe-it's got great style, lol.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Fatally Flawed,"If The Shining were about camera work and atmosphere only, it would rank with Kubrick's best, which is to say about as good as the movies get. To Kubrick's hand-held camera and cinematic imagination, the hotel's vast empty corridors and adjacent rooms become a labyrinth of horror in which evil of any kind might emerge. Only The Sixth Sense, of recent vintage, comes close to capturing the same spooky anything-can-happen atmosphere of the Shining's Overlook Hotel. If the film were about script only, it would still rate an arguable 5 stars, as Kubrick & Co. substitute mood and spectral apparitions in place of the book's hokier parts, such as flying topiary. Nor do I think the film is overlong, since a leisurely buildup is essential to the crashing, mind-altering climax.But this is not the early Kubrick, the sure-hand behind Paths of Glory, Dr. Strangelove, or 2001. This is Kubrick in decline. A director who either cannot or will not control the wild excesses of his celebrity-star Jack Nicholson in the film's pivotal role. In a part that fairly cries out for sublety and nuance, especially in limning the descent into madness, we get instead a leering, smirking self parody of an actor obviously wallowing in a chance to pull out all stops. And who can believe that that dreadful mood-killing line, ""Here'sss Johnny!"" is actually in the script. Rarely has such a grossly self-indulgent performance been allowed to reach the screen in unaltered form. And for that, there is only Kubrick to ultimately blame.I realize I risk offending Nicholson's legion of fans for whom this ""cool dude"" can do no wrong. But the fact is he traded in his acting credentials soon after Cuckoo's Nest for the easier road of self-parody, in which the silk purse of Five Easy Pieces becomes the sow's ear of the typical Nicholson Role. I care because in more disciplined hands - say an Anthony Hopkins - this could have been a great movie, instead of the artistic irritant it finally is.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Very Good; But Could Have Been Great,"I always try hard not to compare media. Unfortunately, I had read the King novel just before seeing the movie. There are plot elements that could have been included that would have made this a much better movie. One of the things is ""the shining"" itself, the supernatural abilities of the young boy. The character of Dick Halloran (Scatman Crothers) is used up with virtually no effect on the plot. I don't know why King allowed that to happen, because it weakens so badly the chance of the victims to escape. The topiary could have been used to a better advantage as well. The way things are, it is too one sided. That being said, I think the Nicholson role is awesome. This is one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. It has enough shadows and manipulation of the supernatural to really be frightening. I loved when Jack was telling the man who hires him what a great opportunity this was for him to work. He's about as wolfy and sly as he can be. Of course, when he finally gets there, the hotel takes over and he begins to become that wolf. One of the most terrifying moments in all of film is when Shelly Duvall , the wife, picks up all the pages he has typed and they are just gibberish. Kubrick plays with us in grand style. I saw the movie a few years after my first viewing, and because the book was behind me, I enjoyed it a great deal more, even though I knew the events unfolding. Kubrick seldom disappoints and this is no exception.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
"A chilling Stephen King adaptation, with Kubrick trying to be different","Very loosely based on the book, which is very chilling and shocking, this is a great film. Having seen The Shawshank Redemption, Stand By Me and It and liking all three of them, I knew I should check out the Shining. I did feel that Jack Torrence's hallucinations, apparitions and time-warps were introduced a little too quickly and the build up to the ending was rushed too. But it is very stylishly filmed, making perfect use of an amazing set built at Elstree and a gliding Steadicam, and the music is atmospheric. The story is also effective, and there are really nice touches in the script. Kubrick here tries to be different, and I think he does a superb job at it. The Shining is more chilling rather than shocking, the blood flowing from the doors and the old woman in the bathtub made my hairs stand up on the back of my neck, and is constantly discomforting in an eerie sort of way. Jack Nicolson gives a barnstorming performance as Jack, a performance that is both hammy and disturbing, and Shelley Duvall does decently in a somewhat thankless role. Young Danny Lloyd is superb as Danny, his chanting of Redrum especially became increasingly hypnotic and distorted. The film concludes with a fairly suspenseful ending, and is overall a film with one or two problems and a very loose adaptation but it is a chilling adaptation with Kubrick succeeding at being different. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
It's a Classic,"I'm a huge Stephen King fan, first and foremost. I've been reading his books for most of my life now, and I have very fond memories of the time I spent reading most of his books.
Except The Shining. The Shining, although far from being one of his longer works, was so full of unnecessary fluff that I had an extremely difficult time getting through it at all.Kubrick took the novel's best points, added some of his own trademark storytelling flare and made a product that, while vastly different than the book, is a product that still very much satisfies horror fans around the world. And, as a Stephen King fan, I wholeheartedly approve of the changes that Kubrick made to the work.This film, unlike its novel, is a true psychological thriller. It's an examination into the gradual mental deterioration of an individual stuck in an isolated area with only his wife and kid to keep him company... or so it appears at first glance.
There was a lot of tension behind the scenes, particularly between Shelley Duvall (Wendy Torrence) and Stanley Kubrick, but every bit of hard work and anguish that went into the project wielded one of horror's all-time greatest films that will be watched, enjoyed and studied years into the future.
And, in true Kubrick style, there are always some questions left unanswered. It's not for the purpose of setting up a sequel; it's done because i truly believe Stanley wanted his audiences to be thinking all the time. This movie is a major success in that department as well.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Another Visual Treat From Kubrick,"When this came out on DVD, I gave it another shot, after not being too impressed with the VHS the first time. Wow, what a difference! Now, it's on Blu-Ray and it's really fantastic - the best yet! This is a ""must see"" in high-def.I found it to be very entertaining, very suspenseful and a visual treat. Those visuals were so good that I didn't mind the slow pace. Jack Nicholson was perfect for the role. Shelley Duvall was fascinating with her ""Olive Oyl"" face, smile and soft voice. She got panned by a lot of people, and that was unfair. She's fine. The kid (Danny Lloyd) was good, too, as were the supporting players.The film is typical (director Stanley) Kubrick weirdness but not as weird as some of his other stuff. The only things I personally didn't care for were two blasphemous outbursts by Nicholson and a general unpleasant feeling seeing the innocent Duvall and son terrorized near the end. I did think, story-wise, that Nicholson's character went ""crazy"" a bit too fast. That could have been drawn out more....but I'm not complaining because I genuinely am fascinated with this film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"

Finally a Horror film that doesn't suck.,"I'm not a Horror nut.But, ""The Shining"" is one of the few Horror films that I did enjoy watching.Not only is it a Kubrick(2001 and Clockwork Orange)Movie, but it's also one of Jack Nicholsen's best leading role's I've seen yet.The story is about a teacher who's now a writer named Jack. He applied to be the Groundskeeper for a Hotel Resort in the mountains during the Winter. They close the Hotel during the Winter because the place would be snowed in and be difficult for the cars to get out. It would cost to remove the snow all the time so closing the Hotel for the Season is cheaper.Jack got the Job and brings his family along to stay there for the season. Jack feels very honored to get a job like this. His wife is proud of him too. And his son, Danny is looking forward in seeing the place.Danny has a split personality where he has a bitter half named Tonny who live in his mouth. And has some physic powers too. This freaked Danny's mom a bit but a Doctor said it's nothing too serious.When they made to the Hotel they get a tour from the Hedge mazed to the lobby and to the Kitchen. This Hotel however is built over an Indian burial ground. Strange things happen in this type of place. Being trapped in a place like this all winter can make a kind man become a serial killer.I never read the book but I enjoyed this movie a lot. It's one of the few Horror/Thriller movies I consider ""cool"". Has some great moments, great dialog, and a cool ending. It's something I can see again and again.I recommend it to all the Kubrick, Nicholsen, and Stephen King Fans.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"

Besides Lynch and Jarmusch, Kubrick is one of the few that I could never mistake for someone else. All of his movies, however different their stories might be, share that insane atmosphere that simply screams Kubrick. Frames, angles, sound and his particular kind of creepy unmistakably betray him. While watching any of his movies I have flashes from his other movies. Although their plots are not related, this movie reminds me of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and bit of ""Clockwork Orange"", and with those two makes the holy trinity of Stanley Kubrick's heritage. In my opinion, one of the best movies of all time.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"

One of the best horror movies ever  made with exceptional performance by Jack Nicholson and stunningly directed by Stanley Kubrick,"A family formed by a father (Jack Nicholson, Stanley Kubrick considered both Robert De Niro and Robin Williams for the role of Jack Torrance but decided against both of them) , mother (Shelley Duvall) and son (Danny Lloyd , first choice to play was Cary Guffey, because Danny was so young and since it was his first acting job, Kubrick was highly protective of the child, during the shooting of the movie, Lloyd was under the impression that the film he was making was a drama, not a horror movie) heads to an isolated hotel for the winter where an evil and spiritual presence influences the father into violence, while his psychic son sees horrific forebodings from the past and of the future. The struggling writer named Jack Torrance accepts a position as the caretaker of a great summer resort hotel called Overlook during the winter season . But then the writer becomes possessed by it .Having turned down directing a sequel to The exorcist (1973), Kubrick made his own horror film: The shining (1980) , today regarded as one of the best terror movies ever made. Stephen King (whose novel the film was based upon) reportedly didn't like Kubrick's adaptation . One of 'Stanley Kubrick''s favorite films was Eraserhead, directed by David Lynch , he cited the film as a creative influence during the making of The Shining and screened Eraserhead to put the cast and crew in the mood he wanted to achieve for the film. The director keeps things at a snail's pace , but he carries out scary moments and amazing scenes . Nicholson' s performance approaches high levels . There is a great deal of confusion regarding this film and the number of retakes of certain scenes . According to the Guinness Book of Records, the scene where Wendy is backing up the stairs swinging the baseball bat was shot 127 times, which is a record for the most takes of a single scene. The picture is shot in the Academy ratio (1.37:1) and features shots down the length of tall, parallel walls, the maze and hotel corridors in . And Steadicam operator Garrett Brown accomplished many of the ultra-low tracking corridor sequences from a wheelchair on which his invention was mounted.Excellent costume design by Milena Canonero and magnificent production design by Roy Walker , all of the interior rooms of The Overlook Hotel were filmed at Elstree Studios in England, including The Colorado Lounge, where Jack does his typing. Because of the intense heat generated from the lighting used to recreate window sunlight . To construct the interiors of the Overlook, Stanley Kubrick and his production designer, Roy Walker purposely set out to make it look like an amalgamation of bits and pieces of real hotels, rather than giving it one single design ethic. Kubrick had sent many photographers around the country photographing hotel rooms and picking his favorite. For example, the red men's bathroom was modeled on a men's room in the Biltmore Hotel in Arizona designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, and the Colorado lounge was modeled on the lounge of the Ahwanee Hotel in the Yosemite Valley. Indeed, the chandeliers, windows and fireplace are nearly identical, so much so that people entering the Ahwahnee often ask if it's ""the Shining hotel"". Colorful and luxurious cinematography by John Scott , Kubrick's usual filmed on location in Colorado, Glacier National Park, Montana,Going-to-the-Sun Road, Glacier National Park, Montana,Saint Mary Lake, Glacier National Park, Montana, Timberline Lodge, Mount Hood, Oregon, (Overlook Hotel exterior), Yosemite National Park, California and Elstree Studios, Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, England, UK . Creepy and eerie musical score , Wendy Carlos and Rachel Elkind wrote and performed a full electronic score for the film, but Kubrick discarded most of it and used a soundtrack of mostly classical music , only the adaptation of Hector Berlioz's ""Symphonie Fantastique"" during the opening credits, a few other brief moments survive in the final version . Rating : Above average , it is considered to be one of the history's best horror films . Despite receiving generally unfavorable reviews upon its initial release, the film is today deeply regarded In 2001, it was ranked 29th on AFI list. In 2003, Jack Torrance was named the 25th greatest villain on the Villains' AFI list. This well produced film by Jan Harlan was named the scariest film of all time by Channel 4 in 2003, and Total Film had it as the 5th greatest horror film in 2004.

End up pretty much as i expected it to be.,"There is a decent ammount of what are considered cult classic horror movies that i have yet to watch, so i decided for Halloween season this year i would add a few ones and The Shining is one i really wanted to be able to say i saw it. So it became #3 on my list so far.Having seen A Clockwork Orange one or two years ago and having taught its a decent movie but way too dragging, i somewhat knew what to expect from this one in a way and it was exactly that.I gave it a 6 because i feel i need to be fair, after all its a 1980 movie i watched 41 years later... it need to be taken into consideration. And the film does have some strong points. The visuals are beautifull and still capture some creepyness despite always being very bright and the sound effects are great. The actors all put a solid performance.But its main problem for me is that it moves at a snail pace. Its a 90 minutes movie that drag for 2 and a half hour. Yes the characters developement is important and we are supose to watch Jack's descent into madness but the issue is LOTS of scenes drag and outside a few couple scenes, there is nothing really ""scary"". The hotel does have a creepy vibes as i said, but its not building tension toward scary if it make any sense.The last act is pretty good but by then i was kinda bored a bit for a solid hour mid-movie going on twitter on my phone and watching the movie with one eye.But as i said due to its age and what it has inspired, i don't want to be too harsh on it. I am ""glad"" i saw it once, but its a movie i will never watch again. Its not one i would say to a friend or a modern kid ""you have to watch this man"".",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"

Kubrick's 1980 classic horror sparkles in moments but doesn't consistently shine,"There's a lot to love about The Shining. The setting is stunning: a hotel high in the Colorado mountains, with decadent rooms and a wondrous hedge maze. The film is beautifully shot, the scenes with the long corridors are memorable, and Kubrick clever use of different camera angles brings the action to life. The two leads are also great; a crazed Jack Nicholson is menacing as the teacher / struggling writer, and the wide-eyed Shelley Duvall plays the not-quite hopeless victim to perfection.So where does it fall short? Firstly, the story is weak. There are too many questions asked and not enough answers. Secondly, I found it difficult to care about any of the characters, they had little backstory and were one-dimensional. Thirdly, for a horror film I never found myself either scared or on the edge of my seat.Overall, I think the good far outweighs the bad and it's a film all move fans should watch at least once, but for me it stops just short of being a true classic.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Don't worry English ladies,"In my experience, every time I've watched this film it's been a really great for my health and reproduction.

The tricycle that Danny (Jack's young son) has in this film has been fun to watch and given me inspiration to set up my electric powered tricycles specially designed to carry toilet paper and suitcases via the soft jiggly custom rear wheels made with love and affection.Oh I love how Danny wasn't intimidated to say he wanted chocolate ice cream to a black man and I love how interesting the Delbert Grady character was in this legendary film as he really put Jack and the other characters in their place and shows the viewer how to be a successful alpha male.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
An OK film but a poor horror movie with awful acting,"After ""A Clockwork Orange"" things did not go so well for the great Stanley Kubrick. He was blamed for violence allegedly incited by ""A Clockwork Orange"" so he had the film pulled in England. His pet ""Napoleon"" project got canned after much effort in pre-production, which prompted him to make ""Barry Lyndon"" as a consolation substitute. After many arduous and expensive months of location filming, ""Barry Lyndon"" flopped both critically (not unusual) and commercially (which was unusual for Kubrick). Kubrick badly needed a low-risk hit movie, particularly in America, to raise his stocks again with Hollywood. ""The Shining"" was that movie, and was indeed a hit in America.The trivia section mentions that Stephen King was surprised that Kubrick was sold on the first chapter of the novel, since the first chapter was atypical of the rest of the novel. It certainly contained no real scares. However when you consider the above background, you can sort of understand the novel's appeal to Kubrick as a film adaptation. The first chapter describes in great detail the layout of the hotel, in which almost the entire snowbound story takes place, as well as the seething writer's anger at being questioned about his struggle with alcohol and his personal failures (poignant for Kubrick?). Here was a film which could be shot entirely in the studio (low risk, low cost) using a small, relatively inexpensive cast featuring a well-known star (Nicholson) with whom Kubrick had wanted to work for some time. This allowed Kubrick unprecedented and relatively inexpensive scope for his notoriously excessive re-shoots. It was also based on a best-selling book, thus drawing in the numerous Stephen King fans. The hotel's long empty passageways also gave plenty of scope for Kubrick's trademark tracking/zoom shots down the length of long symmetrical corridors, while Jack Torrance's mental disintegration allows Kubrick to use his other trademark, The Glare.As a gadget freak, Kubrick generally had a technical innovation in almost every movie. In this case it was the Steadicam, to which he had been introduced several years earlier. The stairwells and carpeted corridors provided a perfect opportunity to use the Steadicam on previously ""impossible"" shots, and some shots (e.g. the Big Wheel ride over the carpets, or the staircase ascent preceding the Dog Man) seem to have been included purely to show off the capabilities of his new gadget.Yet in focusing on the technical appeal of this project, Kubrick lost sight of one important thing - he has no understanding of the horror genre, and thus doesn't have a clue as to how to make a scary film. Though the film is reasonably interesting and absorbing, there are only a couple of even moderately scary scenes in the whole film. Nicholson's acting throughout is outrageously hammy, Shelley Duvall is monochromatically hysterical and tearful for too much of the movie, while the child actor does as well as you can expect a 5 year old to do, which isn't very well at all. Kubrick apologists try to claim he wasn't trying to make a scary film, that he was actually commenting on the role of television, or the plight of the Indians (or some other barrow the apologist is pushing) in the guise of a horror movie. However when Diane Johnson was given the job of co-writing the screenplay, Kubrick told her to make it ""completely scary"". So they failed to achieve their goals.The film is justly famous for the ambiguity of its plot. At first Kubrick repeatedly implies that the ghosts are merely imagined for most of the movie, then only towards the end suggests they are capable of action in the physical realm. While this gets the audience discussing the movie, it is also blatantly inconsistent. Likewise with the film's punchline suggesting Charles Grady, Delbert Grady and Jack Torrance may or may not have previously been there and may or may not have been the same person. There is a point beyond which the shifting of perspective turns from tantalising ambiguity and fascinating puzzle into annoying and unsatisfying confusion. Kubrick's extra edits for the 2 hour version seem to remove a great deal of clarifying information, and accentuate this confusion further. I don't know if this was dome out of incompetence or a love of confusion. Either way it's not impressive.In short, this is an unsuccessful Kubrick film, but nevertheless a moderately entertaining one.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
A great classic,"Stanley Kubrick one of the greatest directors to have existed in our history. This movie is and will stay as one of the greatest movies in history.Easily one of the biggest horror movies of all time, it's even on the library of congress. I really can't say anything new about this movie. It's probably one of the most dissected and analyzed films.The cinematography is absolutely phenomenal, when the movie begins with the gliding shots of Montana's glacier national park it is very beautiful while the shining's main theme plays, the tune is very creepy and memorable really great music composed by Wendy Carlos and Rachel Alkyne.The acting is also top tier, even though I heard that in the start the movie wasn't very popular among the critics being called a movie with the worst actor/director, at the least over the time it has been reevaluated as how it should be, a horror icon. The performance really does sell how terrifying the hotel is, even Duvall's acting was top notch in making Jack a scary person also who couldn't forget about little Danny for a kid he really did a good job.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
"With benefit of hindsight and a clear perspective, the film is obviously a disappointment...","Stanley Kubrick takes an arguably weak Stephen King literary tomb and possibly reads more into the material than what King had originally cooked up. Jack Nicholson interviews to be the winter caretaker of a mammoth, isolated Colorado hotel and immediately feels at home in the lonely vastness of its eerie expanse; his jittery wife and muted, psychic young son aren't so sure about the surroundings, especially after Dad starts exhibiting uncontrolled behavior. Once again, Kubrick displays his fabulous grasp of film-technique, resulting in some sensational scenes (particularly the opening drive up the mountain, the child's first meeting with the psychic cook, the overhead shot of the maze, and a funny/scary bit with Shelley Duvall fending off crazy Jack with a baseball bat). Unfortunately, the plot is all gummed up; it takes in past and present incidents, characters as mind demons, and a boy's fear of his father and fails to make all the elements cohere. Worse, the pieces don't make this much of a scary puzzle--it's too confounding to be truly terrifying--and the finale (filled with lots of freaky goings-on) releases all the tension Kubrick has worked so hard to build up. Some may see the confusing debauchery and the blood-filled elevator as Kubrick's comment on the horror genre, his imperviousness to the usual scare-movie tactics--he's above clichés--though what he DOES give us doesn't add up. A great deal of screen-time is spent getting help to the woman and her son (in the form of the cook) and also in locking up Nicholson when he becomes too violent--and both chapters end ridiculously.

One Of The Greates Horror Movies Of All Time,"i think this is definitely one of the best horror movies of all time, thanks to Jack Nicholson as Jack Torrence, which i think is one of the creepiest and best performance of all time, all the other acting is great too, except Shelley Duvall as Wendy Torrance isn't all that good, but shes pretty good in the famous scene where jack sticks is head through the door and says, ""here's johnny!"", the kid Danny Torrance(Danny Lloyd) is also very good and Philip Stone, in is 3rd Kubrick movie, is very creepy as Delbert Grady who was once the caretaker, but went crazy and killed his wife and children and then himself, i also liked Joe Turkel as the bartender, the movie was very strange and creepy, one of the creepiest movies ever, and was also shot very well, jack ends up try to kill his own family but doesn't succeed and freezes to death, and then a strange ending, if you haven't seen this movie i recommend you do!!!!!!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Let's talk. What do you want to talk about?,"I have never understood why the film critics gave this movie mediocre reviews. In cinema history, there have been only a handful of great horror movies. The Shining is definitely one of the greatest. Nicholson gave this role his personal touch. He is excellent as a man who enters a hotel, and rapidly starts to lose his mind. Shelley Duvall is good as Mrs. Torrance. However, I've never understood the stupid way she dressed here. Danny Lloyd was effective as the son, especially when he says ""Redrum"" about fifty times. Perhaps intentionally, the movie never makes it clear as to exactly what ""happens"" within the hotel. The hotel seems to be possessed by ""dead spirits"" that gradually take control of the occupants. My favorite scene is when Nicholson kisses the naked lady in room 237. I love when he realizes that she is really a deformed corpse, and she starts laughing like a maniac. Another great scene is the one referred to in my heading. The movie, to its credit, is alternately subtle and ""off the wall."" This is a great American horror film. What other Nicholson movie could have given him the opportunity to say ""Here's Johnny""?!",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
The best film from Mr. Q-Brick,"Filmed masterfully but the late great Stanley Kubrick. It has everything you could ask for in a good horror film, suspension, drama, isolation, scary imagery, creepy but beautiful music, Great character's, and a good story. The movie's story is really sold by the actors the stand out being Little Danny Lloyd and Shelley Duvall, jack Nicholson is also very good in his role as Jack Torrance but lets be honest we all know that already, in conclusion i believe that the Shining is up there with one of the very best films of all time and would recommend this film to anybody looking for a great film to watch.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
"Skip the medicine, watch the movie.","At this point, this movie is a classic. A masterpiece of ""subtle"" horror.Sure, it's not as gory or ""shocking"" as many modern day horror movies, but it's an effective movie. The haunting music, looming visuals, and overall ambiance combine to make a truly great movie.On a personal note, this is my father's favorite movie. As a child, I remember him watching it in a dark room several times, and every time I entered the movie would go on pause. If you think the movie isn't scary, watch it while home alone, at night time, preferably out in the country away from every living soul you know.I'm a huge Stephen King fan (have read 90% of his novels), and understand his dislike for the movie.

From the opening drive to the hotel to the closing twist at the end, The Shining is a quite cinematically perfect and has stood the test of time for 40 years.

Timeless cinematography,"Even thought I'm not a fan of horror movies, I have always wanted to watch 'The Shining' because of how many times it's been referenced in pop culture. And WOW, so many iconic moments here.The movie is very subtle most of the time, but keeps your attention with the dramatic soundtrack and the intriguing camera that always gives you the impression something is about to happen (like when it follows Danny riding his bike from behind).The only reason I'm not giving 'The Shining' a 10 is the fact that they could have utilised more scary elements by the end of the movies, more specifically when Wendy is running through the hotel looking for Danny. Considering how big the 'Overlook' is, there were a lot of possibilities they could have explored to appeal more to the frightening aspect of the story.Nevertheless, is great in every other aspect.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Somewhat Of A Disappointment...,"At the moment, I'm reading the Stephen King novel. I'm a little past halfway through the book. I'd seen fragments of the movie before, including the end, so I thought ""What the hell? I'll watch it while it's on."" I was engrossed for the first thirty minutes, until I realised how little interest I held in the characters. Yes, Jack Nicholson's Jack Torrance is amazing, and his descent into madness is one of the most interesting parts of the film, but... How could anyone sympathize with him? Or Danny? Or Wendy? In the novel, you understand what motivates each of these characters. In the film, you're just expected to accept them doing what they do as they do it. I can give Kubrick that he didn't have a whole lot of time for characterization if he wanted to add in all he did, but I'd have liked to see more, which is rare for me after watching a two and one-half hour movie.One thing the film gets completely right is the mood: along with the characters, you actually feel trapped within the Overlook. Even the establishing shots of the road leading up to the hotel are foreboding, despite how amazingly beautiful they are. Each of Jack's hallucinations (if you can call them that) are startling and, for lack of a better word, trippy. His slow descent into insanity is enthralling. Tony's ""appearances,"" though considerably disappointing when put next to the novel's version, are also horrifying.However, as I said before, the problem is characterization. I could have cared less for anyone on the screen, whether they lived or died. I can look past the lack of wasps or firehose snakes (though I would have loved to see Danny call one a ""cheap little prick"") or hedge monsters; I just want characters I can sympathize with, who I can feel something for. I congratulate the actors wholeheartedly for doing what they can with a script that seems sometimes forced, as if dialog was hastily thrown in just for the sake of it. All I want is to care what happens to the characters in the end. That's not to say I wasn't scared or tensed-up when the time came; it's just to say that, after all I've heard of the film, this is just somewhat of a disappointment.If nothing else, Nicholson's performance alone makes the film worth watching.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Not what I was expecting,"When I watched this movie totally non-spoiled, I excepted this movie to be a generic slasher taking place on a hotel, but it was way more than that. It is not a easy film to understand, the actor are pretty talented especially Shelly Duvall and Jack Nicholson who put everything in the performance, while it can feel slow at the beginning of the film, it does pick up it's pace as the movie goes on. And it has been analyzed so many times which make sense since it is pretty deep, the cinematography is on point and that all I have to say, but Imbd want me to say more so I report on the fact I have to talk more so that minimum character limit is met.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
"""Here's to five miserable months on the wagon, and all the irreparable harm it has caused me.""","""The Shining"" is based on Stephen King's 1977 novel and is considered one of the very best horror films of all time, in 2018 it was selected for preservation into the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being considered ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"". It has changed the horror genre in many ways. It introduced more horror of a psychological nature, focusing on internal struggles and anxieties of the characters instead of relying mainly on jump-scares.The plot revolves around a family who head to an isolated hotel for the winter and encounter a sinister presence that influences the father (Jack Nicholson) into destructive violence. The psychic son begins to see horrifying foreboding events from both the past and the future. The film would differ from the novel regarding the characterization and motivation of the characters. Stephen King was a famous critic of Stanley Kubrick's adaptation. He would go so far as categorizing it as ""a maddening, perverse, and disappointing film.""

Good but there are some boring aspects,"Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining"" remains an iconic masterpiece in the horror genre, renowned for its atmospheric tension and haunting visuals. The film's meticulous direction and cinematography create an unnerving sense of isolation within the Overlook Hotel. Jack Nicholson's portrayal of Jack Torrance is captivating, capturing the gradual descent into madness with chilling intensity. The film's slow-burn pacing contributes to the building sense of dread, enhanced by the eerie soundtrack and striking imagery. Kubrick's attention to detail and symbolism adds layers of depth, inviting analysis and interpretation, making it a timeless classic that continues to fascinate and disturb audiences. However, for some viewers, the deliberate pacing and extended atmospheric sequences may feel drawn-out or slow-moving, potentially leading to a sense of monotony. Additionally, the film's ambiguity and open-ended conclusion might not resonate with those seeking more explicit resolutions or closure. Some might find the deliberate ambiguity more frustrating than intriguing, especially if they prefer a more straightforward narrative in horror films.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"

Theres no strong wills or heroes in his version, just props to abuse.Alluding to the minor bits of supernatural he does include seems tacked on and makes me feel he didn't understand the novel at all. Shoehorned in ""indian burial ground"" tropes really detracts from the novels subtler, and much more frightening, hauntings.After finally reading the novel, the boredom I have felt for much of Kubrick's work has become justified and makes me glad he is no longer around to ruin any more great novels as he did with The Shining, Clockwork Orange, and Lolita.The man was a style-over-substance hack.",4.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"

Kubrick's Horror Classic 'The Shining' Continues to Terrify Audiences Decades Later,"""The Shining"" (1980) is a horror masterpiece that still sends shivers down the spine of audiences today. Directed by Stanley Kubrick and based on the novel by Stephen King, the film tells the story of the Torrance family as they spend the winter caretaking the isolated Overlook Hotel. However, as the days go by, the hotel begins to reveal its dark and sinister secrets, leading to a terrifying descent into madness for patriarch Jack Torrance (played brilliantly by Jack Nicholson).Kubrick's direction is masterful, building tension and suspense through meticulous attention to detail and a slow, deliberate pacing that allows the horror to build gradually. The film's iconic visuals, from the blood-filled elevators to the creepy twins, have become cultural touchstones, while the eerie score by Wendy Carlos and Rachel Elkind adds to the film's haunting atmosphere.But what truly sets ""The Shining"" apart is the performances, particularly that of Nicholson as the increasingly unhinged Jack. He perfectly captures the character's slow descent into madness, making his eventual outbursts all the more shocking and terrifying. Shelley Duvall also delivers a powerful performance as Wendy, conveying both her character's fear and strength as she fights to protect her son from her increasingly unstable husband.Overall, ""The Shining"" is a must-see for horror fans and cinephiles alike. Kubrick's masterful direction, unforgettable visuals, and powerhouse performances make it a true classic of the genre.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
One of the All Time Greats,"The Shining (1980) ****Stanley Kubrick's horror masterpiece has writer Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) taking his wife (Shelley Duvall) and young son (Danny Lloyd) to a mountaintop hotel where they are going to take care of it for the winter. Before long Jack begins seeing things that may or may not be real.To me THE SHINING is a film that I really didn't care too much for the first time I saw it. In fact, it took several viewings before I'd even call the film good. It took several more for me to love the film and now I'm at the point where I call it one of the greatest movies ever made. I could honestly write thousands of paragraphs about the greatness of this film but I think theories on its meaning and various ideas are already all over the place.For my money what's so amazing about this movie is the sheer terror and atmosphere that Kubrick creates. The entire movie has a very claustrophobic feel to it and no matter how many times you watch it you can sink back into it as if it was your first time seeing it. You may know the story, the twists and what happens but no matter how many times you see it you always feel as if you're seeing something for the first time. That's a huge compliment and I think that's the reason Kubrick's films always work the more times you watch them.I think the film manages to be one of the scariest pictures ever made and especially the scenes with Danny riding around on his bike and running into the twin girls. The creepiness of what Jack finds in one of the rooms is just as good. The various ghostly images that are seen throughout the picture are incredibly effective. Even more impressive is that Kubrick has made a horror film that takes place during the day, in the light and doesn't try to use darkness to build up any horror.Nicholson is one of the greatest actors of all time and for years people debated his performance here. Many found it to be over-the-top and I used to be one of them but over time I've come to realize that the performance is just flawless. Does it make sense all of the time? No but neither does the story and the two work perfectly together because you mind can go into overdrive trying to find out why things are happening. Duvall, Lloyd, Joe Turkel, Barry Nelson and Scatman Crothers are all very good as well.THE SHINING isn't the easiest movie to watch and there's no question that you must pay attention to it throughout the long running time. With that said, to me it's one of the greatest films ever made and it's one that continues to get richer and better no matter how many times you see it.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"

Great movie,"Greetings from Lithuania.""The Shining"" (1980) is a movie made by a legendary and arguably the best director of all time - Stanley Kubrick.

And lets just say this place is a not a one who wants to stay for a long time in isolation.This is a brilliant film that is mysterious, and just like many Kubrick's films its not a plain and simple as it looks.

"Battery's Out, Finger's Dead","This movie has not aged well. Kubrick uses a very old-fashioned camera stance and the dialog is often stagey back-and-forth medium head shots.Scatman is apt, but Kubrick asks Jack to be more external, and that's dangerous with his unchecked exuberance. Duvall needs pumping up.The problem is an old one, and one Kubrick knows. Successful storytelling is bound by its media, so a successful print story can be only a starting point for cinematic narrative. He clearly believes it best when a character or device is external, like Hal, the spirit here, or Hitchcock's mcguffin. His handling of the unseen contrasted with and contained in huge interiors is his strategy and it may have worked better when the film was new. But its just too tame now.What's very nice is the selfreference. It is another piece of an obsessed storytelling about an obsessed writer, engaged in creating a story.I gave this film extra points because it tried to use architecture well. But it did a poor job. Part of this is the unimaginative camera eye. But even a better eye couldn't have exploited the set well.

It's a horror of a film!,"Lousy adaptation of Stephen King's great novel. It's about a family watching over a huge hotel (the Overlook) which is located in the mountains in Colorado during the winter. They're basically isolated out there--miles and miles away from anyone. Also seems the hotel is haunted and starts to take possession of the father (Jack Nicholson). Then the snowstorms hit--they're completely snowed in and the mother (Shelley Duvall) and little son (Danny Lloyd) are at the mercy of the axe-wielding father...The novel was VERY scary and well-done--Kubrick single-handedly trashes the entire book. Kubrick WAS a great director but he just didn't know how to do a straight-forward horror film. He acts like this is an important film--he takes it WAY too seriously. He makes very ill-conceived changes from the book (one character is brutally killed, but he was alive and well at the end of the book, and where are the hedge animals?) and has Nicholson's character act so weird from the get go that we don't really notice any change when he goes crazy. Nicholson IS good however but Duvall is annoying and Lloyd was basically not accomplished enough to pull off his role (but he WAS a young kid). Scatman Crothers is good but he's not in the film enough to really help. Also the film isn't scary ONCE. Kubrick shows all his purported ""shocking"" moments with loud, annoying music--problem is nothing he shows us is scary. Also the ending is REALLY stupid and throws in a reincarnation angle that comes out of NOWHERE (and isn't in the book).My main issues with this is that it isn't scary, is WAY too long and way too serious. Even King himself hated this. But there are some people who think everything Kubrick did was fantastic and even defend this. I hated it in 1980...I still hate it now.

What a great film this is!,"What a great horror film ""The Shining"" is! It is a well-known fact of film trivia nowadays that Stephen King ""hated"" the adaptation of his novel, and was bothered by Stanley Kubrick's ""creative liberties"" (his main complaint: the lack of hedge monsters). I hate to point this out to Mr. King, but his novel was a rather simplistic horror yarn - a classic of its genre? Maybe, but I feel there is far more depth in the movie -- and we saw the result of a faithful adaptation in the form of a late 1990s television miniseries starring Rebecca Demornay - the result was enjoyable but nowhere near the greatness of Kubrick's vision.In general, I'm not a Kubrick fanatic and I don't devour everything he's done. I consider ""2001"" and ""Full Metal Jacket"" to be overrated - but this is probably my favorite film of his (but then again, ""Clockwork Orange"" and ""Paths of Glory"" are superb, too). This was perhaps only the second truly epic horror film (the first being Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"") - and the direction is really amazing. The eerie nature of the movie is unsettling all at once without showing anything at all.Simply built on music alone, Kubrick manages to convey so many feelings. He pulls out to an overhead shot of a boy playing on a red rug. Coupled with the soundtrack it's terrifying. This is how all horror films should be. It shows what an impact subliminal terror has - an axe-yielding maniac can only have shock and jump value; seeing something this psychologically mind-screwing is utterly gut-wrenching.See this movie. Honestly, if you haven't watched it yet, please do. And avoid the edited TV version, which omits some of the more terrifying moments (I guess they're considered too ""scary""?). Some omitted scenes are simply too risqué for television. One of these moments happens towards the end - I saw it as a child and it still disturbs me and has stayed with me after all these years. Shelley Duvall is running through the Overlook and she comes to a hallway, and in one of the rooms two party-goers (one dressed up as a lion or something) are performing some strange sex act. You only see it for maybe two seconds, and they're fully clothed, but it's impossible to forget. The TV version simply shows them sitting next to each other on the bed - odd enough, and still freaky, but the uncut version of the scene is even more so.Truly, the only word to describe this movie's vibe is ""freaky."" I'd place it as one of the top five horror films of all time, and in my own personal opinion, I'd probably rank it right below ""Psycho"" as the most masterful and epic of them all.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
"5% King, 100% Kubrick: a bona fide horror classic","The Shining is a weird example of adaptation: it has very little in common with the source novel, written by Stephen King, yet it is widely remembered as one of the best cinematic renditions of the horror master's work. This is due to two factors: Stanley Kubrick's masterful direction and Jack Nicholson's chilly acting.Nicholson plays Jack Torrance, a writer who accepts to take care of the Overlook Hotel in Canada during the winter period, unaffected by the gruesome stories surrounding the place: he claims a nice, isolated location is just what he needs to finish his new book. Therefore the Overlook becomes the new home of the Torrance family: Jack, his wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and their five-year old son Danny (Danny Lloyd). The boy in particular senses right from the beginning that something's wrong: he has been told by the cook, Dick O' Hallorann (Scatman Crothers) that he is endowed with a mysterious psychic energy, the titular Shining, which allows people like him and Dick to see flashes from the past and the future, among other things. Because of this ""gift"", the forces that inhabit the hotel immediately take an interest in Danny, even though he is quite capable of resisting them. That is not Jack's case, however, as he gets increasingly paranoid regarding his wife's affections and seeks comfort in the company of what can best be defined as ghosts, triggering a chain of insanity and dread which is very hard to break.The Shining works as a horror movie because Kubrick, though having never worked on this kind of film before, knew exactly what was effective and what wasn't, hence the larger focus on atmosphere and psychological shocks than gore and creative bloodbaths. King criticized the director for changing most of the story, omitting most of the Jack/Danny subplot (merely hinted at in the film) that led to the book's emotionally strong climax, and while his disappointment is valid, the omission was actually necessary: the novel dealt with redemption, albeit in an unconventional way, and redemption is a theme Kubrick, one of the most famous analysts of human decay, never had a soft spot for. What he is interested in is the mental, and subsequently physical, unbalance that threatens the characters, and he keeps the creepy tone even thanks to a very cold approach and expert use of the steadicam shot (Danny's encounter with two ghostly twins being the best example).Another criticism King raised was about the actors, especially Nicholson: in the writer's opinion, his trademark grin at the start of the movie seemed to indicate Jack already was insane, thus undermining the rest of the story. Now, it is true that Nicholson looks a bit goofy from the very beginning, but it is equally true that Martin Sheen (King's ideal choice for the role) probably would not have been able to deliver a performance as terrifying as Nicholson's: from the moment he starts grinning in a more unsettling way than before to the immortal ""Here's Johnny!"" scene, it is impossible to picture another actor playing that part, and even though the TV version of The Shining from 1997 isn't bad the Torrance character is indelibly linked to the One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest star. As for Duvall and Lloyd, both add terrific support, the latter especially deserving a place alongside Harvey Stephens (The Omen's Damien) and Haley Joel Osment as cinema's great horror child icons. One might complain about Duvall being completely different from the book counterpart (blonde and beautiful) and not having much else to do but scream and run, but two things ought to be considered: a) back in 1980 the ""scream queen"" cliché wasn't one yet; b) rarely has any actress looked so genuinely terrified on camera, making the book-movie differences secondary compared to the real fear that emerges from Wendy's eyes.Irvine Welsh, the author of Trainspotting, once said there is no such thing as a completely faithful adaptation of any literary work (and he should know, given the liberties Danny Boyle took when his junkie masterpiece was brought to the screen), yet that doesn't mean the movie is necessarily bad. The Shining proves said point to perfection: very little from the novel, approximately 5%, is included in the film, but in Kubrick and Nichlolson's hands this masterclass in loose cinematic translation becomes one of the finest, most original horror pictures of all time, which really is saying something given the genre's current poor form.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Whoever said horror only happens when it's dark?,"I saw this film in 1981 and, just recently, decided to see it again before I wrote a review.Time hasn't diminished the effect: this is still a scary movie from one of the industry's greatest directors.After seeing it for the first time, I sourced Stephen King's novel and sat down to have good read. Boy, was that a mistake? I gave up trying to read King's dense narrative that seemed to be all over the place, leaving it aside so that I could remember the effectiveness of Kubrick's screenplay. Only much later, did I learn that Kubrick's script deviated markedly from King's novel. Well, I guess that's art...There are many striking features about the film. First, who would expect to see a true horror movie shot mostly in bright daylight and at such an idyllic setting? Quite the opposite to all the Dracula type schlock that had been so common and that graced cinema screens up till then. Recall Psycho from 1960... The effect for me was to make the narrative all the more horrifying.Did I say idyllic setting? More like modern Gothic, in a way. Or maybe Kubrick was subtlety poking fun at prior so-called horror flicks that had the inevitable dark castle sitting on hill, with lightning crashing around most of the time?And then there's Jack Nicholson, one of Tinsel Town's eccentrics, if not crazy, playing a role tailor made for him. How could it not be, after seeing how well he did in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975)? Some might argue he was over the top, a caricature almost, of a man who truly goes insane. Watching him for the second time, however, I think his performance reminded me all too well of insane people I've met in real life.As a study in abnormal psychology, I think it works very well  in fact, it's a tour de force. And that's why I'm still also a mite disappointed by the way the narrative turns to use supernatural elements to explain the reasons for Jack's descent into his private Hell. (I suppose I'll have to read King's novel to sort this out.) I'm prepared to accept the idea of telepathy between young Danny (Danny Lloyd) and Dick (Scatman Crothers) because I've come across situations that strongly suggest its probability. I see no need, however, to introduce the supernatural, except to appeal to the gullible.Shelley Duval is well cast as the already nervous wife, Wendy; and, I read that Kubrick made her even more nervous with his need for perfection. Scatman was suitably impressive and mysterious; a fine actor and composer. And, hats off to young Danny Lloyd.If this is a movie you've missed, I recommend it thoroughly.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"

Some of the ideas used in this movie are better than the ones used in the book. But I already talked about those in my comment on the mini series. But, I missed a few. The film is shot at a better location than where the mini series was shot. And the REDRUM scenes are creepier than those in the book.

this movie SUCKED,These writings write about the end of the plot so don't read it if you haven't seen this rubbish.I found this rubbish film in the horror section which made me think it would be a horror. If I owned a video store I'd put it in the BORING section. This film is so rubbish it will make you feel like you have lost your socks.This film contains endless shots of people driving as if that was scary. Well I drive to work and back (and sometimes to the store or to visit my cats) almost every day and trust me it's not scary. It even starts with 20 minutes of some people driving. Even the little kid does it too. Round and round he goes and he never stops. What's so scary about watching a little kid riding a bicycle for an hour? I think NOTHING and if you watch it you will not think so too.The family in the car arrive at a big castle and they are given a tour just walking around endlessly looking at kitchens. Then the man walks around a for an hour and tries to kill his family for no reason. That's all that happens and as you can see it's rubbish.,,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
It's terrifying until you realize how ridiculous it is,"What is horror? When you're watching a movie you are not at physical risk. Surprise. The two ways you create horror is by putting in danger characters you care about or planting a story that you feel could happen to you. For me this did neither. The first half was absolutely terrifying. The camera work, creepy music and use of desolate rooms was very effective. Seeing Jack turn crazy is horrifying, especially since Jack Nicholson does creepy faces better than anyone. The problem is, they introduce the shining which is essentially paranormal and very poorly explained, two things that don't bode well. At first, the visions are creepy but as the movie progresses they just seem more and more ridiculous, particularly since they can actually move things. Again, the reason why isn't explained at all making this frustrating to watch if you haven't read the book. A lot of these are introduced but have no closure so I can't help but wonder why were they in there? Towards the end, Jack is hunting his son, which was terrifying, but then it cuts to Wendy seeing visions that were so cartoonish I laughed. Way to kill the suspense. there are three characters in this movie and the only one I cared about is the villain. Wendy and Danny were loathsome so at times I was rooting for Jack which should not be the goal of a horror movie. Also, Jack is constantly complaining about how much he works but we never see him work once. Not only does this devalue the character's arc but it also doesn't make sense. He was given several tasks that he never does but there is no apparent effect on the building which raises the question: Why is he needed there in the first place? Ultimately, this movie succeeded at being creepy for the majority of the movie, but it makes hardly any sense and several scenes kill the tension.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Read the book instead.,"I saw the film about a year ago and thought that it was boring, plot-less and badly acted. I recently bought the novel to see who was to blame, Stanley Kubrick or Stephen King. Before I had gotten a quarter of the way through the book I had the answer, Stanley Kubrick. After reading the entire book I see that the movie was even more lacking in plot, acting and scare factor than I had thought. The first half of the book is more entertaining than the entire movie in my opinion.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Overrated,"I get it that a lot of people love this movie, but seriously it was too long, like twice as long as it should've been. It definitely wasn't the scariest or the best horror movie. The acting was pretty good, just as the story, but for me that's all the positives. For me personally needed like almost 2 days to finish, because of it's high dryness. So overall only watch this movie, if you like boring or not that intense movies, but I think it has a pretty low chance. I gave it only 4 out of 10, but only because I'm in a kinda good mood.To be honest, I don't understand the 10 out of 10 reviews, even tho there is a lot of them.",4.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
'Shining' On,"Why can't more directors these days create horror movies like ""The Shining""? There's an easy answer to that: modern day directors are not Stanley Kubrick. Kubrick proved once-and-for-all with this movie that he is truly one of the greatest directors and auteurs of all time.So, the plot is fairly simple. A man named Jack Torrance (played brilliantly by Jack Nicholson)and his family move into a large, secluded hotel to watch over it for the off-season. The kicker is that the previous caretaker of the hotel savagely murdered his wife and two girls. What follows can most readily be summed by the title of the movie, but you have to watch it to see what I mean.This is the first movie in a very long time to strike me as ""scary"". It's some seriously messed up stuff, but in a good way. One of the things that adds to the scare factor is the amazing music. Music has been a major part of Kubrick's movies (2001: A Space Oddysey and A Clockwork Orange, just to name a couple) and he definitely doesn't disappoint with this one. The score completely sets the tone and this film would not be the same without it.Finally, I must comment on Nicholson's legendary performance. Jack is terrifyingly convincing as a crazy killer. In fact, just his stare steals a few scenes of this movie. This is top-notch acting that must be seen to believe.There will never be a horror movie that quite matches this one. R.I.P.

"""A tremendous sense of Isolation""","After his greatest achievement in the sumptuous period drama Barry Lyndon, Stanley Kubrick moved on to make his statement on the horror genre. A massive shift in focus, but perhaps not such a surprise since there were elements of horror in 2001: A Space Odyssey and A Clockwork Orange.Kubrick's greatest strength is probably in that he always followed his own muse, regardless of what was going on in cinema at any one time. Of course, he was sometimes influenced by his contemporaries, but he never followed a trend. The Shining is at once bold and innovative, yet also nostalgic and old-fashioned. In a way this mimics the story's theme of history repeating itself and the overlapping of past and present events  a typically Kubrick-esquire mixing of style and content.The atmosphere of The Shining is created through use of space and place. Kubrick shows us two kinds of space at the Overlook Hotel. There are vast, empty spaces such as the grand hall and the gold room, generally revealed to us in slow zooms. Jack is more often shown in these rooms, and they represent his growing isolation from his family and his detachment from reality. Then there are the winding passages like the corridors and the maze, which Kubrick's camera explores with steady tracking shots. More often than not it is Wendy and Tommy whom the camera follows through these passages, and this gives us the sense of confinement and helplessness of their situation.In terms of place, The Shining is in a way a Heart-of-Darkness style journey into hostile territory. The opening credit sequence tells us this right at the start, as we see Jack's car travelling higher and higher into the mountains, a tiny dot from the helicopter shot. The Overlook Hotel resembles its mountainous surroundings, both in shape and colour. Kubrick's construction of space and place combine to create the nightmare situation  a place which is in itself massive and spacious, but which is also a prison, cut off from the outside world.Kubrick is perhaps best known for bucking trends, and rejecting by-the-book approaches, and The Shining does go against the horror grain in several respects. Perhaps most notable is the light. Whereas virtually every horror film prior to this had exploited the darkness, The Shining (as its title suggests) is filled with light and brightness. It's also something of a return to the early days of horror, largely favouring creepy atmospherics over slasher shocks. In fact, there is a very direct and obvious reference to DW Griffith's Broken Blossoms (not actually a horror, but it's still got the axe moment) and even Shelley Duvall's performance towards the end slips into wonderful Lillian Gish-style melodramatics.The Shining is tightly constructed, and it certainly stands out from its contemporaries in the genre, but like many of Kubrick's films it is seriously overrated. For all its supposed sophistication some of the horror moments are terribly camp and corny  for example the old woman in the bathtub does the most ridiculous zombie lurch I've seen outside of B-horror. Those quick zooms and that snare thing on the soundtrack that accompany every shock moment are massively overused and soon become tedious. For my money the supernatural horror elements do not really work  he just doesn't get the creepiness right. It's only the real-life, psycho-killer aspects that have any impact here, and this is mainly down to the intensity of the acting performances. I'm risking flak by saying this, but maybe the film would have been better if Kubrick left out all the ghosts and just told a story about a man's journey into murderous insanity.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"

"Defines ""suspense"".","I saw this film in a theater then it was released, and it was one of my more memorable movie experiences.  A rather longish movie, I thought it was moving a bit slow.  Watchable, interesting, but not very scary.  But, without actually realizing it, the tension was slowly building, building, building.  Why do I say this?  Because with about a half hour left of the movie, I suddenly realized I was literally sitting on the edge of my seat. I don't think this has ever happened to me before or since, with the possible exception of ""The Exorcist"" or ""The Omen"".

The novel I find is a bit more up the horror alley but this is still a very well done adaption. The cast couldn't have been any more perfect.The suspense in the movie is astronomical.

I wish we could stay here forever... and ever... and ever...,"Director Stanley Kubrick managed to take a Stephen King novel and turn it into an essential movie for the horror genre, and somewhat of a timeless masterpiece of terror and despair. And despite it being from 1980 then the movie still holds it own by today's standards, both in storytelling, terror factor and as a wholesome movie.The movie is every bit as thrilling and disturbing as the book. And that accomplishment is well-owned by the director, but also to the actors who were in the movie.The story told in ""The Shining"", which I assume that you should be more than familiar with already - and if you are not, shame on you, is about Jack Torrance, a former teacher turned writer, who takes on the responsibility of being the caretaker of the Overview Hotel as its secluded location makes it impossible to reach during the snowy winter months. Locked away at the secluded mountainside hotel, the desolation plants a seed which is fermented by the isolation and the Torrance family find that strange things take place at the quiet Overview Hotel.Running at 2 hours and 26 minutes, ""The Shining"" might be a bit too long for some viewers, especially since this is the type of horror movie that slowly builds up the dread and suspense. So don't expect to be thrown into a movie filled with scares from the very beginning.And it is this slow and foreboding building up of dread and suspension that really makes ""The Shining"" such a great movie, because it is done in a very skillful manner. And the progression of Jack's descent into madness is so amazing to watch on the screen.""The Shining"" is also the movie that really made me open up my eyes to the acting talent of Jack Nicholson. He is nothing short of spectacular in the role of Jack Torrance. And his mannerisms, charisma and physical appearance is so well-cut for this particular role. It really felt like the character was custom made with Jack Nicholson in mind. I can't really claim to be familiar with Shelley Duvall other than her work in ""The Shining"", but she really did a good job in this movie right alongside with Jack Nicholson.The setting for the movie really also adds a lot of depth and atmosphere to the movie. The Overview Hotel is a grand spectacular building in itself both outside and inside. And its secluded location in the mountains just adds so much to the feel of isolation and desolation that permeates the movie.""The Shining"" is an effective horror movie because of the build up of the isolation, dread and terror. And director Stanley Kubrick really cemented himself in the horror history with this 1980 movie. I dare say that he put a timeless horror classic to film with his accomplishment here.I am rating ""The Shining"" a well-deserved 8 out of 10 stars. And I can honestly say that ""The Shining"" is a movie that you can watch again and again with a few years in between.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Classic horror movie. Based on the novel by Stephen King.,"This is another fantastic movie directed and produced by Stanley Kubrick.It was released back in 1980 so you shouldn't expect the overuse of special effects (SE) like in many modern movies. They simply didn't have that technology. And I think the quality of the story sometimes can benefit from that. I've seen to many movies were stories drown in SE. Anyway, Kubrick won an Academy Award for SE. In The Shining he sure knows when to use them and not. Excellent camera-work.Kubrick uses well balanced and clear images. Combined with a fantastic story progression and strong psychological impressions it all sums up to a great movie experience with a great nerve. It is all so clear and so deadly.

This is the best performance of Jack Nicholson, also better of ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" when he won the Oscar on 1975. The other actors have also a good performance as Shelley Duvall, Danny Lloyd and Scatman Crothers that probably they had a big trauma during acting that movie. This is an important movie.

A visually creepy let down.,"After having just read ""The Shining"" I was jived to see this flick, even though Stephen King didn't like it.And I can see why he didn't like it.First: the good.  This movie has the right look and feel to it.  The hotel that serves as the setting fits wonderfully, and several of the creepy scenes work to full effect. (Interestingly enough, the most chilling scene in the entire movie- the famous 'All Work and No Play...' one- wasn't even in the book!)  So, in that limited way, the movie works.Now the bad: Where are these characters?  Where is there ANY development?? You have Hallorann: By the end of the movie you have to wonder why the even chose to put him in it at all.  Danny: doesn't do anything in the entire movie but mumble a bit.  Wendy: All she does is cry and sob.  Very annoying. Not that it was her fault.  That's all she was given to do.  Jack: This guy is supposed to DESCEND into the madness of the hotel.  He is supposed to be flawed at the beginning of the story, but still be a *good* human being. In this movie, he's very harsh with his family from the start, and we never see him really interact with them before he starts to go off the deep end, so to speak. (Not that there was a chance.  Seemingly, the second he steps in the hotel he's halfway to the end of the movie)The line reading was just that.  READING.  So much of the movie seems forced... contrived...  And though there are nice efforts to alter parts of the novel to facilitate the different medium (such as the doctor scene at the beginning of the movie, which culls elements and plot points from the whole book in mere minutes) there are too many complete changes that don't make much sense. (why the hedge maze?  Why end it like *that*??  I think I know why Kubrick didn't use the same ending/main plot point from the book, but still... could have done better)  Not to mention huge themes and elements from the novel that you would think should have been present.I likely need to watch this movie again in awhile after the book isn't so fresh in my mind, and perhaps I can look at it more as a separate movie and not a movie based on the book.  As it is, I found it it to be very un-affecting for the most part, except for about half on hour towards the end.For now, I give it 5.5 out of 10, based on artistic merit, that half hour, and the best scene that seems like it should have been in the book even though it wasn't.

When compared to the King novel  ~ wow!,"I have seen this movie SO many times (prior to reading the book) and it never fails to scare me each and every time. Jack Nicholson, of course, was born for the part of the lead male but I have found that the Jack of the movie is not necessarily the Jack of the book. On its own, the movie is one of the best in its genre but if you have never read the book, do yourself a favor and do so. Having never read a King novel before, I was impressed. The book was excellent. The depth of characters is so vastly different from those depicted in the film. You actually like the Jack of the book! You 'feel' for him. You understand him. Some of the action of the story too has been altered in the film, and in my opinion, not for the better. I plan to watch Stephen King's The Shining now as I understand it more closely resembles his original story and is more in line with what the author wanted the Stanley Kubrick film to be. The real reason for Kubrick's reinterpretation can be researched, as it too is an interesting read.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Horror can't get better than this,"Stanley Kubrick has been a filmmaker whose work has influenced many countless films and set a huge change within the industry. Each and every one of his movies has affected a lot of present and aspiring filmmakers but his most notable work, The Shining, was ground-breaking!To this day people talk about this movie because of how convoluted the storyline is. This movie brings out one of the most tension filled, nail biting and horrifying experiences. Everything in this film is top notch. Kubrick's direction is amazing. His way of visual storytelling was like no other. The film begins with these gorgeous aerial shots of the scenery that make you feel you are there. The shot selection added a lot to the continuous eerie atmosphere. It's saddening to know how negative the reception was when the film initially came out. I mean Kubrick was even nominated for Worst Director at the Razzies.The editing in this film is sharp. Not once do feel bored or have any intention of turning the film off. The film builds up a constant sense of dread and mystery which fully engrosses you and never lets your eyes off the screen. Aside from Kubrick's direction, the other aspect which made me shudder throughout was the haunting score. The music is used in a very meticulous way. Not once does it feel cheaply used to get a scare out of the audience. Each scene involving the music contributes to the harrowing atmosphere and insinuates an even darker feeling to the environment.The performances in this movie are perfect. Words cannot describe how genuine and phenomenal Jack Nicholson's acting is. This is probably the best performance of his entire career. Shelley Duvall is incredible as well. She is consistently devastated. Her performance brings out the right amount of vulnerability to her character that we whole heartedly care for her. Young Danny Lloyd gives one of the best child performances I've ever seen.Even though Stephen King hated Kubrick's adaptation of his book, many consider this to be the best horror film made. The ending of this movie is equally shocking and thought provoking. After 39 years, film lovers still create crazy theories about what the ending might suggest.Thank you Stanley Kubrick for giving us this gem of a film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
My Favorite Horror Film of All Time,"Stanley Kubrick's The Shining is a film like no other. No film has ever terrified me as much as this, there may have been some others that have made me jump more, but The Shining (Unlike most mainstream horror films nowadays) doesn't rely on cheap jump scares. So many shots and scenes burrow there way into the viewer's mind and never leave them. The Filmmaking is perfect, in my opinion this remains as Stanley Kubrick's best film. Every frame, every scene and every line of dialogue is masterfully helmed. Jack Nicholson's performance here is not only his best but without a doubt one of the greatest of all time. Though Shelly Duval does tend to get a lot of hate for her performance, I'd argue that she was just as great as Jack Nicholson and the fact that she was nominated for a Razzie is utterly insulting. Danny Loyd gives one of the greatest child performances of all time. The Shining is my favorite horror film, my favorite Kubrick film and my favorite film of the entire 80s decade and is of course one of my indisputable favorite films of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
It's Good! (My First Review!),"To start, with. This is my first review, and I am no genius as far as reviews go. However, I decided my first should be for my (probable) favourite. (I know I haven't given this 10/10, but that is only because there is one film I like more than this).Now I have watched this film around 50 times, but it can still keep me enthralled. There are not many films which can manage to do it, but this one succeeds. I think, apart from the great performances from the leads, albeit a somewhat 'over the top performance' from Nicholson, the acting is first rate. So let's move on from there.The one thing which really makes this film stand out in its genre is the cinematography. It is beautifully filmed. The soundtrack fits perfectly. and on a visual level it is near on impeccable. It has to be said that I am a horror film fan, so, my view could be classed as maybe biased. But look at it the other way. I have seen a heck of a lot of horror films and this one takes some beating! All in all, a great film. Try and grasp the storyline, rather than expecting a gorefest.

one of the best adaptations of Stephen King books,"The Shining is one of the best films of the decade of 80, every movie I see that Stanley Kubrick was very wronged in the Oscar, even though he is not being my favorite director is undeniable its ability time to shoot, your ideas are brilliant, the Shining has a good cast, Jack Nicholson this incredible, perhaps his best performance with catchy phrases, and great moments, his best performance in the last act of the film, the cast still has Shelley Duvall, Danny Lloyd, etc., the film will better every minute, I thought the first slow middle act, the better from the second, the movie does not scare if you go thinking it will be scare, will be disappointed a bit, the soundtrack is very good, the script is based on the book of Stephen King (who did not like the film), and the picture is good, the Shining is one of the best movie of Stanley Kubrick, has a great time, even with a slow pace that will better the progress of the film, last act of the film is very good, a mandatory film.

Worst Adaptation of a Stephen King Novel Ever,"This has to be Stanley Kubrick's worst film since ""Barry Lyndon"" (sorry I haven't seen ""Eyes Wide Shut""), & certainly the worst adaptation of a Stephen King novel EVER.  Kubrick has changed the entire focus of the story from a ""haunted house"" story, to the story of one man's trip into insanity (especially since Nicholson had just won an Oscar for ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest).  Kubrick's egotistical attempt to make it his story and NOT King's is epitomized by the changing of the room # of the ""lady in the tub."" The topper was the killing of the cook Dick Halloran (Scatman Crothers), Danny & Wendy's savior, moments after his arrival.  At this point in the movie, my wife had to restrain me from leaving the theater (opening day).My recommendation:  Read the Stephen King novel (one of his best) or see the Steven Webber/Rebecca DeMornay TV mini-series, but AVOID ""Stanley Kubrick's The Shining"" (it certainly is NOT ""Stephen King's The Shining"") AT ALL COSTS.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
All Work And No Play,"In 1973 Stanley Kubrick was asked if he could direct a horror movie called ""The Exorcist"". He politely declined, explaining that he wanted to do the period piece ""Barry Lyndon"" instead. That turned out to be a bad decision. ""The Exorcist"" became a blockbuster, while ""Barry Lyndon"" was a box-office bomb. Kubrick therefore asked his agent to find some other material to work with. Preferably in the horror genre.After ploughing through piles of stories, Kubrick got hooked on ""The Shining"" by young writer Stephen King. So, a contract was drawn up, guaranteeing the director the right to make any required changes to the script. Then Kubrick was ready to start shooting.Although the entire film takes place in a fictional hotel in the Rocky Mountains, Kubrick shot everything at Elstree Studios in England. However, a small second-unit crew was sent to the United States for some exterior shots of the massive Timberline Lodge in Oregon. The real ""Overlook Hotel"" of the story.Unfortunately, it was not a happy shoot. Leading actress Shelley Duvall didn't like the way Kubrick was directing. She felt so pressured by him that she became physically ill for months. (Due to stress, even her hair began to fall out). Jack Nicholson, for his part, got annoyed that the director was constantly rewriting the script. Nicholson ended up throwing away the text he was given in advance to instead learn his lines just minutes before filming began.If Stanley Kubrick had hoped ""The Shining"" would be a hit, he must have been disappointed. Not only did many reviewers criticize the film, but Stephen King was also very disappointed. In an article, the author claimed his work had been grossly distorted, and that the film lacked heart. So, it was perhaps no surprise that the Golden Razzie Awards nominated Stanley Kubrick the worst director of the year.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
"Overrated, but still good","The Shining The Shining The Shining ....... As at today, one of the highest rated films on IMDb. But honestly i'm surprised. The background music made it terrifying, but often not leading to anything.The movie takes far to long to get going. While there are definitely some great moments and the final minutes are epic, this isn't the best drama or horror I've seen. I noticed that only people who were watched this at 1980 rate it so highly. Honestly it's good, but not the best, or even one of the best ever. I would advice you to watch it though, it is entertaining. Jack Nicholson's performance is totally extraordinary.In Summary, nice movie.......... period.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
"Absolutely awful, awful stuff","This entire movie could have been viewed with subtitles and everything on fast forward. Low on dialogue and storytelling, and sky-high on Kubrik-Hype, his God-awful long shots were as deadly as Jack Nicholson's axe... they killed the movie and any suspense it attempted to create.I literally watched the last part of this movie on fast forward. The Kubrik-esquire long shots are an absolute drag, and the producers should have worked more on the script to let people understand the story more.Try watching a few scenes on fast forward, and you'll get the joke. Absolutely unacceptable. The story is not served in any way by watching a well-acted freak with an axe limp across a half-mile hallway or an old black guy walk, 6-inch stride by 6-inch stride across the same bloody hallway for five minutes.All movie adaptations worthy to be mentioned should have enough material within the contents of the movie for people who have NOT read the book to understand ENOUGH so as to get the general story right. This adaptation does not do anything of the sort.Unacceptable script-writing and unacceptable direction. I forgave Kubrik on 2001: A Space Odyssey, but after watching The Shining, in hindsight, his clichéd long shots and his awful storytelling puts him in one of the directors whose work I consistently do not enjoy.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
A masterpiece of terror/cinema art.,"What makes The Shining so good? Is it the acting? The music? The cinematography? The lighting? The set? All of the above. Horror can be a tough genre to judge because does a horror film have to scare you to be successful? And how do you know if you were truly scared or not? If you jump during a scene, does that make the movie scary and therefore successful? Or is the movie scary and therefore successful because you are thinking about it later and feeling a sense of uneasiness? The Shining fits more with the latter category of horror films. It's not a movie that will likely cause you to jump out of your seat with fear. It might not even cause you to lose sleep or feel a sense of fear when thinking about it later. However, it does make one think. Things like when did Jack start to go mental, did Danny have any part in that, why didn't the chef want to talk about room 237, why did the hotel staff leave a family there over the winter knowing what could possibly happen, and did Jack really exist in that photo from the 1920s? These are all unsettling questions you'll be asking yourself after watching The Shining. One of the major aspects that creates the horrific feel of this movie is without a doubt the music. During the most intense scenes, the music only adds to the hysteria unfolding. When Danny sees the girls, when Jack gets angry with Wendy for the first time, when Jack and Danny are talking about the hotel in the room, when Wendy discovers what Jack has really been typing, when Jack is breaking down the door with an axe, and of course when he's chasing Danny through the maze. The music in these scenes, reminiscent of Psycho or Jaws, is almost a character itself. The actual characters themselves were played with such conviction that sometimes it didn't really feel like they were acting. Jack Nicholson didn't really do anything different from what he normally does. He's known for being an actor slightly unhinged. I mean he played The Joker in Tim Burton's 1989 movie Batman and was a patient at mental hospital in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. It was natural that he play an author losing his mind inside a haunted hotel. Shelley Duvall has a stressed out and abused look to her, as if she's constantly fretting about her husband's alcohol problem, money, and food. She's the battered housewife who is soft spoken, meek and she smokes. Danny Lloyd's face said it all. His reactions to the horrific scenes he witnessed were spectacular, and made you sense the fear he was feeling. The cinematography of this film is excellent as well. How the camera follows Danny on his tricycle as he goes through the vast hotel, following Jack through the wintery hedge mazeit was a masterful achievement.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"

The creepy shining continues to glow.,"""The Shining"" is one of the best horror movies ever made. Based on the novel of the same name written by Stephen King, director Stanley Kubrick gives the film his own style and the result is a masterpiece (although not to the liking of Stephen King or the public at its premiere in 1980). The importance of ""The Shining"" continues to shine 41 years after its release. The performances are tremendous especially Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall whose scenes are unmatched, along with them Danny Lloyd and Scatman Crothers also stand out as a couple of people with psychic abilities. Cinematography along with filming locations and art direction achieve frames with unique visuals. The music score composed by Wendy Carlos and Rachel Elkind is one of the most grim in the history of horror cinema. ""The Shining"" is a masterpiece that will continue to transcend.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
A masterclass of atmospheric horror,"The Shining hardly needs much of an introduction: it was based on a bestseller by Stephen King which Stanley Kubrick loosely adapted, a film that Kubrick tortured Shelley Duvall and earned two Razzie nominations despite its obvious quality. The Shining was an intense film and one of the greatest horror films ever made. It was film that was filled with atmosphere thanks to Jack Nicholson's performance, the unsettingly direction and the music by Wendy Carlos and Rachel Elkind. Every filmmaking decision was deliberate by Kubrick to make the film feel uneasy even more Jack's mental breakdown and it was produced many iconic images and scenes.An issue I have had with The Shining is The Simpsons parody was so good that I couldn't help but think of it when watching the film. However, it has been a while since I last saw The Simpsons version so I was able to focus more on the film on its own merits.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Disturbingly Excellent,"I'm really not sure why Stephen King doesn't like this film. I mean, if I were King, I'd be making a bigger fuss over ""Maximum Overdrive"" if I was going to complain at all.The Shining is the story of the Overlook Hotel, a huge and beautiful place where the rich and famous have been spending their summers for nearly a century. However, when winter comes, the Overlook closes down for the season and a caretaker is left behind to look after the grandiose estate. The previous caretaker didn't work out so well; seems a touch of cabin fever drove him to slaughter his entire family with an ax...or at least, that's what everyone says happened. So enter Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson), his terribly insecure wife Wendy (Shelly Duvall) and their 5 year old psychic son Danny. The Torrances move in and settle down for a long winter within the deserted Overlook, but they slowly learn that the Overlook is not deserted at all and that many of the previous tenants never left.Like the festering house in the Japanese ghost story ""Ju-On,"" The Overlook is less a hotel than it is a malignancy which infects everyone who comes into contact with it. It works as slowly and insidiously as a cancer, fatally poisoning you before you are even aware of it. Poor little Danny, who is either gifted or cursed with a powerful psychic gift (which Overlook chef Dick Halloran calls ""The Shining"") is very much aware of the sickness that is the hotel and the many restless guests within. But it is Jack whom the hotel ensnares, quickly and easily, using his bad temper and his alcoholism to turn him against his wife and son. As the winter snows pile up and literally trap the family within the guts of the hotel, Jack quickly descends into madness and the profane ghosts become stronger and more insistent, all but shoving the ax into Jack's hands.This is one of the best ghost stories ever put on film. Much like the unseen entities in ""The Haunting"" the restless dead drive the fragile living into doing the dirty work for them, forcing them to feed new souls into the already crowded halls. The ghosts are very visible here: ghastly and robotic, they take the forms of butchered twin girls, a rotting woman in a bath tub and an ocean of blood crashing down an elegant foyer. The violence is surprisingly minimal, usually presented in aftermath shots, but they are powerful and disturbing shots that literally froze me in place. The acting of the entire cast is exemplary and the hideously creepy opening music sets the tone for the rest of the film, implanting a heavy sense of dread that never lifts until the end credits roll. This is my absolute favorite Kubrick film, and should not be missed by anyone, horror fan or no. 10 huge stars for this morbid masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Miserable adaptation of a great book,"This film is one of the worst screen adaptations of a novel I have ever seen.  Kubrick seems to make the wrong decision at every turn, and the result is a terribly long and incoherent film that does a terrible injustice to Stephen King's terrific original story.First of all, the story is about a man going SLOWLY insane; Nicholson seems more than halfway there at the start of the movie, robbing his character of any suspense.In general, Kubrick has (as usual) ignored his actors shamelessly, with the result that none of them gives anything close to the right performance.Another bad mistake:  in the book, the relationship between the father and the son is an unusually close and loving one; this makes the resulting horror all the more tragic.  In the film, the father and son seem to have no relationship at all.  The mother, a strong and purposeful character in the book, is here something of a ninny.Worst of all, perhaps, is that in the book the boy is the focus of the story; the movie shifts the focus to the father and therefore cuts the guts out of what was a pretty complex story.Also, like most of Kubrick's movies, this one is simply WAY TOO LONG.  There is absolutely no reason for this film to take so much time to say, in the end, so little.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"

The Best Horror Film Ever Made,"The Shining Film ReviewFor many, The Shining is rightly considered the greatest horror movie ever made. The film has so much to offer as an overall viewing experience and goes to show that Stanley Kubrick could make a movie of any genre and execute it to perfection.Kubrick brought something different to every movie he made and the same goes for The Shining. Kubrick uses classic elements of horror such as archetypes but adds his own twist with memorable and iconic scenes, an ambiguous ending, and a story filled with characters that keep audiences on edge the entire time.The Shining takes place in the 1980's during a cold, snowy winter in Colorado. Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) takes his family to the isolated Overlook Hotel where he has recently earned the job as off-season caretaker. There, he plans to finish the book he has been struggling to finish during his daily, suburbia-like lifestyle. Once they arrive and begin to settle in to the huge hotel, things start to change. Jack's son, Danny (Danny Lloyd), continues to be negatively affected by the visions in his head and his imaginary friend that goes by the name of Tony. As the snow piles up outside, Jack begins to discover the haunted secrets hidden within the lodge and a strong cabin-fever mentality kicks in. This leads Jack to slowly crack mentally until he becomes obsessed with harming his wife, Wendy (Shelley Duvall), and Danny.The film does so many things right and certainly stands out in the horror genre. Artistically, Kubrick showcases single-point perspective, a shooting style that frames a shot so all elements within it point toward a single focal point. This shooting style is ironically used in The Shining because it creates a sense of order in a hotel that becomes increasingly filled with chaos as the film goes on. John Alcott creates establishing shots that look beautiful while also building tension by showing the growing amounts of snow that isolate the family from any form of civilization or help. Kubrick recruited Garrett Brown, creator of the Steadicam, to help film several scenes including the ""maze scene"" at the end of the film as well as all of the scenes with Danny on his tricycle. These are particularly special because of the tension. Since the Steadicam follows behind Danny, the viewer never gets to see what is around each corner of the hotel until Danny actually sees it for himself. The ""haunted house"" and ""werewolf"" archetypes are prominent throughout. Characters in the Overlook constantly try to leave their mark on Jack, staining him in various ways in order to transform Jack into the monster he becomes by the end of the film. Kubrick was always obsessed with the details and this can clearly be seen in the use of costuming as indirect characterization. Wendy is almost always dressed in bright, primary colors that make her seem innocent and worry-free. In one scene, Jack and the bartender, Lloyd, wear the exact same color coat during a conversation which creates a mirror-like effect, a connection between the two men, and a sense of duality. This is appropriate because the film establishes a mirror trope right from the beginning. Jack Nicholson delivers a standout performance, one that is required to play such a dynamic character. He starts off as a loving father and husband just trying to write a book but turns into a ""nightmare come to life"" for his family. Nicholson is able to put himself into Jack's twisted mental position and become a blood-thirsty psychopath by the end. His performance is enhanced by quality, supporting roles played by Duvall and Lloyd that create a believable family being torn apart by Jack. The movie has few if any flaws of significance and is critically- acclaimed for its brilliance. Even if their were minor problems, it would be almost impossible for them to outweigh the seemingly endless list of positives. This Kubrick adaptation should be considered a classic in an otherwise, boring genre where the same thing is seen over and over. If all directors in horror tried to create films up to the standard that Kubrick creates in The Shining, the genre would not be the laughing stock it is becoming in Hollywood today. Those that enjoy slow-burn horror filled with tension or are just fans of Kubrick's work should see this movie as soon as possible and really savor the masterpiece it is. People that like horror filled with pop-out scares or fast-paced action should not. The Shining deserves all of the praise it has received over the years and proves how unique and creative Stanley Kubrick really was. It earns a perfect 10 out of 10 rating.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Horror Masterpiece,"'The Shining' is a horror masterpiece and without a doubt one of the best horror movies of all-time. Directed in meticulous style by the legendary Stanley Kubrick and adapted from the Stephen King novel of the same title resulting in a recipe for success and despite taking many liberties with the book that didn't stop this movie from becoming one of the most influential horror films ever and just look at how frequently it ranks on 'All-Time' bests lists.The Plot = A writer and recovering alcoholic Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) accepts a job as the off-season caretaker for the secluded Overlook Hotel, along with his wife Wendy (Shelly Duvall) and son Danny (Danny Lloyd) for the winter. However, the hotel is haunted and soon begins to take its toll on Jack's fragile mind and influencing him into violence, while his son Danny sees horrific psychic visions of the past and future.I always remember visiting my local video shop growing up and seeking out all my fave horror gems and then one day I came across this chilling and visually spectacular supernatural ghost story and well let's just say that it further cemented my love for the horror genre and quickly became one of my all-time faves, even to this day. Terrifying, hypnotic superbly crafted this movie has a way of pulling you into its atmospheric world without you even realizing it and even from the start it instantly engages you into his complex narrative that is also a chilling account of one man's journey into madness. The movie is chock full of memorable yet scary and disturbing imagery and features perhaps the most iconic and instantly recognizable movie locations of all-time - 'The Overlook Hotel' which itself feels like a character of its own with its ominous setting and haunting presence with its labyrinth styled architecture full of foreboding menace that creates a stunning achievement in set design. The skill full direction by Stanley Kubrick is simply outstanding with some of the best camerawork ever displayed on the big screen with such amazing attention to detail.The acting performances are legendary with Jack Nicholson creating a career-defining performance as the main lead Jack Torrence as he creates such a fascinating character that without him this film wouldn't have worked as well as it did. What more can I say about his incredible performance that hasn't already been said, the guy is an iconic and one of the finest actors of all-time. Shelly Duvall delivers an interesting performance going from a supportive and unassuming wife to a downright nervous wreck, she's simply fantastic in this role. Then finally Danny Lloyd gives an impressive performance as the son and contrasts the leading roles perfectly.Overall 'The Shining' is an innovative American horror classic and is something that should be in everyone's movie collection.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"

The shining BEAUTIFUL,"This is Stanley Kubrick's 11 full length film made in 1980 original a Stephen King novel this film stars the brilliant Jack Nicholson and the also brilliant Shelley Duvall. The shining was released as Horror and Mystery with a Certificate of (R), this filming had a budget of $19,000,000 and grossed $44,017,374 making it a very successful film by Stanley Kubrick. The plot for the film states '' A family heads to an isolated hotel for the winter where an evil and spiritual presence influences the father into violence, while his psychic son sees horrific forebodings from the past and of the future''. A very simple but engaging plot to a story.Before I express my love for this film I think it's only right to pen down just how awed I was whilst watching the unbelievable amount of detail put cinematography for this film. The word beautiful does not live up to what exactly I felt about the cinematography in this film, not only was I awed I was almost in shocked almost scarred knowing that someone just as human as me made something so.Immaculate. While trying as hard as possible to actually watch the film in detail I was constantly distracted by the cinematography in this film however when I did manage to focus on the film and the actors I have to say that I was actually very scarred most times while watching the film the other half of my concentration was spent marveling at the magnificence of the film itself.The acting in the was unbelievably authentic, it was recorded in the book ''The Real Stanley Kubrick'' that Kubrick was not so happy that Jack Nicholson made more money than he did for this film and in some ways it is understandable and although it is without a doubt that Kubrick had done a lot of work for this film it ultimately could have been let down by the acting. After watching Jack Nicholson's performance in this film it is now impossible for me to not think that somewhere far, far in Jack Nicholson's mind he has a bit of the personality of the character he played, left in him. I believed that he was crazy and he was going to kill his innocent family and at some points I did feel compassion for him but after questioning myself on why I did feel compassion, I could not find a reason. The main actor would not be able to make any impact on the audience without the help of his supporting actress Shelley Duvall. Shelley Duvall's eyes was probably the saddest eyes I have ever laid my eyes on, it made it easier to show just how scarred she was when her husband was going crazy. Her tears we real, her fear was real and he attempts to save herself and her child was equally as real but sometimes when on screen with Jack Nicholson, his character was so powerful that Shelley was left in the background and all the audience wanted to see was Jack Nicholson going crazy.Before watching this film I believed that it was impossible for a director to explain to the actor exactly what he wanted he or she to do but when I heard that Kubrick Made Shelley Duvall redo a scene in the film over a maybe exaggerated 100 times I believed that the acting in this film wasn't by luck it was something that Kubrick had seen and wanted to be acted perfectly on screen. Although it is recorded that Jack Nicholson improvised the line ''Here's Johnny'' In the bathroom scene, I felt that this so called legendary line did not add anything to the scene for me. Yes that line is a great line and yes it's become somewhat an iconic line but I couldn't understand what I was supposed to feel about it, the line did have a comedic side to but how was I supposed to find a man about to kill his wife and child funny. Even though Kubrick was known for his dark humor this was in no way dark or humorous.In conclusion I loved this film and saying exactly what I loved about this film would result in me repeating myself. This is my second favorite Kubrick film and this film made me have a respect for Kubrick .",,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"

What was Stanley Kubrick doing directing horror?,"The suspense was ruined scene after scene by bad editing. Jack Nicholson was never credible as a sane Jack Torrence. This should have been billed as ""loosely inspired by Stephen King's The Shining"". Left out the topiary (a very important aspect of horror in the book) and what's with the repeated shots of the elevator of blood? I think the ONLY reason this has gotten decent ratings is because it has Stanley Kubrick's name attached to it. If it had the director as Alan Smithee, I doubt it would have gotten above a 3 rating. If you want to see a very faithful adaptation of the novel, rent the mini-series Stephen King's The Shining. Shelley Duvall (an accomplished actress) was reduced to a whimpering, sniveling extra. And, what's with the finger ""redrum""?!? In the book... Tony lived in the back of his throat, not in his finger. About the only thing worth watching in this movie is Scatman, even though they changed his role quite dramatically from the book. This movie appears to have been made to show how insane Jack Nicholson can act, as he is really about the only thing featured in the movie.

The soundtrack is terrifying and haunting, it keeps the audience on their toes throughout the entire film. The cinematography is very cinematic, including numerous tracking shots, making the film looks beautiful and makes the location seems more real. The performances are good for most of the cast but Jack Nicholson's performance is over the top, his performance could have been more restraint early on in the film. But it does make the film more entertaining and remember-able. Characters could have had more development to define the characters more; this could have made them more interesting. Also some back-story could have been used to define and to make them more interesting as well. Good dialogue that works in the film. A very intriguing plot that only gets better as the film goes on. I enjoy how the plot unfolds growing ever so creepy and unpredictable as the time goes on. Great unique visuals are used frequently giving the film a interesting look. Amazing set design of the overlook Hotel. Good characters, they are not all are amazing characters but they work in the film.

4K HDR Final Cut.,"What defines the greatest horror film of all time? Is it the film that most unsettles and terrifies you? Is it the film that rewards repeat viewings, never diluting the film's impact no matter how many times you watch it? Or is it the film so expertly crafted whether it be the tight plotting, career defining performances or flawless direction, that it comes close to perfection? Whatever way you define greatness The Shining inevitably comes out on top.I have vivid memories of watching Kubrick's masterpiece for the first time. Like all the best horror experiences I was far too young to really watch it, and despite hearing stories about it in the playground, nothing can really prepare you for your first time. At that age you don't appreciate the brilliant acting and direction as you're too wrapped up in the sheer terror of what is unfolding on screen. Whilst the big and most famous moments hit their marks with precision it was the little fleeting incidental moments that freaked me out the most. The blink and you'll miss it fellating man-bear was particularly unsettling and even to this day it is hard to really understand why.Yet the film's great strength is that, unlike so many other films in the genre, it still manages to disturb on repeat viewings. You may know when the twins make an appearance or when Jack goes loco with an axe, but these are mere exclamation marks to the true horror that lurks around every corner of the Overlook Hotel. The film's genius is in its subliminal surrealness that creeps under your skin without you even realising. The hotel is built with impossible rooms, dead ends and inconsistent blueprints. It's not something you notice, not consciously at least, not until you've really lived with the film. Rob Ager produced a fascinating video analysis of the strange spatial awareness in the film (you can watch the documentary on YouTube - One, Two and Three) which gives you an insight into why this film has endured and details the exacting standards Kubrick demanded. Kubrick has often been criticised of being cold, clinical and never being interested in characters. This is of course pure poppycock, none more so in this film. You completely buy into the family dynamic here meaning when it begins to fracture you are totally invested in the survival of Wendy and Danny whilst Jack becomes much more than just a stock bogeyman to fear.The way Kubrick defies genre convention - the horror being just as real and threatening in the daytime as it is at night, the omniscient-like camera often keeping a distance from the characters and the fact that the film's protagonist isn't the victim but the antagonist - means that the audience can never settle. The horror is all pervasive rather than merely relying on traditional and safer jolt scares. There is no safety net here, no moments of comfort for the audience to dry their sweaty palms of unclench their white-knuckled fists, it is a descent into madness for both Jack and the audience.In the end, The Shining is not only a masterclass in horror but in filmmaking too. A true classic irrespective of genre and a film that will continue to unsettle audiences for decades to come. Peerless.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Kubrick's vision of King's The Shining,"When it comes to Stanley Kubrick's 1980 film, The Shining, there are not many movies that can show the slow and uneasy turn to insanity that someone like Jack Torrance experiences. The movie's simple plot: a family lives in a hotel in the mountains, to keep it in good working condition for the spring time. Jack Torrance slowly loses his mind as his own thoughts are the loudest thing in the hotel.
The film is groundbreaking and influential, not only for the industry as a whole, but also for what I hope to emulate on day and improve on. The films application of color was unnoticed to most, once the audience has knowledge about that theory, it changes the whole perspective, giving the viewers a roller coast of emotion.
When it comes to the editing of The Shining, the long and growingly uncomfortable shots make the audience notice even the most minor of details, from Jack raising his eyebrows to Wendy's growing fear on her face. The pacing of the film is something that most films cannot replicate, the exponential increase in horror and tension near the end of the film seems to come out of nowhere for the average viewer, but more people more in-depth with the knowledge of the industry, it is obvious from the start. The perspective of the film is highlighting Jack, who is a struggling writer, trying to finish a book that he started, giving himself space to think. His own mind ends up being the jail cell he was trying to escape.
The Shining is a great film, that will stand the test of time. Though Stephen King wasn't a fan of it, most critics welcome The Shining with open arms, excited to see another one of Kubrick's creations.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"

Let's go back in time!,"Beyond the fact that ""The Shining"" has been released 42 years ago it's an outstanding horror film, remembered as a timeless classic. There is always something so unique in movies based on King's novels. They are not like the others, there's just always something that makes them so entertaining to watch. First time I watched ""The Shining"" was around 2007, it was one of the first horror films I've ever watched. The vibe from the 80's made my watching experience even better. It felt like I was watching a REAL horror movie. I hope that nobody will make a remaster of ""The Shining"" cause that would be so bad. That's it folks!Greetings from Singapore!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Can't believe I didn't like it,"This movie has two things going for it: style and eyebrows.The visual style is quite handsome and well done. Intriguing sets, odd colors, and a sense of large, sinister space inside the hotel. This was the first movie to utilize the Steadicam camera, and it's put to good use.The musical style is also effective. Bizarre 20th-century classical works (similar to the ones in Kubrick's 2001) enhance the spooky and creepy nature of the action.And of course, we have Jack Nicholson's eyebrows. I don't believe they've been put to the test before or since. They're very effective in letting us know what's on his mind.But if you take all this away, you're left with a very confusing story. Okay, so the hotel is haunted. Somehow along the way we find that one of the characters may be from the past, and then that seems to be confirmed at the end. But so what? What does that have to do with the story? Why is that important? What does that have to do with the hotel? Why do the scenes from the past matter and how do they fit in with the story in the present?I saw the movie when it first came out, and just watched it tonight, 30 years later. I wanted to give it a second chance. But I felt exactly the same way both times. I found it boring, not scary, somewhat predictable, and ultimately unsatisfying. Style is grand, but it cannot make up for a story that doesn't make any sense.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
The Shining - gloomy and uninspiring amid spectacular shots,"At the start, I was drawn into the movie with the aerial filming of a vehicle driving through the Colorado Mountains. Jack Nicholson as Jack Torrance is driving to a mountain hideaway for an interview at the Overlook Hotel for a job lasting through the winter at a snowbound hotel. Despite the serious isolation, which he is warned about, he takes the job and brings his family - his wife played by Shelley Duvall and child Danny Lloyd. This is where Jack is going to write his magnum opus, the great book he has never been able to take on. The first flag that goes up for me is why would anyone take a job involving such a long stretch of time, especially with his loved ones. It's not as if they can go skiing everyday or have access to big screen entertainment...just a long period of solitude doing routine work inside the hotel. To make matters worse, the sheer size of the immense hotel only worsens the loneliness. His 7 year old spends time cycling along the lengthy corridors. The mother and boy get lost in a giant maze of hedges, one scene that was terrifying. There are a few staff at the hotel and one in particular, Dick Halloran, played by Scatman Crothers, who warns them about the maze and the hotel's past as a crime scene. Predictably Jack and his family become a bit stir crazy with the grand, snowbound place which is soon engulfed in a the worst snowstorm in many years. The worst is yet to come as Jack, a recovering alcoholic, resumes drinking and becomes more antisocial and violent in his behaviour. The hotel management didn't exercise what would be considered due diligence in hiring him and worse allowing him to come with his family. Presumably, they were happy to get someone there regardless of the huge personal cost, not to say the risk to all involved. Stanley Kubrick is considered one of the great directors of all time and visually, the movie is stunning in many ways - from getting lost in the maze to the camera work of the boy on his tricycle, the aerial photography and the deep focus shots inside the huge hotel. I didn't find it scary but a pointless showcase of blood and violent attacks. I much prefer the high suspense associated with movies like Psycho or Halloween. I had to see this movie again to revisit my previous impression and while it does have some merit, it is still for me a major disappointment.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
a mostly negative review,"The Shining is a mediocre horror effort, I have been scared more by episodes of Dr Who. Although the novel is a very absorbing story, (me being a knowledgable horror critic) it does not deserve the praise it recieves. In the entire film I don't think I was scared once and certainly didn't have to ""sleep with the lights on"", the downfall however was not acting ability but an inappropiate screen adaption, which didn't force the viewer to think or at any time be in any doubt of what the that his/her perceptions were incorrect. Although it might sound it, I don't hate this film, as films go it is quite good, it is just not one of the top notch horror films that it is made out to be, better screen adaptions of Stephen King Novels are Misery and perhaps IT (bar the stupid ending), which I would much rather recommend.The Shining is a film everyone should see once (no more).7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"

A masterpiece on every level,"The Shining is a cinematic masterpiece on every level. There isn't a single wasted line or wasted shot and the set design is incredible in its symmetry. It's almost unbelievable that the entirely convincing hotel interiors were built on sound stages in England and not in an actual historic hotel in Colorado. Jack Nicholson gives an absolute powerhouse of a performance as Jack Torrance and Shelley Duval, as his wife Wendy, does 'terrified face' better than anyone has ever done. Child actor Danny Lloyd (as his namesake Danny) shows an acting ability well beyond his years. Scatman Crothers gives great support as the concerned but doomed Dick Halloran.Kubrick's mastery of the art of cinema is on display in every frame. There is a scene where Jack first begins to unravel. He is working in his cavernous study and we see him from behind. Everything is perfectly symmetrical, except Jack who is seated at his typewriter just slightly off centre. Maybe it's accidental but somehow I doubt it. Kubrick is signalling that the wheels are about to come off Jack's mental state as he begins to give in to the murderous spirit that haunts the Overlook Hotel.Only on this latest watch did the degree of misogyny and gaslighting really come through for me. Jack blames Wendy for his own lack of creative output. Everything is her fault and the descent into violence and attempted murder is tragically an all-too-real one for so many abused women. There really ought to be a trigger warning for any victim of domestic violence. The horror here goes well beyond a cinematic genre to the actual experience of far too many women and children at the hands of violent men. Ironically, Kubrick was one of them as he tormented Shelley Duvall to get the terrified performance he needed to perfect his art.There are so many iconic visual moments in this film that have entered into pop culture to the extent that it's hard to recapture what their original impact must have been like - the ghostly twins, the woman in the bathtub, the cascading blood from the elevator doors, Danny's wild ride on his tricycle through the haunted hallways, and of course, 'Here's Johnny!' as the axe comes through the bathroom door. They have all entered the lexicon of the horror genre and deservedly so. In the final shot, are we to understand that Jack has always been the murderous spirit that haunts the Overlook or is it simply that evil is never short of receptive hosts ready to surrender themselves to their most malicious impulses?Stephen King is famous for letting anyone and everyone adapt his novels, selling the rights to do so for as little as a dollar. It's a risky business, evidenced by the number of truly awful Stephen King adaptations that have made it onto the screen. In The Shining however, it pays off wonderfully, in possibly the finest adaptation of any of his novels.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"

"Arguably The Most Aesthetic, Artistic & Accomplished Of All Horror Films!","Arguably the most aesthetic, artistic & accomplished of all horror films, Stanley Kubrick's The Shining is another masterwork of precision craftsmanship that presents the gifted filmmaker at his prime as he smoothly blends the elements of supernatural & psychological horror into one methodically structured & meticulously layered story whose underlying themes & narrative complexity has spawned numerous interpretations over the years and remains a subject of discussion amongst film buffs even today.The Shining tells the story of Jack Torrance, a former teacher who takes the caretaker's job at the Overlook Hotel which tends to stay closed during the winter season. Arriving at the remote location with his wife & son, Jack intends to use the solitude of the hotel to pursue his passion for writing but once the family settle into the hotel, his condition worsens as he begins to act strangely, suffers from writer's block, becomes prone to violent outbursts & is constantly haunted by the supernatural entity that reside there.Co-written, produced & directed by Stanley Kubrick, The Shining is his first stint with horror and yet he exhibits a far better understanding of this genre than most established directors of horror cinema. From the opening moments, the film is able to establish an ominous mood thanks to the eerie score that accompanies its title sequence and the aerial photography that finds its camera hovering over those rocky mountains, lush landscapes & narrow roads leading to the Overlook Hotel, thus already foreshadowing the isolation that awaits the Torrance familyThe technical aspects in almost every Kubrick film is carried out with precision care and The Shining is no exception. Production design team deserves kudos for the meticulously designed set pieces for it provides the hotel an identity of its own. Cinematography makes very inventive use of its camera & follows our characters like a silent observer at all times while the fluid movements, clever angles, steady zooms, perfect lighting & aptly chosen colour tones greatly amplify the whole look & feel of the picture. The real highlight however is how the Steadicam is utilised.Kubrick here pushes the Steadicam to its extreme to achieve a smoothness & stability that hasn't been replicated ever since. The flexibility & sleek flow provided by this new technique didn't just allow the director to stage some of modern cinema's most iconic shots but also brings the viewers into the story by placing them behind the characters as the plot unfolds. Editing is a strong highlight too for almost every scene ends up playing a relevant role in the story. And the background score is in perfect sync with each & every moment and elevates the whole experience by encapsulating the entire film with a highly unsettling mood.With Jack Nicholson in the lead role, Jack Torrance already looks like someone who's just waiting for a little push to descend into total madness which doesn't come off as a surprise when it eventually happens. The stressful experience Shelley Duvall underwent during its production is well-documented but the effect of it all can be felt in her rendition of a broken Wendy, as the entire ordeal only helped her performance. And Danny Lloyd plays their psychic kid and just like every kid in almost every horror film, he's annoying to an extent. All three actors are over-the-top at times but this added exaggeration somehow works in the film's favour.On an overall scale, The Shining is a thought-provoking meditation on madness, isolation & paranoia that defies everything that was usually a norm in the genre of horror back then yet puts on screen a cinema that is now regarded as a definitive example of atmospheric horror. Immortal for its contribution to horror, a staple of pop culture, and a classic amalgamation of superb direction, deft writing, innovative camera-work, skillful editing, menacing score & devoted performances, The Shining remains one of the greatest achievements of its genre that's only getting better with time and is definitely amongst Stanley Kubrick's finest works. Highly recommended. Multiple viewings advised.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
The best horror movie of all time.,"Kubrick proved his brilliantness again, now in a suspense-horror film based on Stephen King's book titled the same way. Jack Torrance is a man in his forties, married, with one child, and with a past of trouble and alcoholism. The Overlook Hotel in Colorado suspends service during the winter because of its extreme weather, and there is a well-paid job for the person who takes care of the facilities during those five months; and Torrance, who was looking to become a writer, found it perfect. But, the manager advised Torrance about the loneliness in this place during the winter, potentially dangerous, and told him that some caretaker in the past went crazy and murdered his family. Even before they got there, his son Danny, who has some sort of imaginary friend who illuminates him the future (shinning), knew the place wasn't good and didn't want to go. Once they installed themselves in the hotel, things started right but within a month, Jack began acting strange, irritated, and depressed. At this point, we know something is going to happen, but don't know when and how. Scary things happen such as the appearance of two twin girls talking to Danny, and someone who attacked him violently. They are not alone in this place. Later on, Jack started to see other people and immediately felt good with them, like if they were his family; among them the famous psychotic caretaker, Delbert Grady. Grady tells Torrance that he must kill his family because they are ""intruders"" in the hotel. Obeying this order, Jack went for the objective and many of the most scary things I've ever seen happen here. The ending is spectacular and the viewers will stay interested and shocked until the last minute.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Shelley Duvall was adorable in this chiller!,"Super scary, but without the extra gory special effects of today, and without the extreme jump-scares so common of contemporary films of the genre. What gore there was, was relatively mild compared to what today's audiences are used to, and thus this film is a lot less gross than today's horror, but effectively thrilling and chilling. I don't like being scared, but the intrigue of the tone and story keeps me watching, so this was good.I loved the sweet cook character who talked about the shine, and Shelley Duvall was adorable!

Absolutely Worthless,"Do not waste your time on this movie.  It is one of the best examples of a botched translation from print to screen ever.  It has been inexcusably ""Kubrickized"" to make it fit in more easily with the rest of Stanley Kubrick's body of work.Kubrick takes the basic idea from the book-- and I do mean the most absolutely basic outline of the story-- and changes it into something that is not even remotely scary. In the book, the Hotel itself is the fourth main character, slowly driving Jack Torrance insane.  In this utter waste of film, Jack was crazy when they got there, and the isolation from the outside world is what takes him over the edge.  In this bastardized version, there is no point in having Danny possessed of psychic powers, nor of making the Hotel itself haunted.  Those two points, which should be the two most important facts of the story, instead take a backseat to a very predictable, very generic story of an already unstable man finally snapping.Do yourself a favor, and instead of this absolute SIN of a film, watch the made-for-tv mini-series starring Steven Weber.

"Horror genre, The Shining","I've always been a big fan of horror films, although one thing I have always felt that they lacked is originality. The stories all contain the same elements and the concepts were all loosely based on something supernatural rather then something realistic and something like body horror.The Shining was the first film which I thought had brought something original to the horror film genre. The movie follows a writer (Jack Nicholson) and his family who agree to watch over a hotel while it is closed for the winter. There were rumours of the place being haunted, the last resident went crazy and murdered his family as a result of the effects of the hotel onto his stability of mind. However, Jack is convinced that he and his family will be okay and he can use the quiet to overcome his writer's block. After months of solitude and silence however, Jack becomes a grumpy and later violent man. Is it cabin fever or is there something in the hotel that is driving him mad?One of the scariest parts of the film is the extreme sense of isolation which Stanley Kubrick makes.

Terrific essay on Human's insanity!,"There's no doubt that SHINING is a major classic of the horror genre, but it's even a bit more than that. It's the horror movie elevated to the ""art status"". I mean, unlike the majority of the horror films which use the same kind of plot, stereotyped characters, clichéd scenes, and worst of all, are produced and reproduced in endless sequels, SHINING is a single and unique piece of ""Horror Art"" (as PSYCHO was until they remember to do the first sequel in 1983). It doesn't mean that SHINING doesn't have some clichéd scenes, because it has indeed (I can remember the scene when WENDY lock herself in the bathroom and tries to escape through that little window where barely could pass her head), but if we ""forget"" about the few clichés it has we really have a good horror film here. On the other hand, in this movie, horror is more symbolic than actually gory. It is mainly symbolic icons which create the horror scenes, so we can definitely say it's more a psychological horror movie than really a gore fest. In fact, there's almost no blood, if we exclude those ""blood waves"" gushing out through the corridors (here it is one of the symbolisms I did refer). More than a horror film, SHINING is a terrific essay about Human's insanity, because it explores until the edge the loss of self control and the irrationality of the Human mind! And to do that disturbed character, JACK TORRANCE, who better than Jack Nicholson?! He really looks like a true lunatic! Superb acting I must say! He has the perfect face, expression, sarcasm! On the opposite side it's the acting by Shelley Duvall, which plays WENDY TORRANCE! It's really bad! She doesn't convince at all playing the victim, as her acting just seems too fake to me! Danny Lloyd, the small kid, also does a nice performance. Excellent film, I score it 9/10!",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Dreadful,"The Shining begins with the camera gliding, twisting, and turning over winding roadways. The opening credits crawl up the screen not unlike closing credits during these aerial shots. And a dies irae, played on a synthesizer, oozes from the soundtrack.. At frame-one Kubrick inspires a feeling of dread, a feeling of uneasiness, and a sense that something is not quite right.No, The Shining is not one of my favorite horror films; however, I have to give credit where it is due, and I have to acknowledge that the Shining accomplishes what it sets out to do: inspire dread.I originally watched the Shining 15 years ago, and didn't care for it at the time. Upon revisiting the film I was surprised by how vividly I remembered the film (more vividly than the novel, I might add.) So kudos to Kubrick.Then interestingly, Kubrick explores another meaning of the word ""dreadful"" with the dialogue in the following scenes  the interview. Painfully forced, obligatory, dare I say Hollywood-ish? I cringed watching Jack Nicholson put up a stilted performance complete with a phony grin as he assures his employers, ""Five months of peace is just what I'm looking for."" And the performance of all the other characters matches this same stilted tone.Like a puppet show with Stanley pulling the strings.Shelley Duvall stares into her past, making an uncomfortable recitation (that curiously lacks conviction) of the memory where Jack hurt little Danny once upon a time. In the end, I felt this neglect ultimately robs the film of some of the emotional attachment required to get the sense of tragedy  although Roger Ebert's perspective paints these stilted performances in a fascinating light in his Great Movie review series.Then, strangely enough, as Jack descended the steps to insanity, his performance felt more natural, more believable, and I bought every second of his unprovoked hostility. Eventually leading back to that same adjective, ""dreadful"" in the sense that at any moment this man could snap as he sits with Danny for a painfully long period of time until the mounting suspense becomes unbearable.The Kubrickian pacing syndrome where things happen (or don't happen) by Stanley's watch: as I described in the above paragraph (which is not a criticism, btw), the film is not afraid of pausing. Not afraid to linger. And not afraid to take its time, while the camera absorbs the hotel in such a way that it (rightly) becomes an ominous character in itself.Having said that: the Overlook Hotel was Kubrick's playground, and he masterfully wove its vast depth, its space, and its symmetry into the very fabric of the film. The cinematography is simply marvelous, literally bombarding the audience with symmetrical shot after symmetrical shot compliments of the Overlook's architecture. The sensation is like watching a story told through a series of animated religious paintings. Symmetrical. Unnatural. Something isn't right.Then the film moves outside for a sudden contrast in shot composition  the climax. Frequently reduced to a mere silhouette, Jack races through the creepy foggy atmosphere on the cold snowy landscape in an asymmetrical frame. Here we observe a contradiction of expectations - these exteriors in the bleak snowscape feel less empty and less isolated than the interior shots of the Overlook as if the hotel were a vacuum.Unnatural.Dreadful.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"

Fantastic style,"I'm not sure why this one has never resonated with me quite as much as it does with so many others. I like it, and thought I might like it even more on what was probably my fifth viewing over the years, but it still didn't click to the next level. I love the stunning beginning sequence from the air with the car driving through beautiful mountain scenery, the brilliant dreamlike (or nightmare-like) ending sequence in the maze, the classic moments from Jack Nicholson ('Here's Johnny' and all that), and the horrifying moment when Shelley Duvall finds out that all he's been typing is 'All work and no play...' instead of cranking out the great American novel. Probably my favorite moment was when their boy has gone to the room to get a toy, and we see a shot of Nicholson both on the bed and in a mirror, calling him over. It's absolutely terrifying, because we know he's hurt the boy while drinking in the past, we know something evil is going on with this place, and we see him in that mirror, so perfectly placed in the shot. The style and the cinematography of the film are fantastic.I guess what holds me back a bit is either the original story from Stephen King, which seems a little overdone, or the direction from Stanley Kubrick, who gives us little nuance. I think it would have been better if it hadn't had all the backstory about the Indian burial site, the place being cursed, the former caretaker having axed his family, and the chef having a psychic connection with the little boy. He's really going to be out there in Florida, feel a disturbance in the Force or whatever, and then fly off to Colorado and drive out to what is supposed to be an inaccessible place? I know stripping all this out would have gutted the film and had King fans howling even more than they do as it is, but I wish it had just been the guy and his family out there for the winter, slowly going crazy, without all the other mumbo-jumbo. The twins are spooky, but the flood of blood from the elevator? I don't know. As it is, to fit all that in, or maybe because of the choices Kubrick made, the pace to insanity is awfully quick, too damn quick, whereas a slow path would have been more terrifyingly tense and real to me. On top of that, Nicholson's performance is memorable for sure, but jeez if only he would emote a little, you know? He should have dialed it down early, to tell the story of gradual descent into madness better, and to make the scenes towards the end more powerful.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
"One of the greatest directors, one of the greatest actors, one of the worst movies","Stanley Kubrick is one of the greatest directors of all time and his many movies are excellent, probably because he is perfectionist, despite this is a torture for the actors who worked with him. As I read, he had gotten Shelley Duvall act the same scene 87 times, then Duvall had a nervous breakdown. It seems impossible, but unfortunately, in spite of this effort (perfectionism) there is nothing except for Jack Nicholson. Everyone talks about the bicycle scene with amazement. Yes, it was interesting, but if we think about Kubrick's other movies, it is nothing. The script is seriously mediocre, the direction is a bit better than the script. For example, the development of the story is uninspiring. Nicholson enters the bar of the house and starts to talk to a man, but also he does not react at all as if everything is fine. What a bad idea to mention that the house is uncanny. You think to yourself like what is going on here? The idea of the man who comes a mansion with his wife and children, then he starts to go mad was not well adapted in other words. The movie is in contradiction with Kubrick's coherent direction style. The final was one of the most uninspiring finals of all times and a little bit ridiculous. The characters who sense the danger and try to help are nonsense and unnecessary. Those characters only serve to thrill us, but unnecessary. The child often looks gawkily, he gapes. Those moments are very silly and to me really annoying. The hatchet scene is the best (the only best) scene of the movie. I should count the bicycle scene, too which the child rides his bike through the corridors. Generally, in fact, always, nobody does something to the bad movies which loved and overrated, but The Shining was nominated for the worst director in Razzie awards.

A Horror Classic,"A family heads to an isolated hotel for the winter where an evil and spiritual presence influences the father (Jack Nicholson) into violence, while his psychic son (Danny Lloyd) sees horrific forebodings from the past and of the future.What is most interesting is that this film has gone from bad to good. When it first came out, the reviews were not so positive, and there were even some Golden Raspberry nominations (but no wins). Today, this is not only considered a top horror film but one of the top 100 films of any genre... what a turnaround.Then we have King's disappointment, and I think he raises serious concerns: he did not like the casting of Nicholson, and he did not think Kubrick made the film as horror-focused as it could have been. On the first point, it is true that the lead should have had a greater transition. Nicholson just looks crazy from the first scene. I would love to have seen Michael Moriarty...As for the Kubrick criticism, it is true... he bent over backwards to make an artsy, stylish film, but maybe not a horror film. It is a great film, but maybe not a great horror film. If you want a good haunting film, for example, ""The Changeling"" has this one beat...",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
How Stupid!!!,"Okay, well I am 14 and me and my 11 year old brother decided to rent the Shining and watch it last Saturday night.  My 8 year old sister Rachel and my 2 half sisters Emma, 5 and Ashley, 17 watched it with us.  None of us had seen it and we thought we were in for a big fright!  Throughout the whole movie, Emma and Rachel kept asking us when it was going to get scary!!!! There was not one scary thing in the movie!  We laughed more than anything!!!  When we started watching it we wern't sure if Emma should watch it with us, b/c she might get to scared, but she and Rachel just laughed the whole time!!!!  The movie was not a bit scary!  We watched Urban Legends after the Shinig and it was 100% more scarier!!!  I thought we were going to be in for a HUGH scare with The Shining, and I was SOOOOO dissapointed! Usually, ever more scares me, but not this one!  I even got scared at Alicia Silverstone's True Crime but I was not the least bit frightened at The Shining and neaither was Landon, Rachel, Emma or Ashley!  It was more funny than anything!!!Much Love ** Alexandra",,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
The Shining (9/10),"Stanley Kubrick is considered one of the top directors for a reason, his adaptation of Stephen King's The Shining is a tremendous piece of cinematic history. The scenery and music in the opening credits are eerily horrifying right off the bat. The character of Jack Torrance would not have a better role if it wasn't done by Jack Nicholson. The small supporting cast of Shelley Duvall, Danny Lloyd, Scatman Crothers and Barry Nelson were equally great in the film. Although there were terrific performances, the real star was The Overlook Hotel and the masterful way Kubrick portrayed the evilness of the place. The film develops itself very slowly and builds itself into complete insanity. The horror scenes that include the twin girls, Room 237 and the stairway are all freaky and expertly shot. When the ending comes it does come as a shock because the vast majority of viewers have no idea what just happened. It takes multiple viewing and additional research to completely understand King's and Kubrick's deranged story that is The Shining.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
"Not Worth Your Time, or The Film it was Made On","AVOID THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Lots of brain dead Kubrick-heads will try to tell you that this is the best Horror Movie ever simply because Kubrick made it.  This is a FALSEHOOD.First off, it's not a Horror Movie.  You have to at least try to be scary to be a Horror Movie.  This film never even makes an effort in that regard.Second off, it's not good.  Even if you try to watch it as just a ""suspense movie"" and forget about all this Horror which you are supposed to be exposed thru all throughout this movie, it's still just not a good movie.  There is no plot to speak of.  The Wife and Son, and the Hotel for that matter, who should ALL be treated as equal characters to Jack (and in the case of Danny and the Hotel, MORE important) are all pushed to the side so that we can constantly be treated to scene after scene of Jack Nicholson completely botching every aspect of his character.  How the man ever had a career, much less a successful one, after this travesty is beyond me.Do yourself a favor and try to catch the ABC TV Miniseries version.  Stephen King actually oversaw that one to make sure it came out right.  And it did.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
A Shining Piece in the Top Echelons of Cinema!,"The Shining is a curious motion picture. While Stephen King (on whose novel 'The Shining' the movie is based) was largely ambivalent about the adaptation, for legions of filmaholics, it is an example of directorial bravura and an exemplary study of psychosis and unreliable terror. With its intensely suffocating sense of personality disintegration, The Shining is as unsettling as anything Stanley Kubrick made during his distinguished career.At its core, The Shining is a simple haunted-house story. Jack Torrance (Nicholson) takes up a job at the unbelievably remote Overlook Hotel in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado (a place where many depraved incidents have happened, it has become something of a library of malevolent psychic energy) with his wife Wendy (Duvall) and his son Danny (Lloyd) in tow. They are to spend six and a half months as the winter caretakers for the hotel, separated from the rest of humanity by an unforgiving alpine winter. Jack's personality seems on the edge and we soon learn that he's a recovering alcoholic. Wendy is the kind of meek wife who follows her husband's lead while Danny has a disconcerting habit of conversing with himself, implied to be a manifestation of his psychic powers. Very soon, bizarre occurrences start happening and the movie flails off into an orgy of psychological terror. Wendy becomes concerned that her husband is losing his grip on sanity. And with a winter storm howling outside, the spacious hotel becomes a penitentiary. And the weirdness and danger escalate further as Jack slips over the edge from sanity to madness.Nicholson's centerpiece performance is so absolutely terrifying and raw that it's no wonder he's spent the rest of his career in its shadow. Duvall as the mousy, jangled wife makes the most of her natural wide-eyed innocence, while Lloyd is equally compelling as the young boy who has the gift of the (paranormal) gab. The real star here, however, is Kubrick's direction. Kubrick creates a twisted environment in which mental stability, supernatural malignance and the sense of space and time shimmer and twist to dreadful effect. Kubrick presents much of the movie from Jack's point-of-view, and it becomes apparent that Kubrick wants us to become mired in the maelstrom of his disintegrating sanity. He however, never answers the questions about whether Jack's ghoulish visions are real or fabrications of his increasingly warped imagination, which adds to the eerie discomfort. By the end of the film, every inch of the hotel hints at something sinister and every frame is infused with a sense of the macabre.With Kubrick's majestic fingerprints all over it, The Shining easily finds a place in the top echelons of cinematic achievements. A totally visceral experience!",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
The Shining is More Than a Horror Movie,"Anyone can make a horror movie. Throw in some blood, gore, a chainsaw, and mask suddenly the most basic movie script turns into a box-office hit. No author understood this concept as thoroughly as Stephen King. By unintentionally monopolizing the genre, he created an era of cheap thrills and paper-mache horror. With titles like Pet Semetary and Cujo the Demon Dog to his name, it's no wonder that people scoffed at The Shining when it was first released. A man is trapped inside all winter and he goes nuts from cabin fever. So what?Where others saw cliché horror, Stanley Kubrick saw potential. He manipulated the plot so that the main character's insanity, driven by isolation and supernatural forces, became intrinsically lined with marital abuse, unrequited love, and premature domesticity. By radically deviating from the original story line, Kubrick has transformed The Shining into something much more than a horror movie. It is now a study of of humanity, dehumanized and defeated, starved and beaten, tempted and tortured, by forces within and beyond.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"

All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy,"Think of the greatest terror imaginable. Is it a monstrous Alien? A lethal epidemic? Or is it this harrowing masterpiece from Stanley Kubrick, is it fear of murder by someone who should love and protect you-a member of your own family? From a script he co-adapted from the Steven King novel, Kubrick melds vivid performances, menacing settings, dreamlike tracking shots and shock after shock into a milestone of the macabre. Jack Torrance arrives at the elegant, isolated Overlook Hotel as off- season caretaker with his wife and child. Torrance has never been there before, or has he? The answer lies in a ghostly time warp of madness and murder.This film stars: Jack Nicholson, Shelly Duvall & Danny LlyodThis film is a scary film, I watched this with a friend and he was literally bricking it throughout the film, In my opinion it is not a great film but it is a film that I can watch and be scared like I should in a horror film, it doesn't deserve 8.5 in my opinion but I can see why people love this film. I highly recommend it, just don't plan on having too much sleep the same night as it will leave you shocked & scared.***/***** good film",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
I dont get why everybody thinks this is so good?,"Ok, honestly I dont see why everybody thinks this is so great.  Its really not.  There were two good things that came out of this movie 1.  Jack's performance, he was very good I can tip my hat for him.  2.  Danny's performance, he was good.  No other then that it got pretty stupid.  And, what was Stanley Kubrick thinking drafting Shelly as the Wendy?   She was so bad.  She looked the same every time she got scared.  The problem with this movie was the ending.  I would have had more respect for it if Kubrick would have ended it differently.  And, the over all movie was just stupid.  The problem with the movie is that the book was so much better.  So dont see the movie read the book and you will be much better off.  3/10.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
"Nobody can conquer this movie, you think you have cracked its purpose, you have not even come close. It is just too damn tremendous.","Watching this horror masterpiece from the Kubrick of Stanley (Stanley Kubrick), I personally never understood nor entirely loved, but with this re-watching; I accept ""The Shining"" is something on it's own level and deserve it's labels, ""first epic horror film."" I may have seen it over and over, so much so I reference it in other reviews as a fine film, the film itself is an enigma to me, which is why I watched Vivian Kubrick's the making of The Shining just before sitting through the real thing, hoping it would help me have a good conclusion on this orchestra of a horror film.I think there may not be a huge massage behind his weird and irregularity of showing you something profound and questioning, I think his huge IQ helped him understand a film that is hard to pin down is just entertaining throughout, never once is ""The Shining"" or Kubrick or other unique movies (Clockwork Orange, Dr. Strangelove) boring. I'm thinking it is all to keep the suspecting viewer on there toes, like a game of chess. Get ready for this craziness, the owner of The Overlook looks a lot like John F Kennedy and the American flag on his desk as well as stenciled name on his desk is well, and his saying goodbye to the beautiful girls walking by as he shows Jack around, JFK was a ladies man. Kinda like the fake moon landing theories addressed in the reality poking documentary about ""The Shining,"" Room 237. But leaving secret massages out of it, it is just an excellently made film, stating the obvious of course, with it unquestionable Kubrick style that can not be cloned or even reached in today's cinematic experience. It's movies like ""The Shining"" that proves what a daisy of beauty the art form of film, can be.Jack Torrance (Nicholson) with his wife Wendy (Shelly Duvall) and his psychic son Danny (retired: Danny Lloyd) are gonna spend the rest of the year util May in The Overlook Hotel, Jack Torrance has taken the job as the caretaker for the empty hotel, because of the frost biting snow storm that hits leaving any body inside stranded. Leaving Jack with a abundance of time to get through writers block, that seems to be caused by his family more the seclusion of the Hotel. Wendy cleans and cares for the hotel while Danny enjoys the spoils of a child, while he keeps getting weird premonitions from his psychic ability, the cook who also has some supernatural ability tells him in the beginning it is called the shining, it seems his shining is centered around room 237, which the cook, Dick tells him never to go inside. When Danny finally breaks the advice Dick gave him and walks through the threshold of room 237 he sets in motion unintentionally, an uninvited, gruesome set of events that leads agitated Jack Torrance on a roller coaster of inanity, or could it be the ghosts of Overlooks past dealing a contract to execute a gory unjust killing.I feel Kubrick exploited his cast in this- Jack Nicholson's talent to express raw emotion with his iconic acting and Shelly Duvall's beautifully weird looming presents equal of annoyance, to perfectly get the same felling her role is given to Torrance, of unintentionally annoying him to the point were we see through her acting in itself making us hate her as much. Keeps this horror/frightening presents in every frame like a stretched jumpscare. With the kids plain acting skill for him to dully and act frightful in a bowl of elixir of casting along with Stanley Kubrick question mark of direction and brushed screen of weirdly dark purple and red colors painted on the Overlook canvas of plain white. The output is something that baffles and amazes whoever watch's and always finding something with this film with every watch, pushing the unanswered question that looms in the form of horror what exactly is happening on screen in this simple plot that seems to become trivial compared to the unquestionably masterclass look of movie magic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Mesmerizing Horrific Power Makes For One of the Most Terrifying Films of All Time,"Stephen King didn't care for Stanley Kubrick's adaption of his novel ""The Shining"" at first, but appears to have warmed to it, particularly citing it as an important contribution to the horror film genre in his nonfiction book ""Danse Macabre"". There are perhaps a half-dozen horror films which terrify on one level and yet explore greater, deeper literary themes. Horror often forces the introspection concerning the nature of the inner and outer realities of human existence. William Friedkin's the Exorcist is one such example, which explores the issues of religious faith within the context of a priest determined to save a girl possessed by a demon. ""Interview with the Vampire"" is another, in which the ""monster"" is all too human, exhibiting all the emotions of their mortal counterparts rather than being deranged and mindless. And ""The Shining"" directed by Kubrick is another, which explores the vulnerability of the family unit, confronting forces far more powerful than itself, and whether that unit can survive.Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) is a writer with an alcohol problem hired to be a caretaker for the Overlook Hotel during its off-season months in the Midwest. Towards the end of the interview for the job, he learns that something evil had occurred many decades previously by one of the caretakers. Torrance resolves the same won't happen to him. He and his family move to the hotel with the purpose of taking care of the hotel allowing Jack to work on his writing projects. Jack, his wife Wendy Torrance (Shelley Duvall) and their son Danny Torrance (Danny Lloyd) travel to the Rocky Mountains where the hotel resides on the cusp of the winter months. When they arrive, the hotel is about to close for the winter and Torrance will maintain the hotel while it lays dormant. The manager offers them a brief tour before everything is closed down and the Torrance's are left with only one other employee and the large ominous building, which rings of hotels made 100 years ago in a by-gone era.From the get-go, the Overlook Hotel seems strange. After the regular employees and management have left for the winter, the hotel creaks and moans, as if stirring from a long sleep. One of the fascinating elements of the film is that the hotel itself is a character as interesting as the human characters. The only other employee who stays during the Winter is Dick Hallorann (Scatman Crothers). Hallorann befriends Danny and learns the boy has a secret: he is receptive to ESP, which the older man calls ""Shining"". The boy senses through his ability something is wrong with the hotel; it has an evil presence and energy. He begins to see horrific images throughout the hotel. In one of the most frightening images ever portrayed on film, Danny, while riding his big-wheels around the hotel encounters a ghostly apparition. And as the hotel's secrets begin to reveal themselves, so is the family forced to confront its omnipresence whose malevolence targets the Torrance's.This is one of the most astonishing and terrifying films ever made, and not for the feint of heart. White some other writers and filmmakers, like Clive Barker and Anne Rice, can certainly disturb through their works of Dark Fantasy, King's visions have the ability to terrify readers and film-goers almost like no other. When apparitions appear in a King work, they are not just spooky, they are blood-curdling monstrosities forcing all those they encounter to face death at its most horrid and gruesome. Kubrick's The Shining is perhaps the essence of King's horrific vision realized on the large screen.

Of course, luckily, those ghostly creatures can't find you if you're hiding within a blanket!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"

Shinning,"The Shining'' arouses feelings: after him, you will want to seek an ax and go around chopping off heads or get anxious, afraid that something happens like you. This time, believe the propaganda of the cover of the video. (Zombie) Just a curiosity: A week before The Shining open in theaters, Kubrick changed the end of the movie and took an entire sequence: After you see the pictures on the hotel wall, the scene would dissolve and would be taken to a hospital. Wendy is resting on a bed and Danny is playing in the waiting room. Stuart Ullman appears and tells her that the body of her husband was not found. When Ullman is leaving, he gives a ball to Danny - the same ball that mysteriously rolls down the aisle before the boy being attacked in room 237.

Another Kind of Horror,"1980, the new beginning of decades in cinema. And Kubrick brought the most memorable horror of all time. I think it's not a horror after all, it's an unclassified-genre, a Kubrick's very own genre. For me, it is not scary, maybe because the cultural gap between the western and eastern. The Asian-horror, usually frightening young woman appears as ghost, is my cultural-horror. I mean, you know ghost, in every culture is different. At the one hand, if you believe in ghost or those mythical things, this movie is worth to watch, it's from Stephen King's novel itself. In the other hand, if you don't believe, don't worry, Kubrick make another alternative to enjoy this movie. Watch it as a psychological-problem-movie, with suspenseful scene in it. So, two perspective in a movie, who could believe that, but Kubrick made it true. And about its difference from the novel, I don't know if you are a novel reader or what. But, I do appreciate King as the writer, he has good sense in writing mystery-novel. I haven't read the novel though, but King as writer, had done a great job. For Kubrick, you may say, he had torture the masterpiece of writing. So, King is right to defend his work of art. But Kubrick also had a fantastic sense of cinematography, that's why it's okay for him to change the story a little too far. Anyway, I adore both of them.""The Shining"", however, is pure entertainment in my opinion. It doesn't criticize the culture, society, beliefs, or anything else. A magical movie construction with little jumbled sequence and undefined evil spirit in it. It's okay for me, what audiences really seek is the intense-scene itself, not the comprehension of the symbol in movie. It gets wrong when the movie is bad and boring, but not for ""The Shining"" which is very genius in that very era. Kubrick doesn't add twist, just leaves the movie-mystery behind. To make the audiences keep wondering, and that's good. Nicholson did a really intimidating-acting, one of the best act from him that I've ever seen. The story itself, I mean the screenplay from the movie, is just so tremendous, though-provoking, and cold. I just can get enough claustrophobia from this film. And what's very touching is ""the shining"" itself, people that can shine, or has talent to communicate with spirits. The way the movie leads to point a very different way to understand such a weird-talent. You know, children, they are really plain and honest, just a tiny kick for showing new view.Nine out of ten, I rate this movie. With small-amount of moral value, I usually don't rate movie as high as this. But the cultural- impact of this movie is remained until now. Not just in America, but reaches my country also, Indonesia. ""All work and no play makes Jack adult boy"" comes in my English assignment.

Deep. Symbolic. A multi-layered Classic.,"I'm thankful for the liberties Kubrik took with the adaptation of King's novel. It made it less corny and deeper than the original story.

"""They'll Love It!""... ""Hello, Danny!""...","From the breathtaking opening sequence, which manages to make a VW Beetle ride seem ominous and adventurous, it's obvious that Director Stanley Kubrick's THE SHINING is something special.As with other Kubrick films, the camera sweeps and hovers, or presents static scenes in a way that is somehow dynamic. It is this that makes the Overlook hotel haunted, feeling as though spirits must certainly be soaked into every bit of this imposing structure.Kubrick fills the Overlook with dread, and Jack and Wendy Torrance (Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall) are the perfectly unsuspecting caretakers. Along with their son, Danny (Danny Lloyd), they settle in for what should be a long, relaxing winter with very little work to do.Of course, this is based on the classic Stephen King novel, so we know that a comfortable stay is out of the question! Jack's dark history, Wendy's nervous, willful ignorance of it, and Danny's ""gift"", combine within the isolation and vastness of the Overlook, resulting in madness and murder.Everyone remembers the hedge maze, the twins, the ""blood lobby"", Room 237, and Jack's final unraveling. After multiple viewings however, it's the quieter, sometimes silent moments that jump out. Kubrick's ability to make these moments so captivating is part of what separates him from other directors. He somehow fills the silence between the lines of dialogue while creating a thick atmosphere that binds the action sequences together.There's a depth that is rare, and very satisfying.Nicholson is his usual, force-of-nature self, gobbling up the Overlook's furniture in gloriously seething fashion. Ms. Duvall is a great Wendy, going from shell-shocked wife and mother, to desperate survivor. Young Mr. Lloyd is quite believable in his role, as is Scatman Crothers as Mr. Halloran.An all-around masterpiece of horror -as well as some of Kubrick's sly humor, this Halloween staple is must-see viewing for any time of the year...",,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"

Brilliant,"I am an avid fan of both Kubrick and Stephen King so perhaps I am a little bit biased in this review. But still, I simply cannot understand the critical slander that is often heaped on this film. It is nothing short of brilliance. Any even casual reader of King's novels understands the understated and claustrophobic terror that he conveys to your subconscious, the eerie images that creep into your mind when you wake up in the middle of the night and make it difficult for you to get back to sleep. ""The Shining"" is the only adaption of any of King's novels that I have seen that conveys these extremely unsettling images to the visual medium. Jack Nicholson gives one of the most hauntingly fascinating performances in film history in my opinion. The scene in which he slowly pursues Shelley Duvall up the stairs (""Gimme the bat, Wendy!"") is absolutely horrifying, yet impossible to look away from, because you know you are witnessing great acting at its pinnacle. There are those who call Nicholson's performance ""over the top"" and ""campy"", but I simply do not agree. This movie belongs to Jack Nicholson, and he absolutely owns every single second he appears on screen. With possible arguments made for ""Chinatown"" and ""About Schmidt"", this has got to be the finest performance of his amazing career. Shelley Duvall is perhaps a bit overmatched (imagine Meryl Streep or Cybill Shepherd in her role), but she gives a respectable performance and the makeup team does a frighteningly terrific job in making her look progressively weary and haggard as the film goes on. And young Danny Lloyd is terrific in a role that must have been extremely difficult for a child his age to understand. Overall, I believe ""The Shining"" is a standard by which all other horror films should be measured and is infinitely more frightening than the never-ending and schlocky slasher pictures that seem to dominate the mainstream nowadays.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"

My brief review of the film,"A great horror story from Stephen King is given the Kubrick treatment here, which results in sheer brilliance, only weighed down by a confused storyline. The story has not only been adapted but also it has been manipulated by Kubrick, giving the film an uneasy ambivalence, especially at the end. Other than the screenplay, the film rarely faults, and it is always intense and intriguing to watch, even when one does not understand. Technically, it is an ultimate horror experience, with a rather sterling production design and excellent cinematography. Great sound effects and an underplayed haunting music score are able to create an astonishing atmosphere that is perfect for the film. Also generally well acted and rather well directed, it is a shame that the screenplay lets a bravura horror film down, even if it is still excellent nonetheless.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Best Movie Ever!,"This is without a shadow of a doubt the finest film of all time, uniting my favourite actor with my favourite director. Probably Jack Nicholson's greatest performenses of all time.

More tragedy than thriller,"If you haven't seen it, don't bother.  I have no trouble understanding why Stephen King hated this movie so much he had it remade (though I haven't seen his version, so I don't know if he actually did a better job than Kubrick).Jack Nicholson does a fairly good job as Jack Torrance; although he seems incapable of acting normal when he's supposed to (mostly in the beginning), his character goes mad fairly early, and mad is Jack Nicholson's middle name.  The best scenes are definitely those that show Torrance's gradual descent into madness; they almost (but not quite) manage to save the movie.The rest of the cast varies from fair (Philip Stone as Delbert Grady) to passable (Danny Lloyd as Danny Torrance) to indifferent (the hotel staff, the firemen) to bad (Scatman Crothers as the stereotypical genial black cook with the most annoying laugh you've ever heard) to abysmal (Shelley Duval as Wendy Torrance): Lloyd is so-so, with on one hand his laughable conversations with his imaginary friend Tony, and on the other the excellent ""Redrum"" scene, which is slightly reminiscent of The Exorcist, while Duval - well, let's just say you'll spend most of the movie hoping she gets brutally murdered at the end.The plot is simple, predictable and uninspired, and is not without its fair share of holes, which is surprising (and disappointing) for a Kubrick movie. There is also a distressing number of continuity errors, though some of them can be explained if one assumes that more time passes between scenes than it seems - but either way, they're annoying.One of the movie's few saving graces is the photography - ranging from good to excellent - which manages to convey the strangeness and isolation of the Overlook Hotel very well, and help set the mood in those scenes that actually have mood (which excludes most of the scenes featuring Duval, Lloyd or Crothers).",4.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"

A film that relies on building suspense rather than cheap jump scares.,"My friend recommended this movie, so I rented it on Amazon Prime. I love scary movies, so I watched it at night with all the lights off. It's not exactly a ghost story, but it will really mess with your mind! The movie uses pictures and music to make things super creepy. This film is a masterclass in building tension, using long, lingering shots and an eerie soundscape to create a pervasive sense of unease. A hotel where this movie built itself becomes a character, its labyrinthine corridors and deserted rooms amplifying the feeling of claustrophobia and isolation. The masterful use of camera angles and Steadicam shots adds to the disorientation, making the viewer feel perpetually on edge.I don't want to give a bit of spoiler but I want to say the actors are all played a fantastic of their given role! Jack Nicholson plays a writer who goes crazy. His wife, played by Shelley Duvall, tries to help him. But the most amazing actor is that kid, Danny Lloyd. He plays Danny Torrance, who has special powers and can see scary things. Jack Nicholson delivers a mesmerizing portrayal, while Shelley Duvall and Danny Lloyd add layers of vulnerability and innocence. However, it's the film's atmosphere that truly steals the show. This movie is a slow burn, a film that relies on building suspense rather than cheap jump scares.This movie is really scary, but not because of violence. It's more about feeling scared and alone. It also makes you think about how people can go crazy. If you're looking for a film that will stay with you long after the credits roll, a film that will leave you questioning what you see and hear, then this is a must-watch. It's a testament to the power of atmosphere and sound design in creating a truly chilling cinematic experience. If you like scary movies or mysteries, then you must go for it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Absolute Masterpiece,"In all honesty when watching The Shining for the first time i was sat there thinking that it was a tad weird at the beginning.I was so right. The whole movie is undoubtedly one of a kind. Being a bit of a horror movie fanatic I have watched many horrors where they have since tried to recreate the story and atmosphere. I can recall several movies who have taken elements of this film and tried to rearrange it into their own production, but not once has it worked as well as it did in this one. I always knew this as 'that film where the guy says ""here's johnny""' but now I can see so much more than that.The cast fitted their roles so well, almost as if they were designed around the actors.It has a very on the edge of the seat, eerie atmosphere and you're never sure what's going to happen next (unless you've watched it as many times as I have). However it is still such a classy production with excellent location, not to mention how well the movie was scored.I will forever be utterly obsessed with this production, and definitely recommend it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Jack Torrence vs. The Overlook; Stanley Kubrick vs. Stephen King,"While I was watching The Shining I kept thinking why this movie is probably the most slammed Kubrick movie (maybe Eyes Wide Shut, but every Kubrick movie is disliked upon release then is regarded as a masterpiece down the road). I looked through the rest the rest of his movies and saw that all of his ""best"" movies had been atapted from novels. I read A Clockwork Orange and thought it was somewhat different from the novel, the book even had a different ending (and I've heard that Kubrick never read the ending when he decided to do it, but he heard about it during production, so...) It's because Anthony Burgess, Gus Hastvford, William Thackery, all the authors of the novels his films are based aren't names themselves. Kubrick always overshadowed them. In this case, Kubrick has to battle over a respected author over who was right. To me, King just wrote a horror story about a haunted house, though it was a little more than that, but, Kubrick made, sorry if it's cliche', a psychological story. It was his most metaphorical film (besides EWS maybe) and used over the top performances to enhance that idea. I don't think Kubrick films should be viewed in the same way as any other movies. He is definitely a latter day Freud.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"

Greatest Horror Movie of the Century,"The Shining is easily one of my all-time favorite horror films, mainly because it doesn't rely on cheap jump-scares or gore/violence; the antagonist never physically hurts the characters on screen, only providing the mere (and very real) threat of violence toward the end. The film also does well by avoiding typical cinematographic tools of the genre: dark lighting, close-up shots, and fast jump cuts, all of which would play on the viewer's fear of the unknown, claustrophobia and anxiety. However, The Shining manages to provide all of these unnerving sensations in scores, despite doing the exact opposite of the typical horror genre, by portraying the Overlook Hotel as brightly as possible, using wide angle shots throughout the film, and by using long, lingering shots of the environment of the Hotel. Director Stanley Kubrick did a marvelous job of putting the viewers at unease by showing the vast expanses of the Hotel in full lighting, assuring the audience that our protagonists are truly alone in the Hotel - until they are not. He also puts sharp, jarring noises (usually reserved for scenes where the killer is lurking in the dark, or when the monster moves past outside the window) throughout the Shining, even when nothing of significance is happening, further playing on the audience's anxiety and keeping them engaged thinking something could happen at any time - although mostly it doesn't, but it still worked in getting my palms perspiring. The Shining is unique in this sense, that it provides some of the most unnerving cinematic experiences in history, and leaves the viewer absolutely terrified and not able to answer why. For these reasons, The Shining gets a 9/10 from me.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
small details,"Poor treatment of King's characters aside, Kubrick's direction was brilliant. What he lost in characterization, he made up for with some of the best camera work and set pieces in horror history. Although Jack Torrance is portrayed as insane from the first scene of the movie version, Jack Nicholson makes the unhinged Jack Torrance work as few other actors could have. Nicholson's work is unsettling and unforgettable. I will even argue that Shelley Duvall did a marvelous job portraying Kubrick's vision of Wendy, even if Kubrick's characterization of Wendy is deeply flawed. Kubrick's pacing is strong, too. Although the descent into madness is evident from the opening scene, the tortuous pace which ensues induces feelings of claustrophobia in even the most seasoned horror aficionado.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"

My introduction to Stanley Kubrick,"I'll never forget this. Probably one of the most - if not THE most - terrifying classic horror films I've ever seen. (Plus, it was the very first movie I saw that was made by my soon-to-be favourite filmmaker of all time!). Like many people, I saw this film at a rather surprisingly young age. I was at a friend's sleepover (birthday?) party, and he - or someone in his family - had rented this movie called ""The Shining"", starring Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall, and directed by some guy I had never heard of, but whom apparently was a great director, with a great style. After hearing the creepy premise, I looked forward to this interesting journey with quiet anticipation...Words couldn't express my silent whirlwind reaction to the style and scope of this man's work. From the very first frame of opening credits, I was hooked (and scared to death, naturally; and it was just a freakin' shot of a car driving!)So many images, lines, and scenes from this film still resonate with me that I won't even bother going on forever about each one...but I will say that throughout this disturbing, beautifully-conceived nightmare, I was constantly trying to figure out how I was going to sleep that night! That's some powerful material! I must admit, however unfortunately, that I've never read Stephen King's novel upon which I found out this was based. I found out much later that he apparently HATED this version, but I nevertheless respected his opinion. After all, this movie wouldn't have been made if it weren't for him!A rich, timeless, and unforgettable masterpiece of cinematic horror that is surely among the best work of Kubrick's illustrious career.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"

Still one of the scariest films ever made...and a true masterpiece.,"Across all movie genres, I think it is pretty safe to say that a majority of people will consider horror to be the black sheep. And, to a certain extent, understandably so. Throughout the years, many filmmakers have seemingly had great difficulty in recalling a basic principle: horror as a genre is first and foremost a subgenre of fantasy. Whereas grotesque and bloody images instantly get the audience to react, fantasy is an immersive genre that, when properly delivered, engenders a momentary detachment from reality, thereby keeping the audience in captivity within an atmosphere in which the oddest stories may unfold. This is the gist of horror cinema, and the films that actually manage to provide this type of experience are a rarity.Stanley Kubrick, one of the most brilliant filmmakers of all time, has understood and mastered this fundamental principle, thereby delivering a film of unimaginable strength that is a master class in both fantasy and horror. ""The Shining"" is grandiose in every way. Combining a wide range of fantasy elements (ghosts, visions, madness, disappearances, apparitions, labyrinths, telepathy, etc.), Kubrick tactfully juggles with them all throughout a terrifying yet simple story, originally written by none other than Stephen King.The film takes place in the huge Overlook Hotel, which is located in a remote corner of the United States. Every winter, while the hotel is closed, a caretaker is hired to stay in the hotel for a couple of months. Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson), a writer, ends up signing the contract. Accompanied by his wife Wendy and son Danny, he believes he has finally found the perfect opportunity to be completely isolated from the outside world to better engage in his writing. However, as Jack and his son Danny are about to discover, within the walls of the Overlook Hotel lie obscure secrets of madness and murder.Each of Kubrick's shots is incredibly sturdy and beautiful. Kubrick was a perfectionist, as evidenced by the fact that he holds the record for the number of takes for the staircase scene in this film. Whether it is his use of steady cam, fixed or slightly moving shots, his masterful direction and use of symmetry is crucial to the terror conveyed by the film. The notion of shot/countershot in ""The Shining"" is used at the very best of its filmic utility. The pace is slow, which allows the horror to gradually settle in without the audience noticing. Matched with the ghostly music of Wendy Carlos, Rachel Elkind, Béla Bartók, György Ligeti and Krzysztof Penderecki, the terrifying atmosphere of the hotel will subtly invade your mind and emotions in a way only a very few films achieve to do so. Forget the jump scares, as ""The Shining"" is a truly visceral and sensory experience where anticipation takes on a whole different meaning via cinematic and musical prowess rather than via gruesome images and loud crescendos.The film stars Jack Nicholson, who is at the absolute top of his game. There's a reason why Nicholson's face bursting through a hole in the door screaming ""Here's Johnny!"" has become an iconic moment within mainstream culture: This is an iconic role, and a legendary character that nobody would even dare imagine being played by anybody else. Hats off to Danny Lloyd for undoubtedly one of the best performances by a child actor ever captured on film. This was not an easy role to pull off. Needless to say, the rest of the cast is just as superb. I understand those who thought Shelley Duvall looked and sounded hysterical (almost to a point where she becomes annoying), but this is exactly the point, as she is the only character inside the walls of the hotel that does not have the gift of ""the shining"". Among other memorable performances, there is that of Philip Stone, who plays Delbert Grady, the bone-chilling spectre of the former hotel caretaker, and that of Scatman Crothers, who is also excellent. Performances and direction of actors are absolutely splendid.Those who have read Stephen King's novel will notice significant differences with the film. Kubrick built his film from Jack's point of view rather than Danny's. Disgrace to the original? That seems to be King's opinion, as he apparently hated the movie adaptation. That being said, and no disrespect to King, I think both the paperback and the film have plenty to offer, and can be appreciated on their own.Like all Kubrick's novel adaptations, ""The Shining"" also pays tribute to cinema in many regards. Especially towards the end, there are multiple on-screen references to a wide variety of horror sub-genres, many of which, throughout the years, legions of die-hard fans have been trying to decipher. I know that it is all fun and games, but in my humble opinion, if you try to decrypt ""The Shining""'s ending and drag it into the realm of semantics, the whole point is missed. To me, this last bone-chilling shot is just Kubrick having fun, telling his audience that Jack's own memories, whether they be real or not, will forever be within the walls of the Overlook Hotel, and within the grasp of anybody who has the shining who'll ever step foot in that building (and just like that, I fell into the semantics trap myself). And regardless of what it actually means, I am having goosebumps as I am writing these lines and remembering that ending, so mission accomplished.This is a film that you can watch many, many times, and still be scared. I've watched it over a hundred times, and am still scared by it. Its ability to arouse emotions and drag you into an almost hypnotic state of mind makes it absolutely unique, engendering the kind of horror that inhabits you and grows on you, as opposed to horror films filled with jump scares, where you'll know when to cover your eyes/ears upon a second viewing.An astounding experience of image and sound combined, and an emblematic figure of fantastic/horror cinema. One of my all-time favorites without a doubt. Brilliant.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"

There are so many subtle things that this movie does especially with the sound that make it so much more terrifying.

"Awful adaptation of a terrific--and terrifying, let alone actually scary--book.","Stephen King felt pretty happy about the adaptations of his first two books, Carrie being mirrored perfectly by Sissy Spacek in De Palma's 1976 classic and 'salem's Lot being fairly okay on TV in Tobe Hooper's 1979 adaptation.  However, when Stanley Kubrick, one of the biggest and most famous directors ever, chose to adapt King's masterpiece of horror and great storytelling, Stephen King became cautious about who he chose to adapt and direct (not to mention how they are adapted and directed)--and with good reason.  Virtually the only things in common between the book and the movie are as such: character names and roles, the title itself, and locations.  All similarities end right there.  Though fans of Kubrick welcomed this so-called ""masterpiece"" into their already-huge cult of Kubrick movies, fans of the far larger Stephen King world--even after only 3 books at the time--were severely disappointed.  How could this movie be created?  The characters' attitudes are far different than in the book (Jack Nicholson is an average schmo to start and immediately becomes grouchy, then kookie; Shelly Duvall is an eccentric wife that acts as if she has suffered many years of abuse; not to mention Danny Lloyd's ridiculously ignorant and indifferent and jaded attitude that quickly turns to psychotic episodes).  Very bad acting goes into it all (virtually the only case of good acting that shows real characterization, however shallow, is Scatman Crothers as Dick Halloran), and the directing is terrible.  Over 12 obvious mistakes occur in this movie, including a clear shadow from the helicopter view of the Rocky Mountains at the beginning as well as a bending baseball bat used by Shelly Duvall on Jack Nicholson in one of many ridiculous conflicts and multiple parts of the door from the famous ""Here's Johnny!"" scene disappearing in several following scenes.  And to top it all off, Stanley Kubrick was so convinced that this...rubbish...was such a good movie that he had a contract made so that any re-makes of the movie could not be released on video in the US.  Luckily in 1997 a far more faithful adaptation was made, but unfortunately Mr. Kubrick's legacy of no-US-video had the movie appear only once on commercial television, never to be seen again unless it is on the video available overseas from Amazon.co.uk.  This was a terrible scratch in the long film reel of cinema history, and hopefully will be mended & forgotten soon enough.  All in all and simply put: this movie sucked. --MetalHorror",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"

Horror films often tend to divide audiences into genre fans who follow the gore and those who laugh in the face of so-called scares, insisting their own resiliancy to cheap thrills and lamebrain plotting.As a movie, The Shining is thoroughly watchable from start to finish. Jack Nicholson steals the show as the ex-alcoholic, ex-teacher who is looking for solitude for a 'writing project', and the Overlook Hotel appears to be just what he is looking for as he pitches in as caretaker during the snowbound winter months. Joining him at the Overlook are his wife Wendy (Duvall) and his talented son Danny (Lloyd), whose special ability to 'shine' causes him to fear (and rightly so) the dark secrets of the hotels past.Is Torrance simply going mad, or being influenced? What's driving him? Is it the ghosts of past events, or his own consciousness filling the void of isolation, or a bit of both? Despite the supernatural visitations you never quite know, and this is what makes this film so chilling and unbelievably bleak - Jack could simply be a victim of his own insane consciousness. Without ever resorting to extreme gore or shocks, Kubrick creates a vision of hell, a vision of the void that will sear itself onto your mind.Overall rating: 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
"Cold, chilling brilliance","It's been well documented that Stephen King wasn't very happy with Stanley Kubrick on account of how he adapted his novel The Shining to the screen. I myself haven't actually read the King book but I am a big admirer of the Kubrick film. But it does appear that this movie is one that divides opinion like few other horror films. While there are many like me who love it, there are equally many others who find it unscary and unengaging. Not only that but, somewhat bizarrely, it seems to have also attracted a lot of conspiracy theories surrounding supposed hidden messages and subtexts buried within the film. If you don't believe this, watch the recent documentary Room 237 which presents several of these, in my opinion, utterly stupid theories. Basically, there seems to be little middle ground when it comes to opinions on The Shining.I can only speak from the point-of-view of someone who thinks this is a bit of a masterpiece. Kubrick was a director who seemed to make films in different genres that still retained his very personal stamp. In this example I think he shows that the horror genre was pretty well suited to his sensibilities. The cold detachment his films are famous for works really well for this particular story. The setting is a remote isolated hotel in the middle of winter after all. His meticulous attention to detail is evident from the first beautiful soaring shot over a cold lake right until the final extreme zoom. Visually the movie is a tour de force. This was one of the first films to use the Steadicam, which allowed for very smooth mobile camera-work, most notably when we glide through the corridors of the hotel following the boy Danny on his trike. The horror genre also gives Kubrick ample opportunity to construct nightmare-like imagery such as the river of blood that flows out of the lift shaft. But it's the atmosphere that really makes it all work. There are several standout suspense scenes, like the famous axe moment and the ghostly little girls but also others such as the very disturbing encounter in Room 237. Then there is the hotel bar that Jack Torrance visits in moments of despair, replete with swinging 1920's guests. From here we have one of the standout sinister parts of the whole movie, where Torrance has a conversation with the ex-caretaker (and very dead) Grady in the toilet. The conversation is cold and disturbing and sets the wheels in motion for the final horror. Sometimes, though it's the very simple, subtle ideas that generate the biggest chills, such as when Wendy discovers just exactly what it is that her husband has been spending his whole time writing since arrival.The cast is small but excellent. Jack Nicholson is admittedly very over-the-top but he is pretty convincingly intense, Shelley Duvall is very good in a tough role, young Danny Lloyd is one of the rare breed of child actors who can actually act and Scatman Crothers, who plays the cook who recognises Danny's shining ability, is always a welcome presence in any film. But really, the real standout character of this film is the Overlook Hotel itself. Everything happens under its bright lights, there is no typical horror darkness here but this only adds to the terror if anything. It's a place that seems to hold a secret and its vast empty expanses become somewhat sinister once the guests and workers have finally left. Wendy Carlos unusual score accentuates this by punctuating certain moments with tones that imply impending dread. On the whole, The Shining is a movie that doesn't really have any faults for me. It's an immaculately constructed horror movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
"A classic, but a bit overrated","As classic as this movie is, I feel like it is a bit too hyped up by the horror community. This movie was definitely something. Like it wasn't bad, the acting is amazing, but I have to admit, it's way too long. I was rolling my eyes through some scenes, just waiting for them to end. I don't even have much words to say cuz I literally just watched it cuz it's a classic. There are definitely better classics out there like The Exorcist or American Psycho. I'm not saying it's bad, there definitely parts that I enjoyed but I don't know, overall, it didn't really leave a mark on me. I didnt really care.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Kubrick's Mark on the Horror Genre,"The Shining is often considered as the greatest horror film of all time and I completely agree with the notion. Kubrick's perfectionism and attention to detail regarding every minute aspect of the filmmaking process really shines through in the final product and this is one of the many reasons why I am completely enthralled by his contribution to the genre of horror.Not only this but The Shining is also one of the few horror films wherein the audience is able to perceive other small, yet significant, details upon a second viewing which they may have failed to notice or glossed over during their first experience-the mark of a true masterpiece in film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
A Haunting Masterpiece,"""The Shining,"" directed by the legendary Stanley Kubrick, is a cinematic tour de force that continues to captivate audiences decades after its initial release. Released in 1980, this horror classic is a brilliant adaptation of Stephen King's novel, showcasing Kubrick's unparalleled mastery of suspense, atmosphere, and storytelling.The film revolves around the Torrance family, played exceptionally well by Jack Nicholson, Shelley Duvall, and Danny Lloyd. Jack Torrance, a struggling writer, accepts a position as the off-season caretaker at the isolated Overlook Hotel, accompanied by his wife Wendy and their psychic son Danny. As the family becomes increasingly isolated by harsh winter weather and sinister forces, the hotel's malevolent history begins to unravel.One of the most remarkable aspects of ""The Shining"" is Stanley Kubrick's deft direction and his meticulous attention to detail. From the iconic Steadicam tracking shots to the eerie set design, each frame is crafted with precision, building an unsettling atmosphere that lingers throughout the film. The hotel's vast, empty corridors and chillingly deserted rooms contribute to a sense of impending doom, leaving audiences on the edge of their seats.Jack Nicholson's portrayal of Jack Torrance is nothing short of iconic. He delivers an unforgettable performance, conveying a descent into madness with chilling intensity. His facial expressions and maniacal laughter are etched into cinematic history, making him one of the most memorable and terrifying antagonists in horror film history.Shelley Duvall's portrayal of Wendy Torrance has been the subject of much debate over the years. While some criticize her performance as too distressed and vulnerable, others argue that it adds to the overall sense of horror and helplessness. Regardless, she successfully portrays the fear and desperation of a mother trying to protect her son from a horrifying fate.Young Danny Lloyd is exceptional in his role as Danny Torrance, showcasing an innocence and maturity beyond his years. His psychic abilities, represented by the unsettling ""shining,"" form a crucial element in the plot, intensifying the film's supernatural themes.Moreover, the film's haunting musical score, composed by Wendy Carlos and Rachel Elkind, contributes significantly to its eerie atmosphere. The spine-chilling sound design, featuring the repetitive and unnerving ""Dies Irae"" motif, further elevates the sense of dread and unease throughout the film.Despite some differences from Stephen King's novel, Kubrick's adaptation offers a more enigmatic and ambiguous narrative, allowing for multiple interpretations. This artistic choice has sparked numerous discussions and theories among viewers, giving ""The Shining"" a timeless quality that remains relevant in contemporary film analysis.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
"A stunning example of atmosphere, horror, and filmmaking","Some films are able to create a world separate from ours, create a place that has its very own feel, it can be wonderful, awe-inspiring, adventurous, etc. Studio Ghibli are masters of this, as nearly all there films (even the ones grounded in reality) feel fresh and they always make you want to enter there special place, except for maybe Grave of the Fireflies. Stanley Kubrick's The Shining is one of those very special films, but while Studio Ghibli's films were magical and fun, The Shining is terrifying and disturbing.Stanley Kubrick is one of the greatest directors of all time, he was a perfectionist in every sense of the word. In one scene a tennis ball is rolled down a hall, Stanley Kubrick shot this scene over fifty times, and The Shining also holds the record for the most times a single shot in a film has been re-shot. (but some of the crew members say the number was exaggerated) Stanley Kubrick was also vicious on his actors, even sometimes mistreating them to get the performance he wanted.The Shining is an adaptation of a Stephen King novel, and is about Jack Torrance a struggling writer, who is also a recovering alcoholic, who is hired as a winter caretaker of the summer hotel ""The Overlook"" in Colorado. (the manger says its to difficult to keep the hotel open with the heavy snow fall in the winter.) So Jack Torrance spends the winter alone with his family in The Overlook, but as can be expected of all horror movies, strange things begin to happen, and Jack Torrance slowly loses his mind. Jack Nicholson plays Jack Torrance, and many contemporary audiences have criticized Kubrick for this choice, saying that Jack Nicolson was a bad choice for the role, because he always plays crazy people so the transformation of his character would be non existent, this criticism is incredibly out of context. When The Shining was released Jack Nicholson would have been known for playing ""free spirit"" characters, like in One Flew Over The Cuckoos nest, or Easy Riders, sure nowadays he is known for psychopathic roles, but he wasn't known for them back in 1980.Another thing these critics seem to forget is that there isn't even the slightest hint of Jack losing his mind until 40 minutes into the film, and by that point we have already been exposed to several other horrors, that audiences that haven't ever been exposed to anything about the film wouldn't even expect him to go crazy, but there will never probably be an audience who hasn't been exposed to film in some sort of way, so many of the films scariest and most unnerving scenes, have been referenced and parodied so many times, that it causes them to lose their impact. This is probably The Shining's biggest flaw, and it's not even the films fault. I will not mention any of theses scenes here, so if you haven't seen the film yet, don't look up anything more about the it and watch it as soon as possible.But enough about how other people have ruined the film, let's talk about what makes it so great. I've already talked about Jack Nicholson's performance, but all of the performances in the film are prefect for the characters, Danny Lloyd deserves a special mention, because he was only 6 at the time and was under the impression that he was shooting a drama, not a horror film. You'd never be able to tell if you watched it. The soundtrack is also one of the best in any horror film ever, from the very first shot of the opening credits we are completely immersed in it, it's slow, creeping, subtle, and can match things like the Halloween score or the Vertigo score. The cinematography (done by John Alcott, who did many of Kubrick's other films) is also some of the best that you will ever find in a horror movie.The Shining is also often criticized today for being boring, much in the same way Alien is, and just like Alien these criticisms are completely unwarranted and make no sense. Some may have expected The Shining to jump right into the action, but it takes its time and slowly buries us in the vicious, creepy atmosphere of The Overlook Hotel, and there are several eerie scenes at the very beginning. So I don't really understand why people would think The Shining is ""boring.""One final thing, if you're an avid Stephen King fan, you will probably be disappointed, as Stanley Kubrick takes several ""artistic liberties,"" while adapting Stephen Kings work. But please look at the film on its own, because it really is one of the greatest films ever made.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
An excellent movie,"The score that I gave to this film says it all. EXCELLENT! I wouldn't change a single thing about this movie. First things first; the direction that the genius Stanley Kubirk made was outstanding. He was looking for perfection an got very close to it. Then the performances that the actors made. Personally I think that Jack Nicholson's performance is one of the best I have ever seen. Now is not a secret how much Shelly Duvall suffered on set, but at the end the result makes it seem as if it all was really worth it. Along with the performances there was a little improvisation, phrases that have been quote till today and for eternity, those improvisations and their performances combined with the script and the direction is the result of an amazing piece if art. The production did a wonderful job. The film editing seems so simple, that for me that makes it look excellent, again, one of the best I have ever seen. All the psycho part was incredible. Every scene of this movie is legendary. Is an excellent movie, that everyone should watch, off course if he or she have the guts to watch it. If you like suspense, horror, thriller, and psychological themed movies, this one is for you!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
"like it or not, this is a classic","I believe the people that really hated this movie are the same people that require their horror movies to be chock-full of blood, gore and slimy aliens. The Shining accomplishes its purpose not with blood and guts, but with an unbearable build-up of suspense, first-rate (if a bit over-the-top) acting by Nicholson, and eerie camera angles. Kubrick is a modern genius. As in his other masterpieces, 2001: A Space Odyssey, A Clockwork Orange, and even the underrated Full Metal Jacket, there is a sort of white, shadowless, ""frozen"" quality present in many of the scenes, and that eerie, ""upward-angle"" lighting of Nicholson's face during certain pivotal moments that is truly unnerving and nightmarish. The movie is similar to a nightmare in other respects as well: chilling music by Bartok, a desperate sense of isolation, bizarre room angles/lighting, and events that don't seem to make sense logically (such as the elevator pouring blood and the spooky diorama/maze scene early in the picture). For me, the most truly terrifying scene occurred around the middle of the film, when Wendy (Shelley Duvall) is leaning over Jack's typewriter, snooping at what he has been ""writing."" Without mentioning anyhing else, suffice it to say that it is at this moment that we realize that Jack has descended completely into madness, and from this point on, the movie's mood shifts from uneasiness to sheer terror.There is something far more frightening about one's loved ones  losing any semblance of sanity (although truth be told, Nicholson seems slightly insane even in the beginning of this movie) than any amount of blood, guts and slimy monsters so prevalent in most horror movies today. The sense of isolation here only underscores the terror. This movie terrified me so much I had trouble sleeping for weeks. While it's true that it does not follow King's book precisely, I forgive it that for it is so well-crafted in its own right (also, I read the book *after* seeing the movie).  Truly a masterpiece of horror.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Read the book you scums,"Don't get me wrong The Shining is a great film which is why I give it an 8. HOWEVER I have heard that Stephen King disagrees with Stanley Kubrick's version of the Shining. I am on Stephen Kings side. The book version is so much better! By the way I'm not one of those scums that thinks 'ALL BOOKS ARE BETTER THAN MOVIES' - but the book is better.The book has far better character development than the movie. The book builds up all three characters personality's and also their family's. However the movie portrays Jack instantly right from the start being a 'BAD' character. He is creepy and evil right from the start which makes no sense. He is actually a nice person, it's the hotel that makes him evil.The movie also has scenes that only make sense in the book for example all those scenes where Jack is at the bar talking to his imaginary bar tender, not once does the movie mention that Jack is a recovering alcoholic.You know I could go on and on about things that the movie didn't have that should have been in there.

Over-rated,"I've never understood the incredible love for The Shining, and its regular ranking as the greatest horror film of all time.It's a decent horror film, no doubt, but I don't rate it anywhere near the best. In fact I find both the sequel Doctor Sleep, and the Shining sequence in Ready Player One considerably more engaging than the actual original film.For the uninitiated, the story involves a writer with writers-block who packs his wife and son and takes on the job of winter caretaker at a large vacant hotel high up in the mountains, in the hope that the quiet will help him get out of his rut.The isolation plus some evil forces inhabiting the hotel slowly drive him nuts.The story location is terrific, but I dislike the cast and performances (even Jack Nicholson), and I think that the whole thing could have been done in a much better and creepier manner.I also think that the film looks very dated, in a horrible 70's way.Perhaps my perception of it is affected by having first seen it many years after it was initially released, but to be fair I am not rating it against subsequent films, but against films made either prior to or around the same time.In my opinion its a good story, that could have been executed better.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"

The best madness,"A family stay in a hotel, which is located in the depth of a mountain, as the caretaker for the winter. The father is a writer and tries to finish his work during the stay. The son has something special gift which is called shining; he perceives spiritual things. They enjoy the stay at first, but gradually the father goes mad. It's related to the miserable murder happened at the hotel before. I'm sure that no one could act the madness except for Jack Nicholson. Just small his behavior makes us scared. This is the deferent point from other horror movies in America. Kubrick creates the best madness without monsters and zombies. Also I guess this film has similar but different atmosphere from J horror films. We can see both of them show human's or ghost's curse, but in this film something beyond the curse is described and Jack Nicholson creates that point. We see the madness, but does it come from only the apparition of the hotel? Is there no relation to his loneliness or pain?",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"

Brilliant & Terrifying Film.,"Stanley Kubrick directed this (loose) adaptation of Stephen King's superb novel, about married couple Jack & Wendy Torrance(Jack Nicholson & Shelley Duvall) and their young son Danny who go to an isolated Colorado hotel as caretakers for the winter, when the hotel is forced to close. They are met by the head chef Dick Halloran(Scatman Crothers) who recognizes in Danny what he knows about himself: that they have powerful psychic abilities called ""Shining"" that alerts them to ghostly presences. Unfortunately for them, the hotel, called the Overlook, is indeed haunted with evil and violent ghosts that are determined to destroy them, and then add their spirits to those already there...Genuinely terrifying film is supremely well crafted and directed by Stanley Kubrick, made more frightening by the sinister banshee wailing music score that really gets under the viewer's hide. Fine performances by all, claustrophobic atmosphere and horrifying imagery in this top-class adaptation; though writer Stephen King disliked the changes made to his novel(author's privilege) this film is nonetheless among the top horror pictures ever made. Once seen, not easily forgotten...",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
The darker side of human nature,"This film, like most of Kubrick's works is a lot more complex than it appears to be at first glance. In ""The Shining"" Kubrick seems to be cultivating the theme of the darker side of human nature which runs throughout so many of his films and while watching this film I get the impression that Jack Nicholson is playing  not someone who is possessed but someone who's darker side has been cultivated by the influence of evil in the hotel. The hotel itself seems to be playing a very important role in the film as is reflected with the superb cinematography, most of the shots being of a wide angle nature to show the hotel as an integral part to the story. Finally it is important to note that at the end of the film Nicholson dies away from the hotel, away from  his point of strength strength and influence.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Good but overrated - even after the third watch,"I saw this movie as a teenager, thought it was mostly boring except for some unforgettable scenes, the terrifying music, and the memorable acting. I gave it another chance in my 20s, and felt the same way but understood its nuance better.I just watched it again, over a decade later, and still basically feel the same way, though I understand the psychological horror and relationship drama a lot better, but I still ultimately think it's a overly-long, melodramatic chore to get through.I'm not really a Stephen King fan, so maybe that has something to do with it, but I really think the underlying issues are the lacking writing and the drawn-out pacing. The camera work and sets are beautiful, and surreal visions the family has have stamped themselves in my head since I was young.Jack Nicholson makes the movie better than it deserves, and portrays one of the best horror monsters I've ever seen. Shelley Duvall's portrayal of a terrified wife at her wit's end is iconic. Scatman Crother's personality shines through as sympathetic and strong where the story needs it, and his character provides the moving crux for the title.My main issues really are that there isn't enough build up of Jack's growing madness, and not enough scenes showing (not just telling us of) the strife between him and Wendy. There's some dialog that implies strife, and Jack seems annoyed most of the time at his wife, but fleshing this out in scenes of them doing things together that would have demonstrated this strife better would have really helped the pacing, and made better transitions between Jack's sudden shifts in anger and sanity. It feels more like ""OK now Jack's way more unreasonably angry and crazy because we've gotta move the horror elements along"" instead of the creeping sense of believable dread that Kubrick could have woven a thread through using scenes of normal life showing why the couple grinds against each other, instead of mostly just randomly telling us in little bits.I know Kubrick is heralded as legendary, but I think he missed the boat on this. I might blame the writers, and I haven't read the book (apparently it shifted far from King's novel), but directors contribute to scripts and lines, and determine how scenes play out and what gets left on the cutting room floor. I'm sure some time spent having a camera move along hallways could have been shifted to some time showing Jack and Wendy's clashes to make Jack's behavior look less contrived (I realize he's being influence by an outside force, but it still often looks too forced). As much as I love Kubrick's camera work and set designs... I go against the grain, and I think he's mostly overrated as a director. I liked 2001 as a kid when I saw it, but it suffered from the same problem; way too much long drawn-out camera work, not enough dialog between characters showing why they are how they are, and jarring jumps between plot points and character behavior I get that he likes things stark, but he just goes overboard.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"

Seriously Dramatic and Twisted,The Shining is not a typical hack-them-up slasher film nor it is a simply a ghost/haunted place movie - it is a combination of both in a roundabout way.

Jack Nicholson plays Jack Torrance so well that you almost believe that he is that psycho in real life - he's so convincing in this movie! Shelly Duvall was outstanding - I felt like she captured the emotions and torment of Wendy perfectly.The movie has spawned satires and jokes since it first grazed the silver screen in 1980 due to it's popularity.

"A Taut, Terrific Thriller","So many ""legendary"" movies come prefaced with such hype that they often fall short when you finally see them. The Shining is not one of those movies. It's an excellent horror film that withstands the test of time, likely because it doesn't rely on gimmickry or special effects. Instead, it's all about creating psychological intensity. The acting is excellent, the plot builds, and the tension keeps increasing until the climax. This movie may include the most haunting carpet patterning and wallpaper of all time. The production team kicked it into overdrive to create sets that you won't forget. My only gripe with the movie is that I found the soundtrack a tad over the top.

lack of coherency,"This is one of those typical movies that divides its viewers in two camps: those who loved Stephen King's source novel and disliked the movie for bearing too little relation with it, and those who love Kubrick films and called the film his umpteenth masterpiece. As a occasional admirer of both artists, I agree with Kubrick's fans when they say that a filmmaker should be able to use a novel as a start off point - sounds to me like one of the fun things of filmmaking: taking an existing story and do your own take on it. I also agree with the film's advocates when they mention the visual beauty (direction; sets; photography) as one of its strengths. However, it's the visual beauty that underlines the inner emptiness of the film.The problem lies mainly within the film's screenplay: 1. I totally agree that for some movies a script is nothing more than a blueprint (like ""Evil Dead"", which has a cliche ""story"", but can totally rely on Sam Raimi's direction and Tim Philo's haunting photography), but when the phrase ""psychological"" comes to pass and the film evolves around only three main characters, I expect fleshed out characters and increasing psychological suspense, but we don't get any of that. The characters are astonishingly one-dimensional people who don't seem to have a past. 2. Nicholson is nuts to begin with and spends the remainder of the movie, at turns, being nuts-""normal""-nuts-""normal""-nuts. 3. There's no real (psychological) build up to the final, which just arrives after a rather meandering middle section consisting of incoherent sequences which without any problem could swap places. 4. There's almost no dialogue between the three characters (the first time I saw it, I kept waiting for an uncomfortable scene with Jack, Danny and Wendy around the dinner table - which would have been an ideal setting to return four or five times in the film to underline the falling apart of the family). 5. Nicholson plays mostly for laughs, thereby putting even more emphasis on the exterior and, alas, thereby also emphasizing the inner shallowness. 6. The all too obvious symbolism (like Nicholson dying in a labyrinth which is both physical AND metaphorical) 6. Kubrick's gives the obviously very tired Shelley Duvall ways too many close ups (especially in the final) thereby painfully emphasizing her rather mediocre acting. I had the chance to see it in the theatre about a year ago and people weren't afraid --and they were laughing at some of the meant to be eerie scenes, especially Nicholson's encounter with the naked lady that turns into a witch. King's TV-remake of the film may be a bit unnecessary (like one of his characters says in his novel ""It"": ""Your book is in the shops and nobody can change a word in it"") but psychologically and (too) emotionally, it's stronger than Kubrick's film. Nevertheless, I still give Kubrick's film 3 stars out of four, because he was a master filmmaker, a personal favorite whose lesser films are still ten times better than other directors best works. I have seen it five times now and everytime I thoroughly enjoy its direction, photography, and rich atmosphere. Try to track down Vivian kubrick's 'making of', too, because it's an enjoyable companion piece.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Kubrick's Unsettling Masterpiece of Pure Horror,"Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining"" remains a timeless masterpiece that delves into the depths of horror, creating an atmosphere of unease and terror that lingers long after the credits roll. With its deliberate ambiguity and chilling portrayal of insanity, the film establishes an ominous mood that seeps into every frame. Kubrick's directorial prowess, combined with Jack Nicholson's unforgettable performance, delivers a profoundly unsettling experience that leaves the audience questioning their own interpretations of the story.Kubrick's approach to ""The Shining"" defies conventional storytelling, favoring the creation of unease and terror over explicit explanations. The story is intentionally loose, leaving ample room for interpretation. This deliberate ambiguity becomes the film's greatest strength, allowing viewers to immerse themselves in its nightmarish world. By eschewing a connection with the audience, Kubrick creates an unsettling detachment that intensifies the horror, leaving viewers captivated and disturbed in equal measure.At the heart of ""The Shining"" lies Jack Nicholson's mesmerizing portrayal of Jack Torrance's descent into madness. Nicholson's performance is nothing short of haunting, capturing the gradual erosion of sanity with unnerving precision. His portrayal of insanity is a tour de force, blending charisma and unpredictability to create a character that is simultaneously captivating and deeply unsettling. Nicholson's iconic line delivery and chilling expressions become etched into the viewer's memory, cementing his performance as one of the most memorable in cinematic history.As the film progresses, Kubrick masterfully builds tension, culminating in a third act filled with terrifying thrills. The director skillfully cuts between various disturbing images, creating moments of genuine terror that are etched into the viewer's psyche. Each shot is meticulously composed, heightening the sense of unease and leaving the audience on the edge of their seats. From the haunting imagery of the Grady twins to the infamous ""Here's Johnny!"" scene, ""The Shining"" delivers an unsettling array of visuals that linger long after the film concludes.The Overlook Hotel serves as a character in its own right, exuding a palpable malevolence that permeates the film. Kubrick's meticulous attention to detail in capturing the hotel's architecture and decor amplifies the sense of dread and isolation. Every corner of the Overlook Hotel drips with an eerie atmosphere, further accentuated by the masterful use of lighting and cinematography. Combined with a score that heightens the horror, the film creates an inescapable feeling of impending doom that resonates with viewers long after the credits roll.""The Shining"" stands as a masterpiece of pure horror, with Stanley Kubrick's visionary direction and Jack Nicholson's unforgettable performance creating an indelible cinematic experience. By prioritizing unease and terror over a straightforward narrative, Kubrick crafts a film that is open to interpretation and deeply unsettling. From its chilling atmosphere to its spine-tingling moments of terror, ""The Shining"" continues to captivate audiences and solidify its place as a defining work in the horror genre. Prepare to be gripped by a sense of dread that will stay with you long after the lights come up.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
By far the best horror movie ever made,"This is the only Kubrick film I have ever seen and after seeing this I am thirsty for more of his work. The movie had me glued to the screen the whole time and the ending shook me to my core. I am amazed at how well Kubrick translated the King's novel onto the big screen. This is by far my favourite horror movie, and is in my top 5 favourite movies of all time. This is a beautifully haunting experience and after I saw it I had an hard time readjusting to real life. This movie is stuck somewhere deep inside my scull, and is living there rent free. The haunting score also added a tremendous amount of scariness. And I cannot even start talking about how excellent Jack Nicholson acting in this isIn conclusion, I recommend this to anyone who can handle the scariest that horror has to offer.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
The Shining and Salem's Lot,"Yes the shining is definitely a classic and I agree with whoever said that many of King's novels get butchered when made into movies...Sleepwalkers is a prime example. Wish I could see ""It"" but my fear of clowns keeps this movie far from my view. I love stephen king and his books are just riveting but his movies fall largely under his standards. Another good king movie though is Salem's lot...not to be mistaken with salem's lot 2 which is crap! Salem's lot follows vampire rules and gives you an eerie feeling as the movie progresses, Salems 2 depicts vampires leaping from cornfields and attacking passing children which is not true of what we know of vampires. Very disappointed with the second one but definitely see the first one. Watch for the master. He's the best part The shining is extremely well done and my favorite part is danny riding the bike on the rug and then on the floor. Good directing on Kubrick's part!

The Shining (1980),"I've loved movies, and horror movies, and Kubrick movies all my life. I saw this for the first time over 35 years ago. I liked it then but somehow it left me bewildered and unsatisfied. After all, Kubrick should have made the 'perfect' horror film, right? But, he didn't. Or did he? Ah, too many things must have gone over my head as a teenager way back when. 'The Shining' watched again 35 years later is definitely a chilling experience (even the soundtrack is terrifying in headphones). 'Chilling' not least because now I'm down with what movie analysts call Kubrick's 'hidden socio-concerns', and the implications as to what The Shining could 'really' be about are what make it truly horrific.As a curious 46-year-old film buff, the more I learn about and examine, not just this movie but, Kubrick's other works, the more I begin to notice and decipher mysterious symbols, obscure metaphor, partially hidden social and political criticisms, story-telling on different levels - the cryptic and esoteric messages sent out by Kubrick to be decoded by his audience. Always thought he was a genius, but after watching The Shining again I now believe he was a bona fide subversive who had discovered far too much about the darker side of life during his time as a privileged A-list artist (watch 'Eyes Wide Shut' if you're not convinced). No wonder he shunned Hollywood for a life of privacy and isolation. Finally, it's not just the obvious genre tropes and clichés that make 'The Shining' terrifying; it's all the other stuff as well.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Too much work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.,"Absolutely brilliant! How many times have I seen it now? Its so impressive. Kubrick goes far here with horror as 2001 he does for Sci-Fi if you ask me. I can't imagine any playing this role as well as Jack Nickolson, the part seemed to have been specially designed with him in mind all along. The guy is just as mad in between takes here. Even Shelly Duvall and the kid are great here. I love the lack of clichés and the fact that this is sheer horror, not being stalked by a guy in a mask. I like how the only possible hero almost like a Saint makes it all the way to the hotel travelling long and hard when he is supposed to be on holiday, but he is concerned like a saint, we take it for granted that his efforts will be fruitful but NOOO! I also love the ghostly scenes with Nickolson at the ballroom, absolutely bizarre and the conversations with the ghosts are really far out. i can go on for ever about this kind of film, Its all good.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
A horror classic.,"This is an indispensable horror classic, which tells of how a former teacher moves with his wife and son to an isolated luxury hotel to work as a caretaker in the months that its closed. What he couldn't know is that the place, where there were already dozens of deaths, is apparently a hot-spot of evil, that only his son can perceive. Its based on a novel by Stephen King, which I unfortunately haven't yet had the pleasure of reading, and is my favorite film of Stanley Kubrick's work. Although it contains extremely violent scenes of carnage and nudity, its relatively contained in comparison to other films I've already seen. From the very beginning, it creates a very pleasant suspense around John Torrence and his family, without ever specifying two things: the nature of John's son's gift and the nature of the evil that inhabits the hotel. Two things that it purposely leaves open, perhaps to increase the impact of the end. Jack Nicholson played the lead character and I think its fair to recognize that it was the most challenging and iconic role of his career. He was fantastic, and his body and facial expression helped immensely to make him more real. The same thing can be said of Shelley Duvall, who was incredible as Mrs. Torrence, harmonizing well feelings of disbelief, fear, powerlessness and urgency to act and protect herself and her child. The film has good special and visual effects, as well as an excellent and credible set. For the last, a final note to warn that it is a movie unsuitable for faint-hearted.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Great movie,"I love this movie, Stephen King is an amazing writer and this movie brings his work to justice. It is a classic for its time. I love Jack Nicholson his acting in this movie was very believable a can see how something like that can happen to someone in those situations. There is a painting in the movie that is actually in our home, it is the picture in the Torrences room at the hotel of two little girls warming themselves in front of the fireplace after a bath. Shelley Duval was very convincing her acting was amazing and really brought chills to me and really felt her fear, as though I was in the hotel with her. I wonder how I would of acted if I was in her situation. I have read the book and the movie pretty much stayed true to the book.

The Greatest Movie of all time,"When I first saw the shining was a few years ago and not in 1980 because I was born in 2003. The first time I saw the movie I was very confused and terrified. I remember that while I was watching the movie I kept pausing when I saw horror moments because I thought that my heart would stop if I kept watching. The most exciting thing is not the first time that I saw the movie but the 2nd, 3rd, 4rd e.t. Because of the lack of spoilers I was constantly terrified in the entire first movie and I couldn't understand the details. But the more I was watching that movie the the better I was traveling inside the movie.

"A True Horror Classic, A Definitive Staple of the Genre","Horror is a very strange and interesting genre. Most horror films never work. About 90% of horror films are terrible in an artistic sense, even in an entertainment sense, but still, there is that 10% that really make a difference. ""The Shining"" is one of those. It's one of those household film names everyone has at least heard of.This Stanley Kubrick classic is a great example of Kubrick's directorial power. Like all of his films, there are subtle hints that are clues to the point and direction of the film. There is an interesting documentary about these things called ""Room 237"" I strongly recommend checking out after watching the film for references to what I'm talking about (though may of this may just be coincidence)The screenplay, of course, was great. Stephen King is a hard author to translate into film, most films based off of King's books are terrible, but Kubrick had a vision enough to make it one. King has an excellent story writer.There is a lot to say about this film, the acting, the music, the atmosphere especially.

A 10 out of 10 Horror film.,Kubrick cemented his legacy here and proved that he can take on just about any genre and make one of the best films of that genre. Jack Nicholson in an excellent performance takes on a job as a caretaker for an isolated hotel during the harsh winter when it is closed. He slowly goes insane and is haunted by the past horrors of the hotel. The score featuring Wendy Carlos is one of the eeriest in film history and is the backbone to the film.,10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Favorite Horror/Psychological Thriller Ever Made.,"The Shining is absolutely a must watch for anyone who considers themselves as a movie lover, or simply anyone who wants to watch a movie that will leave them unsettled and jolted. From the very beginning of the movie, there is a tension felt that is rather hard to describe. The viewer knows that there is a maleficent presence at the cabin as soon as they spend a few minutes there, yet it is very difficult to describe what will happen to the family as they spend their time there or exactly what is so unsettling about the house. The movie is the culmination of the brilliant writing of King, the detail- oriented directing of Kubrick, and the convincing performance of Nicholson, and it is exactly as satisfying as one would think it would be. The rising level of uneasiness is hard to ignore as the film progresses, and the way the movie is filmed and the scenes are set will unease the viewer time and time again. Despite the psychologically disturbing nature of the film, it is very easy to watch and quite entertaining. This is my favorite horror movie because the acting and the plot are absolutely quality. It does not rely on quick jump scares or commonly done tricks, but rather a deeply thought out enemy that is complex enough to demand multiple viewings.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
"Overrated ""horror"" film","I have not read Stephen Kings The Shining novel so I can't compare the two. But i will say this, the acting left much to be desired. I wanted to watch the shining because it was one of the cult classics that I hadn't gotten around to watching yet. People raved about this movie saying it was one of the scariest movies of all time. If you ask me this movie was more creepy than it was scary. Jack Nicholson is of course extremely skilled at playing the wacky insane parts bc that's just who he is. So no surprise that he played the part well.Wendy was by far the worst character in this movie. She was like a mouse, so weak and desensitized to the abuse. The entire first half of this movie was so slow moving and quite frankly, pretty boring. It could've been condensed into a 90 minute movie instead of dragging on for the first half and then finally theres some action. Overall it was not terrible especially for the fact that it is 40+ years old. If you're just a casual horror fan this is something you may enjoy more. To an avid horror lover like myself, this movie fell short in many areas. The scenery was gorgeous, the close up shots, camera work and eerie music were some of the highlights, but the killer wasnt all that scary, and came off as funny so they definitely missed the mark with that. Still a decent horror movie but could've been so much better.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Great Book awful casting,"I started reading the book on the Thursday before a long weekend. From the time I picked it up, I couldn't put it down until I finished it. While I'd loved Salem's Lot, it paled next to The Shining. When I heard it was going to be made into a movie, and Stanley was directing, I thought I'd died and gone to heaven. I stood outside the theater hours before the tickets went on sale so I could be the first to see it.Why Stephen King didn't encourage his fans to boycott this film remains a mystery. It's well known he was not pleased with the production. I'm with him. The book was about the Hotel and our own demons.Unfortunately Jack Nicholson decided he need to take over the movie and make it about himself. While there are times and movies when Jack's over the top portrayals are amusing and spell binding, this was not the film he should have used or misused his talents.Years later, Stephen remade The Shining, casting Steven Webber as the father. It was a much more interesting version, focused more on the story and less on one egomaniac's stealing of the spot light.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Not the horror you may expect.,"Ultimately, like it's original bad reception, people to this day often do not like this movie because it does not rely on jumpscares, graphic gore or body horror, it is predominantely psychological. If you are a fan of horror, you have already seen this movie, but if you have not, it will not scare you. You will not stay up late because of the terror it caused, you will sleep nice and easy, however, it is a brilliant movie. Engaging and at times slightly campy. It will always be a favourite of mine, and of my horror-loving friends. Although, the true horror in this movie doesn't come from the hotel. The true horror comes from the moral dilemma of acknowledging Kubrick as ana amazing director, but an awful person. The horror is in knowing how Shelley Duvall was treated. The moral dilemma of loving the movie and needing it to exist, but knowing it wouldn't be as good without her performance, but wishing she never had to deal with any of that, is the true horror.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
"""classic"" is an overused term....","... but it is completely appropriate in referring to this movie, now approaching its 50th anniversary. It is simply one of the creepiest, most chilling horror stories ever committed to celluloid. There is no doubt that the plot is a hodge-podge of disparate elements - horrific past events, supernatural powers (ESP), fantastic beings (whether imaginary or supernatural), ghosts, alcoholism, imaginary friends, insanity. It is all thrown into kind of stew which is often weirdly contradictory, but there is no doubt that the effect on the viewer is overwhelming. Also, there is no doubt that this is one movie in which one of the most important roles is played by the setting itself, the interior of the supposed Overlook Hotel. It should be noted that the actual building is the Timberline Lodge at Mt. Hood, Oregon, and the filmed interior was actually one of the largest sets ever constructed, at Elstree Studios in England. The sets were inspired by the Ahwahnee Hotel in Yosemite Park. Jack Nicholson, descending into madness (or possessed by supernatural forces, take your pick) does some of his best work here. Danny Lloyd is very effective as the child, and Shelly Duvall powerfully portrays terror. ""Iconic"" is another overworked term, but ever a film was so, it's this one.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"

Overrated,"Jack has taken the job and now he is the caretaker of The Overlook Hotel. His wife and their little son are going to be here with him. The location itself is beautiful but remote and isolated.What exacrly is his job? What duties does he have here? What if he fails to do his job properly? Is there any danger in that? Pay no attention to that.What's wrong with his wife? Why does she treat him as a child that needs to have its meals brought to it at an exact time? Alright, alright, calm down. She may have reasons to behave like that. After all, this is a married couple. Who knows what they've been through?What's wrong with their son? Alright, the movie sort of explains it. Speaking of the boy. Go watch Looper and you will probably understand why I think this boy might have inspired Rian Johnson. Just saying.Why does Jack go insane? Because he hates his wife and cannot get any inspiration for his writing? He's a writer, by the way. Sure, things happen in this hotel but seriously, is what we see in the movie enough to drive a man insane? Do not think about it.Also, the one and only Kubrick directed it, so you either like it or you're too dumb to understand the greatness of art! Sure. Seems like whoever was in charge of production had plenty of ideas and got lost in thier own maze. Hints, things, whatever.Jack's wife is a miscast, say what you will. She's annoying for the wrong reason. The story is raw, it is not well paced. It is a mess. The music is misplaced and does not stop. Annoying.The movie looks good, that is for sure. Most of the time, anyway. Jack Nickolson is great. That little boy's acting was impressive. That old woman in the room where nobody should go, well, that was disgusting. Being repulsive edges on being scary in that scene. There is blood, a lot of it. Looks impressive. That's about it.Also, go read the book. Way better!

Kubrick's Worst,"It is hard to believe that the man who made ""Paths of Glory"" and ""Dr. Strangelove"" could have created this nonsense. It starts off with a fairly interesting premise but soon turns south, thanks to a story that is silly and characters that are one-dimensional and under-developed. Nicholson's acting is way over the top with the only redeeming quality being that it's pretty funny at times. Duvall is at her bug-eyed, buck-toothed worst as Nicholson's simpering ninny of a wife. The blame for this must fall on Kubrick, as both actors have shown that they are capable of better performances.

A masterpiece of a horror movie but a sophisticated one as well,"The Shining remains to be a horror masterpiece to this day from Jack Nicholson's performance, the camera work, and how much of it is worthy of being analyzed. Jack Torrence (Jack Nicholson) is a writer and is taking up the job of being the caretaker of the Overlook Hotel, he takes his family with him, Wendy (Shelley Duvall), his wife, and Danny (Danny Lloyd), his son. Before he takes his family up with him, he is talking with the manager of the hotel and is told of a story of a man who was a caretaker once before for the hotel and ended up having a mental breakdown leading to the him killing his entire family as well as himself. Jack says he'll be fine and simply brushes it off.Many different things unfold in this movie, from the intense tension in a vast majority of the scenes, especially the last 40 minutes, and all of the strange things that happen which you question the reality of and what the deeper meanings are. But, even if you don't bother to get analytical with the film or try to interpret the complexities, it doesn't take away from the film because it truly is one of the best horror movies ever made especially in terms of actually being scary and the performances. The soundtrack alone make things terrifying whether they are meant to be or not. The movie manages to have some incredibly memorable moments that are littered in pop culture today for good reason because so much is worth remembering.Every single shot in The Shining is taken with care, every thing is perfectly done and it makes for one beautifully terrifying film. It doesn't surprise me that Kubrick was such a perfectionist because not a shot is wasted. Everything is perfectly framed. Amongst everything though, the performance by Nicholson is mind blowing. He plays a fully blown-out insane man and it is incredible. It isn't very surprising considering I think he is easily one of the best actors ever and seems to be a stand-out in nearly all the films he is in. As the film ends, you will have plenty of questions but that's the beauty of the film, just how much of it is open to interpretation.The ending stands out as you question what is meant by it all and what Jack Torrence is exactly. The film has supernatural elements that aren't wholly explained but more left to what you think its supposed to be. Personally, I like it when a film leaves me with questions, if its done tastefully of course, I don't want everything to be spoon-fed to me by the artist. Ultimately, this is a film that still stands the test of time and probably will forever as a horror classic as well as being a smart, albeit terrifying, movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"

Flawed but effectively creepy,"Stanley Kubrick begins his love affair with the Steadicam in this film, five years after 'Barry Lyndon.' Tracking shot after tracking shot after tracking shot fills this film as Kubrick, liberated from laying track for his camera, follows his characters as they run, walk, limp, stagger, hobble and cycle from room to room all over the Overlook Hotel and through the Maze outside on the hotel grounds. Jack Torrance (Nicholson) is a writer (surprise) with, apparently, a history of mental problems and alcohol abuse. In recovery, he and his wife Wendy (Shelly Duvall) and their son Danny (Danny Lloyd) are hired as caretakers of the Overlook Hotel in Colorado during the off-season. But during the winter, Jack falls off the wagon and descends into madness---or does he? Are we witnessing the hallucinations of a deranged mind, or is the hotel really haunted---or both? Is son Danny really telepathic and clairvoyant, or is he also a little nutty? It would appear that the hotel really is haunted and that Jack's mental frailty is fertile soil for the spirits' pernicious influence.I have not read the book, but I've heard that Stephen King was sufficiently dissatisfied with Kubrick's adaptation that he approved a 1997 TV miniseries starring Steven Weber and Rebecca de Mornay. Maybe so, and this is film is not without its flaws, but the power of Kubrick's unique vision is undeniable. The sets of the interior of the hotel are huge; they are somewhat reminiscent of the Discovery-2 in '2001.' We see ceilings and hallways that really appear to be connected. Different rooms are lit in different hues, so that there are sudden color changes as characters run from room to room, which must have given the cinematographer some truly baroque headaches. The emptiness and stillness of the hotel's rooms and corridors are effectively creepy. The film would not succeed, however, without Jack Nicholson's ferocious portrayal of a man losing his mind. His fortissimo performance simply overwhelms all the other actors' work, with the exception of Scatman Crothers. His riveting performance as Halloran astonished viewers who were familiar with Crotheres only as a rather clownish older black actor who made frequent appearances on TV dramas, comedies and talk shows that were rarely or any consequence. Since Crothers and Nicholson are almost never together on screen, Crothers has the opportunity to steal every scene he appears in with effortless aplomb.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
"Brilliant, but has one HUGE flaw.","This is a superb film - the pacing and suspense are just right, and the shocks come thick and fast in the last 45 minutes. However, there is a big flaw: It is never properly explained exactly why the lead character goes psycho. In the book it is because he is a reformed alcoholic who's just had his first drink in three years, and the hotel he is taking care of is playing with his mind. In the film, we are given a slight hint that he used to be an alcoholic, but not enough. We are just left confused when he suddenly goes mad a while later.

"Best viewed as an adaptation, not a translation","Just watched ""The Shining"" again for the first time in years and I still don't know what to think. The first time I viewed it, 20+ years ago now, I utterly hated it because I literally had just got done reading the book earlier that same day. A few years later, after reading about it in John McCarty's excellent book ""The Modern Horror Film,"" I gave it another shot and found I enjoyed it much more. McCarty says the film is best viewed as an adaptation, not a translation, of King's novel. This is true.There is no denying that the film is magnificently crafted. The cinematography is graceful and beautiful, and the production design is to die for. Every time I see the film I'm still astonished that the entire hotel was built on a soundstage.Where the film suffers is the casting. Jack Nicholson seems like he's on the edge of madness right from the beginning. He's great in the later part of the film once the madness has fully taken hold of his character, but in the first part of the film I can't help but wonder, ""Why would anyone in their right mind think it would be a good idea to leave this guy in charge of a hotel in the middle of nowhere for six months?"" And Shelley Duval just spends the whole movie seeming like she's on the verge of fainting. Granted, that may not be her fault so much as the script's, which turns her character into a rag doll that is seemingly afraid of everything.Just my $.02.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
"Tries to have the best of both worlds, and ends up with the best of neither","Jack Torrance, a writer, applies for a job as winter caretaker at an isolated hotel. The hotel is set high in the mountains, a long way from the nearest town, and is normally cut off by snow during the winter. Jack, who wants the solitude in order to concentrate on his writing, accepts the position, even though he has been warned by the hotel manager that a previous caretaker, Charles Grady, went mad and killed his family and himself. When we hear that we know exactly how the plot will pan out. Jack will go mad and start attacking his wife Wendy and their young son Danny.I love Stanley Kubrick, whom I regard as one of the greatest directors of all time. I love ""Paths of Glory"", ""Spartacus"", ""Doctor Strangelove"", ""A Clockwork Orange"" and ""Eyes Wide Shut"", all of which I regard as masterpieces, with ""Lolita"", ""Barry Lyndon"" and ""Full Metal Jacket"" not far behind. I don't love ""The Shining"", which I regard as one of Kubrick's rare failures. I realise that I am in the minority on that score, although I would probably have been in the majority when it was first released in 1980. Many critics at the time disliked it and although it was not nominated for a single Oscar or Golden Globe, it earned Kubrick his only ""Worst Director"" Razzie nomination. (Shelley Duvall was also nominated as ""Worst Actress""). Since then critical thinking seems to have shifted and the film is regularly ranked among Kubrick's best, but watching it again recently, for the first time in a number of years, has not persuaded me to revise my generally unfavourable impression of it.Before I set out my criticisms of the film, let me first say what I liked about it. Jack Nicholson, who had earlier won an Oscar for portraying another mentally disturbed character in ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", is excellent as the tormented Jack. (I was less taken with Duvall). There is some excellent photography of the mountain scenery, and Kubrick's shots of the eerie, deserted hotel are often highly atmospheric.Kubrick's previous film, ""Barry Lyndon"", had been criticised for being too long and slow-moving, and was a box-office failure in America. He therefore decided that his next film should be both a critical and a commercial success, and hit on the horror genre, possibly influenced by the fact that horror films like ""The Exorcist"" and ""The Omen"" were very much in vogue in the seventies. I have always felt, however, that his style of film-making was not well-suited to horror. It was in my view admirably suited to a historical epic like ""Barry Lyndon"", but horror has generally been a genre which requires something tauter, leaner and faster-moving than Kubrick was used to. ""The Shining"", at least in the cut released in America, ended up nearly two and a half hours long; the British and European version, with which I am more familiar, is 25 minutes shorter, but even that seems overlong and to move at a glacial pace. Although, as I said, Kubrick is often able to conjure up a disturbing atmosphere, that atmosphere is too often dissipated when nothing happens.One of the film's critics in 1980 was Stephen King, the author of the novel on which it is based. I have never read the book, so am unable to enter into the controversy about whether or not the film is faithful to it, but some of King's other criticisms seem justified. King disliked what he saw as the ambiguity of the film. He stated in an interview that his story was definitely a tale of the supernatural, of the ""sheer inhuman evil"" haunting the hotel. He felt that Kubrick, whom he described as a ""visceral skeptic"" and ""a man who thinks too much and feels too little"", was unable to grasp this and therefore sought to locate the evil within Jack's own personality.Now there would be nothing wrong with a film about a man who is driven to madness by loneliness and isolation and who, in his insanity, believes that he is seeing ghosts. That interpretation, however, does not really work here because there are other elements in the story which do indeed point to a supernatural explanation. It is not just Jack who sees the ghosts; Danny can see them as well. The hotel appears to be haunted by not just the ghosts of the Grady family, who died in 1970, but by spectres from an earlier period, the 1920s. It is said to have been built on an Indian burial ground. (Has there ever been an American ghost story which does not involve Indian burial grounds?) Indeed, the film's very title has a supernatural meaning. Danny discovers that he possesses psychic abilities, something he shares with the hotel's elderly chef Mr Halloran; ""shining"" is Halloran's term for these powers.I felt that ""The Shining"" could have worked as a straightforward ghost story, with Jack's violent behaviour explained in terms of possession by paranormal forces. (I am generally as sceptical as Kubrick about such matters, but am prepared to leave my scepticism at the cinema door). It could have worked as a straightforward psychological thriller, with the ghosts and apparitions which seem to haunt the hotel explained in terms of the delusions of a deranged mind. Kubrick, however, tries to keep hold of both possibilities, with the result that the film ends up muddled and confusing, with no satisfactory explanation ever being given. Ambiguity can sometimes be an artistic strength, but here it is more of a weakness. ""The Shining"" tries to have the best of both worlds, and ends up with the best of neither. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Watch the film before you read the book.,"I saw The Shining years ago and thought it was a great horror film. Visually stunning and full of unpleasant moments, and not just some popcorn and cola slasher flick. There is nothing to complain about if you have not read the book. The acting is great and the score is haunting. If you want creepy memories, you should rent this film. The small things in the film is what made me want to pick up the book; and the small things are what makes the film so good too. But if you have read the book, I think you will be disappointed, as a lot differs from the original story. I can see why King did not like this film. But King himself said. ""Films and books are two different things."" I think this film, like the novel, is timeless and definitely one to watch with the lights off.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"

A Haunting Descent into Madness,"Adapted from Stephen King's novel, the film is a symphony of dread that gradually crescendos, enveloping the audience in an atmosphere of sheer unease. Jack Nicholson's iconic performance as the increasingly unhinged Jack Torrance is a tour de force, his menacing charisma and infamous ""Here's Johnny!"" moment etching themselves into the annals of horror history.Kubrick's meticulous attention to detail is on full display, from the hauntingly beautiful shots of the Overlook Hotel's corridors to the subtle dissonance of the soundtrack. This isn't just a tale of ghosts and ghouls - it's a psychological exploration that leaves viewers questioning the boundaries between reality and madness. The Shining remains an enduring classic that continues to send shivers down spines, a testament to the power of expertly crafted suspense and storytelling.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Wow. All I have to say is wow.,"Most horror movies try phony jump scares and gore. The truth is that this movie only has only one on-screen kill, which many consider racist because he was African-American . Also, the other terrible thing about this movie is how they treated Shelly Duvall off-camera. Other than that, it is an amazing horror classic and it is truly terrifying, especially jack Nicholson's Jack Torrence, which may be a coincidence? Jack playing Jack? Anyway, it is an instant horror classic but let it be known that there is full- frontal female nudity, which turns from a young woman to a elderly woman very quickly.

Very Scary for Its Time,"One of the greatest actors of all time, Jack Nicholson, shows what happens when he commits himself to all work and no play as he attempts to finish his novel.The scariest thing about this movie is how vulnerable his own family is to his descent into madness, as a blizzard whirls around their location in an empty lodge in the middle of nowhere with ghosts abounding.As the brilliant director, Alfred Hitchcock showed us in his movie ""Psycho,"" the most bone-chilling horror can be imparted through subtle psychological means (the shower curtain, the bloody water circling the bathtub drain). And so it is with The Shining: A long, winding icy road up to the far-away lodge; 500 typed pages that all say ""All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy;"" an endless labyrinth of hedges. Don't worry, there are horror, blood and gore aplenty for the rabid fan.A classic.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Didn't age too well,"""The Shining"" might not have aged too well, but it's undeniably another excellent example of Kubrick's filmmaking skills, especially if compared to its contemporaries. It still retains its value as a precious film study piece, but audiences who were born from Generation Y onwards might find it hard to connect to the material on an emotional level.Kubrick's meticulous cinematography and attention to detail managed to tastefully recreate the uneasy atmosphere of the Overlook Hotel without relying on the gimmicks of the genres. It's the only haunted house film I could think of that has been shot mostly in such wide and bright spaces, with vivid patterns and cozy colors.The ominous soundtrack also plays a significant role in emphasizing each scene, with droney sounds and screeching strings that reminded me of the soundscape techniques of David Lynch's ""Eraserhead"" (1977). It blends incredibly well with the slow pace of a film that is based on lingering images rather than dynamic scenes and jumpscares.The film is also notorious for its pioneering use of Steadicams to help us feel the spaces for Danny's tricycle scenes and the chase in the maze.However, no matter how many times I watch it, the horror elements do not work much anymore. It's true that so many classic scenes have been shown and parodied so many times that they lost a lot of their effect, but there are also a lot of unintentionally hilarious moments like those close-ups of Danny with his mouth wide open, the quick zoom on Dick Hallorann's corpse, or the skeleton rooms that show up towards the end.The psychological sides are still valuable, though. All the scenes focused on Jack's descent into madness, and his visits to the Gold Room still retain that unsettling, chilling atmosphere. Many critics' theories expand on the possible allegories and the subtle sides of the relationship between Jack and his family, but the movie itself does not really dig as deep as I hoped it would. As with most of Kubrick's films, there are tons of studies and documentaries based on ""The Shining"", but I wonder how much of their discoveries match with the author's intentions.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Great horror movie,"This is one of my favorite horror movies. It was genuinely unsettling, with a claustrophobic feel. I also appreciated the lack of jump scares and the creepy atmosphere.

The worst horror film I have ever seen!,"This movie does no justice whatsoever to the novel written by Stephen King. The acting, by all three of the main characters (Jack Nicholson, Shelley Duvall and Danny Lloyd) is sickening.   I mean, Wendy is supposed to be good-looking, and they cast Shelley Duvall?!?!  And Jack is supposed to be a nice guy - a good father and husband - at the beginning of the story, which makes for greater contrast when he goes ballistic at the end.  But Nicholson looks and acts psycho from the get-go, making it is no surprise when he actually does go crazy.  Considering King's novels are usually terrible (come on, a car that kills people named Christine?) ""The Shining"" was a haunting account of the hotel effects on the gradual demise of Jack's psyche.  And what's with Tony morphing into this friend that ""lives in Doc's mouth""?  I suggest reading the actual book, or watching the 1997 mini series with Steven Weber and Rebecca De Mornay,which is true to the book and a much better movie.

Truly the Greatest Horror film of all time,Anyone who says this film is overrated doesn't know anything about filmmaking. This is true horror at its finest. Horror isn't about jumpscares.The whole movie is a masterclass in filmmaking. Kubrick took a great horror story and turned it into his own. I agree the plot isn't fleshed out but the movie makes up for it due to its ambiguity.Every scene is metaphor for something deeper. Kubrick truly was a perfectionist.

"Stephen King book aside, this film is a masterpiece","Stephen King in many interviews has considered Stanley Kubrick's 'The Shining' to be a complete failure of his own work. Having read the book before watching the movie, I can completely understand King's point of view. However, this is the only time I will ever say that the film has actually managed to be AS good as the book, which it usually fails to please.To get the full satisfaction of this movie you must completely ignore the book, and just focus on the making of the movie. I won't go into depth but I can tell anyone who is interested in this movie that they will without a doubt get what Kubrick wanted them to get: scared. Unless of course you are one of those hardcore horror fans where nothing seems to frighten you (I find that inhuman but hey).

A scary movie with artistic merit,"This is a movie I highly regard, namely for demonstrating some great artistic merit (some other movies in this category are ""Cat People"", ""A clockwork orange"" and ""The baby of Macon"", which I've also reviewed here).When I first saw this movie as a teenager, I must say I was very disappointed, as it was a movie that was hyped for its shock value, and I didn't find it that shocking.Anyway, the plot of the movie concerns a family who move into a hotel during winter to act as caretakers during the off season. The father is a man who has struggled with alcoholism in the past. His son seems to have some sort of sixth sense, which gives him some very disturbing 'visions' in the hotel.As winter sets in and the isolation becomes more pronounced for the father, he returns to drinking. He starts behaving erratically and violently and may be interacting with his own demons or actual demons in the hotel.I don't want to give away too much more about this movie. In the past, I tended to think of ""The dead zone"" as the best adaptation from a Stephen King novel. Having seen The Dead Zone many years later, it struck me as being little more than a midday movie.So, what made me change my mind about The Shining? One scene. It's the scene where the caretaker's son rides his tricycle inside the hotel...over floorboards and carpet. It struck me as great art-the sheer acoustic sensuality of the sound of the wheels travelling over various textures.It's odd, I know, but I really value that kind of art in a movie.The movie does contain some very creepy scenes, so it is not just a horror movie with artistic flourishes. I'm sure that many of the scenes will haunt you for a while.Just by the by, some years ago, I saw a mini-series of this story, which had Stephen King's involvement. I must say, I did find King's own mini-series to be really awful-especially the ending. Normally novellists complain bitterly about directors ruining their vision. In this case, it was all King's doing.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
A Very Good Movie That Could Have Been Great,"Wasted potential bothers me - whether in a person or in a movie. It bothers me here. I want to love this movie. I want to think it's a masterpiece. But it misses that height by just a little bit because while it's very good, it could have been great.There's a great story here that could have worked so well. Jack Nicholson is Jack Torrance, a writer who finds the perfect opportunity. He's going to take his wife and young son (Shelley Duvall and Danny Lloyd respectively) off to a secluded resort in the Colorado Rockies for the winter. They'll be the only ones there; Jack will work as the custodian and have all sorts of time for writing too. But the unexpected happens. Jack has writers' block. Anyone who writes for a living knows how frustrating that can be. Combined with the seclusion of the resort, Jack begins to slowly drift into insanity, with repercussions for the whole family. If that had been the story, this would have been a great movie; a masterpiece - simply because it's so plausible. Unfortunately ...Well, Stephen King (who wrote the book that this is based on) felt the need to take a story that would have been absolutely chilling because of its plausibility and turn it into some sort of rather silly supernatural/psychic adventure. It seems that Danny has visions and hears voices, etc., etc. The focus keeps coming off Nicholson's descent into insanity and back to this psychic bit, which makes the whole thing nothing more than a flight of fancy, when it could have been bitingly real. Combined with an ending that was - to me at least - the epitome of anti-climax, this movie really lost a lot in my estimation.Don't get me wrong. It's a very good movie. The performances are excellent. Jack Nicholson was born to play parts like this, and he is superb here. Shelley Duvall is convincing as his increasingly terrified wife, and Danny Lloyd does well - even though I wasn't sold on his character's psychic abilities. It was a pleasure to see Scatman Crothers in a supporting role as Dick Hallorann, the resort's chef who shares Danny's psychic ability. I've always liked Scatman Crothers. Stanley Kubrick does a magnificent job of building suspense. You will be on the edge of your seat throughout, and time and time again you will think something is about to happen, except that more often than not nothing happens, so you just start to get comfortable when you suddenly get shocked. This is one of Kubrick's best in my opinion.Watch this. It's a very good movie. It simply could have been better and more believable.7/10 (would have been a 9 if it had been told straight without the psychic nonsense.)",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"

Crescendo of Madness,"Kubrick and Nicholson slowly devolve Jack Torrance into insanity using their masterful skills. Kubrick's long takes, often full of excruciating tension and lack of sound, accentuate his Torrance's emotional state....or lack of emotion in many moments. Often the viewer is forced to ponder, while squirming in their seat, what is about to happen. Modern movies rely on loud bangs to make the audience jump. Not here! Anxiety is slowly burned into the viewer as they have ample time to think during long takes and unexpected revelations that slowly stack up into impactful moments. This is a complex story and arguably open to interpretation yet it focuses on the Torrance family as they agreed to be caretakers of the vast Overlook Hotel, located in isolation up in the mountains, for the cold winter months. The hotel becomes are character itself as the family gets acquainted with it and we learn there was a murder here many years ago. Was it brought on by the constant isolation or something inherent within the hotel? Anyway, this film scared the pants off me when I saw it in a dark open basement in high school.

"Visually interesting, but little more.","I have to wonder why this film has so many fierce defenders.  All we have in this film is a great premise, a series of often outstanding visuals tacked on to an anorexic story, and some fine actors struggling mightily against the retarded dialogue they were given.  If Stanley Kubrick had spent even half the time on his screenplay as he did planning his camera movements, this film might be worthy of the praise it receives.There is plenty to like about the film: the music is effective throughout, and the sets of the Overlook Hotel are simply incredible -- of course, Kubrick uses them to his full advantage, moving the camera slowly through them to heighten the impact and size of the place.  There are many visual images which stand out: the blood gushing from the elevator door and flooding the hallway, Danny riding his big wheel through the enormous, empty hotel, the typed pages Wendy comes across, Jack Torrance attacking the door with an ax and then looking through the hole with his famous grin, and of course the film's final image of Jack is one that is tough to forget. Kubrick never failed to deliver a visually interesting film.About the acting: I love Jack Nicholson, and he was very good in ""The Shining,"" but he was miscast as Jack Torrance.  Why?  Because he always plays the crazy/weirdo guy, and the audience knew this going in.  One cannot buy Nicholson as a normal guy in this or any film, so when he becomes crazy it has little effect.  This takes a lot of wind out of the movie's sails. Shelley Duvall spent too much time whimpering, but considering that this is what she was asked to do I thought she was very good.  Danny Lloyd was OK as Danny Torrance, although I thought Courtland Mead in the TV version did a better job (for those who insist that a six-year-old kid can't be that articulate or intelligent, try spending some time with one...).  Scatman Crothers was great and underused as Hallorann.The thing that really gets me about this movie is when I read or hear people say that it is a metaphor for religion or child abuse or racism or jaywalking or whatever core value you prefer.  It seems that Kubrick's fans believe that since he made the thing, it has to have some sort of deep, spiritual meaning and structure.  Wrong!  He read (skimmed through?) King's book, liked the idea of a family imprisoned in a haunted hotel, and decided to make a movie about it... it's that simple.  Whether Kubrick understood what King's book was about is irrelevant -- if you've read the book, you can easily see why King doesn't like Kubrick's movie, but the plain fact is that Kubrick never set out to make ""Stephen King's The Shining.""  King fans (and King himself) have the TV miniseries for that, and Kubrick fans should lay off it; it's pretty good, not nearly as visually fun (or as ""scary"") but the characters are infinitely more interesting and human than they are in Kubrick's film.  If Kubrick ever made a popcorn flick, ""The Shining"" is it.The bottom line is that Kubrick wanted to make a horror movie, but had no idea how to do it.  ""Do I make a ghost story or a slasher flick?   Is it about going insane or having ESP?  Is it about the supernatural or getting lost in some hedges?  Can I put in something about Indian burial grounds? And where do I squeeze in the obligatory scene with the cobwebby skeletons in old dressy clothes?""  He had no idea, so he threw in a bit of everything, and the result is predictably uneven.  It is only Stanley Kubrick's undeniable talent as a director, a big name in a starring role, and the Overlook Hotel itself that separate ""The Shining"" from any number of average horror movies.  ""The Shining"" is little more than a ""B"" horror flick with an ""A+"" director.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
The classic example of a murder horror,"The movie starts out slowly, as eventually all he other murders will gladly follow suit. But this movie's start up doesn't take very long. It soon takes the viewers to the lonesome world of the big hotel. The thriller sets in very nicely, building momentum for the barrage of horror moments. What I like about this horror is that Stanley Kubrick dared to use minimal amount of dark lit environment, compared to what almost all of the recent horrors are depending their scares upon. The repeated long shot on the corridors are very nice touches that help build curiosity. Those shots puts the object right on sight but with lacking clarity, sometimes prompting the viewers to slant their eyes to have better glimpse of what's being shown. The acting by Jack Nicholson deserves a legendary status indeed. His role gets into character very nicely that when it comes to the twist of the typed pages, even I was surprised, although I have been anticipating such a twist.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
THE SHINING 1980,"Watching The Shining was my second tryst with Stanley Kubrick's cinematic brilliance, and I must say, it was an experience that left me both unsettled and awed. Kubrick's masterful storytelling weaves a complex web of psychological horror, atmospheric tension, and eerie mystery, making The Shining a movie that's hard to shake off.The film tells the story of Jack Torrance (played by Jack Nicholson), a struggling writer who takes up the job of winter caretaker at the isolated Overlook Hotel. Jack's wife, Wendy (played by Shelley Duvall), and their son, Danny (played by Danny Lloyd), accompany him to the hotel, hoping that the isolation will help Jack overcome his writer's block. However, things take a dark turn when Jack's sanity begins to unravel, and the hotel's supernatural forces start to exert their influence.One of the standout aspects of The Shining is its atmosphere. Kubrick's use of long, sweeping shots and eerie sound design creates a sense of unease and tension that permeates every frame of the film. The Overlook Hotel, with its labyrinthine corridors and ornate decor, becomes a character in its own right, exerting a malign influence on its inhabitants. The film's visuals are stunning, with Kubrick's innovative use of Steadicam shots creating a sense of fluidity and unease.The performances in The Shining are also noteworthy. Jack Nicholson brings his signature intensity to the role of Jack Torrance, conveying the character's growing instability and madness. Shelley Duvall, on the other hand, brings a sense of vulnerability and desperation to the role of Wendy, making her character's plight all the more heartbreaking. Danny Lloyd, who plays Danny, is also impressive, conveying the character's unique abilities and emotional turmoil.If I have any criticisms of The Shining, it's that the film's pacing can be a bit slow, particularly in the first half. Additionally, some viewers may find the film's supernatural elements to be a bit ambiguous or unclear. However, I believe that these elements are intentionally left vague, adding to the film's sense of mystery and unease.Overall, I found The Shining to be a deeply unsettling and thought-provoking film that's hard to shake off. Kubrick's masterful direction, combined with the film's atmosphere, performances, and themes, make it a must-watch for horror fans and cinephiles alike. If you haven't seen The Shining before, be prepared for a cinematic experience that will leave you sleeping with the lights on.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"

ceci n'est pas une histoire de fantôme,"A location from which it is impossible to flee is a beloved element in horror films. In ""The shining"" the Overlook hotel, snowbound during winter, is such a location.The complementary element is the monster that tries to kill the main characters. In ""The shining"" there is no monster but there is a main character (Jack Torrance played by Jack Nicholson) that is slowly growing mad and violent. There are some hints that at least the violence is not for the first time. In a way having to be afraid of your father or your man is at least just as scary as having to be afraid of a ghost.The above paragraph already is my interpretation of the movie. There are some ghosts in the film but I think these are imaginations of the (detoriorating) mind of Jack Torrance. One example supporting this interpretation is the bartender Jack is ""talking with"". When his wife comes along she sees nobody.However Kubrick wouldn't be Kubrick if the interpretation would be so straightforward. The ghost of the butler liberates Jack Torrance when he is locked up by his wife, a fine example for a ghost that exists only in the imagination.Writer Stephen King was not very happy with the way Stanley Kubrick had adapted his story. I think he was above all unhappy about the way Kubrick had turned a ghost story into a story about madness. King was also not happy with Jack Nicholson as lead actor. I think this unhappines has the same origin, because after his role in ""One flew over the cuckoo's nest"" (1975, Milos Forman) Nicholson was easily associated with madness.""The shining"" is a complex film, also with regard to the cinematography. It experimented with a steady cam, mainly in the scenes were son Danny Torrance (Danny Lloyd) is riding with his tricycle bike through the long and empty corridors. These scenes are really ill-pregnant, expecting a surprise after each corner.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
A timeless influential model of the horror genre,"With just over four decades of the shining, it is still one of the most unique and well executed horror films of all time, with only psycho being its real competitor in taking the throne of the most influential movie in the horror genre. The narrative is about Jack Torrance who was given the opportunity to take care of the Overlook Hotel for 5 months until May the first. Jack accepts the deal, and takes his wife Wendy only with Danny over. However before he took the deal, he was warned about Grady a Janitor who has murdered his entire family while also taking his life after the process ten years ago, a story that is looking to reestablish through anyone that can shine.What makes this film so special, is the sense of isolation that is delivered from the beginning to end of the run time from the script and the use of wide shots. In the opening scene, we follow Jack car as he heads over to the Hotel, with the camera being much above him while following him like a drone. This helps to not only express the lack of buildings in the journey to get to the hotel but also shows how dreadful it is to get to it during the winter with all the snow. That along with the chilling soundtrack from Wendy Charlos makes you get invested into the film from the very beginning. Apart from that, when Jack and his family finally have control of the Hotel, the writers don't form a strong bond for all three of them as they all have their own interests and duties so that they can be separated from each other. This helps add to the isolation point, as anyone is more vulnerable alone then when they are in groups, combined with the fact that these characters don't know how haunted this hotel can be makes it really enticing to watch as we develop a more intricate understanding of the Hotel through the characters experiences.The only flaws that I have with this film is Jack Nicholson character and the lack of the haunted elements that could have been applied more to provide a more haunting experience. Jack Nicholson performance was great but it didn't really fit the tone that the film was building up to, instead it felt more towards a comedy with how much energy he has during intense scenes instead of being more of a cold killer. For the haunted elements, there weren't many, and when they were on screen, they never gave a sense of danger to the characters making the stakes feel lower than they should be judging by the build up at the start of the film.Overall this is a must watch film for the sheer sense of isolation, combined with the amount of details put into each scene which makes it something very fun to rewatch and analyze.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"

The opening helicopter shot is phenomenal, and just sets the audience up for the rest of the film.Obviously there's the iconic bits, ""Come play with us Danny"" and ""Here's Johnny"" to name a few, but I'll just name a couple of scenes that stood out to me. I'll begin with any of the scenes where Jack goes to the bar. There is something about these scenes that put me on edge, and was something that I loved when I read the original Stephen King book. Jack Nicholson's performance is crucial to these scenes, and I love how the character of Lloyd intensifies as the 'spirit' of the Overlook gets more desperate.Stanley Kubrick's cinematography is both perfect and groundbreaking. I said I was going to try and miss out the iconic scenes, but the ones where Danny's cycling through the Overlook are just brilliant! The whole symmetry of the scenes and use of really disgusting looking seventies style decor complements the film perfectly. Another key element in those scenes is the use of sound. No other sound apart from the rolling of the wheels of Danny's bike. Rooooooooolllllllll Stop Roooooooolllll Stop. Perfection.As is the film's score. Aaaaaarrrggghh!!! From the start, it's iconic. 'Nuff said.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
The Director's New Clothes,"Stanley Kubrick is probably my favorite film maker. Dr. Strangelove and 2001 are on my top 10 list. Clockwork Orange blew my mind when it first came out. I think Barry Lyndon is a visual masterpiece. But The Shining has always struck me as ""the director's new clothes"" a film that forces me to question whether Kubrick was really a charlatan.I remember being at a bookstore back in the late 70's and seeing a paperback book called The Shining with the tag line ""soon to be a Stanley Kubrick motion picture."" I immediately grabbed it and devoured it in a day or two. I had never heard of the author and I had never experienced such intense horror while reading it. I absolutely could not wait for the film to come out.I imagine that Kubrick must have had a similar reaction to the book which is why he bought the rights. The advertising for the film promised a horror roller-coaster: the blood pouring from the elevator, the creepy girls, Jack Nicolson with the ax, the boy and mother running through the maze in the snow. But when I sat there at the first showing the movie just never took off.Was it me? Had I been expecting the book? Shouldn't I have known better than to expect a faithful adaptation from an iconoclast like Kubrick? But the screenplay seemed amateurish and way over thought. The whole production struck me as an attempt to create big effects with music and sound to cover up a complete lack of substance.What went wrong? I think that Kubrick picked the wrong book in his attempt to recreate movie horror in the same way that he redefined science fiction with 2001. I'm guessing that he was bowled over by the book and committed to it before really thinking through whether it was the right material for his style. Once he started working on it and trying to break it down to its essentials (throwing out half of the book in the process), he found that the ""bones"" of the piece just didn't work.So, in essence, Kubrick became the character Jack at the typewriter, struggling to create something but going mad in the process. To me, Kubrick's Shining is the cinematic equivalent of ""All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.""",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
The face of horror in the 90's,"The Shining as a book is an absolute gem, and so is the movie, even though Kubrick did many things obviously very different then King would've done it (as he says in every interview about the movie).
But that's for the better in my opinion, it is a much better movie than any other flick with ""Kingfluences"".The performances (besides the kid, but he's ok too) is absolutely stunning. Especially in the director's cut version I often find myself simply rewatching the movie twice in a row.Also the cinematic value is immense, my god the intro where they drive up the mountains and the intro rolls and the music plays, it is so perfectly filmed, especially for the time of the movie.What a true, outstanding masterpiece of a movie.

Hints and Tips.,"Now...I'm usually afraid of Horror films, but since studying film studies in college, I have learnt a few tricks..to calm us weak hearted people down! I watched The Shining for the first time last night and truly found it terrifying! But watching it a second time, I began to pick up hints on how it works. Whenever you see Jack look into a mirror, you can tell something is going to happen, because a mirror is a split between the body and the soul. You'll be able to see it happen in the bedroom and in the dining room. Also I know that this is obvious, but it's great how the music builds up on the enigma and creates a strong tension between audience and character. When Danny is scooting round on his little tri-cycle and the music becomes more extreme, prepare yourselves because around one of these turnings something is going to happen!

Not bad,"I like to watch horror movies, and this one is said to be the classic... so I gave it a go last night and I must say that is not bad. I believe I remember when I was a kid that we had this movie on the VHS or somewhere... I remember the twin girls and the lift and that blood pouring into the hall but that's it. After 25 years, these scenes do not seem to trigger any horror. In fact, the twin girls seem kinda out of place - and they seem very old?! Are they even girls?I believe that the roles of all 3 main characters were played out very well, though the woman seem - at some scenes - uncertain ( to me) as if she does not know if she played right or not. Also, I found it a bit silly that when she is chased, from all the places she could go ( including the outside which I am sure is the best solution) she goes into her room ( where, normally, she would be caught!) and locked herself with a child in the bathroom. OK, I know that add to the suspention and all, but those unprobable 'moves' kinda turn me off.All in all, not scared. Maybe in the 80's it was...

Reigns supreme amongst the scaries,"You all know it, and I'm afraid you don't need me to reaffirm this frankly universal agreement. The Shining, direct by Stanley Kubrick, is a no-brainer among the best horror films. Simple. Frankly, this is such a common agreement that I'm afraid I don't have any new information to present. Overall, the film is such a cinematic mosaic of perfection that I am at a loss on where to even begin.Such undeniably perfect cinematography for such a wacky, novel, well paced, spooky plot is nothing short of fantastic, easily entitling it to the honor of among the world's best films in general.

It's very hard to find anything that good, or that bad.I think the Shining is seriously -that- good. It still feels modern, no, futuristic. Every shot is visually stunning, almost overwhelming and wasteful feeling to imagine how much technical compulsion and overwhelming decisiveness was put into everything, to make it the spectacle of near-perfection everything from it's performances, to setting, and how every single detail make it the futuristic experience it is today.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
"Deeply unsettling ""horror"" from Kubrick","When this movie was released 40 years ago, the author of the book on which it was ""based,"" Stephen King, said: ""I think it's a really good movie; I just don't know what it has to do with my book.""King is, of course, an acknowledged master of the ""horror"" genre. Stanley Kubrick, on the other hand, is a master of cinema, i.e. visual storytelling. The story that Stanley decided was the most terrifying was the one we start to tell ourselves in our innermost thoughts.And that's why his ""horror movie"" is so different than most, and his mastery is why it's so deeply unsettling to watch. Jack Nicholson's performance is iconic, of course, and Shelley Duvall's creeping feelings of abject terror are palpable (supposedly because Kubrick did indeed terrorize her during the filming). I find it also notable that the young actor who played Danny then chose not to pursue acting, but became an M.D. instead!This, along with ""A Clockwork Orange,"" are the 2 Kubrick films that I did not like at all upon first seeing them as a teen. I have now seen both dozens of times and consider them movie masterpieces. That's what his movies are like for me: they start out just being odd, not fitting the ""mold,"" and they end up changing my entire perception of that mold.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
It's an entertaining film,"The plot and dialogues are amazing. About the gender, they absolutely get what terror is, but it's more like psycho horror. The performances

The role of his wife is a bit stupid, I think Kubrick must had given her more protagonist and intelligence. And the main reason why I give it 7 stars, It's a really slow film, like the most of those times by 70s and 80s.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"

Some movies seem dumb 40 years later...,"Some movies are timeless. Some movies seem kind of dumb 40 years later. To me, this one was among the latter kind. The special effects obviously, but also the music and even the acting all seemed out of date. (Part of it may be the fact that I was thinking ""That's the girl from the Popeye movie"" in every scene with Wendy. Her style of acting was perfect for Olive Oil, but seemed silly in a horror movie.) It wasn't scary at all.
Between the fact the I thought it was just okay, and hearing that Stephen King hated it, it makes me interested to read the book. So it succeeded in that at least.

A Haunting Masterpiece of Psychological Horror,"Watching ""The Shining"" for the first time was an experience that I will never forget. As I settled into my seat, the eerie opening music set the tone for what was to come. From the very first shot of the winding road leading to the Overlook Hotel, I felt an unsettling sense of dread creeping in. The cinematography is nothing short of breathtaking, and Stanley Kubrick's meticulous attention to detail is evident in every frame.Jack Nicholson's portrayal of Jack Torrance is hauntingly brilliant. His transformation from a struggling writer to a man possessed by the malevolent forces of the hotel is both terrifying and mesmerizing. I found myself holding my breath during his iconic scenes, particularly when he finally confronts Wendy. Shelley Duvall's performance as Wendy is equally compelling; her vulnerability and strength create a palpable tension that kept me on the edge of my seat.The atmosphere of the hotel itself is a character in its own right. The vast, empty corridors and the chilling silence amplify the sense of isolation and madness. I felt as if I were trapped within those walls alongside the Torrance family, experiencing their descent into horror firsthand. The iconic imagery-the blood-filled elevator, the ghostly twins, and that haunting maze-has been etched into my mind long after the credits rolled.What struck me most was how the film delves into the psychological aspects of fear and madness. It's not just about jump scares; it's a slow burn that builds an overwhelming sense of unease. The way the film explores the fragility of the human mind, especially under the weight of isolation and despair, left me contemplating long after it ended.I can see why ""The Shining"" is hailed as a classic. It transcends the horror genre, offering a profound commentary on family, addiction, and the darkness that lurks within us all. It's a film that demands to be watched, not just for its scares but for its artistry and depth. I walked away feeling both disturbed and exhilarated, a testament to the power of cinema.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Among the best horror films ever made,"I think the makers of such effect-induced, plotless, pointless movies like the more recent ""The Haunting"", ""Deep Blue Sea"", ""The Faculty"", and many other such films should be forced to sit down and watch this movie, maybe with ""Vertigo"" and ""North by Northwest"".  Kubrick can draw more from a small group of actors, a non-alive house (except maybe the elevators), and axe and a small, repetitive manuscript than most directors these days get from $100 million dollars.Granted, this movie couldn't have been made without Jack Nicholson.  This may be a backhanded compliment, but no other actor has the ability to play a creepy, crawling-under-your-skin, all out psycho like Jack Nicholson. This is one of his best performances, and here he is in expert hands.The whole cast and set is made to give the perfect effect.  There is very little actual violence in this movie, but it's ten times scarier than most of the so-called ""horror"" films we see out today.  Kubrick is a master at using suspense to a real effect.  It seems that any type of movie he made, it became one of the definitive movies of it's genre, and this is no exception.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Outstanding Film!,"Horror movies don't usually have a very complex story line. Movies like Halloween or Friday the 13th, usually have a simple story line of somebody going around murdering people, and there's not much else to the story besides that. Stanley Kubrick's, The Shining, is a horror movie because it can be scary at times, but it is not your everyday horror. The Shining is more of a suspense thriller, as it takes the viewer through the progressing mental illness of the main character, Jack Torrance.Stanley Kubrick's, The Shining takes place in the 1970's at the luxurious Overlook Hotel that is being closed for the winter. Jack Torrance, the father of Danny Torrance and husband of Wendy Torrance, goes to apply as the winter caretaker of the Overlook Hotel in search of a job after recently quitting his previous job as a teacher. After getting the job as caretaker and living at the hotel for about 5 months, Jack soon grows impatient with his family. He becomes mentally ill and suffers from a serious mental breakdown, causing him to go insane.Overall, the story line of The Shining is very interesting. The film is not only compelling, but it is also very realistic; apart from all of the paranormal and supernatural activity that goes on in the hotel. The story is mostly clear and thorough, but can be confusing sometimes. A lot of the story is told through Jack's point of view, so that the viewer can have a sense of his constant crescendo of insanity. The film focuses on various ways a family can be torn apart by things such as addiction and abuse; which makes it so realistic.The actors chosen for this film were amazing! Jack Nicholson's portrayal of Jack Torrance was flawless. Everything about his performance was amazing. The psychotic tone and the way he moved really brought the psycho side of Jack Torrance to life. The setting of the Overlook Hotel is pretty typical for a horror movie. The interior alone makes it spooky, and then with the addition of monsters, spirits, mysteries, and it being the site of several murders, gives it the horror feel. The music score certainly adds to the eerie feel of the movie. The Shining has such good camera work that always leaves the viewer questioning what's going to happen next. The scenery was well crafted and really emphasizes the madness of the film and for how old the movie is, the special effects crew did an outstanding job, even though they didn't have CGI the way there is today.Overall, Stanley Kubrick's, The Shining, is a captivating film that is a must watch. The Shining is a suspense thriller that takes the viewer through the realistic struggle of mental illness and the effects of abuse and addiction. The Shining is an excellent film that is highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Both scary and thought provoking.

Jack Nicholson shines as Jack Torrance, a writer who takes his family up to the Colorado Mountains for the winter to take care of a hotel, but the hotel seems to have secrets of it's past.Stanley Kubrick's direction and Jack Nicholson's acting are definitely the high points of the film.

Kubrick - A Gifted Azzhole,"""The Shining"" is an exemplary film, and that's why I rate it so high, but there are some flaws. Each time I've watched this film I marvel at the acting skill and the cinema-graphic precision.STORY: The story itself is interesting, but this is really not a ""mystery"" per se, as some may see it. Essentially, the story is rather flat, but the film adds dimension around it to give it fullness.ACTING: Overall the acting is very good, but the STAND-OUT performance is Shelley Duvall. That's right, I see Nicholson as largely just being himself (and the world cheers), but he's always been overrated IMO. But Duvall's skill, sensitivity, intelligence and range are what catapult this film. Without her, this film would be mediocre. BTW - Duvall is a very gifted actress and producer.TEMPO: Excellent tempo, never gets bogged down or hyper.CINEMATOGRAPHY: Aside from Duvall's performance, this is the highlight of the film. The angles, realism, and even the use of sound, e.g. The ""Big Wheel"" running across hard and soft surfaces, etc. Create a consistently measured mood. Very impressive.DIRECTING: As a whole Kubrick is a gifted technician, and this is the result. However ... I think he's a total @sshole. This guy put Duvall in such an emotionally devastated condition that she suffers a breakdown on set. Even so, he's still a d!ck to her. He has done brilliant work, but there are some absolute losers: ""Barry Lyndon,"" ""A Clockwork Orange,"" ""Lolita"".Summary: Great film for so many reasons, but Kubrick? He's a d!ck.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"

Good Book. GREAT Film!,"The Shining is one of my favorite movies.Kubricks films always seem a little ""cold"" to me. Lots of long shots and hard, shiny surfaces, I guess. But to his credit, he always knew how to turn that coldness to underscore whatever the theme of that particular film is about.In The Shining, the coldness is terrifying. And it's not just metaphorical. It's literally too cold and snowy to go outside. The Torrances are isolated, bunkered in, and Kubrick somehow manages to make huge spaces like the ballroom and the lobby where Jack sets up his writing station, feel claustrphobic.Stephen King, so the story goes, does not like this adaptation. He felt that Kubrick didn't understand or believe in evil, so he changed it to insanity. And he's right about that. But the thing is, the movie is SO MUCH BETTER than the book. In the book we get King's standard fare - guy with a drinking problem and a troubled marriage, source of stored-up evil, demonic possession, etc. While I think it's one of King's better books, there's nothing there that you can't find in many of his other books.But Kubrick gives us something completely unique - a film that is both a fascinating portrait of a man losing his mind, and a master class in how to compose a shot. Every shot in this film is beautiful, and most are perfectly symmetrical. Somehow that manages to be terrifying. The ""fascinating portrait"" part is due in no small part to Jack Nicholson's very, um... Nicholsonian performance. But Jack had been around for a while at that point, and I'm sure Kubrick knew exactly what he wanted when he hired him.I guess what I'm trying to say is, there are many books like King's The Shining, but there is only one film like Kubrick's.Now, I don't really blame ol' Steve for being a little chuffed that Kubrick didn't run with his central concept. But I suspect that what he was mostly feeling was kind of abashed that Kubrick had schooled him on the difference between being a good artist, and being a great one.Pretty much nobody remembers the remake that King actually had a hand in making. But here, 40 years later, everybody knows Kubrick's - even if they haven't actually seen it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Passable.,"*WARNING!! SPOILERS!*I freely admit to reading the book before seeing the film, but I tried very hard to see the film as a separate entity, and it still didn't do it for me.I found the entire thing rather disconcerting. Nothing is really explained, and while some may think this ""adds to the mood"" I just found it to be lazy and irritating. I have to say how frustrating it was to see Halloran throughout the entire movie trying to get there and is immediately killed. I understand that this was meant to be a shock, but I just found it irritating and time wasted. Perhaps if Halloran had done something, ANYTHING, before he was killed I wouldn't feel that way. I was also put off by the pictures on Hallorans walls. I don't know what that was about. He was just a useless character because Kubrick needed SOMEONE to kill.I also didn't CARE. I didn't care about any of the characters. I think that's a very important quality in a film. I could have lived with the changes if I cared at all about the characters. As it was, I didn't get scared or anxious or INTO the movie at all, because I just didn't care. Jack, as others have said, seemed crazy from the beginning, which undermined the film, in my opinion.They didn't need to bother calling the movie The Shining, as Danny's abilities played such a small part they could have been cut entirely and no one would notice.It wasn't all bad. Nicholson's performance towards the end was quite disturbing, and I loved the imagery in the movie. It just didn't deserve the hype. There were some scares. The twin girls were disturbing enough.

"Overblown, directionless mess.","OK, full disclosure, I was a massive fan of Stephen King novels in the 70's, 80's and 90's, and read The Shining when it first came out. Sadly so much was changed between the novel and the movie, it tears the very beating heart out of the story and renders it meaningless. Even the Shining, as Halloran dubs their abilities, is swept under the rug and seems irrelevant in the film after which it is named. Other major changes from the novel, well it's hard to know where to start there are so many. Just about all of the back story around Jacks alcoholism is ignored. The history of the Overlook is all but ignored. All three main characters differ vastly from their literary counterparts, right down to their hair colour. The Topiary of animals becomes a maze, the roque court, a major element of the novel, just disappears. The pieces that do survive from the book just end up being confusing asides without the background. The casting is very poor, Nicholson comes across as maniacal right from the off and continues to over act his way through the entire film. Duvall seems completely out of place and Danny Torrance displays all the charisma of an empty paper bag. The jarring musical soundtrack is often irritating more than it is effective.

The shining is a fantastic example of what he achieved, by taking an alright book by Stephen King and turning it into the canonical version of the story... by sheer brilliance and genius I would add.King claimed he hated this movie after the release... I think he was hurt and jealous. Kubrick wrote a better story than he did. In any case, the movie 'Dr. Sleep' that came out last year was set as a sequel to Kubricks 'The Shining', and it was a pretty good follow up I must add. This film is one of my favourite of Kubrick's works, and it got a 10/10 from me as the 6th on my list out of only 8 items.Now then, what can be said that hasn't already? Well I can start with how this film makes me feel. Much like Jaws, this film terrifies me; even more so due to the topic and ghost story aspect of the material. This is one that haunts my thoughts, as it is set up eerily and strange right from the beginning. It has topics of child abuse, ghosts that eat your energy and take the form of the dead, or rooms and buildings. The backdrop sets the hotel on an Indian burial ground, an eerie place to begin with, but even though the movie is created to show the blood of the past, or sins of the founding peoples of the USA, Kubrick leads you to far worse and creepier things.The themes have been explored, and up to 40 years later some people have figured out only some of what Kubrick had encoded into this masterpiece. Even the editing, done over the 5 year production, has been created in such a way that big plot events happen in mirror timecode to each other. It is such a strange thing to see that someone decoded that, but it is elegant and frightening all the same. This genius thought about his imagery of 'mirrors', both physical and literal in the scenes; to mirrors of the physical world and the spiritual world. His mirrors also cross from the cinematic world to the real world as we as the viewers peer into his creation.So many strange things happen in the background of this film, it creeps me out to this day. The chairs that keep moving around, and disappearing and reappearing for one. Chairs in Kubrick's version seem to represent the spirits, or those watching us. They always seem to face the characters; and in the scene with the dead girls, he had the two chairs knocked over in the blood to represent the girls perhaps? Or to link us to the ghosts of the girls? Who knows, but it creeps me the hell out. The TV's that have no power cords, as if powered or activated by Danny's shining, or that the hotel is connected to him.The encoded message that Room 237 is the moon at 237,000 miles away, and that it is filled with horrors and lies is fascinating one; as Danny wearing the rocket ship launches and heads over to the room of horror.Anyway, all this stuff adds to the visual feast of this film. The basic plot itself is a good horror, the acting is amazing. Kubrick was a talented man, and many have a lot to owe him and his works. The Shining represents so many things and 'Dr. Sleep' shows how much love and adoration people have for what Kubrick had created from King's novel.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Jack Torrance HATES HATES HATES his family! ...,"To me, that's the underlying theme of the film. Jack Nicholson always plays some facet of the classic Jack persona in every film he is in, and this one is no exception. The film deviates from the novel in that the novel has the husband doing the hard work of caring for the Overlook Hotel and getting possessed by it in the process, and the film has the wife doing that same hard work. But to have Jack Nicholson's character doing this kind of hard work and actually caring for the place would be so not Jack Nicholson. So here, he is the indifferent caretaker.So Jack Torrance starts out resenting his family and his obligations. The isolation of winter in such a place and his growing alcoholism just escalates matters into tragedy.I've watched The Shining several times, and I find it disjointed and even muddled compared to the novel. Because the real horror of the Shining is not being trapped in an isolated place with a madman or even inside of a truly haunted hotel. The Shining is a parent's horror story. The real horror of the story is the idea that the thing that poses the most threat to your child could be you.Still, I give it an 8/10 because it is creepy in a visually inventive kind of way that doesn't involve gore, and as the decades have worn on since this was first released that is a real hallmark of good horror - to be scary without resorting to gore.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"

Just so wonderful and insanely masterful in placing such scenes and depicting them on screen.,"""Heeeere's Johnny!"" and ""All Work and No Play, makes Jack a Dull boy"". Just so wonderful and insanely masterful in placing such scenes and depicting them on screen.Stanley Kubrick, the master story teller has indeed made one of the most spine chilling and scariest movies ever. Jack Nicholson as Jack Torrance did an awesome job. This is a film that not only scares you but also gives nightmares. Dare to watch it non stop without fast forwarding or pausing and you may feel something like you have never felt or rarely felt before.It is written superbly by Stephen King but I will say this is more a Kubrick masterpiece as he visualised the whole and brought the writing alive. A wow to the master Kubrick.It works on many levels be it psychological or technical, there are steadicam scenes, some insane scenes, some symbolism. Like REDRUM is reversed as MURDER and many many more. Jack becomes from being completely normal to tally mad. There is a history to the whole setup and it's all so very intriguing.The whole cast has to be awarded for doing what they did and specially that boy Danny Lloyd. While Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall did perfectly. Over and above everything was location and art direction here. Be it the creation of a vast maze or that creepy hotel and that detailing of every room and nook and corner of it. The trail to the hotel, wow everything was so masterfully done. Cinematography is something that we can learn, those strolling scenes of kid on cycle through the hall, or those maze scenes, or the car travelling through high road. Each one is shot so exquisitely, I fell in love with most of them.Watch it for Kubrick's brilliance, it's the perfect suspense film. A 5/5 for this. Just can't say more. Go and understand what Shining is, they know everything.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
It is a Classic.,"After seeing the Shining and it's sequel I have determined that this film is still great but, there is one glaring problem for me. The pacing in the first half is extremely slow. I believe this movie is 4 minutes shorter but I thought this was longer than its sequel. I get that the exposition has to be laid out but it really takes it out of me for the first 45 minutes. Although the second half blows the first half and most movies out of the water showing us that Jack is going insane and that hotel is the puppet master with little hints dropped here and their. That's what I like about this film more than the one that proceeds it. It isn't fully clear what is making the house haunted in a sense but that it just is. I like that it is not all in your face about it being haunted or that Jack is just a crazy person. Also, this movie has one of my favorite endings and it took me forever to understand.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Nicholson's Finest,"An absolute classic in cinema and a brilliant film adapted from a brilliant novel. Kubrick's take on King's work is phenomenal as suspense builds constantly throughout the film. Visually it is incredible, with steady-cam footage providing some of the best scenes, but the soundtrack is unbeatable and keeps you constantly unnerved. It would be hard to go wrong with King's original plot, and this holds to a similar narrative, keeping you gripped until the end credits.Casting is perfect, and this may be Nicholson's best work. His descent into insanity from isolation could not have been portrayed better by anyone else. His facial expressions and solo scenes make this film. Duvall is superb too, and the chemistry created was largely down to her ability.The only issue with The Shining is it lacks the depth of the novel, which would be difficult to cover under any circumstances, but the development of the hotel and outside characters could be construed as confusing in the film. The novel provides perfect understanding of each backstory, the history of the hotel, and how everything interlinks. The film doesn't really expand upon 'scary hotel' with what you can only guess at are hallucinations? Ghosts? Actual people? This and a few major twists in the storyline, particularly towards the end, plus the absence of Jack's former alcoholism, are the only real negatives, and these are only when you compare to the novel.Overall, it is one of the best horrors of all time. The suspense can kill you and everyone involved is phenomenal.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"

Welcome to the Overlook hotel. you can check out anytime you like but you can never leave.,"Stanley Kubrick's Version of the Shining butchers Stephen King's fantastic novel. by stretching it in other ways and omitting important plot points and adding others and making changes to the Overlook itself and how the Torrance family reacts to the Hotel.That said. however Kubrick's version of the Shining is a outstanding and highly original look at King's novel. Which King hates. but Kubrick was a gifted director who knew what he was doing and he was a perfectionist which drove the cast and crew of this movie crazy. but Kubrick never lost sight of the story he wanted to tell. in the novel King explains that the Overlook is a large psychic vampire a large battery feeding off of the people there who had Psychic abilities . Making the Overlook a large battery that stores and contains the most emotional psychic moments of its existence. Happiness ,Death,Love , violence. all of these things go on and on in the Overlook . but in Kubrick's nothing about the Overlook is explained except in the barest of details .but that is more then enough. Here in the movie less is more. And while the Shining is Kubrick's movie it belongs to Jack Nicholson. while in the book the slide into madness is supposed to be subtle for Jack Torrance. In this movie he seems cheese and crackers right from the start which is fun to watch as you realize the cheese has slid off his crackers and he is dangerous . The best bit is the scene that leads to the staircase. Wendy stop swinging the bat Wendy..as he moves in to kill her in a moment of comic timing. Nicholson makes the movie his own. Jack is dangerous he is now a maniac bent of killing his family. But he has a sense of humor about it. which makes it creepy.To me the part that keeps me up at night while thinking about it is only hinted at. When we are told Delbert Grady went crazy and killed his family with a ax. And stacked them neatly in one of the rooms of the west wing like cord wood. and then shoots himself. In the novel Grady kills himself long after his family he kills himself by shotgun because he has broken his leg falling down the stairs . To me the most horror filled moment is when you think about the little girls being killed by a ax. while one little girl looks on and sees her sister being killed by her father and knowing she is next. Does she run ? does she hide ? can you imagine the horror she must have felt knowing her sister was being chopped to pieces by their father and their mother was already dead. and she was next. That's the one point in the movie that gets me every time and with every viewing. That's how you know its a great movie. film making of the finest kind. And after seeing that and letting your imagination run wild with little scenes like the one I described . You can forgive Kubrick for his butchering King's novel because he did what he sets out to do. Telling King's story from a different view point. And scaring the daylights out of us . Its a great classic and deserves to be !",,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Got horror?,"This is considered one of the scariest movies in film history. I'm not completely sure why. Sure it is very cold and leaves the audience disoriented in many great shots, but what Kubrick film doesn't? Spartacus?Every time I have seen this film, I find more things I like and more things I hate. By the way, if you have read the Stephen King book, do not see this movie! If you have seen this movie, read the book! If you have done both already, you know what I'm talking about.I am an avid fan of Jack Nicholson and he does spit out some classic lines in this movie. "" Heeeeere's Johnny! "" (where on earth did that come from?) and "" All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. ""  I'm sure that was the mantra he chanted while working with the irritatingly perfectionist Stanley Kubrick.There's one thing of Jack's performance I didn't understand. Where did he go mad? One day he's joking with his wife and the next he's staring off into oblivion with cold, soulless eyes. Insanity needs some sort of explanation. It's funny how Kubrick can edit out scenes from Nicholson's growing cabin fever and leave in so many scenes of the dreadfully miscast Shelley Duvall and the unfortunately wasted Scatman Crothers doing virtually nothing.One member of the cast that does a wonderful job is Danny Lloyd as the moptop kid with a special gift. ""Reeeedruuum!"" He is used in the movie's scariest scenes, especially the one with the two little girls and room 237. Brrrr...What keeps this movie from evolving into a horror masterpiece is that it tries too hard to be epic with so many holes to fall into along the way. There are so many moments where the viewer needs an explanation, but Kubrick is too busy trying to make you feel cold and uneasy. I still don't know what he intended for the final shot. Maybe he wants you to read the Stephen King novel yourself.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Stanley Kubrick great job,"Director Stanley Kubrick. Well he did an excellent job with Jack Nicklson & Shelly DuVall.

It was filmed in the eighties and is still enjoyable by today's standards.The caretaker who went on vacation was good he was able to ""shine"" with the little boy.

The Shining is a masterpiece,"This film is undoubtedly one of the greatest horror movies of all time. Let me start by explaining why I think so. First, the storyline is incredibly well-crafted. With Kubrick's masterful direction, this truly stands as a cinematic masterpiece. The film doesn't just focus on horror elements but also delves into human psychology and social critique, delivering themes that were far ahead of their time and remain relevant even today.As for the production process, it's no secret that it was notoriously challenging. The infamous tales of a single scene being shot 500 times speak volumes about Kubrick's perfectionism and the passion he poured into this film. If someone tried to make a movie like this today, the director would likely face significant obstacles.Moreover, the film portrays chaos and madness so effectively that it offers an experience that mesmerizes, overwhelms, and provokes deep thought. The set design, use of music, and cinematography all contribute to the film's gripping atmosphere. Jack Nicholson's unforgettable performance, in particular, elevates this movie into a true work of art.The Shining is more than just a horror story; it's a psychological thriller and a journey into the dark corners of the human mind. If you haven't seen this film yet, you absolutely must. Kubrick's perfectionism and vision have made this not just a horror classic but a cornerstone of cinema history.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
a movie that will always stay in my mind,"Countless reviews have been written on The Shining and I don't feel that there's much I could add to that. Only that:1) Personally I found the cast (with exception to Danny Lloyd) and their acting horrible (watch how the actors make gaps after each line, as if they were high-school students on a school play) but the cinematography ABSOLUTELY BREATHTAKING!2) Kubrick displays his genius from the first second of the film, with the wide-angle views of the road to the hotel and all the following sets and direction in general.3)The scene in which Wendy (Shelley Duvall) sees the typewriter and what Jack (Jack Nicholson) has been working on, is to me the most amazing, revealing, shocking, blood-freezing scene of all films, of all times.4) The way in which Jack loses his mind is presented very believably and naturally, that it really makes you feel fear in it's raw, primal form.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"

2) The score does a great job of ratcheting up the suspense
3) The production design of the Overlook Hotel is fantastically iconic
4) There are multiple tracking shots in the film that are filmed perfectly
5) If you go into the film expecting a psychological thriller, you will get everything that you came forNEGATIVES:1) Some of Jack's spiral into madness is inconsistent and sudden at times
2) While almost everything inside the Overlook Hotel is brilliant, the film loses its way in the scenes that are outside the Hotel. This is because horror films work best when you feel trapped and claustrophobic, the film loses these feelings whenever it shows the sunny mountains or any of the subplot with the Head Chef
3) If you go into the film expecting a horror film, you may be a bit disappointed because, while the film is definitely creepy and unnerving, at no point was I horrified or scared",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"

"Jack pulling faces,  Shelly acting scared - then the weird science bit.","I have a grand overall theory about music and film. Much popular music is the kind of music you can easily ignore because most people that buy music never listen to it in isolation. It is background noise. Easy listening - more like not really listening.Growing up the biggest selling LP was Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells. This was for me the perfect example, they even used it on the soundtrack of the Exorcist. You could even watch a feature film while it was playing!In the same vein most blockbusters are not really proper films at all. Merely novelty rides or one trick ponies. Star Wars (video game), Jaws (man eating rubber shark), Superman (man that can fly) and Psycho (confidence trick) are four that I can throw up without thinking.Nothing wrong with them - all well worth one sitting - what bugs me is that people think they can convert them in to art simply by throwing a lot of long words at them. They are fast food for the brain. You enjoy and move on - unless you are being paid to make them more than they really are!Here is another perfect example of the thrill ride format. Nothing really happens that doesn't happen in a horror B, but it has one or two image ideas that it pulls off. But overall it is just a short ghost train ride in the snow.Kubrick was a very rude man making this film. Indeed he showed himself to be a total pig. Treating Nicholson with only the greatest respect and dignity; while being utterly rude and ignorant to Duvall (Nicholson confirms this) to the point where she often broke down in to tears.(The little boy was protected by minders from the perfectionist.)Whether this was to help her performance I don't know - but I know that whether you are a star actor or tossing burgers at the local greasy spoon no one has the right to tear strips off you when you are trying your best.Kubrick might well have been a genius - although this is not the best evidence - but as a human being he left a lot to be desired. We might not see his like again, but at least future film sets will not fall foul of the Geneva Convention on Human Rights.As regards the film, watch and forget - although it might turn up in a few nightmares.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Outstanding film!,"Horror movies do not usually have a very complex story line. Movies like Halloween or Friday the 13th, usually have a simple story line of somebody going around murdering people, and there is not much else to the story besides that. Stanley Kubrick's, The Shining, is a horror movie because it can be scary at times, but it is not your everyday horror. The Shining is more of a suspense thriller, as it takes the viewer through the evolving mental illness of the main character, Jack Torrance.Stanley Kubrick's, The Shining takes place in the 1970's, at the luxurious Overlook Hotel that is being closed for the winter. Jack Torrance, the father of Danny Torrance and husband of Wendy Torrance, goes to apply as the winter caretaker of the Overlook Hotel in search of a job after recently quitting his previous job as a teacher. After getting the job as caretaker and living at the hotel for about 5 months, Jack soon grows discordant with his family. He becomes mentally ill and suffers from a serious mental breakdown; causing him to go insane.Overall, the story line of The Shining is very interesting. The film is not only compelling, but it is also very realistic; apart from all of the paranormal and supernatural activity that goes on in the hotel. The story is mostly clear and thorough, but can be confusing sometimes. A lot of the story is told through Jack's point of view, so that the viewer can have a sense of his constant crescendo of insanity. The film focuses on various ways a family can be torn apart by things such as addiction and abuse; which makes it so realistic.The actors chosen for this film were amazing! Jack Nicholson's portrayal of Jack Torrance was flawless. Everything about his performance was amazing. The psychotic tone and the way he moved really brought the psycho side of Jack Torrance to life. The setting of the Overlook Hotel is pretty typical for a horror movie. The interior alone makes it spooky, and then with the addition of monsters, spirits, mysteries, and it being the site of several murders, gives it the horror feel. The music score collaborates nicely to intensify the eerie feel of the movie. The Shining has such good camera work that always leaves the viewer questioning what is going to happen next. The scenery was well crafted and really emphasizes the madness of the film and for how old the movie is, the special effects crew did an outstanding job, even though they did not have CGI the way there is today.Overall, Stanley Kubrick's, The Shining, is a captivating film that will jostle the viewer's emotions and nerves. The Shining is a suspense thriller that takes the viewer through the realistic struggle of mental illness and the effects of abuse and addiction.

"Consider it as a standalone horror film and it's terrific.

As a film adaptation of The Shining book by Stephen King, it fails. However, I understand it was likely not Kubrick's intention to create a film that fired on all cylinders to capture the book's exact plot and character development and motivation page-by-page (so thankful though there's a '90s TV miniseries which excellently delivers on everything including performances too!).Kubrick has created a film very, very, VERY loosely based from King's book.

Horror MASTERPIECE!!!!!,"The Shining is a 1980 English-American psychological horror film produced and directed by Stanley Kubrick, co-written with novelist Diane Johnson, and starring Jack Nicholson, Shelley Duvall, Danny Lloyd, and Scatman Crothers. The film is based on Stephen King's 1977 novel of the same name, though there are significant changes.[4]In the film, Jack Torrance, a writer and recovering alcoholic, takes a job as an off-season caretaker at an isolated hotel called the Overlook Hotel. His young son possesses psychic abilities and is able to see things from the past and future, such as the ghosts who inhabit the hotel.

Best King adaption ever!!!,"Kubrick nails it again with this adaption of Stephen King's boring novel. King is a great idea man, but his writing style is a bit droll. Luckily Kubrick took the best elements and made it his own. The Shining is a horror masterpiece, right up there with John Carpenter's The Thing and Nightmare on Elm Street. The music and cinematography are hypnotizing and Jack's performance is a tour de force. There is few horror films that feel this epic. It's a classic in the truest sense if the word. It's gotten better over time and the creep factor remains strong. I try and watch this every Halloween (along with the movie Halloween).

Probably the best horror film ever made.,"Visually stunning, with a degree of eeriness only Kubrick and very few others could have achieved; some of the scenes are unsurpassed in this respect. Ghost stories are notoriously unscary, so hats off to Kubrick for making all the right choices to elevate this trite genre to very lofty heights.The cinematography is immaculate. Kubrick even makes the toilet look good. OK, bathroom... whatever.Nicholson is incredible and provides much of the entertainment. What he did here isn't overacting: it's precisely what the film and story required. (He has been criticized for his performance here by a small and very clueless group of detractors - who probably consider Rob Zombie the greatest ever film-maker.) After all, he is going insane, right? Should this kind of psycho-lunacy be underplayed? Just as with ""A Clockwork Orange"", Kubrick picked literally THE best actor for the job. Both movies heavily relied on the main-character casting for the movies to reach their full potential.Shelley Duvall is excellent, too, and well-cast. The poor thing really struggled during the filming; Kubrick was merciless toward her. Considering the shoot lasted a whopping 11 months, this is no minor thing.I can't believe they re-did this though; what's the point? Re-doing TS is like sending 23 year-old Helen Mirren to a plastic surgeon and breast-implants doctor. What's there to improve?That vastly overrated bumpkin Stephen King always hated the fact that Kubrick had his flawed original story heavily re-written, and he despised Kubrick for it. The ego on that man! ""How dare he re-write MY words??? They are MY words, the great Stephen King! Blasphemy!"" (This is how I picture an egomaniac hack writer reacting to someone ""messing"" with his garbage.)Stevie should be forever flattered that the best director of all time decided to pick up one of his crummy books and make a movie out of it. In fact, this guy had actually dared to publicly criticized Kubrick's adaptation of his irrelevant little novelette, thereby exposing his ignorance to all. Stephen King criticizing Kubrick is like a guy in a wheelchair criticizing his boxing coach for not making him the WBA heavy-weight champion of the world (with the difference that Kubrick made something great out of ""Shining""). King criticizing Kubrick is like an eight year-old Flat Earth Society member telling Einstein that his theories are stupid. King criticizing Kubrick is like Michael Moore criticizing old BBC nature documentaries for being unrealistic and staged. King criticizing Kubrick is one of the biggest jokes in the history of mankind. If you still want to watch the remake, your problem. There are great Youtube clips mocking it: I recommend those instead.Excellent soundtrack, similar to that of ""2001"". I wouldn't listen to it separate from the movie though...I strongly suggest you find the 140-minute version.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
"Yes it is a classic, but so is also the book...","I suppose I'll join the group of people who've read the book before seeing the film and who's a great of Stephen King's novels, so I suppose you may get a hint of where I'm heading. ""The Shining"" as a book is a masterpiece, probably the best King novel out there one can get if you would ask me. The film however suffers from, as more or less all films based on novels do, a lot of ""keys"" that I think is really important for the whole plot. I won't give any spoilers here, but Mr. Kubrick, whose works I adore, gives his own interpretation of the novel and he has a few tricks in his pocket for you here in case you believe that you've read the book and that'll leave you out of surprises - well you're wrong. Jack Nicholson (Jack Torrance in the film) makes a crazy performance here and if anyone should be closed within rubber walls, he's the person for it. He makes his role perfect and he succeeds in spreading psychotic vibes. I'd really like to make this a bit of critical spoiler, but I won't, so I sum things up with that I recommend reading the book before seeing the film. Yes, the film is a classic and I like it for sure, but so is also the book who I love.

A fascinating movie about a man's descent into complete madness.,"Although it is sometimes considered to be a movie about a haunted hotel; I believe it to be a documentation of the descent of a man and his family into madness. In this it differs from the Steven King novel from which it takes the name, the characters, and the location. Although this has offended many King fans, I, for one, love both, though for different reasons.If you love the book, keep an open mind; it's a tale of madness, not haunting, but it's still quite scary, and incredibly intense.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
I love it!,"The movie follows Jack Torrance, a writer and former alcoholic, who takes a job as a caretaker at the Overlook Lodge in Colorado with his wife Wendy and son Danny. As Jack struggles with his writing, he becomes increasingly unstable and is plagued by hallucinations of the hotel's previous inhabitants. Danny, who has psychic abilities, can sense the presence of ghosts in the hotel and turns to the caretaker, Hallorann, for help as his father falls deeper into madness.Jack Nicholson delivers a powerful performance as Torrance, portraying a man who has lost touch with reality and is beyond redemption. While Shelley Duvall's portrayal of Wendy may seem exaggerated at times, it effectively conveys the distress of a wife trapped in her husband's descent into insanity.The film's atmosphere is a standout feature, with the Overlook Lodge depicted as cold and eerie, surrounded by isolated mountains. The cinematography is remarkable, showcasing bizarre and often horrifying imagery, such as the iconic elevator scene. The soundtrack composed by Wendy Carlos further enhances the film's mood, with the opening theme setting an ominous tone.While Stephen King initially disapproved of the adaptation, The Shining remains a triumph in the horror genre and is considered a Kubrick classic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"

A Chilling Masterpiece of Horror,"This film is a haunting and visually stunning experience that redefines the horror genre. Directed by Stanley Kubrick, it follows Jack Nicholson as he descends into madness while isolated in an eerie hotel with his family. Nicholson's performance is iconic, capturing the character's transformation from a loving father to a terrifying figure.The atmosphere is incredibly unsettling, with the Overlook Hotel serving as a character in itself. The cinematography is breathtaking, using wide shots and striking colors to create a sense of isolation and dread. Kubrick's attention to detail and pacing build a slow-burning tension that keeps you on the edge of your seat.The story explores themes of insanity, isolation, and the impact of past traumas, making it more than just a simple horror movie. While some parts may feel drawn out, they contribute to the overall sense of dread. The imagery is unforgettable, and certain scenes have become legendary in horror history.Overall, this is a chilling and masterful film that leaves a lasting impression. It's a must-watch for any horror fan who appreciates a blend of psychological terror and visual artistry.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Idiots,"I can't believe some of you people on here are saying this is a bad movie because it doesn't copy the book. Any fool could copy a book and turn it into a movie. At least Kubrick had the bottle to change it and make it 'more accesible' to the typical movie goer. As opposed to some 16hour epic that just goes on and on and on like alot of the 'made for tv' adaptions. The Shining is a terrifying and well acted movie. Ok, granted Jack Nicholson looks insane before he goes insane. But thats cause he is insane. Anyway, stop slating a film that dares to deviate from its original source.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"

But in ""the shining"" it was the whole movie, whole movie was based on eyes, Kubrick really said with that film: ""eyes are the mirror of the soul"". It was genius to represent different, million kinds of emotions, feelings in one gaze...Fear, terror, madness, love... I was terrified with it..

Another Kubrick work that I find polarizing.,"I think it's a stretch to say that ""The Shining"" is one of the greatest works of all time, but it's also presumptuous to label it as mediocre.The portrayal of Jack is magnificent, his gradual descent into madness feels like a subtle exploration of insanity. You feel unease from the very first scene he appears in, scenes that are masterfully raw. I know it's a film based on Stephen King's book, but the supernatural elements didn't captivate me as much; I'm much more drawn to Jack and Wendy's acting and development than all those supernatural elements surrounding the hotel.But regardless, even with those elements, it's still well-executed. Excessively slow? Perhaps.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Crushing disappointment,"I had read Stephen King's ""The Shining"" once previously, in high school, before picking it up from the library last week and giving it another go. I didn't remember much about it, and oddly was more familiar with the film thanks to pop culture than I was with the book, having all but forgotten that I even read it. As over-written and even melodramatic as King's novel is, it is a genuinely intelligent, viscerally creepy (thanks to some stunningly effective psycho-sexual imagery, mainly), meditation on a family falling apart, a man's descent into madness and his battle with alcoholism, and it also develops the Overlook Hotel as a menacing entity all on its own, another character in the novel, if you will. By taking the time to develop genuine characters and a genuinely creepy setting, it ends up being a very rewarding experience. It's also written with real passion; Jack Torrance in the novel was autobiographical, as King was struggling to contain his alcohol addiction and angry outbursts at his family.However, I am not keen on faithfulness in adapting literature, not when it's done for the sake of being faithful anyway, so I was actually fairly excited to see what Stanley Kubrick, an artist who is better at his craft than King is at his (although I will always defend King as a genuinely talented author), would come up with, and excited to finally see a film I had heard so much about but never actually sat down and watched. Kubrick is a great artist and you have to respect his approach to most things because he makes them his own and usually makes them very worthwhile.Sadly, while I can't call ""The Shining"" a bad film, because it is quite entertaining (although at least 70% of the time for all the wrong reasons), and is an absolute marvel on a technical, visual level, and boasts a better finale (well, before the idiotic final shot anyway) than the novel's, it is disappointingly empty for a Kubrick film, and beyond just that doesn't even deliver on its own terms as a horror thriller. The phenomenal cinematography and camera work, as well as the typically (for a Kubrick film) excellent design make the film very atmospheric, but all the 'scary' bits, hyped by fans of the film as some of the finest moments in film history, are really absolutely nothing more than just more 'jump' moments, typical of most horror movies ever made. There's no psychology at work here, just cheap, boring, silly jump moments. The only jump moment in the film that actually is sort of effective is one which employs a bit of unsettling psycho-sexual imagery, but it's fleeting and uses a character who was used to far more disturbing effect in the novel. There is no need for workmanlike faithfulness when adapting a story for the screen, but if you have something that already provides unsettling imagery which is based on some very basic human fears and paranoias common to a lot of us, why on earth replace it with silly nonsense?The script is an absolute disaster, outside of some good dialogue. The characters are not used as effective archetypes, they are mere caricatures. Jack Torrance is, before he goes after everyone with an axe, just a damned prick. Wendy is one of the most annoying 'characters' in film history, characterized as a timid, whiny brat, although that also has a lot to do with Shelley Duvall's truly unbearable 'acting'. The kid, Danny, is just an obnoxious brat, and the actor they picked to play him is beyond abysmal. Moreover, there is the utterly retarded decision to have Tony live in his mouth (in his mouth!), and have the blasted kid go on and on in a silly voice, pointing at his mouth while doing so. Was him going on repeating 'redrum' supposed to be frightening? Egad! Nicholson is forced by the script to play a one-dimensional caricature even early in the film, and does a half-decent job, but when he does go nuts and starts chasing everybody it's a phenomenally mad, over-the-top performance and truly enjoyable and iconic, and immediately improves the film's entertainment value, if not its artistic value. The last half hour or so, bar the final shot, is startlingly effective following the unintentional hilarity of most of what had just passed.I'd love to at least say that ""The Shining"" was well-directed, but I'm afraid that even that praise can't extend beyond the visuals. I have immense respect for Stanley Kubrick, but he is partly responsible for Duvall's performance and for the kid's performance. His work as writer is what is truly disappointing however, as his additions and subtractions from the original work make no sense at all. You should go into a Kubrick film, specifically an adaptation of a literary work, expecting it to be quite different to the work being adapted. I really did expect something different to King's novel. I did, however, expect Kubrick to do something with the material that didn't ultimately amount to completely dumbing it down for the masses, especially not when the work he's adapting is populist enough as it is!The problem with this film isn't that it doesn't work as an adaptation (as many King fans say), but that it doesn't even work on its own terms. There's no tension here, no menace, because there's no development of anything at all. Jack's already mad when he arrives, 'the shining' itself is barely even mentioned, and the Overlook isn't developed or anything of the sort- it's just there, and it's only creepy because every so often Kubrick has the brilliant, never-before-thought-of idea to have something pop up and then disappear. A technically excellent film, but the script and performances ruin it. The hedge maze is lovely though, and the chase which occurs there is spectacular.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Watch it again....,"..... and you'll see one glaring fault. Jack Nicholson is insane before he even starts the job. He's an arsehole in the car heading to the Overlook! So no. Forget the visuals, the movie doesn't work for me. I loved this film when I first watched it, even after reading the book.... But then I read the book again... And again.... And I realised this is the decent of a sane, if struggling, man into the abyss. The film shows none of this, Jack is doing his eyebrow thing from the start. Kubrick is a genius but he has missed the point here, this should be the unravelling of a basically good man, but the Jack Nicholson character is bad from the start.

Oh yeah, Scatman Crothers would be the guy I'd want to rescue me from a remote haunted hotel with a mad killer roaming around the place. Pitiful. And the comment about the hidden ""Native American"" theme here really takes the cake. Is that the last bullet in you robotic Kubrick worshipper's gun?

The Hotel And The Cinematography!,"Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining"" stands out for its exceptional cinematography, which plays a crucial role in creating the film's eerie atmosphere. John Alcott, the director of photography, uses innovative techniques to immerse viewers in a world of psychological tension.The film opens with breathtaking aerial shots that set an ominous tone, showcasing the isolation of the Torrance family as they approach the Overlook Hotel. This use of wide, sweeping shots establishes a sense of vulnerability and foreboding right from the start.Inside the hotel, the use of the Steadicam is revolutionary. The smooth, continuous tracking shots, especially those following Danny on his tricycle, create a sense of unease and disorientation. This technique pulls the audience into the hotel's maze-like corridors, amplifying the feeling of being trapped in a supernatural labyrinth.Kubrick's framing is precise and deliberate, often employing symmetry to create an unsettling visual experience. Characters are frequently centered within vast, imposing spaces, highlighting the oppressive nature of the hotel. This meticulous composition contrasts with the unfolding psychological chaos, enhancing the film's tension.Lighting is expertly used to heighten the sense of dread. The interplay between natural and artificial light creates dramatic contrasts and shadows, adding depth to the film's ominous mood. Iconic scenes, such as the torrent of blood from the elevator, are visually striking, utilizing bold colors and surreal imagery to leave a lasting impression.Overall, the cinematography in ""The Shining"" transforms the Overlook Hotel into a haunting presence. Through careful visual techniques, Kubrick and Alcott craft a chilling atmosphere that elevates the psychological horror, making the film a captivating and enduring piece of cinema.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"

*Slams thru door* Here's my review !,"Judging by the title you can say I am a lame guy but you know what is NOT lame ? The Shining 1980
I just had the opportunity to watch it for the first time in my life. Right away I can tell you that this movie truly stands the test of time !It is a suspensful movie that keeps you on the edge the whole time and the backround music just adds even more to that. I swear , sometimes , the music is scarier than the actual scene.Jack Nicholson absolutely steals the show with his performance here. He can just make that creepy look that gives me chills.I honestly feel sorry for Shelley Duvall for having to do so many takes of one scene ( 124 takes I believe ) The performance was absolute masterpiece but it was still brutal. Even the kid did a pretty decent job so overall the acting is satisfying.I also appreciate the fact that everyone is quite smart in this movie. That really makes it stand out from the crappy horror movies we have today so this one did feel like a refreshing watch.Camera work and little details that I tend to pick up made this movie an enjoyable watch. However I can't say that it was all flawless.I don't agree that this is ""The scariest horror movie"" or even in the top 20. The movie is overall creepy and sometimes scary but everything else is just overrating the movie.I like how everything was made , I appreciate Kubricks vision and camera works. The acting and plot made this movie suspensfull enough for me but in my opinion I am probably not gonna rewatch this movie a lot.PlatinumanYT 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Legendary...,"The Shining is a movie im glad to say is in my top 10 movies of all time, and has a place in my heart. A marvelous feat from the legendary Stanley Kubrick, the movie stars Jack Nicholson as the infamous Jack Torrance along with Shelley Duvall as Wendy Torrance and Danny Lloyd as Danny Torrance. The family of 3 head up to Overlook Hotel as Jack Torrance becomes the winter caretaker of the hotel. He hopes to cure his writer's block by taking a break with his family. Danny Torrance (Lloyd). Danny is gifted with ""the shining"", psychic abilities that enable him to see into the hotel's horrific past. After a winter storm leaves the Torrances snowbound, Jack's sanity deteriorates due to the influence of the supernatural forces that inhabit the hotel..The scenery of this film to begin with, captures a ghastly atmosphere, making a link back to it's supernatural, unsettling themes. It's rich and exquisite undertones of the devil, accentuate the ghostliness ambience which this film creates. Stanley Kubrick's use of his trademark symmetrical shot in the famous hallway scene, was another way he pulled in the viewers through the uneasiness he creates, letting it speak for the greatness of his direction.Last but not least, one of my top favourite performances of all time include Jack Nicholson as Jack Torrance in The Shining. His phenomenal, groundbreaking performance speaks volumes of the praise he deserves for his acting ability. His disturbing yet exhausting perfomance in this, is something to soak in for the ages. The line between oddly hilarious yet irritable is something extremely few actors can pull off, Jack Nicholson pulling it off flawlessly in this occasion. Not to forget Shelley Duvall's remarkable, distinguished performance as Wendy Torrance. Unfortunately, she did endure some mental damage during the filming of this movie, but she did indeed give one of the most exceptional performances as the mother who was vexatious after the wellbeing of her child. In cinema history, we have no one but her to thank for that. Danny Lloyd giving one of the most iconic child performances in this was pure brilliance too. Scatman Crothers is another we shall never forget. From all this, we can derive that Stanley Kubrick's magnum opus, is something which will be agonizingly hard to recreate for the rest of time...",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"

We must also recognize the good performance of the child, not any child at that age could act like that, and the performance of the woman seemed to me that it made her anguish, frustration, fear and despair well notice.In more than one moment I got to feel uncomfortable and terrified in certain scenes, that is something that should be highlighted because not any movie today would do it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"

Style over substance,"I watched The Shining for the first time almost 30 years ago. I had been a Steven King fan for a few years but I had not read the book. I wanted to see the movie without having been biased by the book as books tend to be much better than the movie. I had also been a fan of some of Kubrick's earlier works, especially A Clockwork Orange and Full Metal Jacket (not a big fan of 2001)As I watched the movie I often wondered if I had drifted off and missed out on key plot points. There were fantastic visuals, fantastic score and some good acting, but it felt uneven. Nicholson was a bit more than over the top, Duvall was horrible and Danny Lloyd, unconvincing. Scatman Crothers seemed only to be in the movie to build up to a shocking, jump-scare.The story lacked character development that could not be resolved with exposition. And no clear villain.A weird ending and the lack of any form of resolution left me wondering 'so what?I rated the story as a 6 out of 10 as it is a watchable movie, with excellent production value. It is just not, for me, the horror classic that so many others rave about. There are so many others that are much better.BTW I did later read the novel, and even with that information, I find that Kubrick's script was totally lacking in motivation, character development and comprehension.

This for me is an absolute cinematic masterpiece.,"The performances are just brilliant, but with the exception of Shelly Duvaull, while her performance as a caring mother is good, her mousy screams get very overacted, and tedious after a while. But Jack Nicholson was AMAZING in this film, his performance was strong, believable and terrifying. It is easily his best performance to date.Another equally amazing thing is, after all this time, is how well Kubrick used his actors, music and visuals to underscore the themes of the story itself. The technical details are prototypes in themselves, helping the story build massive tension; the long hallway shots, the eerie musical score, the use of words written backwards, the implication of a blizzard, and the tall, wide staircases establish a sense of uncertainty for both the audience and the individuals in the movie. Each of the characteristics are also evidence of the haunting craftsmanship-the photography of the hotel, for instance, creates a portrait of breathtaking beauty long before the breakdown of the characters' lucidity chars our attraction to it.This for me is an absolute cinematic masterpiece in horror, Kubrick's whole style here may not be for everyone (Stephen King himself hated what Kubrick did to his excellent Novel), but it works wonders for me, the music, the suspense, the cinematography, the overlook itself is a wonderfully isolated and creepy building whom no-one in their right mind would want to spend the winter months their amidst all the madness, some complain about the acting but for me it's not a problem, this is a horror film a bit of over the top and hammy is fine by me.This will be always hold a place in my heart, and will always be one of my all time favourite horrors, turn off the lights, and enjoy.10/10.

Kubrick's contribution to the horror genre.,"From the pen of one of the most prolific writers to the direction of one of the most obsessive perfectionist directors. Stephen King's imagination has inspired many movies and Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of The Shining' is the best that I have seen. Given the fact that many top directors have bought King's work to the big screen, we can thus see how good Kubrick really is. Kubrick has made many top class movies, but this one probably captured audience's imagination the most. It also became a signature role for Jack Nicholson, which is further indicative of the status of this movie.The soundtrack was not to inspire gross sales or to add greater revenue by way of soundtrack sales. It was utilised with one purpose in mind, and that was to significance to the story. The DVD edition includes the compositions in the chapter headings thus indicating how each particular composition was used to manipulate audience emotion and add value to the storyline. How do you portray the terror of the mind using the big screen? The ingenious use of camera shots and angles certainly helps and this was used. But overuse of this will underscore the effect the director is trying to create. It will translate to the audience as someone who is trying too hard and it becomes pretentious and this will be foremost in the audience's mind rather than the effect itself. Music has the benefit of creating the impression that some overbearing, ominous evil is present, but we cannot see it. This effect is used very well in the opening scene where Nicholson is travelling to the Overlook Hotel. An overhead shot is used with the car seemingly overpowered by the landscape and this is accompanied by a chilling opening number. Here the two are combined to enhance the overall effect. Nicholson is heading towards an enemy far stronger than him and a sense of impending doom is initiated for the audience.This is also used in the scene where Danny sees images of foreboding terror at the hotel. Excessive use of blood can be cheesy, but it's usage here has a definite part to play in moving the story forward. Danny picks up the image of terror that the hotels inhuman occupants have to show. This image is shown whenever Danny senses something terrible is about to occur, most notably in the scene where Nicholson confronts his wife after his experience in Room 237. The blood indicates the presence of the terrible beings at the Overlook Hotel and shows the true horror that they wish to impose. There is very little sound of gushing or none at all  just the use of dark sound which rises as the terror is shown thus excentuating the image of horror for the audience. Although a shocking image, it is not out of place and clearly delivers the message of the foreboding terror that is about to unfold.Kubrick has a firm understanding of how to visually translate the terror of the mind. His work can be compared to that of the well-known writer of the 18th century, Edgar Allan Poe. Poe had a great eye for detail and also used very little dialogue in his horror stories. He usually portrayed the story from the viewpoint of the himself thus creating reality for his stories. He described the inner workings of the mind when subjected to terror, sometimes terror self  imposed by the frailties of the main character's own mind. Kubrick has the same style, only he uses the big screen, which is sometimes more difficult when attempting to create this illusion. Kubrick made the necessary use of dialogue, but his mark was made by using other elements to project this effect. This is a complicated task to perform and one can well understand why he used Nicholson in the key role. Nicholson used his eyes to great effect with a little assistance from his devilish looking eyebrows. This is evident in the scene where he stares seemingly into nothing, but we can see the evil intent taking hold of him.There are no weaknesses as far as the performances are concerned. Nicholson is brilliant as the writer who already has problems with his wife from the start. We can see that this is a man who is impatient with her lack of intelligence and becomes less tolerant as the ghostly inhabitants increase their influence and guide him towards their diabolical objective. We can see that Nicholson relished the role of the demented axeman. He was able to fulfil his fantasy of wreaking havoc on society, which he does with boisterous aplomb. Duval is good as the wife who is gradually subjected to terror by Nicholson and it is the ghosts that finally decide to take control of the situation, revealing the full perverted horror that the hotel holds. Kubrick gave her a psychological drubbing in order to ensure that she looked unlikely to handle the situation. This may have been unpleasant for her, but it was essential to create a character that would seemingly falter against her husband and the ungodly spirits. Danny was superb. He showed maturity beyond his age as he was able to portray someone who had to deal with these images of terror. When Tony, his name for the power that his mind has, attempts to tell his mother through Danny that his father has escaped, he was able to keep his concentration throughout a long scene. This scene hung the suspense on a shoestring, which snapped when Nicholson starts to chop the door down. Working with children has it's own unique demands which were well met. Scatman added a lot considering his small role. He helped Danny deal with his images and the connection between the two offscreen oozes onto the screen.Without doubt this is one of the most prominent horror movies to date. Most satisfy a fast  food mentality whereby cheap thrills and abuse of special effects is evident. If these are the fast  food, then The Shining' is the escargot. It is in a class of it's own. To watch it once is to not experience the full effect of the movie. The sound of Danny's tricycle as it crosses the carpet onto the wooden floor and back again, the sense of isolation, the approach of the tennis ball and the terror within the eyes all take on a greater significance when viewed for a second time. These all helped to make evidence of the terror of the mind.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
"Pretty good, not to the caliber of top 250 though","I liked the shining, I just didn't agree that it was a perfect 10/10 horror film. Yes, Jack Nicholson was wonderful in the leading role, he just seemed like a normal father and husband. Shelley Duvall is good too, why she was nominated for a Razzie I will never know. She engaged very well with Nicholson and handled the intense scenes realistically. The writing works pretty well, especially the dialogue between Duvall and Nicholson, when his character begins to go mad and get violent, that's when the best acting and writing is. The filming and scenery is great, I loved the opening shots, and the eerie score makes it one hundred percent better. The music is great here, it has a very creepy/eerie feeling to it. Little Danny is great too, especially for the age he was when this was made. Kubrick is a masterful director and he does so well with this movie, he knows how to film it in just the right way to ensure a scary effect. The bathtub scene is one of the creepiest and best scene in the whole movie. The full frontal nudity was necessary for the scene, hardly ever is full frontal nudity in a movie, but it is for this one, when she turns into an old creepy deformed woman it has the perfect effect! And of course the CLASSIC here's Johnny scene is wonderfully done. From jacks mad as hell behavior to Shelley's wonderful scared out of her wits reaction. All in all an interesting film that's definitely worth a watch. A very thought provoking ending too, leaves the viewer with questions. Have to watch to find out what i mean ;). Yes, some of the scenes have a slight cheesiness to them, but that's my only complaint. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Psychological Horror at it's best,"This film is the best psychological horror film ever made in my opinion.Stanley Kubrick's directing is on pointe. (Though I don't agree with some of his methods.)
There are many secrets, easter eggs and metaphorical meaning to uncover, people are still finding stuff out about this film 40+ years on.All in all, this is an amazing film. Definitely deserving it's spot (currently) at 66th best film of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Shining but not luminous,"Supernatural mysteries take many forms.  Some are purely about the psychology of belief (for example, ""The Blair Witch Project""); some present ghosts as banal facts of everyday life (""Truly, Madly, Deeply"", and my own favourite, Kieslowski's ""No End""); some depict literal terror (""The Exorcist"") and some are just downright bizarre (""Twin Peaks"").  The Shining is a highly peculiar but nonetheless effective amalgam of all these genres. Even at the end, the viewer has little more idea what is going on than the characters.  I guess that's what makes its a mystery.The film is chiefly remembered for the collaboration of its legendary director and its equally legendary star.  Stanley Kubrick's mark is certainly clear, especially in the beginning: he shoots every scene as if something terrible is going to happen; then cuts away abruptly, the threat unresolved.  The scenes with the ghosts are shot so as to appear like bad cases of superimposition: the spirits are somehow in the same rooms at the living, and not, at the same time.  The tense score is intrusive but successful.Jack Nicolson gives a good performance in the central role, but without the subtlety seen in his greatest films (see him in Five Easy Pieces for a truly great portrayal of a misanthropist).  The other actors' performances are universally downright bad, in a possibly intentional parody of cheap horror films. The plot is likewise an assembly of corny, but beautifully executed, tricks.This is a seriously weird film, more imaginative than most in its genre but ultimately no less silly.  Make of it what you will.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
The best horror I've ever seen.,"And that's primarily thanks to the staggering acting of Jack Nicholson, who put in one of the top 10 best lead performances I've ever laid my eyes upon. It's literally the Jack Nicholson show for 2h 26m, and we're all just lucky to be witnessing it. Also, Stanley Kubrick's direction is unbelievably extraordinary. However it's such a pity to hear about his subhuman treatment of Shelley Duvall during filming. It doesn't dock my rating, but it is rather disappointing.Back to positives though, I was thoroughly impressed by Danny Lloyd's performance as Danny Torrance (the child), especially considering he didnt even know he was acting in a horror movie (as the crew had led him to believe they were shooting a drama film instead)! As for Shelley Duvall, I would say that her character wasn't written all that amazingly for this screenplay (which is actually part of the reason why Stephen King doesn't like this picture), but with saying that, I do think she managed to do the best she could, considering both this and the harsh treatment she suffered on set.Finally, despite the fact that this truly is the best horror flick I've watched, I found the ending quite bemusing, so much so that I honestly had to watch an 'Ending Explained' video just to get a grasp on it. Also, I found the climax just before it a little underwhelming, but in saying that, it did make sense to me once I'd understood the meaning behind the final shot. I guess what I'm trying to say is that Kubrick's execution of the closing 5 or 10 minutes was fairly flawed in my opinion.Overall, I was left speechless by this picture. It really is astonishing, and it's understandably a cult classic. 100% a must-watch before you die. 100%.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
More relevant now than ever,"When it comes to the socio-political allegory of this movie, if you know you know... and damn does it hit home right now.But I think what Kubrick does that so many others fail to do is maintain restraint and subtlty til the very end. Movies like this should be able to stand on their own without understanding the deeper meaning, and The Shining manages to do that extraordinarily well as a thriller.Nicholson's ability to unnerve with every word that hisses out of his mouth and every expression and movement is chillingly good.Beware of letting the western man be isolated with his guilt, for when he loses his sense of purpose of identity or purpose as a man and a father, he will be seduced by the devilishly warm acceptance of older more archaic purposes that call him to do terrible things to the people he once called kin.He will be called to protect ""Overlook"" from those ""outsiders"" who would seek to usurp him of his ""duty"" to it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"

For The people who have also read the book, you guys don't realize what have happened behind the scenes. And the behind scenes footage looked like a mess, seeing Kubrick writing the Script, or rewriting it, but it still turned out to be a great movie. Also for the book of 497 pages, with too much detail, you cannot fit that in with 2 Hours and 26 minutes, or even more than that, there'd have to be lots of cutting out and editing in the process.

All Work and No Play,"The Shining is a timeless horror masterpiece that redefines psychological terror and stands as one of the most iconic films in cinematic history. Directed by Stanley Kubrick and loosely adapted from Stephen King's novel, it masterfully blends supernatural horror with an unsettling exploration of the human psyche. The film's lasting impact on both the horror genre and popular culture is a testament to its brilliance and enduring appeal.Jack Nicholson delivers a career-defining performance as Jack Torrance, a man whose descent into madness is as terrifying as it is captivating. His portrayal captures the gradual unraveling of Jack's sanity with an intensity that lingers in the mind long after the credits roll. Iconic moments, such as his chilling delivery of ""Here's Johnny!"" have become embedded in pop culture, cementing his place among the most memorable villains in film history. Shelley Duvall's portrayal of Wendy Torrance is equally powerful, embodying raw vulnerability and unrelenting fear. Her performance adds a layer of emotional authenticity, making the audience feel every ounce of her terror and desperation.Kubrick's direction is a masterclass in atmosphere and precision. The Overlook Hotel is brought to life as a character in its own right, its vast, ominous halls and labyrinthine design steeped in foreboding. The meticulously crafted visuals, from the hypnotic tracking shots to the eerily symmetrical compositions, immerse the viewer in a world of relentless tension. The sound design, featuring Wendy Carlos and Rachel Elkind's haunting score, and the strategic use of unsettling silences, further amplifies the sense of dread.What sets The Shining apart is its layered storytelling and deliberate ambiguity. By blurring the lines between reality and the supernatural, the film invites endless interpretations and discussions. Its psychological depth and cryptic symbolism challenge viewers to look beyond the surface scares, making it as intellectually engaging as it is terrifying.At its core, The Shining is an exploration of isolation, madness, and the darker recesses of the human mind. The themes of familial breakdown, addiction, and repressed trauma resonate deeply, adding emotional weight to the chilling narrative. Kubrick's ability to weave these elements into a cohesive and unsettling whole ensures that the film remains a cornerstone of the horror genre.In conclusion, The Shining earns its place as one of the greatest films ever made, transcending the boundaries of horror to become a cultural and cinematic landmark. Its impeccable direction, unforgettable performances, and chilling atmosphere ensure its legacy as a film that continues to haunt and fascinate audiences. It is a masterpiece that demands repeated viewings, each one uncovering new layers of meaning and intrigue.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
I'm In the Minority,"I read the book and loved it, but never really cared for the movie. I know Stephen King complained that the Jack Torrance character went from normal husband/dad to psychopath seemingly with the flip of a switch. Character development was definitely lacking. I also found Danny's invisible finger pal intensely annoying, some things just don't transfer well to the screen. Sure there were jump scares and the atmosphere Kubrick created was superb, but all-in-all, The Shining left me cold (sorry).",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Stylish and Hilarious but not scary,"A very visually compelling little ghost story (with a lot more to it than ghosts) with oodles of bizarre imagery to illustrate what is essentially a decent into madness but there's way more to it than that as you will find in the layers of meaning that have spawned a thousand fan theories. However, it happens that it is so over the top that any attempt at being genuinely chilling falls on its face but it's still quite a ride as it slowly builds atmosphere and then delivers.The sensation of isolation yet with a little world of memories to explore is the lasting impression in what really ought to have been a PC game if the flavour had been conceived two decades later.I wonder if Jack Nicholson was miscast. His vivid, bestial father stands apart from other examples of the character type by the comical twist but does kind of change the tone of the movie.Not exactly very sensical the first time round but then again it isn't supposed to be. Definitely worth a view just for the experience but as a horror movie it doesn't quite work.Probably its makers best movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Good film! Butis it really worth the status of `Horror Classic'??,"Stanley Kubrick's the Shining is a powerful cinema experience and a fine adaptation of Stephen King's novel, but I think the high status it enjoys is rather questionable. Too easily this film is labeled as the `scariest' horror film ever and many of the sequences are a bit overblown, if you ask me. Recently some website published the hundred scariest movie moments and multiple parts of the Shining positioned high in this list. True, legendary sequences like Jack Nicholson screaming `Heeeeeeeeere's Johnny!' and the little boy approaching room 237 on his tricycle look impressive when seen separate, but when you watch this film as a wholesome (like the way it was intended, naturally) it loses some of its power. I think Stanley Kubrick himself is to blame for this. Often during the Shining, he undercuts the tension himself by showing repetitive images and underdeveloped ideas. The cause of Jack Torrance's madness isn't explained like it should be and comes a bit sudden (in case you're not familiar with the plot: Jack Nicholson's character suffers from a writer's block and accepted a job as caretaker in a famous Colorado hotel, during the dead-of-winter. Along with his wife and son, he spends the winter up there while the isolation and impact of previous drama's that took place there slowly cause Jack to go insane and threat his family with an axe). Not a bad word about Stanley Kubrick and his (almost) flawless career, but I feel he's to blame for the partially missed opportunity that is The Shining. All the other necessary elements to create a horror milestone are there. The setting is uniquely isolated and perfect for the story. The cinematography (by John Alcott, who previously worked with Kubrick for Barry Lyndon and A clockwork Orange) simply is outstanding and the acting is GREAT! That surely has to be said: Jack Nicholson gives one of his most amazing performances of his already brilliant career. Really, Jack's facial expressions often make you wonder whether he isn't the reincarnation of the devil himself! Especially in The Shining, he's the kind of guy you don't want to mess with! Good film and certainly recommended butthink twice before ranking it as `essential'",4.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"

Textbook tension and suspense. Enjoy.,"Honestly, one of the best in the genre.While not a short movie by any means, The Shining is constantly building tension and world building around the Torrance family and the Hotel they're secluded in.The movie is filmed beautifully whether it's capturing moments of shock and using camera effects to convey emotion or when they're filming otherworldly scenes that would not be captured in reality.The movie builds layers taking the audience on a journey of interpretation of what they're watching. Something that truthfully I have yet to fully interpret myself.All in all, I think this movie is a masterpiece and a must watch for everyone whether you're a fan of Horror & Thrillers or not.

shock horror I like a horror.,"The Shining (1980) Stanley Kubrick director, Stephen King book.Shock horror at 60 years of age I actually like a horror film, which is surprising as I've never been a fan of horror films or their genre, but this is something else.I've never seen this movie before but I was amazed how much of it I have seen in various documentaries previously, probably about 75% , that said it still shocks.From the opening shots of Jack Torrance driving to the Overlook Hotel there is a build up of tension, Wendy Carlos synth driven score helps with this immensely.. The three principle leads Jack Nicholson, Shelly Duvall and the great and never to be seen again Danny Lloyd are breath-taking and a special mention for Scatman Crothers, who i know from numerous westerns. Overall the slow pace and slow unravelling of Jack's mind are what gives you the willies.

A Haunting Masterpiece,"Experiencing ""The Shining"" for the first time was like stepping into a haunting dream that lingered long after the credits rolled. From the moment the iconic opening credits began, accompanied by the eerie score, I felt an unsettling tension that only grew as the film progressed.Jack Nicholson's portrayal of Jack Torrance is nothing short of mesmerizing. His transformation from a hopeful writer to a man consumed by madness is chilling. There's a raw intensity in his performance that made me feel both sympathy and horror; it's a delicate balance that few actors can achieve. Shelley Duvall, too, delivers a heart-wrenching performance as Wendy, embodying the terror and desperation of a mother trying to protect her child from the abyss that her husband is falling into.The Overlook Hotel itself is a character in its own right. Its vast, empty hallways and the oppressive silence create a sense of isolation that is palpable. I found myself holding my breath during the scenes where Danny rides his tricycle through the corridors; the sound of the wheels echoing against the floorboards was both mesmerizing and foreboding. The cinematography is stunning, with each frame meticulously crafted to evoke a sense of dread and unease.What struck me most was the film's exploration of psychological horror. It delves deep into the human psyche, questioning the nature of madness and the thin line between sanity and insanity. As Jack descends further into his own madness, I felt a creeping sense of dread, as if I were witnessing the unraveling of a mind right before my eyes. The film's ability to evoke such strong emotions is a testament to Stanley Kubrick's genius as a director.The infamous scenes, like the blood pouring from the elevator and the haunting presence of the twin girls, are etched in my memory. They serve as reminders of the film's ability to tap into our deepest fears-the fear of the unknown, the fear of losing control, and the fear of what lies within ourselves.Even after all these years, ""The Shining"" remains a masterclass in horror filmmaking. It's a film that demands to be experienced, not just watched. It's a haunting journey into the depths of madness that leaves you questioning your own reality long after the final scene. I can confidently say that this film has earned its place as a timeless classic, and I am grateful to have finally witnessed its brilliance.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"

Dark and creepy but not scary as some say,"For many horror fans and filmmakers especially, site director Stanley Kubrick as a part of their inspiration to make movies. Kubrick had a reputation for being a director with a unique vision. Many of his films had aesthetically pleasing visuals and shots that were hard to find amateurish. He was after all a photographer before a filmmaker, which helped give him that edge. When it came to stories, another person who was constantly sought after to get permission for their works was Stephen King. Although King was not in the Hollywood business full time as other people, what he did provide were foundations to creating new horror films. Since its release, Kubrick's interpretation of Stephen King's The Shining text was widely praised for how intense the viewing experience was. Since then, much of the crew members have surfaced and spoke about the film and the level of involvement Kubrick demanded. Oddly enough, King wasn't that impressed with it. Believe it or not, King might be right.Adapted by Kubrick and Diane Johnson (in her first and only screenplay), the story is about writer Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) looking to find a place of seclusion to finish his project. He ends up finding an opening position as the caretaker of the Overlook Hotel. Finding it worthy of his goal, Torrance brings his wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and son Danny (Danny Lloyd) to live with him from the fall to the summer of next year. Little do they realize that the hotel harbors an ominous spirit that has connections to a horrific past. As an overall story, the execution is very well done. However there are certain elements that if omitted, would not have impacted the experience in a negative way. Danny has a psychic ability where one can see events from the past and future. This talent is called ""shining"". This is only revealed to Danny and the audience when Dick Halloran (Scatman Crothers) concedes that he can do it too. What isn't mentioned is how on earth anybody knows what ""shining"" is.How does one contract such a power? Is it through genetics or by other entities that be? The other big hole in the story is the lack of explanation for certain key events. How is a viewer supposed to understand what Kubrick's message is? It doesn't make any sense and it's sometimes sillier than it is disturbing. Everything else about the production on a written and visual level all work effectively to create a dark and disconcerting haunted house feature. The performances by Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall are neck and neck in quality. Nicholson easily can look off his rocker while Duvall reacts perfectly to her co-star's outbursts. Nicholson's eyebrows also add to his menacing look (as weird as that sounds). Danny Lloyd is definitely not as skilled as Duvall or Nicholson but can still freak out the audience with his mouth agape look. Very unsettling. There's also other short appearances from Barry Nelson as the prior caretaker to Mr. Torrance and Mr. Durkin (Tony Burton).Scatman Crothers as the cook to the hotel is an interesting character. It is because of his talk with Danny that adds to the suspense of the dangers that lurk within the building. The imagery that is displayed however is what really drives home the concept of dread that precedes the hotel. What is great about how Kubrick directs this film, is that it is not treated like many other mainstream horror films. Jump scares do not exist in this film. It all relies on mysteries and off-putting flashes of different scenes. These quick scene cuts are not annoying either. They're intriguing because it makes the viewer question ""what is going on"". At first ""REDRUM"" is a questionable component to the narrative but overtime, the meaning is exposed. Though it may be obvious or rather uneventful to some when light is shed on the matter, it will be for those not use to the Kubrick method of execution. Remember, Kubrick was also the director to Paths of Glory (1957), 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), and A Clockwork Orange (1971).If anyone is looking for gore though, the volume is very low. Is there bloody violence - yes, but not enough to satisfy someone who enjoys lots of victims. Camera-work by John Alcott was wonderfully captivating. Having worked with Kubrick before, Alcott knows how a scene needed to be shot. Every scene has wide angle lenses that have static movements that rarely rotate. Also the technique of very slow zoom-ins are implemented and that helps the viewer focus in on what Kubrick was trying to convey. Alcott also worked on Terror Train (1980). Music on the other hand was a mixed bag. Composed by Wendy Carlos (best known for her score to Tron (1982)) and Rachel Elkind, the music used is effective but only in certain areas. In some parts its perfect with its deep drawn out strings and synths, which represents the dire threat that lives with the Torrance family. While in other places, it gets dragged out far too long when a scene is no longer that worrisome. It's not bad but could've been used better.Some parts within the script could've been left out completely and the story would've run smoother. The music works but far extends some scenes for no reason. Aside from this, the acting, creepy imagery and unique cinematography make this a different horror film worth seeing.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"

cause it was dead and dull
and what was up with Danny lloyed and his second personality it has no use in the movie the shinning was never really explained or used and the mother Shelley Duvall wasn't that bad but I found myself looking and staring at her teeth through out the entire film
as for the build up of Jack Nicholson's Jack torrance you really don't notice anything like the build on insanity until the last 30 min or so and even then your like who the hell cares you just want the movie to end I also noticed a few problems near the end like when the mother is the bathroom after sending her child out through the window she stays there for a good couple of mins before going to look for her son but then goes up stairs like why would he be there she also tends to run so pathetically i was laughing every time

Kubrick is dishonest about the music scores......,"Whilst utmost respect is donned on the late Kubrick for this masterpiece, there is some dishonesty in the closing credits concerning the music.The three composers whose music he used are Bartok, Ligeti and Pendereki, and Kubrick only gives full credit to Bartock. He names the piece.This is because any music lover would identify the piece by Bartok because in the music world it is too well known. He HAS to fully credit it. However, why no full credit to the other two composers?  The pieces used are lesser known, but any musician would know them well.....Kubrick knew the POWER the chosen scores gave the film, in many of the scenes the acting was choreographed to the music rather than the other way round. The music is what completes the brilliance of this film.The only reason Kubrick chose not to fully credit the music scores he used is simple. He wanted the credit himself! Bartock was the original creator of the style of music. Bartok's ""Night Music"". Ligeti and Pendereki created music of the same style using Bartoks original creations as their inspiration.  Bartok is well known, Ligeti lesser so.Kubrick KNEW he could probably getaway with it as only a serious musician would notice.KUBRICK OWED A DEBT TO THE GENIUS OF HIS COMPOSERS",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"

The Mad Author,"A classic example of a masterpiece initially underappreciated but subsequently celebrated, Stanley Kubrick's horror film, ""The Shining,"" is a striking exploration of a maze of architectural space and a haunting portrayal of the creative process and extreme writer's block. Adapted from Stephen King's novel, the film is famously unfaithful--adding psychological ambiguity to the supernatural haunted house fluff (complete with being built on an Indian burial ground). In the film, it's indefinite whether the surrogate writer on screen is writing the horrors of the Overlook Hotel or if the building is writing his descent into madness and to what degree the son interferes. King's animosity for the adaptation aside, it's an apt cinematic transmutation of the reflexive textual basis of the author-character into the visual exegesis of cinema in moving through space and time and as embodied by the building's ghosts and the ESP ""shining"" of the characters.There's a lot of visual doubling--a past and a present hotel caretaker and actually two present ones: one for winter and one for the other seasons, the twins, the maze of hedges outside and its miniature inside along with the labyrinth of hotel hallways down to the pattern on the carpet, the doubling of scenes through the superimpositions of the long dissolves--and shots through mirrors to reinforce the cinematic and literary reflexivity. Per usual of Kubrick's later oeuvre, the color design is impeccable. The wide-angle lenses add greatly to the apparent enormity of the sets. This was also one of the first, after more limited uses in films such as ""Rocky"" (1976), to extensively employ Garrett Brown's Steadicam. There are many memorable shots (and sound) here merely tracking characters walking down corridors and, especially, of Danny on his tricycle rolling along the hardwood and carpet floors. Add to that the helicopter shots outside and the transitions between the maze and its miniature as overlooked upon by Jack, and that the score is iconic. Another meticulously-crafted Kubrick film par excellence.There've been criticisms of Jack Nicholson's performance being over-the-top, and I hesitantly agree with that assessment towards the end of the picture. Much of the ambiguity as to who is in control of the narrative, Jack or the hotel, seems to be lost with Nicholson's mugging later on, as if wearing the face of the building's ghosts, whereas his ""Kubrick stare"" and more restrained ticks earlier on suggest his internalized struggle. Regardless, it's a big and memorable performance. The rest of the main cast is remarkable, too. Shelley Duvall's character is rather an abused milquetoast with nothing to do but react to others, but she plays terrified well. Scatman Crothers is also good, but unfortunately fits into King's pattern of what Spike Lee termed the ""magical (African-American)"" (as IMDb censors insist it be called) trope, seen in ""The Stand,"" ""The Green Mile"" and elsewhere. It'd be easy to dismiss were this a one-off, but King, or at least the adaptations of his books, are repeat offenders. ""Doctor Sleep"" (adapted in 2019), the sequel to ""The Shining,"" even regurgitates kidnapping gypsy stereotypes. Kubrick doesn't do any better, either, with the sexual posters adorning Dick Hallorann's bedroom, and the director ultimately resorting to another unfortunate trope from horror films.The real highlight are the hotel and maze sets, though, and how they're filmed. Even if this weren't an effective piece of Gothic horror, which it is, or even if the ""Room 237"" (2012) conspiracy theories were nonsense, which are they are, ""The Shining"" would be worthwhile merely to overlook figures passing through the halls and the winding hedges. Regardless, too, of who or what ultimately controls the narrative, psychological or supernatural, past or present, note the final shot is photographic. The real timeless ghosts that haunt us are cinematic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"

the limit of madness,"The Shining is without a doubt the best horror movie ever made. Many scenes from this movie went down in the history of cinematography. Of course, for good reason. A combination of King's captivating genius, Kubrick's extraordinary talent and charismatic Nicholson. Could it be better?The shining is definitely a movie for people who like to feel a thrill, but also like a mysterious atmosphere. This is not a classic slasher full of blood or cruelty, but we are dealing here with insanity and madness.I think that even if someone does not like this genre (horror), it's worth trying. There are no scary scenes that you will dream about at night. You'll rather want more every minute as both Nicholson and Duvall's play are brilliant. It is a timeless film that every cinema lover should watch.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Suspenseful masterpiece,"There are so many films that I have reviewed for the last year and a half that are such classics that there isn't a lot more to add to the mix. Another of these is a film I caught as a midnight showing at a local movie theater, 'The Shining', directed by Stanley Kubrick and adapted from Stephen King's classic novel of the same name. 'The Shining' has become such a pop culture phenomenon, parodied by everyone from Saturday Night Live to The Simpsons, that it is easy to forget to look at what a fantastic film it really is.Set in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, 'The Shining' tells the story of a small family who are hired to take care of a large hotel/resort during the off-season. This is an ideal situation for the father, Jack (Jack Nicholson) who plans to spend the time working on his novel, his wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and young son Danny (Danny Lloyd) if not for a couple of key factors. Firstly, the hotel gets snowbound in the winter, so leaving isn't an easy option. Secondly, the family has its own problems; Jack is a recovering alcoholic who has been abusive in the past, Wendy is fragile and nervous to the point of near-collapse, and Danny is a borderline schizophrenic whose alter-ego Tony manifests himself as a barking voice coming from Danny's right index finger. Oh yes, and the hotel is haunted by the spirits of guests, servants and their families who have died there in the past.All of these factors make up a spooky story that, when coupled with Kubrick's exquisite direction and cinematography, makes for a pretty creepy little film. His use of light and color (always with the red), unconventional score (always with the jarring piano) and serious creepy imagery are as amazing as always. The flashes of the twins, even after seeing the film many times, still make me shiver, and the tracking shots following Danny as he rides around in his Big Wheel still make me cringe every time he takes a corner. What Kubrick does best with 'The Shining' however is the slow pace he makes us follow until the action story crescendos near the end. Rather than construing this as a pacing issue, this is more of a simmer, then a slow boil, and finally a boil over.As I said earlier, this isn't a very compelling review because there has been so much said about the film that I can't possibly add anything in the way of significant interpretation and exploration in a forum this short. What I can say in testimony to this film's relevance, appeal and ultimately, longevity is that the theater I screened 'The Shining' at was packed with people, from adolescent to middle age, which I personally found pretty neat, being such a fan of Kubrick's work. 8/10Shelly",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"

Gotta be the creepiest effing thing I've ever seen,"I'm used to the gore and cheap jump scares of modern horror, so I was expecting the scariness of ""The Shining"" to have dulled over 35 years.Nope.Psychology, that's where the real horror lies. That, and the claustrophobic atmosphere (pretty snow on the outside, encroaching madness on the inside). Hopeless isolation. And it doesn't help matters that Kubrick plays on your emotions. He just wouldn't let up with the often-terrified expressions on Danny Lloyd's face, but it is extremely effective. And between the tracking shots, movements and unbalanced camera angles, it's just watching the maestro at work, turning the screws just a little bit more. Cold and calculated.And let me just say that, even though it's never mentioned alongside the other famous images (""Heeere's Johnny!"", the twins, REDRUM, the blood), the woman in the bathtub scene was the scariest. The reveal in the mirror, her cackling, the unrelenting strings - Jesus Christ, ""unnerving"" would be the understatement of the year. Kubrick turns something erotic into . . . that?! Maybe it's because that's the movie's first real scare, but that scene left its mark, no question.What a movie!9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
This is supposed to be scary!!???,"I was very disappointed with this movie. I had read the original novel about 8 years ago and never got around to seeing Kubrick's much ballyhooed film--until just the other night. It's been well-documented that Stephen King wasn't all too pleased with Kubrick's portrayal of his book. I don't blame him. I tried to see the movie as a separate piece from the book and tried to judge it on its own merits. I came away scratching my head and thinking ""Is this supposed to be chilling and frightening?"" I think it's funny to read all the Kubrick sheep proclaiming this movie to be a masterpiece of not only horror but of cinema in general. Their attempts at trying to find symbolism and an artistic edge throughout Kubrick's ""brilliant"" direction amuses me. There are some good directorial techniques but they weren't effective in portraying the overall feel of doom for the main characters that King did through his prose. Kubrick's direction aside, the acting is atrocious. Maybe I've been ruined by all the mimicked/cliched Nicholson lines over the years but he never instilled any type of fear in me. All I got was dark humor. I can also see why Shelly Duvall went from doing this to Popeye and then to obscurity. My biggest gripe is that I never felt scared and that's essential in a movie based on a King horror novel. The only slightly scary scenes involved the two little girls hassling Danny on his Big-Wheel pedaling around the Overlook. Very underwhelming...",,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Only above average,"I felt that I should comment on this film because I did not think it was all that great, while other reviewers seem to think it's the greatest and scariest movie ever made. Now don't get me wrong. I thought it was an ok movie and definitely worth a rental. However the film seems very amature. Kubrick does not build the story up very well before Jack starts going nuts. Also the film editing seemed half asked. I also did not find this to be a very scary film. Kubrick was definitely a skilled science fiction director, but horror does not seem to be his forte'. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"

"An excellent psychological horror drama. And one of Jack's most memorable and iconic roles(""Heeeere's Johnny!"")","If you've read the novel from Stephen King then you know it is quite different from Stanley Kubrick's adaptation. King who's novel is long and drawn out and it goes into more detail as is the case with most books. Kubrick on the other hand made the film long also yet his focus was more of an enchanting and psychological chilling visual masterpiece. Stanley was always so good for the fact that when shooting his films the scenes shot were always done in a manner of detail with a great camera touch. You add this with the performance of Jack Nichoslon(my favorite actor)who's over the top and out right crazy here with his role as was so common in his acting roles(example: ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" and as the ""Joker"" in ""Batman"") ""The Shining"" turns out to be a horror masterpiece as most agree it was one of Warner Brothers most acclaimed and successful films of all time.Nicholson is Jack Torrance an ex school teacher and now writer who moves his wife Wendy(Shelley Duvall) and young son Danny(Danny Lloyd) a clairvoyant to the Overlook hotel in Colorado, where he has just been hired as winter caretaker. This is an old and elegant style hotel of many alleys and room floors, yet soon behind it all this place reveals a haunted past of ghostly secrets it's a past time of ghostly madness. Scatman Crothers and Barry Nelson give good supporting performances as hotel employees.And the creme of the crop my man Nicholson gives a stirring and most memorable iconic performance as a man who's guilt ridden the film is a good character study of a man coming to terms with his guilt and family problems only sadly he gets wrapped up in the ghostly and sinister past of the overlook. Nicholson was at his angered and shocking best even during the dreamlike track shots and remember the famous line that still sticks in pop culture ""Heeeere's Johnny!"". The film is moved just fine by Stanley's direction it blends well with his musical score which is so pulsating and creepy. In the end it proves the past can suck you in and haunt you, and also that each and every place has hidden secrets as in this case it was a ghostly past a time warp. Overall a great horror classic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
"Fails a little for a horror flick, but still a pretty good job by Kubrick","I've heard many claim this to be a failure, either due to it straying too far from the book(something that apparently ticked King off, though he wasn't the first writer to be less than satisfied with Kubrick's adaptation of their work) or due to Kubrick's love for setting a mood and building atmosphere ruining the scares, at least if you're into sudden shocks, gore and stuff like that. Personally, I don't care too much about the source material... of course, that's probably due to my distinct dislike of Stephen King. But a good story is a good story, no matter who or where it came from. And the better part of the good story here may have come from Kubrick, and it may have come from King. I don't really care. I will admit that the film does fail in some areas, though, as a horror film. The scares are not as constant as they feel they should be, and the film only really works on the atmospheric level. The atmosphere and mood is great. No doubt about that. The film has a nice mysterious feel to it, nothing is explained in too much detail. The story is pretty good, as well as thoroughly interesting and involving. I saw this film once before, years ago... and even though I didn't understand too much of it, I liked it a lot. Particularly because of the story and the atmosphere. The plot is very good, interesting and involving. The pacing is quite good, there are only a few scenes where you're somewhat bored. I believe this is mainly because Kubrick wasn't too used to horror movies... or maybe his approach to the genre just wasn't the best. Through his career, Kubrick went through just about every single movie genre, often only making a single movie in each genre. That might be the reason some of his movies(this one and Full Metal Jacket, mainly) aren't as good as his better movies(A Clockwork Orange, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Dr. Strangelove). The acting is good, though it can be argued that the two leads, Nicholson and Duvall, overplay and underplay, respectively, at times. The characters are well-written and credible, though it can be argued that some of them are a little thin. The special effects are great, and still hold up today. All in all, a pretty good horror film, and a very good Kubrick film, but definitely not for all tastes. I recommend it to fans of Kubrick, atmospheric horror films, atmospheric films in general, and possibly fans of the actors involved. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
The Shining,"I am not a person that gets concerned with book-to-screen adaptations. It's not that I am not a reader, I enjoy literature and read a great deal in my free time. I recognize, however, that books and films are two different mediums, therefore, have storytelling devices unique to the manner in which they work with a narrative. Stephen King's vocal and vehement opposition to the 1980 film by Stanley Kubrick means quite little to me. He may be right, the work originated with him, obviously, but films are different than books and should be appreciated as a separate entity rather than an extension of one another. I also wouldn't classify myself as a fan of Stanley Kubrick. That's not to say I don't think he's made some wonderful films---he has, I just don't list him among my favorites which make me an ideal candidate to speak evenly about his film and King's book. Kubrick's film starring Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall tell the tale of a writer and his family who become caretakers of a hotel with a dark history on a secluded mountain in Colorado. The Torrence family is in for a lot more than a quiet winter once they finally settle in. Kubrick really outdoes himself with his visually stunning version of The Shining. The staggering cinematography creates the immense isolation the leads succumb to, keeping audiences glued to the screen until the final minute.Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) signs a contract to be the caretaker for the Overlook Hotel. Since the hotel will be empty while in Jack's care, he sees this as a perfect opportunity to work on his next novel. Just as he is signing the paperwork, he is warned that through the hotel's long history, there was a former caretaker that killed his family with an ax before shooting himself to death. Jack is unfazed by the news still focused on the opportunity to get a great deal of writing done during his time there. When he brings his wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and son Danny (Danny Lloyd) to settle in, things are alright for awhile, until Danny's gift of being able to see things from the past and the future, referred to as ""the shining"" begins to warn him about the hotel, and hints at something sinister taking place in room 237. When Danny meets the head chef who also has ""the shining"", who is preparing to leave the hotel for the winter, they speak about the sinister history surrounding the events that took place in room 237. The longer the Torrence family stays at the hotel, the more visions Danny has, and the deeper Jack surrenders to the insanity of such extreme isolation. When Jack starts becoming aggressive, Wendy and Danny begin to fear for their lives, thinking they may become the next victims of the Overlook Hotel.I'm a total cinephile, but I have few ""film traditions"". I enjoy seeing new-to-me films as often as possible, so I partake in very few re-watches. The Shining, however, is a film I watch every year on Halloween as a double bill with Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho. I've always been one of those people far more afraid of the darkest sides of human beings than an unhinged slasher. Despite watching The Shining every year, there hasn't been a viewing yet where I haven't sat in complete awe while watching it. I am completely immersed in the world Kubrick creates in The Shining, and that's solely due to his genius in portraying the subject matter. The sound design is extraordinary and creeps into the heads of those in the audience as subtly yet profoundly as Jack's isolation creeps into his head. I practically have to clean up the drool from the floor over the tracking shots Kubrick utilizes in the film. One of the best tracking shot in cinema history takes place in The Shining. Of course, I'm talking about the shot of Danny on his big wheel riding through the hallways of the hotel until being confronted by the horrors tucked away in the hotel's history. The brilliance and exquisite beauty of the tracking shots and long takes Kubrick uses to tell the story are fascinating, and never lose their luster no matter how many times you see The Shining. I've heard the criticisms of Nicholson, but I personally think that he was perfect for the role, and can't imagine anyone else playing the part of Jack Torrence. He was over the top at times, but the role calls for it the further he descends into madness. I also found Shelly Duvall's monotone agreeable attitude perfectly suited for her role of Wendy, as well. The camera work, direction, sound design, and performances come together in a magnificent sweeping package to create a piece of cinema that cements Kubrick's notion that film is an artwork, and should be repeatedly appreciated as such.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Here's My Shining Review,"The Shining is possibly the greatest horror movie ever made. It's cold, atmospheric, and lonely. It takes place in a giant, upscale hotel where only the greatest people have stayed. And during the wintertime, it has employed a lowly ex-drunk writer and his family to be it's caretaker.Now the plot is a little tricky. This film could be a ghost story, or it could all just be a writer's imagination. The characters words are so concentrated upon, and the camera concentrates on it's situations so much that the audiences feels like a bit of a peeping Tom. As if we don't belong there with them, and we are only the observant.So much more could be said about this movie, that you'd feel like frozen Jack at the end of the movie once it's complete.

The Horror From Kubrick,"The Shining for Kubrick is about the mystery of places and people. The people staying at the Overlook, the Torrances, but also the Overlook and the sense of ghosts who perhaps know all too well their accursed fate. It's also a work of mad genius, cribbing King's book (which was scary and moody on its own if heavy on exposition) for the sake of giving a viewer a sense of total and unnerving dread. It's perhaps also a really great 'ordinary people are not what they seem' saga. And about writing and Jack Nicholson.With Nicholson's performance, by the way, it's meant to be such a GIANT performance, and it either gets to you or it doesn't. This is a BIG performance that ranks with the likes of a Noh theater production, as if Nicholson had a touch of Mifune in Throne of Blood surrounded by those ghosts of Macbeth. We only gets hints about this man's sanity early on, then his growing boredom, and then a sense of, really, what the hell is going on with this guy. In the book it's made much more explicit: the hotel's gotten to him, it's in fact taken him over, in order to get to the boy. In the movie you can't be sure of it, because Kubrick and Nicholson keep you guessing, even as what you see is what you think you got.Also, Shelley Duvall is underrated here; it's a performance that's perhaps not as great as Nicholson's, but that's because she's Wendy isn't the one the hotel gets to, at least in the same way it does for Jack Torrance. It's an exagerration of what one would expect a normal everyday mother- who also happens to live with and brush aside domestic abuse and alcoholism, or try to bear with is as she can- to react in this environment. It was said Kubrick pushed Duvall quite hard during the production, and it shows for all the best effect. In fact the Shining film wouldn't be so great if it weren't for pushing hard against what is possible. It taps into the soul of the book but translates for a medium that needs spatial sense, the thread of ambiguity (which can be a no-no for some filmmakers but for Kubrick is nothing short of mandatory) while presenting us with really disturbing things.It's not particularly a film to show to a nine year old, but I saw it when I was nine anyway, and was moved, confused, running-out-of-the-house freaked-out (woman in bathtub, seriously), and knowing deep down I was experiencing some visceral thing here. The camera, the little girls, the music, the ""all work and no play"", the hedge maze, Nicholson, all of it comes together in one of those ultimate tales that makes perfect sense and no sense at all. It also gives the chance to ask questions, which the book, as amazing as it is, didn't let you do. Film as a medium gets a brooding kick in the nuts by the Shining.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"

MADNESS PURSUES AND CAPTURES JACK,"This is, perhaps, the ultimate psychological horror film.

Two hours of movie-time later, his psychosis full blown, wielding an axe, he is hunting down his own wife and son through the deserted grounds of their isolated temporary home.
By narrowing the focus of King's novel, Kubrick heightens the terror. His use of music and dazzling photography, as well as a near total absence of darkness in the interior sets (everything is brightly lit
until we get outside in the final ten minutes) - create a texture that is entirely his own. My only problem lies in the last shot: of a black and white photograph

One of Kubrick's best,"The Shining is the best horror film I've ever watched and one of my favorite films of all time. In this genre, it is unparalleled in vision, atmosphere, and class.I was constantly wondering what his style of film making would turn out to be. Though because of how mysterious the premise of The Shining is, I can't say I've really learned much in that department other than the fact that Stanley Kubrick was definitely influenced by some of David Lynch's earlier works, which is awesome. This is not a bad thing though, that I didn't learn much, as the mystery of this film along with its endless possibilities for theories is what makes it so timeless and engaging. Even with its 2.5 hour runtime, I never felt drained by the end, in fact I was left with more questions I had going in. I love that this movie never gives the audience the satisfaction of knowing exactly what's going on. Much of the film feels like amusement art, where we're immersed into the world of the characters, enveloped in realism and tension. I say realism because one of the core themes of The Shining is about family. This makes way for many dialogue sequences that don't really seem like they are just the ""what you see in the movies"" type of thing. Because they can seem real, the story, at times, feels more grounded and personal.Even on a surface level, The Shining is such a well-made, perplexing cinematic masterpiece. Without even trying to further read into the plot, The Shining is already one of those slow but unsettling festivals of tension that effectively utilizes music and cinematography to captivate the audience every second of the way. Everyone who has praised this movie has talked about the cinematography, and I'm going to do it here again. It's amazing. The use of the Steadicam camera stabilizer along with the intense score made the tension so powerful and the film so visually appealing.Of course, I can't forget about Jack Nicholson. I haven't seen many of the movies he has starred in so this was definitely a sight to behold. Aside from the fact that he gives many great performances throughout the film, he just knows how to demand screen presence. My attention was always on him when he was on camera; he really has a way of ""face acting"" that helps the viewer kind of piece together what is going on inside his head. As far as acting goes in general, it doesn't get much better than this guy. In fact, as far as movies go, it doesn't get much better than this one either.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
A movie to watch,"When I first saw ""The Shining"" I just watched it like a normal horror movie. But when I watched it another time I understood many more things about this movie. There is a story behind it, but it's hard to catch it at first sight. If you search some interpretations about it, you'll find out many versions that will help you to have a clearer idea about the message of the film. Some of the interpretations say that the topic is about the incest. Some others think that the movie is about native Americans genocide. The hotel in which the film takes part is built on a native American burial ground and there are also paintings on the walls that recalls of native American.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Not As Good As I Remember,"I've decided to rewatch this movie after many years of watching it for the first time and to be honest its not as good as i remember, the movie is pretty average and hardly horrifying, Story is not interesting and the only good thing in the movie is Jack Nicholson acting he is phenomenal and fit the maniac character very well with his facial expression and the way he behaves its just great however the other cast are nothing but mediocre, I'd like to say the beginning shots of the movie with the scenery and mountains and throughout the movie were beautiful.The main reason for rewatching it is because im planning to watch Doctor Sleep and wanted to recollect what happened in the first movie.I can't really recommend the movie unless of course, you want to watch it for the sake of nostalgia then go ahead but for me i found it to be boring and long5/10.",5.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Just Perfect!,A few weeks ago I had never really watched anything like The Shining. Not many horror films at all but in the space of 2 weeks I've watched it twice and it's one of my favourite films ever. Jack Nicholson is fantastic in this film with his facial expressions and just his overall acting. I really enjoy the subtle nods to the book and also the added things that aren't in the book. This film has inspired me to read Stephen Kings books and also watch some of the films which have been mostly good. I wouldn't say that this film is necessarily too scary but I think that the story completely makes up for that. Just an amazing film.,10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"

Tsiegretlop ? (dvd),"I ask the question because the very first thing we hear about the hotel is this shared dramatic roots : the place was a sacred burial ground that has become desecrated for modern life !There's no doubt that Kubrick was a talented director : The way he shoots this empty, majestic haunted hotel is indeed fabulous ! Usually, when a movie takes place in a single location (ex : « million dollar hotel »), the director pays no attention to it while it's the first character ! Here, we understand the topography, we know the different places so we are really immersed in what happens between the characters. In addition, the sights are totally incredible as well in natural outdoors as sophisticated indoors and i'm really fond of social, collective places becoming desert (ex : a mall like in « career opportunities »)Now, it's hard to tell if the movie is frightening as i'm an adult, i have read the novel and i have watched it a long time ago ! Actually, the way dark forces twist the family is really original because except for very graphic moments, the horror is mostly verbal and psychological : to illustrate those fears and anguish, I found the cast really talented : Danny plays great when we think how young he was ; His mother was really caring for the whole family and shows resources when needed and Jack was indeed a fabulous puppet man driven crazy ! So maybe the flaw was just him as King told : if Jack is perfect when crazy, he is unfit to play the normal guy : at the start of the movie, he doesn't act like the perfect husband, loving father or motivated employee so we lost his unexpected fall and thus a lot of the dark intensity of the movieBut, after 36 years, the movie doesn't look old and senile and with that late 70s fashion and design, it's still pertinent and a must see movie today !!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
"""all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy""","This 1980 Kubrik masterpiece is without any doubt the scariest film of all time. Even scarier than The Exorcist. The paranoia-driven, psycho thriller unfolds as something so real you can feel it, something so human -- succumbing before a mental devolve triggered by haunting images of an animalistic massacre. The scenes of Nicholsons crash to his unvisited, deep recesses of mind, and of course the immortal graphic tidal wave of blood rushing from the elevator were instant classic cerebral macabre. A complete diversion off the usual horror sequences my generation grew up with, The Shining instead carved in film history the whole meaning of horror, ever present in each person snapping out of sanity.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
A horror movie for the ages that will stand the test of time,"I have seen the shining many times on television, on DVD, at Halloween at friends houses or just to scare myself stupid sometimes when the moment calls for it. To me, this movie is one of the greatest pieces of cinema I have ever witnessed from its superb camera work, to the lighting effects and terrifying soundtrack to the overall feel of and pace of the movie. It takes time to lay the groundwork in the beginning but once it gets going, the movie unravels in a chilling and thrilling spectacle of terror and horror. I can genuinely say that this movie is a wonderful piece of horror cinema and is a piece of creative genius from the way it was imagined by the late, great Stanley Kubrick. It plays with your mind and stays there for weeks on end gnawing at your core and wanting you to unravel the story further and delve deeper into the madness that is the shining. Although I am young, I have seen many a film in my time and can boldly say that I am fully aware that the shining is one of the greatest if not the greatest psychological horror movies to ever grace the silver screen. If you have seen it, you know what I mean. If you have seen it and don't like it, watch it again to try and fully grasp it. If you haven't seen it yet, get up and rent it NOW! You are doing yourself a great disservice to miss one of the greatest works ever.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
No contest - horror at it's finest!!,"Just watch it, if you don't like it there is something seriously wrong with you (no offence).

Upon hearing this I went into the garage, pulled out an axe and began to hack away at my friends bathroom door. OK I didn't but I wanted to!It is just amazing!Jack Nicholson is AMAZING and I can't believe Stephen King didn't want him as the starring role! Why?

"more assets than liabilities, a fun film","First, I'll try a synopsis of this movie. That isn't easy, because there are basically three points of view throughout. A writer takes a job overseeing a desolate hotel, which for some reason is completely isolated during the winter, with no one around. He, his beautiful wife, and his troubled young son are all alone in a haunted hotel. The people who leave him there seem to know it is haunted, too. The writer, we learn later, is trouble, too. The film is purposely ambiguous as to whether he arrived deranged, or whether the ghosts he meets drive him to insanity. Some will like the chilling scenes. It is a fun movie, and it is scary. Others will not like some of the ambiguity, nor the fact that the writer seems to go crazy all at once. However, a second look shows that he may not have come unhinged in one second. The tell tale scene is when his wife finds part of his manuscript to see what he has written. It denotes that he has been crazy for some time. The young son is trouble, but ""gifted"", with some ability to sense hauntings. For some reason, this makes him a sort of target. Why? Probably more for effect than actual cause. To accept the premise of the movie, you need to accept the premise that the ghosts are the result of some actual intelligence, and that this intelligence is some evil of the usual Hollywood undying evil sort. A lot of interesting scenes make this movie enjoyable enough. It has mixed reviews, but overall, it has many more assets than liabilities.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"

One of the Kubrick masterpieces,"An amazing movie about loneliness that is divided for all the main characters.

It's not an easy movie to watch, but will make think about it for a long time, and of course, as Kubrick loves to do, we will learn and think more about the movie day by day, and we will never find a finite meaning for the movie!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Not a masterpiece,"I don't mind watching this once in a while for a few reasons.First. This movie is in format 1.33:1 fullscreen which means that the screen of my old TV set is completely filled whereas almost all movies of the last 40 years are more or less panoramic or ""widescreen"".Second. The light in this movie is excellent along with the quality of the images. Kubrick, unlike some directors, handled with care the original negatives of his movies. That is why today Kubrick's films are the most outstanding from an ""image quality"" point of view despite the fact that they all aged. (Space Odyssey is from 1968). This means respect for the viewer.Third. The fact that Jack Nicholson looks half crazy from the very first scene rather adds something to the movie instead of penalizing it. From the very first scene we are already tuned on the upcoming outburst of Jack Torrance. We just can't wait till it happens.The atmosphere is very particular. Some scenes are really the ones of a ""horror movie"" and by this I mean that the term ""horror movie"" is very abused.But I did notice a few things that I didn't like. It happened during the sequence of Jack Torrance with the bartender. I noticed that when Jack is talking, the bartender is out of the picture and we only see a very small portion of his shoulder. When the bartender is talking, Jack is also out of the picture and we only see a small portion of his shoulder also. What kind of a technique is that? Was Kubrick too lazy to work with the 2 actors together? I bet you that when the bartender was filming his scene, that small shoulder we see was the one of a technician and Jack Nicholson was relaxing in his dressing room.The same thing happens in a more dramatic scene, when Jack Torrance has gone definitely nuts and is about to attack his wife. Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall are never pictured together. If we see Jack, Shelley isn't there and vice versa (except for that famous small portion of shoulder). I think this scene looses much of its dramatic intensity. In the scenes where Shelley was blubbering I couldn't stop thinking of Nicholson probably having a day off.The scene of Nicholson definitely going nuts is where the movie ends. Every mechanism of the movie drops. The tension of the movie is now uniquely in a physical match which appears right away almost ridiculous. We have a too slow moving Nicholson opposed to a very awkward and clumsy woman. The final part is really without any surprise as we all know what will happen.From very good to excellent. But not a masterpiece.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"

His version of Stephen King's terrifying novel is creepy, unnerving and unforgettable!

An Everlasting Cult-Horror Classic,"Stanley Kubrick's The Shining (1980) is an undisputed masterpiece and true horror-movie classic. The film is an adaptation of Stephen King's original novel published in 1977. Although faithless to the book, Kubrick's adaptation showcases literal and figurative madness from crew to talent. The revolutionary cinematography, genuine performances, and underlying tone of pure insanity make this cult-classic worth repeated viewing.In a seemingly innocent exposition, Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) becomes winter caretaker of the Overlook Hotel, a secluded mountain resort in Colorado. He brings his wife, Wendy (Shelley Duvall), and eight-year-old son, Danny (Danny Lloyd), in what will be five months of 'fantastically cruel' isolation. Two weeks into his new job, an epic snowstorm barricades the family-of-three within the Overlook. Jack finds trouble sleeping, becomes infuriated with his family, and befriends an imaginary bartender. He succumbs to his hellish, erotic, and homicidal urges, resulting in a total mental collapse.Unlike modern-day horror, this legendary film doesn't only rely on gruesome imagery, but ground-breaking cinematography. Once Kubrick learned of 'The Steadicam,' a camera accessory intended for smooth shots over an irregular surface, he stopped at nothing to obtain one. And unlike any film before it, The Shining took the device to new heights; effortlessly gliding the audience alongside characters, and throughout massive corridors. The extraordinarily long shots of Jack, Danny, and Wendy masterfully conveyed a sense of ever-following hysteria.To further support the ominous cinematography was Kubrick's meticulously placed soundtrack music. The now-iconic scores performed by Béla Bartók perfectly accents the chilling weather, vast emptiness of the Overlook Hotel, and progressive instability of the Torrence family. The under-toned music escalates tension to virtually unbearable levels.More so terrifying than Jack and Shelly's onscreen performance was their offscreen struggles. Nicholson, now triple Oscar-winning actor, frequently attributes his success to habitual drug use. And during The Shining's 1978-80 production, there was no shortage of cocaine. He later admitted to frequently leaving set to snort, inadvertently creating the perfect on-camera madman. In addition, Shelly Duvall's trembling fear and overwhelming vulnerability were genuine. Kubrick kept her isolated from the cast, cut many of her lines, and forced her to perform the iconic 'baseball bat' scene a record-breaking 127 times. In the later months of filming, she presented the director with clumps of her own hair, to bring awareness to his cruel methods.For exactly 39 years, The Shining has remained untouchable and irreplaceable. Still today, Stanley Kubrick's cinematography is worshiped by industry professionals and critics alike. His strive for frame-by-frame excellence drove the talent insane, resulting in genuine on-camera mania. I challenge anyone to witness the literal insanity and cinematic excellence of The Shining.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Why?,"The title of my comment says it all, why? Why take a perfectly good book from undoubtedly the best horror writer around and turn it into this long, boring film that is supposed to have viewers quaking in their boots but instead had me almost asleep? I suppose I shall go through my feelings about this 'film'.Firstly, the cast that the director has decided to involve in this film is all wrong. Wendy Torrence, all she ever seems to do is cry, and almost break down, she is such a weak character anyway so why get an even weaker actress to play this part? Danny, well, he just seems totally lost all the time, the character is supposed to be a scary character, what this boy is experiencing is not normal so why does it seem that everything he does is just boring? His facial expressions are all obviously fake and he seems to react to the whole scenario as if it were a walk in the park, this makes no sense. Finally, the infamous Jack Torrence (Nicholson), well, I would like to say how sorry I am in advance to any avid Nicholson fans out there but the only reason that he seems to act well in this is because he has such a weak supporting cast. He is wooden and, well, he does not play the part that was meant by the author. At the beginning we should see Jack as a loving husband and father who, although he has his faults, is not a bad person, but even in the early stages of this film we see the manic sides to Jack that we are not supposed to see until at least half way through, he goes to pieces before he reaches the hotel. Nicholson, although a good actor in some of his films, gives this part an edge from the out start which shouldn't even be there. This brings the quality of the film right down.This film was so hyped up that I automatically thought, naive as I am, that it would live up to all the publicity that it received, I was wrong. As a fan of the horror film genre, I was so disappointed that the supposed 'best horror film of the 80's' would turn out to be this long, pointless, laughable portrayal of what could have been a seriously terrifying film. My advice to you is to skip the film, it's a waste of 2 and 1/2 hours and read the book instead, that'll have you more scared than the film ever could.Again, I ask my original question why..............?",,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
I finally got to see Johnny!,"""Some places are like people: some shine and some don't.""I'm ashamed to admit that despite being a film buff I never got around watching The Shining. As a matter of fact the only Kubrick film I've seen is 2001 A Space Odyssey, which I thought was brilliant. I tried to watch A Clockwork Orange, but never managed to finish it. I'm not a huge Kubrick fan but I do need to watch his films. The Shining is one of those movies that I wish I would have seen years ago because it really hasn't aged too well and after seeing so many horror films I've realized how much they took from this film. That is why perhaps I felt the film to be very predictable, but there is no denying that this film influenced the horror genre during the last three decades and continues to do so. The film was adapted from Stephen King's novel, a writer which I'm not a huge fan of either (although I loved Misery). I guess that having watched The Amityville Horror before this, kind of ruined the suspense for me, but there is no denying that Jack Nicholson's performance was magnificent here during his psychotic transformation. That ""Here's Johnny"" scene is such a classic and it is proof that Kubrick knows his craft. He is a perfectionist and it comes through in his direction. The problem I had with this film is that the ghost story really didn't work for me and some of the scenes felt really cheesy. The imagery in this film however is technically brilliant and there is no denying why this film has become a classic.Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) is a failed writer who is trying to find inspiration for his next novel. He is offered a job as the winter caretaker at an isolated hotel in Colorado and he realizes it would be the perfect place for his writing project. He decides to settle in the hotel along with his wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and his son Danny (Danny Lloyd) who has some sort of a psychic ability known as the shining. Before the employees of the hotel leave for the winter season they warn Jack to stay away from Room 237 where a terrible murder took place several decades ago. The first person to have terrible visions of the place is Danny, but soon the rest of the family realizes that they aren't the only ones in the hotel. The place begins to take its toll on Jack who slowly begins to go through some sort of transformation that puts the life of his wife and child at risk.The Shining sets a perfect background for a horror story and Kubrick takes advantage of the screenplay and gives us some spectacular visuals. The symmetry of the images, the inclusion of the color red in most of the scenes, the impressive and claustrophobic maze and hotel corridors set the tone and mood of the film. My main issue had to do with the ghost story and the entire ""shining"" thing with Danny. Narratively speaking the film has many flaws, but technically it is very well crafted. The only performance I enjoyed here was Jack Nicholson's, but the rest of the cast wasn't really up to par with the movie. I do have to admit that the soundtrack was thrilling. If you leave out the entire ghost thing and realize this really has to do with how isolation can often turn into madness you will appreciate Kubrick's work even more. However, as a horror film this really never managed to scare me or make me feel uneasy so it doesn't really succeed in that level.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"

Every frame is a piece of art,"Many people wonder why I say ""The Shining is the Greatest Movie Ever Made"". I show it to them, turn it off, and then they just say: ""What's the big deal?"". The Shining is a big deal.  It isn't just about a recovering alcoholic caretaker suffering from a bout of cabin fever, it focuses on his growing hatred for his family, and his growing love for the Hotel, as graphically described in the book (just for the record, I prefer the movie). Kubrick's obsession with the Stedicam, chasing Danny through the long winded, carpeted halls of the Overlook Hotel, the score and the beginning music: ""Dies Irae"" from the Symphony Fantastique by Borodin all add to the truly amazing, terrifiying and fantastic roller-coaster of a ride that is The Shining.If you haven't seen The Shining, you are missing out on a film where every frame is a piece of art.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
My 2 cents,"So I've seen the film and read the book (in that order). I've even sat through some of the TV-series (or as much as I could stomach). I've read several threads in this ongoing debate.In the first place, I'd like to thank and praise King for writing the novel. It is to his brain that we all owe a great debt of gratitude for this interesting story in the first place.Secondly, I would add that I think we're dealing with 2 different caliber of artists approaching similar subject matter (which, again, King originally came up with). On the one hand, and setting aside basic plot ideas/differences for the moment, I find King's writing to be good (though very long-winded). On the other, I find Kubrick's film-making and screenplay to be brilliant (and concise).In the end, I feel Kubrick's capacity far outshines King's. I appreciate King's own appreciation for Gothic (esp. Poe), but feel he hardly measures up (to Poe or other writers he admires (such as Lovecraft); I suspect he would agree). King is a good pop-fiction writer. Most people will read him. He explicitly (and annoyingly) explains his metaphors (such as the wasp's nest), rather than leave them for the reader to decipher for themselves (if they do). Most people need that. We live in an age where more people read Harry Potter than Crime and Punishment; but, I digress.Before closing, I had one final note which may be a piece of fiction of my own, but, I think, is worth considering nevertheless: King's novel, which we know is in many ways autobiographical, may have been a therapeutic exercise for him in which he fabricates a new (and fictional) reality and recognizes (and, therefore, addresses, genuinely I think) his own personal issues/exorcises his own personal demons. As readers, we can only admire him (if that is in fact the case). However, that Kubrick's interpretation puts a wrench in this may be part of the reason why King disliked the film in the first place (and continues to do so). Any personal issues which originally fueled the novel do not need to be adopted or even recognized by Kubrick, who clearly went in a different direction with the character, Jack Torrance (than did King). Here I say, let King be King, let Kubrick be Kubrick.I never met King or Kubrick, except through their work, and even there both reveal and hide parts of themselves. I am grateful to both, but, if pressed (and regardless of who originated the story), I would consider Kubrick the superior artist. Also, I could barely sit through even some of the 1997 TV-series version (written by King), but can appreciate why he continues to keep the story emotionally sprinkled and sympathetic to Jack Torrance as he does. Here, King's presence remains; whereas, in Kubrick's version, it is checkmated and eliminated from the game.In closing, I would add that we should also thank Diane Johnson, herself an author and (I believe) PhD in Gothic Literature, who no doubt greatly influenced Kubrick's final product.

An Analytic Classic,"The Shining is Kubrick's attempt to develop in an intimate way the dynamics of a young family. The horror is the maintenance of the mother-son bond that is under threat by the overzealous father. No matter how hard he strives, this bond cannot be broken. He sees women as whores, as the objects that relieve his desire. His son is a mere token of his abnormal sexuality.In isolation, without the counter reliance of men, he is held hostage to the redundant role of men in the family situation. He is unnecessary and feels he should be punished. His psyche shifts and lives in self-destruction, the mode that attracts the attention of his wife and child. But he is overcome. The male is signaled as deceased. The killing by each man, is the determination of the male role in the family unit. Redundant, obsolete, violence offers only a vacant reprieve.Kubrick follows Nicholson's destruction with an eye for the decline of the creative enterprise. Either way, the role of storyteller is overtaken by the wife and the clairvoyant son, who seek refuge from this male self-destruction. We hope for Jack's vacation, but his impotence pollutes any attempt to bond with his family. History repeats itself. If only Jack could lesson his grip on dominance the trio would be saved by unitary fear of the unknown. Jack doesn't recognize this fear, doesn't confront his impotence as the ""male"" and relents to the massacre.One of the best films of the twentieth century.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"

From there, Jack Torrance slowly spirals into madness and it is only a matter of time before he will cause harm to his wife and son.Jack Nicholson's performance is both fantastic and haunting, it's a performance that was very under-appreciated by reviewers when the film was first released in 1980. Surely a nod for a Golden Globe or Oscar would be deserving for Nicholson's performance. Shelley Duvall's performance is middle-of-the-road, it's not terrible, but yet it's not sensational, however when it comes to the scenes where Wendy is terrified of Jack, she really, really does let it all out. Lastly, Danny LLoyd gives a very good performance for his age. Also, it is incredible to think that Danny Lloyd was only 6-7 at the time of the release of the film, and he had been told he was working on a drama, not a horror film. He found out that he was acting in a horror film when he was 17!!Finally the last thing to mention is the cinematography. The filming gives 'The Shining' an extra sense of terror as the camera motions are very controlled. How this film did not receive an Oscar win or nomination for Best Cinematography is an absolute crime.So that is 'The Shining'. I remember when I first watched this film several years ago, I knew instantly from the second it started that it would become one of my all time favourite films, and I was correct. If you are a horror film and have not seen 'The Shining', I highly recommend it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
One of the greatest horror films of all time,"It had been four years since I last saw this on the big screen and thanks to The Art House running a Stanley Kubrick film festival, I got another chance to see it in the theater again. This time I got to take my 9th grader to see the film for the first time. Before she went in, she asked, ""What's the scariest movie I've seen so far?"" I told her I thought it was probably ALIEN but that after today it would be THE SHINING. During the Room 237 scene, she covered her eyes, so I'm pretty sure I was correct. Below is my review from the last time I watched the film:10-1-19
I recently rewatched ""The Shining"" on the big screen at a revival showing and was struck by how it has aged and now only seems mildly frightening. I remember being terrified of the twins, the elevators of blood, and Jack in the hedge maze. Still, even though the film has lost some of its scare factor, ""The Shining"" is a fabulous piece of cinema. I won't bother summarizing the plot, because this is a film everyone has seen, and if you haven't watch it NOW. Masterfully directed by Stanley Kubrick, his use of the Steadicam gives the film a dreamlike quality, floating through the empty hotel hallways and hedge mazes, which beautifully compliments the film's supernatural story. This was a new technique at the time and it still stands out as one of my best uses of this technology (Scorsese's use of it in ""Goodfellas"" is probably the other standout). Although not as edge-of-your-seat as contemporary horror films (Mike Flanagan's ""The Haunting of Hill House"" is an excellent example of a film that manages to be both scary and intelligent, which ""The Shining"" was in its day), Kubrick's film does maintain a wonderfully creepy atmosphere. The photography by John Alcott (""Barry Lyndon"" ""A Clockwork Orange"" ""The Beastmaster"") is gorgeous. It's interesting to note that this is a haunted house story shot on brightly sunlight sets, compared to the typical dark and stormy night setting of most horror films. Roy Walker's production design and Leslie Tompkins's art direction are both beautiful and terrifying in their starkness. No review of ""The Shining"" would be complete without mentioning Kubrick's masterful selection of music for the film. Wendy Carlos provided a few pieces, but a majority of the frightening music were compositions that, believe it or not, already existed. This film introduced me to György Ligeti, Krzysztof Penderecki, and Béla Bartók. Kurbrik brilliantly places the music into the film to a highly effective degree. Thematically, there are many theories on what the film is about (see the hilarious documentary ""Room 237"" for some outrageous theories, though that film is less about dissecting ""The Shining"" and is more about how people get sucked into conspiracy theories and look to make order, seeking out patterns and connections where they don't exist, to match their world view), but what the story of ""The Shining"" really boils down to is the horrors and challenges of family, parenting, and marriage. All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. Jack is having a midlife crisis. He wants to be a writer, but he now has responsibilities, a wife and a child who he increasingly begins to view as getting in the way of his life. He even tells Loyd, the ghostly bartender, at one point that he's losing who he is. From Wendy's perspective, Jack doesn't appreciate her cheerfully running the house and Wendy begins to lose her mind over this as well, while poor Danny is caught in the middle. Looking for an escape from his responsibilities, Jack begins drinking again (he's a recovering alcoholic) and is even tempted by another woman at one point. Minus all the supernatural elements, this is a domestic drama. This all was more at the forefront of King's book, which got watered down somewhat for the film version since Nicholson goes crazy pretty much right off that bat, which is a negative point in the film and was the crux of King's outspoken criticism of the film. King much preferred the TV mini-series version directed by Mick Garris and with Steven Weber as Jack Torrance. That version is much closer to the book and the highly identifiable Weber much better conveys King's focus on the horror of seeing your very ordinary father wrestle with his demons versus the very unordinary Nicholson (no one's dad is like Jack Nicholson), but the TV-mini series is nowhere as cinematic as Kubrick's big screen opus. Overall, ""The Shining"" remains a classic, but it is a film that has lost some of its sparkle over the years, mostly likely due to it being endlessly copied, which consequentially leaves the film feeling somewhat stale by comparison. Regardless, it remains a compelling and visually stunning film to behold.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"

"A ""shining"" example of how King doesn't translate well to film","I gotta say, the TV miniseries (done years later, I'll admit) was better than this film. Kubrick's adaptation is somewhat scary, but more ""foreboding"" than scary. More proof that Steven King stories don't make movies that are nearly as great as the printed product.Too many important details of the story are left out, and we don't get a good enough sense of the true history of the Overlook. It's these details that create the *real* horror. The miniseries explored them more, and so it was, to me, much scarier, even though I pretty much knew what was going to happen.The worst offense of this film is an over-the-top, over-acting Jack Nicholson and his undeservedly classic ""Here's Johnny"" line.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
The Horror That Changed Cinema,"Soon ""The Shining"" will be forty years old, and yet its appeal remains as strong as ever. This is a film so unique in nature yet classic in plot, a film that will always be remembered; not just as one of the greatest horror masterpieces but as one of the greatest movies in history.
Jack Nicholson delivers a perfect performance as the iconic mad man Jack Torrance, out to teach his wife and troubled son a lesson in the harshest of ways. With an excellent script in hand, Nicholson filled shoes no other actor could have filled or should have filled if they were given the role.
What's most memorable to me about the movie is the constant suspense. Not for one minute of the 140 minute feature did I dare look away. My visual appetite was met with incredible and sometimes peculiar cinematography.
By the time the credits roll in, some loose ends are left to the imagination, but I think this is just how Kubrick wanted it - everything coming full circle, except for some odd bits and pieces here and there to give the viewer their own taste of the madness. It is then that we realise that there's a little bit of insanity in all of us.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Another bore,"Stanley Kubrick doesn't always do it for me. I know this is essentially sacrilege, but to me, his films are either captivating and deep (e.g. Eyes Wide Shut) or just ploddingly dull and lifeless (e.g. 2001: A Space Odyssey). This film falls firmly into the latter camp. I'm really not sure what I'm supposed to get out of this one. It just... exists. But I didn't feel anything.",4.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"

The Shining is a true horror classic that allows you to feel the fear and suspense of the characters.,"The Shining is a classic horror film that has every element of psychological terror. Directed by Stanley Kubrick and based on the novel by famous horror author Stephen King, this film brought together the elements of terror, action, and suspense.Jack Nicolson plays the main character, Jack Torrence, an unemployed writer who accepts a job care taking a hotel in the remote Colorado mountain's. With him he brings his wife Wendy, played by Shelley Duvall, and their young son Danny, played by Danny Lloyd. This film projects a father who is controlling, moody and abusive. He takes his family away to this hotel, knowing its past events, and forces them to endure a brutal winter of seclusion and fear.This film alters between Jack's reality and his delusional state. Jack Torrence, in his quest for solitude begins to lose his mind and transgresses into the life of a psychopathic killer. This film does an excellent job with the use lighting and various camera angles to allow the viewer to feel the tension and suspense.Danny possesses a paranormal ability to see the past and the future. This ability is referred to as ""shining"". With this ability he is able to see the horror that the hotel history holds and the horror that is to come from the hands of his father. Danny connects with the cook at the hotel, Dick Hallorann, played by Scatman Crothers as he also ""shines"". Hallorann warns Danny of the evil of the hotel and to stay away from room 237.As the weeks progress for the Torrence family in the seclusion of the hotel, Jack begins to act differently. He becomes irritable and mean. Jack has delusional conversations with a dead bartender, who reminds Torrence that his family needs to be punished. Wendy becomes aware of Jacks change in attitude and personality and fears for her safety and that of her sons. She tries to call for help, but Jack has destroyed the radio system. Danny, with his ability to ""shine"", is able to communicate with Hallorran and lets him know they are in trouble.The best scene is when Wendy is in the lobby, which is where Jack is writing his novel. She approaches the desk with trepidation as she doesn't know where Jack is and she was warned not to go in there and bother him. She has a bat in her hands and as she approaches the desk the camera angle changes so you can see Jack is behind her in the shadow of the overhang. He is watching her read the pages of his novel, which consists of numerous pages of ""All work and no play make Jack a dull boy"". This scene was filmed perfectly, it had so many elements that worked together to produce the feeling of terror and suspense. The lighting and zooming in on Wendy trying to get away from Jack while walking up the stairs backwards reinforced the fear she feels in trying to protect herself and her son.The theme of this film laid the foundation for the fear and terror that Wendy and Danny felt and the perpetuation of those feelings as Jack slowly lost his mind. This film is a great American classic. Kubrick did an excellent job casting outstanding actors, incorporating perfect lighting, scenery, camera angles to project the suspenseful and terror filled scenes in this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
One of the Greatest,"The Shining blew me away when I first saw it and it never seems to stop doing so. The Shining, directed by Stanley Kubrick, is a masterpiece in horror cinema from its incredible, eery cinematography to its famous, effective scares. This movie will give you the chills and there isn't a moment without tensity. 
The Shining's starting plot points involve Jack Torrence interviewing for a job as the caretaker for the winter months at the Historic Overlook Hotel. Having gotten the job, he takes his wife, Wendy, and his son, Danny, who has a psychic ability called the shining. From there, the film really takes off.
The cinematography in this movie is amazing. Notoble moments include the dolly shots of Danny on his big wheel, the camera following him through the hallways and around corners, as if he's being chased by something. Another example includes the entire Overlook tour, the camera never moving up and down but following the characters perfectly, this making the scene look nicer and more suspenseful. 
The performances in this movie are some of the best ever put to film. Jack Nicholson giving one of his best as Jack Torrence. His performance is incredibly uncomfortable, even when he's acting normally, he doesn't feel right. His performance is incredibly memorable. Shelly Duvall's performace as Wendy is preserved and so nice, making her torment in this film truly sad. Danny Lloyd as Danny Torrence, is one of the best child performances ever. It's very difficult to get a great performance from a child, especially one as old as five years old. Stanley Kubrick managed it and what came out was a boy surrounded by things he doesn't understand. Things that are attracted to his special abilities. Danny is a kid who is 100% NOT annoying, and is quite likable so that's an A+ in my book.
Overall, The Shining is a masterpiece from the brilliant mind of Stanley Kubrick. This film is perfect in my opinion along with films like Alien, The Thing, and Jaws. There isn't any horror movie like it and I definitely recommend that everyone of the right age should give this one a watch.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"

"Visually stunning, but...","In typical Kubrick fashion, here is a movie that is like flipping through a Time-Life ""The Year in Pictures"". The imagery is beautiful, but there is no story. And that's a real shame, because the story is wonderful. Don't get me wrong, I do like this movie, but I wish Kubrick had spent as much time developing the characters as he did working out beautiful steadicam shots. It exposes Kubrick for what he was, a photographer. Nothing more, nothing less.I think Jack Nicholson was great in the movie, but was probably not the best choice for the role since he looked crazy already. Shelly Duvall had the most difficult role, and I thought she did an admirable job.Kubrick took a great story and turned it into a disconnected, disjointed mess. Anyone who watches this film and thinks they have the slightest idea of whats going on is fooling themselves.Oh, and this movie is NOT scary.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Terrifying...,"The Torrance family head to the vast Overlook Hotel, of which they will be the only occupants for the next months. Great for Mrs. Torrance (Duvall) who enjoys the outdoors and a house-keeping challenge. But not so good for sensitive Danny, who feels the influence of the horrors committed by the last caretaker. And definitively not good for Jack Torrance (Nicholson), whose planned seclusion to write his novel leads not to artistic inspiration but to murderous madness.In adapting Stephen King's book, Kubrick turned it and the horror genre on their heads. All the common principles of horror are twisted: things happen in the stark, white daylight rather than at dark, silence induces the terror rather than spooky sounds, and the undead are far less dangerous than members of one's own family. Rejecting the ghosts-as-frighteners theory since to him life after death was a positive prospect, Kubrick tore the film down to Jack Nicholson's slow, frightful mental unraveling. It works wonders (in the most horrible of ways imaginable): Jack Nicholson directed by Kubrick is far more terrifying than any monster could hope to be.Kubrick being Kubrick, nothing is left to chance: every frame is completely calculated. This has earned him a reputation for being cold in some quarters. One can easily imagine what effect this gives a film such as ""The Shinning"". Sweeping shots of eerie corridors (the birth of the steady-cam), slow zooms into Nicholson's crazed face, the labyrinth scene... Kubrick weaves a tapestry of cinematic tension and unease and psychological violence with every element at his disposal. Stephen King hated it of course, convinced that the ""scary"" ghosts from his source novel were what made the horror work, and remade it his way two decades later. the result was a sorry dud of a film.""The Shinning"" is among the best horror films ever because at its heart it holds that sordid truth that the most frightening thing out there is ourselves.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Not to be overlooked but....,"Jack IS the film. Let me start by saying that i am no fan of Steven King, but the fact that Nicholson is ion this one, makes it more than worth seeing. For all you King fans who whine about it being different than the book, DUH! That's what Hollywood does. But it only helps. The problem with this film is that the mother (Shelly Duvall) and the kid (Danny Lloyd) are so damned annoying by their bad acting and that women's bug-eyed histrionic whining of hers that I was rooting for Jack Torrance to get them with the damn ax.I almost wish one could take Rebecca DeMornay and Courtland Mead from the miniseries and put them in THIS one. There is a particularly beautifully done scene that literally had me on the edge of my seat in the maze of hedges at the Overlook Hotel. Just the fact that Kubrick found a way to go from a shot of the miniature of the hedges to the actual hedges was just mind blowing for me. And the changes from the book (pay attention Steven King Fans) were GREAT! This made it a surprise even for those who had read the book. I won't give away the surprised for those who have not yet seen the film.Anyway, there are some genuinely frightening scenes in this horror epic and it still beats the hell out of the crop of slice and dice films calling themselves horror today.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Kubrick vs King,"I'm a Kubrick fan and I adore his movies. But I didn't like the Shining very much. Probably it's because I'm a Stephen King fan as well.In the book, you can understand every detail and the story makes better sense. But in the movie everything was so shoddy.You can't even understand how Jack went crazy.You can't see how the hotel makes him one of it's slaves. He just goes crazy.What I mean is, the major role belongs to the hotel, but it has a very limited part in the movie.If you haven't read the book, you can enjoy the movie. Because it's not a bad one. It has very scary scenes actually. But like I said before I didn't like it because there was nothing from the book.Overall, it's a good movie, you won't hate when you see it, but if you've read the book, you may be disappointed a little bit.P.S:I hated Shelley Duvall when I saw the movie.Her sound and her weird behaviours..There should have been a more ""normal"" person instead of Shelly Duvall.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
A remarkable masterpiece,"Slammed by the critics upon its release, both Kubrick & Duvall were Razzie-nominated, and Stephen King hated it. Yet the director's cut is a masterpiece, one of those rare examples of a movie being better than the book it's based on. It's a film to watch, a film to experience, a film to study. Right from the opening sequence, it is chillingly artistic. The Shining has actually undergone a remarkable public reappraisal over the past three decades. It was initially seen as Kubrick's first sell-out movie, a popcorn flick guaranteed to make a pile of money after the box-office debacle of his last movie (Barry Lyndon).",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Kubrick Mastered Horror,"I finished reading Stephen King's classic last night, so it only seemed right to re-watch my favorite horror movie of all-time: Stanley Kubrick's blood pulping adaptation of, The Shining.I unreservedly understand why King detests this movie now. I mean, if my work was tampered like this, I would assuredly be pissed. But I'm not the author, so I have the potential to relish this malicious braintwister. The book is beyond any doubt, better in terms of its story components and character developments. Having said that, I think Kubrick's revamp handles its horror ingrediants more psychologically, and arguably, more dexterously.The main reason I personally think that, The Shining, towers over any other horror movie in existence, is because of the methods the film employs while incorporating the soundtrack into the sequences. The vital timing, the detail to tension, and the evolution of the music is key to exhibiting such an excruciating feeling of angst.Here are a couple other noteworthy techniques that make, The Shining, stand from the crowd: The impulsive snap-zooms, the one-take stalking shots, Jack's topsy-turvey facial expressions/mannerisms, Danny's interactions with ""Tony"", Jack's unexplained link to the Overlook Hotel, the interlacing cuts of multiple scenes, the drawn-out, gripping, one-on-one dialogue segments, and the spontaneous imageries.Like I divulged before in my recent review of Luca Guadagnino's, Suspiria, the modules that make horror movies scary are the ones that fiddle with normality. Tinkering with what is morally ethical or what is bearable is what makes a film frightening. The Shining deviates from convention more flawlessly than any other thriller out there.Kubrick may have butchered King's vision but, in doing so, generated the most effective horror movie to date due to his atypical perception. The Shining is the definitive sugar-daddy of the entourage of cinematic fear factors that came after it. (Verdict: A+)",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"

stanley + kubrick = horror legend,"""The Shining"" is one of the most chilling and memorable horror movies I've seen, and I have seen a lot of horror flicks. The movie follows a writer (Jack Nicholson) and his family who agree to watch over a hotel while it is closed for the winter. There were rumours of the place being haunted and the last resident went crazy and murdered his family. But Jack is convinced it will be OK and he can use the quiet to overcome his writer's block. After months of solitude and silence however, Jack becomes a grumpy and later violent. Is it cabin fever or is there something in the hotel that is driving him mad? One of the creepiest parts about the movie is the feeling of isolation that Kubrick makes. The hotel is very silent, and the rooms are huge, yet always empty. It is also eerily calm when Jack's son is riding his bike through the barren hallways. Jack Nicholson's performance is also one of his very best, scaring the hell out of me and making me sure to get out once in awhile. My favourite scene is when he is talking to a ghost from inside a walk-in refrigerator. The Shining is tops for horror movies in my opinion, beating the snot out of crap like the Ring and The Blair Witch Project. It may be a oldie, but is definitely a Good. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Highly overrated and only somewhat enjoyable,"Arriving at a secluded mountainside hotel, a man and his wife intending to take care of the establishment during the winter find that the stay there causes them to fall foul of mysterious supernatural forces in the hotel and must find a way of getting out alive.This here turned out to be quite a rather dull and overblown effort without a whole lot to really like. The most detrimental and rather unimpressive element featured here is the film's simple storyline that doesn't really allow it any kind of semblance to being a horror film as the psychological implications generate very little shocks or actual supernatural scenarios. The shots of the family arriving at the hotel and being shown around the grounds, procrastinating while he's trying to write and the continuous shots of him simply staring off into space as the camera tries to make us think he's building towards insanity is mostly pretty laughable as there's little explanation for anything throughout here. These scenes by themselves aren't considered normal horror scares for a reason in that they play more like the activities that occur in a drama which is what it feels like more often than anything, as despite the few times it really tries to swing things over into the horrific it's mostly window-dressing against the more common drama elements that are put into play far more often in here. Those scenes make it difficult to fully understand many other horror efforts present in the later half where it starts getting into the full-on effects of the meltdown which makes no sense, and that furthers another big highly problematic effort here in that the film is completely unsure about what's actually happening to him. Though it makes small mention of the building being on top of the burial ground, there's so much unsure here about the outline of events that cause him to become such an unstable maniac when there's so many other elements coming into play here to account for that change. Going from the idea of the burial ground to the concept of the tormenting spirits and then finally his own mental instability is a continuous series of explanations for what's going on gives this such a tonal shift with each explanation that it's nearly impossible to figure out what's going on to him as it really makes a case for any of them rather than signaling which one it's going for as a logical explanation. There's also little explanation here for what the purpose of the special cognition powers he has, which are so integral to the film yet there's little about what they actually are, where it comes from or what he's doing with such skills to begin with as it never really ties into how the film manages to tie into the possible story lines for the explanation of the supernatural events taking place here. With a finale that also doesn't make any sense tacked on for no real reason, these here are what hold this back over the few small areas that work. One of the film's better aspects is the atmosphere present, as the main reason for that is the hotel itself which is so massive and creepy that much of the suspense and atmosphere is caused by just seeing the hotel. All to often it takes up so much space and the characters are so small compared to it that an already massive building looks even bigger than it really is. With a powerhouse finale that includes the film's only real suspenseful moments and attitude toward action, they're enough to help this somewhat but not enough to overcome the flaws.Rated R: Graphic Language, Graphic Violence, full Nudity and scenes with children in danger.",5.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"

A Perfect Experience,"Since I first saw this movie in high school it's constantly been among my favorite horror films of all time. Even before I sat down to rewatch this film (for the umpteenth time) I knew that I'd give this movie five stars. It's chilling, disturbing, disquieting, and altogether unsettling from start to finish- and by the time the climax comes, you're nerves are begging you for a break. This is a film that even thirty-five years after it's release, still has a way of making me hold my breath in certain scenes. Nicholson is absolutely terrifying, and the way that Kubrick has created the world of the Overlook Hotel makes the place a labyrinth of horrors where surprises wait around every corner.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Mismatch of style and content,"The Shining is characteristic of Kubrik's slow, almost glacial, cinematic rhythm, with events unfolding over a long time scale. This worked magnificently well in 2001, but even by A Clockwork Orange was beginning to become a mannerism. The drawn out nature of Barry Lyndon is one of the points against it, but it could be argued that such an approach works better in a horror film like The Shining where anticipation really is half the fun.Kubrik has a painter's eye for details such as colour, texture and lighting and all his films are visually stunning, The Shining (and the equally flawed Barry Lyndon) being no exception. Some scenes are breath taking and the overall look and atmosphere of the film is exceptional.However these atmospheric sequences are used to cover deficiencies in the plot. Nicholson goes from normal (as normal as he ever is) to hallucinating nut in one quick step. It all seems too easy. Some schlock horror clichés (creepy twins, dead bodies, rivers of blood) are no substitute for what should have been a subtle and gradual descent into madness.Without that psychological subtlety, the film becomes a series of familiar horror scenes: An 'old dark house'; a man who turns up to help only to be brutally killed; a final conventional chase. We've seen it all before and it is not surprising that the original audiences and the author himself were unimpressed.Another issue is the music. We are used to Kubrik using classical pieces in a new and unusual fashion, the blue Danube during a space flight, for instance, or the Thieving Magpie during a fight. Here, he merely selects a series of creepy and atmospheric pieces in the hope they will impart creepiness and atmosphere to what would be very ordinary scenes. In effect, Kubrik piggybacks on the work of the composers.Kubrik even recycles the scrunched-up face close-ups from A Clockwork Orange too, with less purpose here. It does not help that the kid is not much of an actor, but he is not to blame really, since no child deserves to have the full weight of a film placed upon him. But Shelley Duvall's performance is truly awful, so wooden that I can hardly believe it. Scatman Crothers puts in the best turn, but is sadly not in it enough to make a difference.But then perhaps we should not be too critical of Duvall, being as she was, required to act scenes over and over while Kubrik tries to realise the vision of clinical perfection he was apparently aiming at.This is certainly the work of a great artist in decline.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"

kinda boring by 2022 standards.,"I watched this for the first time in 2022 after hearing about how it was ""the greatest horror movie of all time"" and how scary it is. Unfortunately, it disappointed me and was boring at parts. By 2022 standards it is not scary at all. The acting by shelly duvall and jack nicholson was amazing and most cinematography was good (except for the dramatic, slow zoom ins which made me laugh). I appreciate the work that went into this movie and the practical special effects but overall I left disappointed. Also, the child actor danny made me cringe in every scene he was in. I'm glad I watched it since it's a classic but it's not a movie I'd watch again or recommend to any modern horror movie fans.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"

King + Kubrick + Nicholson = great horror,"Today it is very hard to catch a good horror movie, so we all have to remember some true horror classics. ""The Shining"" is definitely a horror classic and also a King's classic. Stephen King wrote many excellent books and I think that this is maybe best translation of King's book on screen. ""Misery"", ""The Shawshank Redemptione"", ""The Green Mile"", ""Carrie"", ""Secret Window"" and others are also great but we have to consider that this is one of the first 'King' movies. Back in 1980. one very special director managed to make one very special movie. Of course I'm talking about Stanley Kubrick and ""The Shining"". Kubrick managed to create fear that book has (brilliant scenes when Danny is riding his bike through the empty hotel and that sound of wheels). He managed to make the atmosphere and he scared us all. His camera is great and this movie is a result of his genius. Music is creepy, Danny's imaginary voice is creepy (Tony), Overlook Hotel is creepy and Jack Nicholson is the king of creepiness. He is perfect for the role of Jack Torrance. With his crazy eyes, attitude and personality, he makes brilliant portrait of a man who gets insane as the time passes. I don't like Shelley Duvall but I have to admit she was good. She was very convincing and she behaved like every ordinary person, in her position, would behave. All my compliments goes to Danny Lloyd too, cause he was very young and yet he acted so well. To all you horror lovers and to all movie lovers. This one is for you. You don't need to watch most of todays crappy horrors. Just watch ""The Shining"" and prepare yourself for one twisted story.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Peep This Reviews,"The most cerebral horror movie ever. It's more of an interpretation than an adaptation of the Stephen King novel. Easily one of the best and most effective horror film ever made, yet there is a very small body count but lots of blood. It's eye-witnessing a man's slow descent into absolute madness. One of Kubrick's best. Transcends true terror into art.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Greatest Horror Movie Ever,"This movie scared my pants off. Right off. I seriously can't find em'. This is the best horror movie ever made. I know it's my opinion, but I'm always right. And that's a fact.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
The creeping horror of the Overlook hotel.,"What in my opinion makes truly a great director is a person who can direct different movies in different genres and make them all equally work out as great ones. Stanley Kubrick was truly one of those directors. He did science-fiction, drama, comedy, war movies, documentaries and basically everything else in between. With ""The Shining"" he delivered his only horror production, which is among his best movies. But then again; is there really truly such a thing as a bad Kubrick movie in the first place?Yes, if you haven't noticed, I'm a real Kubrick fan. Looking back at his career, he probably was the greatest director that ever lived and he delivered masterpieces over the course of 5 decades. Not a whole lot of directors can say that. But even more remarkable is that he always sustained his own style. Each and ever of his movies have the same feeling and approach to it, which isn't necessarily following all of the 'Hollywood-rules'. He always continued doing his own thing, which makes all of his movies very consistent with each other, as well as unique and originals ones, due to its uncommon approach.Also this movie really isn't a very typical horror movie. It's very slow in its build up, which at the same time is also the movie its biggest strength. If you have to compare this movie to anything else it probably would be Robert Wise's ""The Haunting"", which features a sort of similar concept and build up and just like ""The Shining"", was an unique and unusual horror movie for its time.Its slow build up ensures that the movie has a constant feeling of tension and danger looming over it. You never know when a person is going to snap or when something creepy will happen. It makes ""The Shining"" a real unsettling movie to watch, which is one of the biggest compliments you could give any horror movie.The approach and build up of the movie also ensures that this movie is true beautiful one to look at. The hotel and the eeriness of its emptiness and remoteness gets captured really well on film. They really found the perfect locations for this movie. The movie features some real great cinematography in it, especially the steadicam work really contributes to the movie its many great moments.The movie probably also features Jack Nicholson's most definitive role in it. Yes, he has played some truly great and memorable roles and characters over the years but his performance as Jack Torrance is probably his most recognizable and best known one. But also the very young Danny Lloyd was real great. He acts very natural and acts like a true kid of his age, which is something not a whole lot of horror movies are able to get right. All of the characters in this movie feel and behave very natural and also interact that way with each other. All of their relations feel real, which is also one of the powerful aspects of this movie.In my opinion a movie everyone should watch at least once in their lifetime.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Master Piece.,"The Shining is one of my favourite films and I am not just saying that because of my obsession with Jack Nicholson. This film is a piece of art from start to finish. It is perfection in every way, flawless.Jack and Shelley work together perfectly on screen.Kubrick breathed such life into the King novel. I will never understand why King did not like the adaption. What Kubrick did was to create something far superior. He had The Shining anointed by the gods.The cinematography is breathtaking. There will never be another Kubrick. He knew how to get everything just perfect and he knew how to get what he needed out of his actors.You can sit there and dissect every detail of The Shining, because believe me I try. What is Kubrick hiding? Is he hiding things?We will never know. All we can know is that this film is a piece of art and it should be celebrated as next to The Exorcist the greatest horror film ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
May be a good thriller back that time ..,"With the low frequency string, the movie start on a family with a deliberate husband searching for job hoping that will give the isolation and environment for his writing with a homemaker wife and a little son who talks to his own calling to a character Tony.The casting for the wife is a interesting one. The cast makes the character is physically weak, and not of a great beauty that adds to the disinterest of Torrance in his life. The conversation between the couple shows her as always trivial with Torrance making her puny. When this family goes to a isolated hotel for maintaining it through out the winter which already has spooky history. During the period Torrance turns insane and attempts to murder his own family.But there is no real shots or space in the script that shows the change in the character of him, how insanity acquired him with the isolation and obsession on his writing. The concept of shinning that was fresh in the movie and having a positive ending with determinant Wendy Torrance character are aspects that can looked on the movie .",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"

An old thriller; Jack Nicholson & Danny Lloyd make it worthwhile!,"One of those old classics among thriller/ horror genre! Nearly three decades old and over two hours long, the only thing that can keep you glued to the screen is Jack Nicholson’s mesmeric performance while the eerie setting of a lonely hotel in the hills, everything around covered in snow and an untold story of death complete the picture.Jack Torrance (Nicholson) a writer doubles up as a school teacher to make ends meet. When a position opens up as a caretaker at the Overlook Hotel in the mountains that closes down for the entire winter, Jack grabs the opportunity knowing fully well that a decade ago, one of his kind failed to handle the solitude and murdered his two daughters with an axe and then drowned his wife before shooting himself.Joining Jack in his sojourn are his wife Wendy (Shelly Duvall), a fan of horror flicks and son Danny (Danny Lloyd). The little boy though seems to have visions of Overlook’s past and flowing blood. A casual chat with Chef Hallorann (Scatman Crothers) reveals that he too like Danny can foresee things and know unspoken words, a skill that is called “shining” here and is adequately demonstrated at significant turns in the film.The long winter soon gets on Jack’s nerves as he is seen to be visibly stressed by his work and the loneliness of winter. As is must in horror flicks, he soon starts talking to the dead who tell him that he was always the hotel’s manager and compel him to ‘correct’ his son and wife who seem to guard themselves from the ominous. Hallorann, meanwhile envisions the happenings from Miami and flies down to save them.While Jack Nicholson is an accomplished performer par excellence, Danny Lloyd thoroughly shines in his role. Be it his conversations with the imaginary Tony or his curious cycling around the hotel, chance encounters with the dead girls, his visions of death and the spooky humming of ‘Red-Rum’ which is read backwards as ‘Murder’. Shelly Duvall as the mom already looks spooky and is a fine fit for her role.Based on the book by Stephen King, Stanley Kubrick the experienced Horror director makes sure that “The Shining” has its moments. Danny’s cycling scenes, sudden appearance of ghosts, conversations with them and the silent emptiness of locale are done well. The chase sequence in the snow-laden giant garden-maze is apt too. Despite its length, the performances will keep you glued to it. Worthwhile on DVD!",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Am I the only one?,"This movies was horrible.  It was not scary at all, it was the most terrible movie ever... I hated it.

When I first rented it I thought it was gonna be all that great and scary for me to eat with my popcorn and comment it with my friends later, but the only thing that happened was laughter all over the place... TERRIBLE MOVIE... Well, for anyone who thought this movies was good..whatever, I got nothing against your opinions, but for me... never seen worse.

Thank God for Jack Nicholson,"Overrated by the cult of Kubrick. The highlights for me are Jack Nicholson's mesmerizing performance, the excellent score, and wonderful cinematography with wonderful visuals. Definitely worth seeing for Nicholson's performance.

The Shining,"This is the 1980 movies and when I saw its poster I immediately remembered and related the Jack Nicholson's photo that matched the poster of this movie. This was the poster that was on a book  Top 1000 movies to see before you die. I read the reviews of this movie  good and bad both; especially those who hated the movie were those who had read the book. I was fortunate that I saw the moving without reading the book. This helps in enjoying it more.So this was my opportunity to see the movie. The prior knowledge that this movie is a horror movie is not a good thing to know, because one pre-conditions one mind to prepare for seeing something horror  and that is the drawback of our minds.The story is based on Stephen King's novel  The Shining. It is about a hotel in US that remains closed during winter snowing for six months. The author Jack Torrence (Jack Nicholson), wants to go to an isolated place to write a new book and remove the writer's block. He is selected as a care-taker for 6 months of this hotel, and plans to go with his wife (Shelley Duvall) and son (Danny Lloyd). In the beginning they are very happy and excited to be in this enormous place with nobody around. But as time passes Jack starts becoming insane due to these isolation, and the ghosts of the hotel inspire him to kill his son.The movie mostly revolves around these three characters, but there are two more big characters in the movies  the sound track and camera work. The knowledge of this being a horror movie  makes us view every scene with an expectation of something will happen, and that is what creates a feeling of tension. A simple shot of child driving his small tricycle in the empty corridors of the hotel is chilling to say the least. The child stopping and looking at the half open door  is enormously terrifying than seeing a crude make-up ghost in drab movies like Evil Dead etc.The director  Stanley Kubrick has not used night scenes, dark images, shocking editing, sudden entry, loud bangs to awake us to realize it is a horror movie. But he uses subtle consistent musical score that builds up on your nerves. The opening long shots of the journey to the mountain are breath-taking.Jack Nicholson is as his usual self. He has his own style and whims. Anyways as always he has acted well. Shelley Duvall brings life to her role as a typical housewife  who is modest, next door looks, and humane to protect her husband and son; and Danny Lloyd is the best (he actually won the best supporting actor's award) in his role and portrayed the child's character brilliantly.A trivia I read was that Danny Lloyd did not know that he is working in a horror movie  while shooting was on, and even after 2 years on  he did not know it. He just acted in one more movie before retiring to routine life.I consider this movie very similar to Omen in creating fear  without using the commercial gimmick of horror movies. Now I can venture to read the book. People say that the book is better than the movie. So I can enjoy it more! (Stars 7.5 out of 10)",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
Not a big horror person sorry....,"Not a big horror person sorry. Jack Nicholson plays Jack Torrance. Nicholson is a master actor, even nearly thirty years ago he was brilliant on screen and although his performance and character doesn't really match that of the novel he is still a decent choice for Torrance. The problem is Kubrick doesn't give Nicholson any depth to his character at all. So he gets to show sane, and then completely insane with nothing in the middle. Still it's easy to see why Nicholson's performance is so memorable because he is terrific. Shelley Duvall might be one of the worst actresses I've ever seen and casting her in this role might be one of the worst decisions I've ever seen. She is god-awful in this role and not to be mean but MAN is she ugly...holy crap. She was nominated for a Razzie for this role and I usually hate the Razzie's but they were dead on for this performance. She doesn't come close to fulfilling King's novel version of Wendy and she's just terrible in the role. Her facial expressions and downright hilarious acting makes her performance really, really awful. In his one and only performance on the big screen Danny Lloyd plays young Danny Torrance with a certain mundaneness. I mean I give him enormous credit for the scenes where he's ""talking to Tony"" and his belting out ""REDRUM"" which still gives me nightmares but apparently Kubrick shielded him even knowing he was in a horror movie (which surprises me and I gain a little respect for Kubrick for doing that.) Still Lloyd's performance is just adequate, nothing really huge about it. Overall 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Horror"
