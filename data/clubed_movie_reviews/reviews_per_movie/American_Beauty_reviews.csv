An Oscar well deserved.,"This film is one of a kind.  After seeing this film last week, I was left with a hole in the pit of my stomach.  It left many questions in my mind, and most of them cannot be answered. In my view, a film that makes me think after I watch it is second-to-none, and this film certainly delivers in that aspect.I was amazed with the vivid imagery in this movie, as well as with the symbolism.  However, what makes this film the best of 1999 is the acting. Kevin Spacey shines as Lester Burnham, and Annette Bening (Carolyn Burnham) isn't far behind.  Supporting cast members such as Wes Bentley (Ricky Fitts), Thora Birch (Jane Burnham), Mena Suvari (Angela Hayes), and Chris Cooper (Col. Frank Fitts) only add to the drama of this film.  I think the most special aspect of this film is how all of the characters intertwine in a way that is believable, yet fantastic at the same time.  I congratulate Sam Mendes for his direction of this film, as well as Alan Ball for writing it.  I don't think it could have been any better.Rated R in the U.S. for strong sexuality, language, drug content, and violence, the film obviously deserves its rating.  However, none of the causes for the R rating are overbearing, and all of them add to the plot-line of this film.  While I don't think that this is a film for children, I would suggest that adults should view it with an open mind.  I believe that the traits which many of the characters in this film have are found in many people around the world. Perhaps that is why this film hits close to home for so many viewers.While billed by some as a ""comedy-drama"", I don't see anything about this film as funny.  Sure, there are some comedic moments, but by the end, those moments were all but forgotten when faced with the grim reality of the conclusion of the events portrayed in this film.If you want to watch a light-hearted film with some elements of comedy and some elements of drama, don't see American Beauty.  But if you enjoy films that make you think, and are entertained by an excellent cast, excellent directing, and an excellent screenplay, this film should be at the top of your list.My Rating:  10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"A deep, wonderful, penetrating film; extraordinary irony in a psychological drama about the American life.","I have come to see the movie with a certain prejudice.  Everyone saying that it was so wonderful, so touching, so excited -- I usually tend to go with movies that nobody likes.  Nevertheless, this one was a certain exception.It is a wonderful psychological drama, a satire about the American community and about the American life; dark, painful irony and cynicism in the descriptions of life and characters; deep sarcasm on types of people in the community, habits of behaviour such as ""...if you want to succeed, you always have to seem successful..."" or ""never stop smiling"", parasites of the community, and, most importantly, the treatment of people who are ""different"", who are ""freaky"" to some extent; and eventually, there is no character in the film that is not odd in its way, although we have to wait for the very ending of the film, to discover this.With very deep and accurate exaggeration, (most of) the characters in the movie demonstrate the worst, the darkest sides of their personality, while still remaining very human, very touching and very involving the observer. Everyone can find a certain similarity with characters and persons who he met in his life, in the characters described in the film.  The tragi-comical events, the little pieces of funny, disturbing irony dripping from almost every episode, lead the observer to exploration of the American Beauty -- the beauty in life, and the way that we fail to find it, for all our life; the way we hide our feelings and emotions, even behind sullen walls of our sepulchre.The acting is truly brilliant, the episodes are built logically, coherently, the dialogues are deep, thrilling, intriguing; every sentence and every word is deeply constructed, containing profound irony and intelligent elements of humors.  The plot is very intelligently built, constructing a true indication of the sad situation of the American society, and an excellent ground for the actors.An amazing movie, strongly recommended.  10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
A little masterpiece...,"""American Beauty"" is tour de force cinema. Sam Mendes' brilliant debut feature depicts a web of characters who yearn for their own 'American Dream' - yet, in the end, only one character truly attains it.Having seen ""Happiness"" only recently, I could not help but draw comparisons: both films centre around a microcosm of society in which the people, in their own unique way, all strive to be successful or simply 'happy'. But here the similarities end: the characters in ""Happiness"" undergo a self-realisation process through which they become increasingly aware of their meaningless existence, and go on to wallow in their own depravity. ""Happiness"" shows no signs of redemption; whereas in ""American Beauty"" the audience is offered a sense of hope, of salvation, though the characters must endure a similar fate, or more accurately, they must endure the way of life in which they are trapped.The pivotal character upon which this theme centres, is the father Lester, played impeccably by Kevin Spacey. He is presented to us as a bit of a loser who plays the subjugated figure in the home and at work. He appears resigned to an unhappy life in which he is treated badly by his wife and daughter and his boss at work. Seemingly beyond redemption, Lester transforms from being a loser.Mendes portrays this transformation admirably well: he shows Lester on his 'path to enlightenment' pushed up against a grim background of suburbanite existence. These early scenes are well balanced, forming a steady rhythm of TV commercial-like vignettes which prove very comical, if at times unsettling. As Lester reflects in the film: ""My life is like a commercial"". And how this rings true: like in ""Happiness"", all the characters hide underneath this veneer of normality and respectability, yet they are all revealed to be nothing but the opposite: depressed, depraved and desperate.Lester's wife, played by Annette Benning, is the most success-driven character in the story which renders her the most hopeless in the film's tone of moral conviction. ""In order to be successful in life one must project the appearance of success"" is the maxim she adopts from the 'king' of real estate, Buddy King. It is a phrase which resonates throughout the film: for Benning's pawn, life is all about keeping-up appearances. This is where Lester differs from her: his emancipation is enabled by him discarding the constraints of 'normal life' and following what his heart desires.Lester is the catalyst in this narrative in which the ancillary characters either follow suit (as does his daughter and Ricky) or pay the price (as does his wife and the Colonel). The irony inherent in this film, and it grows with resonance as the film draws to a conclusion, is that the only character who truly becomes free must sacrifice everything in order to achieve it. Yet it is through his sacrifice that he is able to afford the surviving characters a glimpse of hope in life.This film left me gasping for air: its hyper-realism conveys, at the same time, a portrait of the suburban comedy, a jolting-shock of realisation, and a cathartic sense of hope. Mendes depicts a certain people who, to varying degrees, all strive for a certain 'American Dream', yet so few actually attain it. Though whilst one may have difficulty with tagging this film with the 'feel good' label, the beauty of ""American Beauty"" is that it sits half-way between a desperate cry for help and a reassuring sense of happiness and fulfilment and that is cinema at its best.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
a very well done film that continues to amaze me...,"When I first saw this movie in theaters, I found it to be very funny. When I rented it at home, I found it to be very sad and complex. Looking at it now, I realize that it is surely one of the most extraordinary films ever to come out of Hollywood. To some it may look trite or cliched, or maybe too un-ordinary to be worthy of its praise, but the overall impact of this film is extremely powerful. After you've seen it, you know you've seen something.A few notable elements stand out. The direction is superb; this is visually a superior film, for the director understands the subtle changes in tone. The writing is equally compelling; the story effortlessly interweaves multiple stories to create one amazing movie. The haunting music is also notable. Lastly is the acting. Kevin Spacey has done excellent films before, and he can add this one to the list. He may be a little to witty to suggest the overshadowed character he portrays, but he simply disappears into the role. Annette Bening is also fine; a less strong role, but she is magnificent none the less. As the teenagers, Thora Birch is able to mesmerize us with one intense look; her ""typical teenager"" role is fleshed out completely. I enjoyed Mena Suvari's character equally. It seemed that she did not receive as much acclaim, but her performance evokes both innocence and experience, and her scenes toward the end give her a depth unlike any other character. And Wes Bentley, as the video-taping boy next door, is easily the most original character. At first he seems a little tense, but, like Spacey, he sinks into the role. His ""purpose"" in the film, unlike anyone else's, is a mystery, thus making him the most enigmatic person.Most films are able to make a lasting impression on its audience, but never has a movie been known to ""move"" its viewers as much as this movie. It truly says something about life, no matter how predictable or tacky it appears, this film disturbingly shows us how to appreciate our individual lives, so therefore, when they are over, we each have something to remember.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"The closer I look, the worse it gets","I first saw this in theaters back in 1999.  I loved it.  I really really loved it.  I've seen it four or five times since, and each time, I like it less.  I just saw it again a couple of days ago, and I stopped it before it was over.  At that moment, I decided to sell my DVD.  It has now been excised from my DVD Collection, about which I have considerable pride.The main reason is that I have come to feel very strongly that this film doesn't know what it wants to say.  It takes a bunch of characters, constructs various relationships between them, and sets them loose to run around for two hours, at the end of which, what have we learned?I've heard lots of people make comparisons between this film and another highly acclaimed movie of 1999 which I hate:  Fight Club.  Both films include philosophically flimsy but highly entertaining critiques of materialism.  With Fight Club, the critique on materialism is made by the character who turns out to be the villain of the piece, who seeks to replace it with fascism.  In American Beauty, the anti-consumerist is, first of all, a total hypocrite, and second of all, has a life changing epiphany the moment before his death, but never gets a chance to expound upon what that epiphany was.On the hypocrisy charge, consider the oft-quoted scene when Lester Burnham (magnificently portrayed by Kevin Spacey) yells at his wife Carolyn (played in an over-the-top caricature by Annette Bening) for placing too high a value on material things, in this case, a sofa.  Fine.  He makes a good point.  No one else seems to have noticed, however, that this is precisely the same scene where it is revealed that Lester has bought a 1970 Pontiac Firebird.  Since we at no time see Lester enjoying the use of his car, the implication is that possession of the object is a good in itself, which is the very apex of materialism.There are lots of other things that we don't see, and I never noticed until I ""looked closer"" how conspicuous they are in their absence.  We never see Angela or Jane don a cheerleading uniform after their initial cheerleading scene.  They never make any reference to being cheerleaders.  The whole concept of cheerleading, then, is merely a mechanism (and quite a contrived, not to mention cliched mechanism at that) to introduce Lester to Angela.I also noticed, when I looked closer, how painfully bad much of the dialogue given to the younger characters is.  ""Lame-o""  ""Geekboy""  ""Take a whizz"" It's just horrid.  And why, exactly, was Jane looking at a breast augmentation website?  First of all, her breasts don't appear to need augmenting (when I saw this in theaters, I thought she must want to reduce her breasts, but upon looking closer, the computer monitor clearly says ""augmentation"", which means a process of adding to).The worst flaw of the film, by far, is the fact that we have one horrible cliche repeated twice in the space of minutes in the final act.  The homophobic marine turns out to be a repressed homosexual, and the slutty cheerleader turns out to be a virgin.  For the love of God, who let those two howlers slip through.  Bad enough that either made the final cut, but both?!!  It defies understanding.The scene that made me turn the film off, this final time that I watched it, was the scene were Jane and Ricky decide to run off together.  I was never very comfortable with this scene, because, call me conservative, I'm just not thrilled about a girl dropping out of school at the tender age of seventeen (or so) and running off with her drug dealer boyfriend.  But what really got my goat was when Ricky ridiculed Angela by calling her ordinary. Fair enough, Angela had it coming.  But for Ricky to not only accept Angela's principle that ordinariness is bad, but to use it against her... that bothered me.  Ordinariness or lack thereof is not a valid criterion for judging the worth of a human being.  Ricky, having been set up (clumsily) as a heroic character, shouldn't have descended to such a twisted and hateful principle.The whole film has the feel of having been made up as it went along.  It is radically different from how it was originally planned to go.  The prelude sequence and the scene later in the film which it foreshadowed have become utterly pointless since the removal of the subplot about Jane and Ricky being blamed for Lester's murder.  Now, that subplot is a bit ridiculous, and was cut for a good reason, I agree.  But why leave the set up if you're cutting the payoff?  [Notice that Ricky shuts off the camera before Jane says ""You know I'm joking, right?""]The sequence where Col. Fitts spies on Ricky and Lester is straight out of ""Three's Company.""  Fitts sees just enough to draw the conclusion that the writer wants him to draw, and nothing else.  That's a classic example (and the most blatant I can recall from any film) of bad, contrived plotting. What exactly was up with Mrs. Fitts?  Presumably, her scenes meant something in some previous, unreleased version of the story.  The initial meeting between Lester and Ricky is built on numerous coincidences... Ricky just happens to be working there, and he works there just long enough to meet Lester!!!  And what self-respecting drug dealer would give a man $2,000 worth of merchandise on the assumption that he'd be willing/able to pay for it later?  It would have been more contrived if Lester happened to have $2,000 in cash while jogging, but ""I know you're good for it"" isn't much better.This film is ambitious.  There are lots of individual pieces of greatness in it.  There are a lot of really good ideas.  But on a fundamental level, it just doesn't work.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
Beautiful...,"Probably the best film of 1999. This dark comedy drama marks two fantastic feature film debuts with Alan Ball as writer and Sam Mendes as director (both winning oscars for their sterling efforts).Kevin Spacey plays Lester Burnham, a man on the brink of a mid-life crisis, who suddenly becomes obsessed with one of his teenage daughters friends played by Mena Suvari. His daughter (Thora Birch) is, as Lester tells us; ""a typical teenager. Angry, insecure, confused..."". And his wife Caroline (Annette Bening) has an obsession of her own, her public appearance.Life starts off on a downer for the Burnhams and their new neighbours the Fitts despite their lives looking good from the outside.As life begins to improve (with most of the main characters finding what they think is love or new relationships) it soon all comes crashing down in the climactic final day.The writing is nothing short of brilliant and made even more amazing by knowing that it comes from a first time feature film screen writer Alan Ball (who had had years of prior experience writing TV sitcoms -  not  that you'd be able to guess from the tone of this film).The directing is on a par with the writing and Sam Mendes manages to get some brilliant performances from the great cast, who are all faultless. No doubt Mendes' theatre directing past played a huge part in directing the actors so well.Another person worthy of a mention is the late director of photography Conrad L. Hall, another one of the five oscar recipients for this film.All the elements in this film gel perfectly together to make one superb masterpiece. Not one person, either cast or crew, steals this film or does anymore than anyone else to make this film what it is. Truly an ensemble effort. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Overrated. Spacey is good, as always.",This should not be in the top 100 movies of all time. The acting is good but it's not even Kevin Spacey's best. The plot is often forced and many characters are left undeveloped. The dialogue is so-so. Anyone that calls this a 10 or the best movie of all time is likely pretentious or dumb. Perhaps they want to be deep but just don't actually know what is or isn't deep. Also the score is downright terrible.,6.0,Anonymous,Drama
The Danger Of Dissatisfaction....A Christian's View On Why This Movie Is A Masterpiece.,"I first saw American Beauty when I was 17, about 8 years ago. It was interesting, but the plot was a bit creepy. But as time went on, I grew to appreciate the movie, and it's now one of my absolute favorite movies.American Beauty is about a 42-year-old man named Lester Burnham, played by Kevin Spacey. He's in his mid-life crisis, and he hates his life. He hates his job, his realtor wife argues with him and they don't have sex (she even has an affair with another realtor), and his daughter Jane and him have a broken relationship.Lester does not like any aspect of his life, and says that choking the chicken (to be less crass) in the shower is the highlight of his day. But then he meets a friend of Jane's named Angela, a gorgeous 17-year-old who, he thinks, will be the key to his satisfaction.American Beauty has a clever way of showing desire- the color red. The Burnham's have a red door- their house is one of desire for happiness. Carolyn even cuts perfect roses in a covetness for happiness.When Lester lusts for Angela, we see rose petals surrounding her in his fantasies. When he has a chance with her near the end, we see roses near them. And when he sees what he truly desires, we see roses again. These are just a handful of examples for Lester.His wife Carolyn desires sex, but can't get it. At the dinner table, roses are in-between her and Lester, showing that she can't reach what she desires. But when she cheats on Lester, we then see them eat together with no roses on the table. Instead, Carolyn wears a shirt with a rose pattern. She got what she desired, while Lester has not- the roses are further away from him.These clever symbols kind of tell their own story, and enhance the one told plainly.As a Christian, and simply a person with morals, I remember how uncomfortable I was with the movie when I first saw it. Lust is a sin, how can I admire a movie that, while well-made, is about a married man lusting over a teenager?However, the more I watched it, the more I realized that this immorality makes it one of the most moral movies I have ever seen.You see, American Beauty is a story about the danger of dissatisfaction- with your marriage, with your job, with your life. That greed and dissatisfaction leads to downfall- to lust, to adultery, to greed, to immoral behavior, to selfishness.When we look to God or selflessness instead of material things to be happy, then life has more meaning, more meaning than ogling over teenagers or getting a new car or job. We learn this from Lester's actions, and it's not too late for us.American Beauty is a dark, unhappy movie. But it's a powerful and thought-provoking movie too, one that makes you think about it long after you watch it.The tagline of the movie is ""look closer."" When you do, American Beauty has an effective message to give- the danger of dissatisfaction.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
An American Masterpiece,"This is by far one of the best, if not THE, movies of the 90's. ""American Beauty"" stole my vote immediately as I started watching it. The idea and concept of ""American Beauty"" is just some ordinary people on an ordinary block with ordinary lives.Kevin Spacey plays Lester Burnam, a middle aged married man who has lost some hope in life. He has a job that is degrading, a wife who refuses to show any type of loving emotion towards him, a daughter who practically hates herself, and is judged constantly as a looser. But all of a sudden, he sees his daughter's friend, Angela, and something snaps in him to do something with his life. He quits his job and takes, the dreaded by most Americans, a fast food cook job. He starts working out and doing some illegal substances. Even though this sounds like he is ruining his life, it actually helps him and makes him realize how much he loves ""the precious moments in his stupid little life."" You have no idea what he is talking about I'm sure, but don't worry, you will some day. Kevin Spacey was by far the best actor in 1999 and deserved this Oscar 100%.Annete Benning plays Carol Burnam, Lester's wife. She is a very fake and unsuccessful real estate agent who cannot get a sale. Her image in life is ""in order to be successful, one most project an image of success at all times"". You can tell, she is not happy with her marriage and starts to have an affair with the big boss of the real estate company. Again, seems horrible, but it helps her in the end. Annete was unfortunately robbed of an Oscar for this film.The supporting cast: Thora Birtch who plays Janie, Lester and Carol's daughter, is extremely depressed and hates her body and herself. But when she notices a strange boy next door and develops a relationship with him, she realizes how precious life is and starts communicating with her family. Mena Suvari plays Angela, Janie's best friend, Lester's crush, and a girl who is clearly insecure despite her attempts at showing her sexy side to every guy in town. Wes Bentley plays Ricky, the next door neighbor boy who looks at something as simple as a bag being tossed in the wind as something beautiful. Some say that this was a very stupid scene, but I disagree. His dialog was perfect and made us look twice at something so simple. He won most of our hearts despite having somewhat of an arrogant attitude. Wes without a doubt got robbed of a nomination for this movie. Chris Cooper plays Ricky's father, Col. Frank Fits. He is a military Sergent who is very abusive to his wife and son and is an obvious homophobic that turns into an ironic situation in the end. Chris also should've been nominated.The most stunning character actually to me was Allison Janney who played Barbara Fits, Ricky's mom, and Frank's wife. She was so beautiful and perfect. Her scene in the front room with Frank and Ricky, everything is so quite, and she says ""I'm sorry, what?"". Ricky says ""Mom, no one said anything"". When Ricky gets kicked out by Frank after a horrible accusation, Ricky says ""Mom, I'm leaving"". Instead of being like the average mom and trying to stop him or say things will get better, she knows this is best and says ""OK. Wear a raincoat"". Allison was just amazing and didn't get enough credit for her role.If there could have been nominations for every role in this movie, they were well deserved. This is a terrific movie that should be watched by every adult. It'll make you look again at your life and think. What a great movie.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
One of my faves of the year...simply great.,"This movie was a joy to watch.  I didn't know what to expect when I came into it.  I had heard the buzz of the acting and the story, etc...but we've all heard that before and had been disappointed, but not so with this one.Kevin Spacey plays this part to a ""T"".  He is strong when it requires and meek when it is needed.  His emotional rollercoaster ride is a trip to partake in. Annette Bening is marvelous as well.  I think they both should be nominated.The support cast is also spectacular.  Thora Birch, Wes Bentley, and Mena Suvari all give great performances as the troubled ""Teenagers"" in the film. Of particular mention is Wes Bentley's performance, worthy of a supporting nomination as well.This is a dramatic and funny tale of a man and his life in a state of turmoil and transition.  When he happens to see a beautiful friend of his daughter's at a cheerleading exhibition, he is completely infatuated with her beauty.  Using this as his inspiration, he attempts to change all aspects of his life.  He confronts his marriage, his job, his ego, and his libido.The music in this film is also very well chosen.  There are moments when the music fits so perfectly with the scene that they meld together as one to present a perfect emotion.The plot can get rather involved, but you will follow it endlessly to see where you go.  I was simply involved, hook, line and sinker.See this movie more than once, and skip some of the other movies out now that are dare I say, trash.This should be on the top of many critic's lists this year and it is certainly on top of mine.My Rating (1 - 10):  10",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Close To Perfection,"The intention is so clear that everything else falls into place, perfectly. Kevin Spacey's suburban husband and father reminded me of his character in ""The Ref"" and that could only be a good thing. Annette Bening and her giggle works wonders here. Their marriage is a tabloid version of a ""Who's Afraid To Virginia Woolf"" Which means very close to someone we know. The biggest surprises in the film. besides the amazing dexterity of Sam Mendes at his first outing behind the camera, are West Bentley. Chris Cooper, Thora Brch and Allison Janney. As I'm writing this 8 years after its first release, the Oscars and the whole hullabaloo, I'm very surprised that West Bentley hasn't become a major star. He is amazing in ""American Beauty"" the complexities of his character are based on recognizable human stands, the hardest to face up to and I went where he went. Thora Birch is lovely as the object of his attention and the film, I believe, is here to say.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Far and away the best film of the year,"What can I say, except that this film really knocked me on my keaster.  I went in to the theater not knowing what to expect, but was pretty sure it would be worth the ticket price.  Boy was I happy when I left.  Not only was it worth the ticket, I paid to see this film two more times.  This film is virtually perfect.  The acting is superb, the story is magnificent, the narrative is brilliant, and the structure of the film is truly groundbreaking (absolutely loved the last 20 minutes).  What really surprised me about this film was how well the cinematography was done.  In a small, character driven film such as this, it is very unusual to have such great cinematography.  With this film, there is something interesting going on in every scene, not many films you can say that about.  In a year where first time directors have made some of the best films, Three Kings, Being John Malkovich, etc...  Sam Mendes seems to have out-done them all.  Though I have yet to see The Green Mile or Magnolia, I find it hard to believe that either film will out-shine American Beauty.

Couples that totally get each other and others that are completely clueless what the other really wants or needs. Cautionary tale about communication, or lack thereof.

Look closer,"American Beauty is, without a doubt, one of my all time favorite movies. The cast is beyond incredible-Kevin Spacey appears to have a sketchy personal life, but this isn't about his real life-his acting in this movie is brilliant. His relatable, funny and intelligent style has you glued to the screen from start to end. Annette Bening is superb; I can see no one else playing this role; she's simply fantastic; everyone else was spectacular as well-from the entire neighboring family to Mena Suvari, all did an outstanding job both independently and as a team. The plot line and twists were just genius; it's so real and bittersweet at the same time. This movie is one I constantly bring up to new friends and acquaintances and although it premiered almost 2 decades ago, it has left a lasting impression. If you haven't already, and you're looking to be thoroughly entertained, watch American Beauty. I can't say enough good things about it. It is truly one of a kind.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
A provocative look at suburban life,"""American Beauty,"" a 1999 film directed by Sam Mendes, offers a provocative and darkly humorous examination of suburban life and the disillusionment that can lurk beneath its surface. The movie follows the story of Lester Burnham, a middle-aged man experiencing a midlife crisis, and his attempts to find happiness and meaning in his mundane existence.The film is notable for its strong performances, particularly by Kevin Spacey, who brings depth and complexity to the character of Lester. Annette Bening is equally compelling as his ambitious and emotionally distant wife, Carolyn. The supporting cast also delivers memorable performances, adding richness to the film's exploration of various themes.Visually, ""American Beauty"" is striking, with cinematography that enhances the film's mood and tone. The use of symbolism, especially the recurring motif of rose petals, adds a layer of poetic beauty to the narrative. The film's soundtrack, featuring an evocative score by Thomas Newman, complements the story perfectly.While the film's satirical take on suburban life and its critique of the American Dream are thought-provoking, some viewers might find its portrayal of certain characters and situations to be overly cynical or exaggerated. Despite this, ""American Beauty"" remains a compelling and visually stunning film that invites viewers to reflect on the complexities of life, identity, and the pursuit of happiness.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

American Beauty,"Speechless.This film is perfect from start to finish. This film has a certain balance between reality and imagination that just makes it feel so genuine and authentic which is rare to find nowadays. The actors in the film are so talented and they make the film feel like someones reality, the acting is so natural almost like your part of their story, their world. The movie conveys how murky and unclear our lives have become, how we've drowned ourselves is societal norms, the idea of blending in and success which slowly makes us numb and unaware of the beauty around us hence the quote ""There is so much beauty around us"". It reveals that humanity has evolved to think that life is so complicated and has so many various elements to it, but in reality life is simple, we don't need all the things we have, we don't need to strive to be normal, we don't need to follow the crowd it just goes to show how all these unnecessary factors of what we think is life is severely blinding us to beauty. It shows how much of life we take for granted and it foreshadows how one can only truly understand and believe in what I just said after a life time of living in a controlled, confined and trapped illusion that we call reality.

"""There's so much beauty in the world""","I remember when I was really young and always seen the cover of this movie at Blockbuster.Of course, looking at the cover I would be way too young to watch it, but it always intrigued me.Being an adult now, I think it's a film that I would be able to resonate with now.This was my first time watching this film and I think despite it being a product of its time coming out at the turn of the millennium in 1999.In my opinion, its themes and topics remain relevant, uncovering the dark underbelly of American life and how families on the surface try to put on a perfect facade to their lives.The cast were all perfect in my opinion, they all felt like believable and dysfunctional families. Out of the whole cast Annette Bening really stood out.Multiple scenes were stunning to watch especially with the rose petals covering the ceiling with the character Angela.The symbolism of the color red showing up in multiple frames, over all it was beautifully shot and told a compelling story.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
AMAZING MOVIE,"When I first saw this movie in theaters, I found it to be very funny. When I rented it at home, I found it to be very sad and complex. Looking at it now, I realize that it is surely one of the most extraordinary films ever to come out of Hollywood. To some it may look trite or cliched, or maybe too un-ordinary to be worthy of its praise, but the overall impact of this film is extremely powerful. After you've seen it, you know you've seen something.A few notable elements stand out. The direction is superb; this is visually a superior film, for the director understands the subtle changes in tone. The writing is equally compelling; the story effortlessly interweaves multiple stories to create one amazing movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
My favourite film of all time,"This movie is perfect in my opinion. There is so much to talk about, and so many layers of interpretation. A look into the 'perfect' American suburban life reveals that even if you have everything deemed perfect (marriage, children, a nice house, two incomes) you can never truly be happy. Everyone has a different interpretation of beauty and this is highlighted brilliantly in this film. The script is brilliant and the acting follows, amazing cinematography and the soundtrack is perfect. Everytime I watch this film I have a different idea pop into my head about the meaning of life, and you will too.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Perfectly captures the dystopia of the USA at the turn of the millenia,"Greed and hate has destroyed the fabric of society in the USA and this film depicts a broken family that could be millions of families in suburban USA. I often think acting doesn't take much skill but movies like American Beauty help me appreciate truly fine acting. The film shows how one man finds redemption by breaking out of the cage his life had become. Despite a tragedy, the film ends on a positive note with the narration of the central character. One of my top 5 favorite movies. Congratulations to everyone who took part in the making of this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Great movie about life, family, depression and intimacy","Greetings from Lithuania.""American Beauty"" (1999) is a great movie that i watched like 4 times in the last 25 years since it was released. This is a great movie that never gets old. Screenplay by Alan Boll was amazing - smart, darkly funny and involving. Directing job by Sem Mendes was top notch - the pacing of this movie is superb and it never drags in its almost 2 hours run time. Acting was outstanding by everyone involved - Kevin Spacey & Annette Bening were at the top of their game here.""American Beauty"" is about many things and it blends them together seemingly at the same time with this dark sense of humor. Its a very funny film but its not a comedy, its a dark film were sexuality and finding yourself i think plays a key role, but its not oversexualized. Every character here is two dimensional, and nothing is black & white or as it seems at first sight.Overall, ""American Beauty"" is a tragic story, comedy and great movie - all at the same time. Its amazingly acted, written and directed as surely is a true classic at this point that everyone should see at least once it their lifetime. Great movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

"""Sometimes there's so much beauty in the world, I feel like I can't take it, and my heart is just going to cave in.""","American Beauty is a deeply penetrating and thought-provoking film. It is truly a top notch drama, effectively a dark satire about suburbia the fallacies of chasing The American Dream. American Beauty would explore such themes as loneliness, conformity, depression, redemption and repression. Lester Burnham, (Kevin Spacey) is an articulate depressed suburban father in a mid-life crisis. It is abundantly clear that Lester is a prisoner of his own life. Whilst every character is in their own prison of loneliness, they are incredibly self-aware of their predicament, for example, Ricky Fitts (played superbly by Wes Bentley) who obsessively captures the most mundane things using his video camera to help him remember the beauty. His character, greatly affected me, I found myself taken aback by how insightful and profound Ricky Fitts was. I mean, how does a teenager become so wise? What events in his life have unfolded to give him such an outlook on life? You can almost see the visceral pain in Ricky's eyes and also his voice. There were many thought-provoking scenes which really affected and resonated with me - to the point where my view of the world has certainly been altered. The unforgettable bag scene - this dancing plastic bag teaches us all a lesson, to appreciate the simple beauty that is all around us:""It was one of those days when it's a minute away from snowing and there's this electricity in the air, you can almost hear it. Right? And this bag was just dancing with me. Like a little kid begging me to play with it. For fifteen minutes. That's the day I realized that there was this entire life behind things, and this incredibly benevolent force that wanted me to know there was no reason to be afraid, ever. Video's a poor excuse, I know. But it helps me remember... I need to remember... Sometimes there's so much beauty in the world, I feel like I can't take it, and my heart is just going to cave in.""Thomas Newman's minimalist score for the film is moody, reflective and extremely moving. The cast was superb, Kevin Spacey thoroughly deserved his Academy Award for Best Actor, his performance was so charismatic. The supporting cast of Annette Bening, Chris Cooper, Thora Birch, Wes Bentley and Mena Suvari was nothing short of magnificent. At the Academy Awards of that year, American Beauty won five Oscars, including for Best Picture, along with Best Director for Sam Mendes, Best Actor for Kevin Spacey, Best Original Screenplay for Alan Ball, and Best Cinematography for Conrad L.

Look Closer...,"The first time I heard about this movie I thought it was this movie and about a man with cancer and then read a lot of good things about and then say some trailers and then I saw it. At first I did not like this movie but than say it again on T.V and then loved it ever since. This is one of the most original films I have ever seen. The performances are one of the best and more Oscars should have been handed out. The directing by Sam Mendes is superb and I'm glad that he won the Oscar. Alan Ball wrote one of the best screenplay and story's ever thought and there's a reason why he won the Oscar and most deserving. This is the Best of the 1990's and that decade had a lot of great movies came out( Goodfellas, L.A Confedintil, Pulp Fiction to name a few). This was the first movie that I saw that was perfect and I had to see it over and over so I can just uncover everything that was in this movie. This movie is in my top ten movies of all time and I'm glad that it's rank number 35 and that one of the reason why I joined this because it was the only website people respect my opinions and agreed with me. Keven Spacey gives his best performance and one of the best of time. Spacey brings a great performance for a really deep and is just a great character. Annette Bening does a great and for some reason missed the Oscar. Chris Copper does a great job and didn't get notice that much, also did Wes Bentley, Mena Suvari and thora Birch did a great job and should have more notice.

One of the 10 best films I have ever seen.,"This is a masterpiece, perfect in every way. It has completely changed the way I view films and the way I look at life. The acting is excellent, especially with Spacey and Bening. The directing by Mendes is one of the best I have ever seen in a film. The cinematography is so beautiful with the strong contrast between the red and other colors. Aside from being visually beautiful, the story itself is this film's best feature. It is original, with hints of humor, noir, drama, and sadness. Overall, it is thought-provoking in a way very few films are. It is hard to watch what these characters are doing because we know that they are only leading themselves to their own demise. Ball's screenplay is one that should be required reading in film schools and the final sequence is perhaps the most beautiful thing ever filmed. It is a stunning achievement, deserving of every award it got. It is, in my opinion, one of the 10 best films I have ever seen and the best film of the 1990s after Schindler's List. It is so real, so poignant, so heartbreaking. Powerful and serene, this is why I love movies. They can change your thinking.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

It is about their desperate attempts to overcome their unhappiness.

Hollywood derives entertainment value from mental illness....,"Here we have yet another highly polished Hollywood flick that seeks to derive entertainment value by depicting two suburban families loaded with mental illness and/or behavioral disorders. Yet, the subject of mental disorders is not addressed and therefore, no meaningful message is given. Instead, the mainstream audience, not fully aware of signs of mental illness, are led to believe that characters with all the signs of mental disorder, are merely quirky, eccentric and at worst dysfunctional.

The way the story unfolds is genius and is non stop entertaining. Annette Benning also give an amazing performance as Lester's crazy wife. All the performances plus the amazing cinematography and direction of Sam Mendes adds to a perfect choice for the best picture and the perfect movie to lead into the 21st century.The dichotomy of the title and the term beauty for what the movie gives us is so cool and ironic.

A superb satirical drama on the pitfalls of contemporary American suburban life,"Lester Burnham is a middle-aged husband and father of a neurotic and shallow wife and a typically sullen teenage daughter. Employed in a well-paying job he lives out a dull, miserable existence in his middle-class neighborhood. Finally being pushed to breaking point, and grown jaded with the banality and unjust office politics of his job, he quits and takes to smoking pot and finding new employment in a fast food restaurant. Embracing what it was once like to be a carefree teenager in what appears to be the ultimate mid-life crisis, in this cynical and tragic examination of the artificiality of the ""American Dream"".Having cut his teeth as a theater director, before moving to the movie screen, American Beauty marked Sam Mendes's debut feature which would earn him not only critical acclaim but a win for Best Director, as earning a further gong for Best Picture. Written by Alan Ball, both he and Mendes created this dark satire on suburban cultures with added themes of forgiveness and redemption. Casting Kevin Spacey as Lester Burnham, a forty-something who from the afterlife narrates in voice-over about his life before fate took it from him. A suburbanite advertising executive as well as a husband and father trapped within the confines of his unhappy marriage. Suffering a midlife crisis, and bored with the monotony of his everyday existence, he butts heads with his self-centered, neurotic, materialistic wife Carolyn (Annette Bening on brilliant form) as well as his smarmy supervisor Brad, who he eventually blackmails due to his complicity in covering up the managing director using company funds to pay for a prostitute. Leading him to quit his job, and leading him on an odyssey of essentially attempting to reclaim the youth he once had. Much to the chagrin of Carolyn as well as his a-typically sullen daughter, who is eternally embarrassed and resentful of her parent's spats and dysfunctional behavior.Lester's home-life with his family is beautifully paralleled although contrastingly so, with his new neighbour, retired Marine Colonel, Frank Fitts, a strict and abusive disciplinarian homophobic conservative who lives with his near-catatonic wife and his more liberal, wayward son Ricky (Wes Bentley). Who records brief, random moments of the world around him on his camera, which he calls capturing the simple beauty that exists within it.Mendes and Ball depict a portrait of contemporary Americana at the turn of the millennium. Where, as with Joel Schumacher's Falling Down a man attempts to come to terms with the pressures, inequities, and injustices of modern society. While also capturing the social division in the social hemisphere. Although both undertake very different means in their quest to do so. Not least when Lester develops an unhealthy infatuation with her cheerleader best friend Angela (Mena Suavari giving a splendidly precocious turn).Equally poignant as it i sharp and funny, it is anchored by Spacey who delivers what is most probably a career-best performance, and I say this as someone who rates him as an underrated actor. However the role of Lester just somehow seems to have called to him. Undeserving of the Oscar he received, he did at least warrant a nomination. His trademark sarcasm sets him in good stead here as is his acerbic cyncicism as he becomes more empowered and emboldened as the movie's story progresses. Striking a blow for the everyday working stiff in one of the movie's relatively earlier scenes when he faces off against Brad. He's supported by an accomplished cast of Hollywood talent and some splendid storytelling, with both Birch and Bentley's scenes together as two lonely, lost souls who manage to find some solace together of palpable resonance.Needless to say, it has to be said is a powerful satirical drama that, delves into the apathy that can come with mid-life, suburban life, and the struggles therein and will stay with you long after the credits have ended.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Over-Hyped Movie is a Bitter Disappointment,"Enough pro and con comments have been written about this so-called Oscar-winning ""masterpiece"" for me to make this review a brief one--but to the point. 'American Beauty' took up too much time to tell a relatively uncomplicated story of mid-life crisis involving several severely disfunctional personalities. If it gives you pleasure to watch Kevin Spacey be little more than sarcastic for two hours or to watch a shallow youth show you a plastic bag pushed about by the wind as a sample of beauty in little things, then this movie is for you. The only genuinely moving and original character in the movie is not Spacey--it's Chris Cooper as the homophobic neighbor who suspects his son is having an affair--with tragic results. His performance in the climactic garage scene is stunning. The symbolism of the rose petals was overplayed and much too simplistic. As was the lengthy shot of the floating plastic bag which so many viewers found deep meaning in--but struck me as arty, pretentious and boring. With a rambling and vulgar script, this emerged as no more than a sad commentary on the complete collapse of American culture. All of the characters are not only weird but unlikeable. For me, this was an ordeal to sit through--the only jolt I got was from the ending (which took too long to get to)-- and then, mercifully, I was able to take the cassette out, certain that I would never want to view the movie again, despite the fact that it won a Best Film Oscar.  As someone once said, ""the mirror of life should be tilted upwards"" more often to make films more inspirational. The gutter is not a pleasant place to spend two hours of your life--look for true beauty elsewhere. A big thumbs down on this one.",,Anonymous,Drama
Not bad not good,"Not a bad movie. But, as they wrote in the magazines, it is very overrated. Nevertheless, the feeling after it is strange-pleasant. Interesting concept of the picture. So many fates! Unfortunately, not everyone is happy. The screenwriter did a good job. A new vision of beauty, revealed not even in the well-known beauty / ugly story, but in a small bag, silently circling along with a bunch of leaves. At that moment, such an unshakable harmony was felt that I really wanted to think about the beauty of our life with you. Of all the heroes, I would single out, perhaps, Ricky. As odd as he may be, and perhaps not exactly a good person, his view of the world is truly amazing. What is the meaning of our life? After looking at the picture, we will hear from Kevin Spacey, no matter how unsuccessful, stupid and insignificant life would be, we must see the beauty in it.

An American Tale,"This debut film from Sam Mendes won the Best Picture Oscar.A quasi comedy-drama about middle America, Kevin Spacey stars plays Lester Burnham, who has a mid-life crisis when he becomes infatuated with his teenage daughter's best friend, Angela (Mena Suvari).Annette Bening is his materialistic wife, who has fallen out of love with him and is having an affair. Thora Birch plays their insecure daughter who at first plays second fiddle with the more beautiful and forward Angela, but later finds solace with their new neighbour played by Wes Bentley.At first she finds Wes strange as he keeps trying to photograph her. Chris Cooper is his militaristic father who is a stern disciplinarian but seems to have deep personal issues of his own.When I saw American Beauty upon its release I did not think much of it and I note its reputation seems to have declined over the years.Like a lot of Best Oscar picture winners in recent years, some people think it was undeserving of the top prize.Strangely, after re-watching this film after a number of years I have revised my rating upwards. Maybe it is because I am now older along with now older children. I viewed this film differently and interpreted the story with differing nuances.Spacey is probably in a rare role where he is likable. He realises that his life is in a mess, besotted by a nubile college girl, trapped in a loveless marriage and lost his job.However he is trying to improve himself, working out and staying optimistic but fate has a different story for him.The themes in this film will vary at different points in your life.

Didn't age well.,"1999 was the year of cinema in the US of A. I don't think I have ever had seen as many movies in terms of quantity, but also in terms of quality. It was the year of the Green Mile which I still don't like, but many cinephiles would argue otherwise. It's also the year of ""The Sixth Sense"" the outsider that year and the popular choice.
In that year, the Academy chose American Beauty. They should have picked M Night Shyamalan's movie instead.
Don't get me wrong, I love American Beauty, and still think it's a masterpiece, but I don't like the message it conveys and the agenda it tries so hard to push. 
The performances are all top notch. Whether you like him or not amidst the Me Too movement and its ramifications, he delivered what some still argue as the performance of his career. Again, the cast is top notch and my favorite character is Jane, beautifully played by a young Thora Birch. 
The movie tackles issues that are actually non issues if that makes sense. Living in the suburbs can be seen as the epitome of happiness. Not in American Beauty, where the characters are so bored they're looking for things that make them happy, only to end up completely disappointed. I'm not gonna spoil the movie for those who are yet to enjoy it, but for me, the movie is not really worth watching anymore, expect for the performances.",5.0,Anonymous,Drama
Powerful,"""My name is Lester Burnham. This is my neighborhood; this is my street; this is my life. I am 42 years old; in less than a year I will be dead. Of course, I don't know that yet, and in a way, I am dead already.""""American Beauty"" is placed in an indefinite suburb somewhere in America (there are indications that it is Chicago), where a seemingly harmonious and quite ordinary family is going through the turbulence caused by the middle age crisis of both parents, as well as the puberty of their teenage daughter.A patriarchal family, ruled by a conservative father, a military man, moves next door to them. While the daughter of our antihero Lester starts a relationship with the neighbor's weird son, and his wife has an affair at work, he, not so secretly, obsessively falls for his daughter's girlfriend.This black humor drama is only seemingly extreme and eccentric, while in fact, it shows quite realistically what many of us go through at various moments in our lives. Admittedly, most only in their heads, and those who dare to take drastic steps usually hide it better. But the fact that most of us would never admit such thoughts and actions does not prevent, but perhaps only makes it easier for us to better connect with the characters and feel their drama more deeply.A strong, well-written story needs actors capable of bringing it to life before our eyes. ""American Beauty"" did not fail in that field either. The excellent character study on paper makes the job much easier, but you can always rely on Kevin Spacey for a really impressive role. A man who somehow manages to be at the same time a nerd and a macho, slimy and sexy, a villain and a victim. Sexual and emotional frustration and the middle age crisis are by no means an excuse for Lester's actions, and yet, Spacey awakens sympathy and compassion in the viewer, rather than repulsion and disgust.Annette Bening skillfully keeps pace with Spacey in the role of a frustrated woman, trapped in a long-extinguished marriage. A woman who, with the last twitches of common sense, tries to balance between a family in disarray and a career that she can never raise to a level that would satisfy her.There is also Thora Birch, an unpopular teen, escaping from the collapse of her family home in a relationship with the eccentric Wes Bentley, as well as the insecure Mena Suvari, who is hiding under the mask of a confident and popular cheerleader. Her transformation from ""Lolita"" that seduces Lester to one of the most impressive scenes in the film, where she is half-naked, trembling under Spacey, does not deserve to remain unmentioned. Although her character is secondary to the others I mentioned and only serves as a support for Spacey's, Mena's performance is unfairly underrated. And last but not least, Chris Cooper who convincingly played a homophobic colonel and stole every scene in which he appears.For me, the two most striking things in this film are the use of red and the unusual disturbing sounds that accompany Lester's fantasies, in contrast to the mainstream rock music that fills the rest of the movie. And of course, the ending is a bit over-the-top, but it perfectly rounds off the story and adds to its strength.The film won five Oscars for best picture, directing, screenplay, cinematography, and Spacey's performance, and was also nominated for editing, music, and leading female role. Each well deserved.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

There was no film, nor role, that he could not handle. He was versatile, had a sense of humor, and could play deadly dramatic roles with the greatest of ease. He excels in this film about the alienation of a middle-aged man with his unfortunate lot in life. He wants to be successful, but he hates being a yes-man, a man who has no substance, merely form. In other words, his two-faced insincerity begins to gnaw at his inner self.

Didn't expect this,"""American Beauty"" is a masterpiece that disguises itself as a simple comedy, but in reality, goes much deeper. The characters may seem stereotypical at first glance, but the longer you watch the film, the more you realize how unique and interesting each of them is. The story delves deep and offers a multitude of meanings that can vary depending on perspective and interpretation. Personally, I love this film and haven't enjoyed a movie this much in a long time. It's a clear recommendation for anyone looking for a film with depth and personality.Another outstanding feature of the film is the acting performances. Kevin Spacey shines in the lead role as Lester Burnham and rightfully won the Oscar for Best Actor. The other actors, such as Annette Bening, Thora Birch, and Wes Bentley, also deliver convincing performances.The cinematography is also remarkable. Director Sam Mendes and cinematographer Conrad L.

It is a clear recommendation for any film fan looking for a masterpiece.I can totally relate to the feeling of uncertainty that often follows watching a movie, especially when it comes to rating it. However, with 10/10 films, there is no such hesitation. I always know right after finishing the film that it deserves a perfect score, because the ending has left me thoroughly impressed. This was precisely the case with ""American Beauty,"" and I can confidently say that it has now become one of my all-time favorite films.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Pure poetry,"This film is not only about American Beauty, but also about the full concept of beauty, which concerns everybody. This deep theme is able to trap us into the story and make us feel the same feelings of the protagonist. The movie has a clear message: don't waste your time believing you're not going to make the difference in some way, get out, look around you and discover the spark that makes you feel at the highest level of your life. This is how I think of it. Sam Mendes, at his debut, already scored and the acotrs' performances were among the best of the decade. And you also find the poetry especially in the music by the incredible and underrated Thomas Newman.Simply beautiful.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Mayn't be the most original movie I have seen, but it is still an outstanding movie","I wasn't expecting to like American Beauty, but I did, loved it more like. The story mayn't be original at first glance, but how the film is written and constructed more than compensates you completely overlook. You may argue the characters are weird and unlikeable, maybe so, but they are quite complex. Lester is a self-described loser who is unwanted by everyone, Carolyn is uptight and sexually frustrated, Jane is the epitome of a sulky teenage daughter and Allison is like a incipient Lolita who Lester becomes smitten with. American Beauty is probably an example of a movie that you may need to see more than once to truly appreciate it, I was like that with Vertigo.What I love about American Beauty is not only the complex characters, but also the stylish filming, haunting score, side-splitting scenarios, the intelligent and darkly funny screenplay and the assured direction from Sam Mendes. Not to mention the performances which are nothing less than impeccable, especially Kevin Spacey who thoroughly deserved his Best Actor Oscar. Annette Bening, Peter Gallagher, Thora Birch and Mena Suvari give wonderful support too.

"""I Know I Didn't Always Feel This ... Sedated.""","Hmmm ... Let's just take a cool, objective look at a few of the comments made by IMDb users who have reviewed ""American Beauty"". ""Haunting.""  ""Riveting.""  ""Brilliant.""  ""More than meets the eye."" ""Uplifitng.""  ""Never contrived.""  ""By far the best I have ever seen."" ""Makes you think.""  ""Exceptional.""  ""Never gives stereotypes.""  ""Classic masterpiece.""  ""Movies don't get any better than this.""And that list is by no means exhaustive.  Now let's contemplate the actual film that these people have been watching.Lester Burnham is Suburban Man.  An unremarkable individual not valued by his employer and ignored by his family, he has wasted his entire adult life by succumbing to the routine of work and home, and failing to indulge his own individuality.  When two key events coincide (the loss of his job and the dawning of a 'crush' on his daughter's friend) Lester is suddenly free to ""beat his drum"", slough off years of conformity and be his eccentric self.Yes, that's right, yet another dull, cliche-ridden suburban situation comedy hinting at inchoate unease deep in the soul of bourgeois America. All the predictable bases are touched during this smug box-office home run - petty snobbery, keeping up appearances, repressed yearnings for Bali Hi, and that profound American lament, ""I've Never Been To Me"".And what does Lester do to express his newfound rebellious individuality?  How exactly does he challenge the suburban world which he has rejected?  Form a witches' coven?  Invent a world language?  Assassinate Castro?  Reproduce indian cave art using bison dung as paint?  No.  He drinks beer in front of the TV set, and gets a job in a hamburger joint. Can America's big-budget Dream Factory come up with nothing more exciting than this?Before dealing with the wider themes, I would like to tackle some details which bothered me.  What is a gun doing in this story?  Are Hollywood's screenwriters so bankrupt of ideas that they can't construct a plot without relying on the dreadfully-overworked device of pistol-packing? The opening shower sequence was embarrassing.  Adult jokes are fine by me, bawdy humour is great ... but this was unnecessary and degrading.  It simply didn't belong.  A narrator who announces that he is dead isn't a clever touch, it's just sloppy work.  Is Mena Suvari REALLY the embodiment of American beauty?  I find that hard to believe.  And what about the total loss of nerve surrounding her character?  Isn't this brash film supposed to be proud of its handling of adult issues?  So why does the temptress have to be revealed as a trembling little virgin?  We hear a great deal of American trumpeting of feminism as a cause.  Can't anyone see that this moral cave-in is profoundly anti-feminist?  On a similar note, what was Thora Birch's topless shot all about?  It defines the term 'gratuitous'.And so, back to the broader picture.  ""American Beauty"" isn't any of those amazing things that people have claimed it to be.  It isn't even mediocre.  It's a tired, self-satisfied, deeply unimaginative rehashing of a format which was outworn by the time ""My Favourite Martian"" hit the TV screen.  Challenging the regularity of suburban life isn't clever and isn't funny.  It is gut-achingly DULL.The question which arises, then, is why so many people are sincerely convinced that ""American Beauty"" outshines ""Citizen Kane"".  I offer this for consideration ... they feel that way because they are told to.  It doesn't work every single time, and sometimes it misses spectacularly, but Hollywood knows that as a general rule, advertising pays dividends.  Tell people often enough that they need to see this mighty film, and they will accept the premises - both that they need to see it, and that it's mighty.Barnum said that nobody ever went broke by under-estimating the public. There's truth in that.  Just provide the bread and the circuses, and the docile populace will take you at your word that the bread is delicious and the circuses thrilling.The public wants what the public gets.",,Anonymous,Drama
Beautiful,"So much has been said about this movie that it's hard to think of what else I could add. I wasn't even going to comment on the film for this precise reason, but then I figured I needed to give my favorite film of all time a shout out.To start, I honestly believe that this is one of the true masterpieces of the decade. This is a beautifully crafted movie on absolutely every level but it's the use and exploration of character throughout that makes it truly astonishing. I find each of the characters incredibly fascinating and very rich. The tagline ""Look Closer"" is spot on because there's always more going on than what you observe on the surface.

No words fit to describe this movie,"This movie is the first one I have written a review for, because it is the one that means the most to me.No word in the English language can give enough praise to do this film justice. I could write a whole book about the significance and meaning of every artistic shot, of every remarkable performance, and every event and still not capture the essence of this movie.The truth is that this is the most complete portrayal of human emotion and interaction I have ever seen. It encompasses every aspect of mankind; from jealousy and intolerance, to romance and happiness. Every single aspect of each scene has a meaning and message, and if your mind is open, then this movie will affect you in so many ways.On a more technical note, this movie is not only superbly written, but executed flawlessly. Kevin Spacey gives the performance of the century, hitting every nuance of his character with grace and style. In a lesser movie, his performance would have been the sole reason to watch. Yet this is not the case. Annette Benning also shines with her portrayal of a troubled housewife that is nothing short of Oscar-worthy. The musical score also stands out as a fantastic attribute of the experience; not overpowering, yet still just as relevant.I could go on and on about the flawless cinematography and lighting effects and such. But I can sum that all up in a different manner: ""There is no bad aspect of this film."" Everything works together to perfection to provide the most outstanding movie of this age.""American Beauty"" is quite simply the most significant film of its time. Yet this movie also transcends time to provide an emotional and thought-provoking experience for years to come.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Spec-TAC-u-LAR!,"Okay, so I don't think there's much left to be said about this masterpiece. ""American Beauty"" is one of those rare instant classics, a landmark of the 90's and one of the best debut features ever (which is both a blessing and a curse for a director - let's hope Sam Mendes doesn't end up like Orson Welles).This bittersweet tale of ordinary suburban lives about an average husband (Kevin Spacey), his ambitious wife (Annette Bening), their unhappy only child (Thora Birch), the weirdo next door (Wes Bentley), his severe father (Chris Cooper), his catatonic mother (Allison Janney) and a certain blonde cheerleader (Mena Suvari), reaches a heavenly level of authenticity and poignancy thanks to a witty, pitch-perfect script (by Alan Ball, who would later create the brilliant TV series ""Six Feet Under""), a wonderful cast (Spacey and Cooper, especially), Mendes's sensible directing, Conrad L. Hall's beautiful cinematography and Thomas Newman's unforgettable score (which has been copied ad nauseam since then, by the way).""American Beauty"" is as thought-provoking and sad as it is, in a weird way, uplifting. To realize the mediocrity in your life; to try to change it or let it be, that's the question. Whichever's your choice, there'll be a high price to pay; thus, no one's a complete hero or villain in this story. Lack of communication, character flaws and hypocrisy all add up to what happens to these people; we feel bad for them, despise them, and root for them, for they all ring so true. That's because they're real, and great writers like Ball have a special talent to expose the good, the bad and the ugly in human nature.My only ""problem"" with this film is that it came out in 1999 (one of the greatest years for films, ever), just like my all-time favourite, ""Magnolia"", which was almost completely snubbed by the Academy (which gave ""American Beauty"" 5 Oscars, including Best Picture and Director). Naturally, I'd have liked ""Magnolia"" to win, but AB is a more than acceptable replacement since the Academy actually awarded a great film that year. ""American Beauty"", even without being the best film of its year, still manages to be a masterpiece.""It's just a couch!"", Lester (Spacey) yells in one scene. ""This isn't life, it's just stuff. And it's become more important to you than living. Well, honey, that's just nuts"".And isn't he right?...look closer. 10/10.",,Anonymous,Drama
A genuinely Beautiful film,"Lester - ""Did you ever see that movie where the body is walking around carrying its own head and then the head goes down on that babe?""Ricky - ""Re-Animator""One of my favorite film references ever.Many things amaze me when it comes to American Beauty, but the most astounding aspect is the way this film touches on nearly all of the insecurities and desires that are experienced in life and turn it into a 2-hour dark comedy drama. To say that this movie is dense with meaning and symbolism would be a massive understatement.I know there are a lot of people who have denounced this film ever since Kevin Spacy's allegations, which is something I completely respect. Personally, I learned a long time ago that I had to separate the art from the artist if I was ever going to enjoy the art that is important to me. But even before that, I knew people who just never cared for this movie saying ""It's just about a guy who's having a midlife crisis and wanting to sleep with a high school girl."" Which in my opinion is a very crude oversimplification.Sure, those are elements in this story but American Beauty is so much more than that. This movie is filled with so many themes that related to the human experience and its all shown through this deconstruction of American suburbia. Themes of morality, love, desire, repression, freedom, redemption, regret, family, and of course, beauty. This film is overwhelming with its many meanings and emotionality but in a way that feels rewarding and eye-opening. It's nearly impossible not to wanna reflect on our own life after seeing it.""It's hard to stay mad, when there's so much beauty in the world. Sometimes I feel like I'm seeing it all at once, and it's too much, my heart fills up like a balloon that's about to burst.""This is one of those rare films that makes me feel better about life. It inspires me to wanna recognize the beauty in the world as opposed to hating everything about it. American Beauty has helped shape my perspective on the human experience for the better. And any film that can do that for me is a film that I consider to be a masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

A Darkly Comedic Dive into Suburban Surrealism,"American Beauty is a deep dive into the absurdity of middle-class existence, served up with a generous side of existential crisis and dark humor.Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) is a middle-aged suburbanite with a job that's slowly sucking the life out of him and a family that's barely holding it together. His life takes a bizarre turn when he develops an inappropriate infatuation with his daughter's teenage friend, Angela (Mena Suvari). But Lester's not alone in his quest for self-destruction. His wife, Carolyn (Annette Bening), is an uptight real estate agent whose obsession with success rivals his own descent into madness. Meanwhile, their daughter, Jane (Thora Birch), is the poster child for teenage angst, complete with a penchant for eye-rolling and dark poetry.The film's humor is as dark as a black hole, often veering into the territory of uncomfortable laughter. It's a satire that takes aim at the façade of suburban perfection, exposing the emptiness beneath the manicured lawns and white picket fences. From Lester's hilariously inappropriate fantasies to the dysfunctional dynamics of the Burnham family, American Beauty revels in the absurdity of it all.However, beneath the dark humor and biting satire, the film delves into deeper themes of identity, desire, and the search for meaning. It's a midlife crisis that transcends the clichés, offering moments of genuine introspection amidst the chaos. It reminds us that even in the most mundane of lives, there can be moments of profound revelation and transformation.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
A masterful exploration of the complexities of modern American life,"""American Beauty"" is a masterful exploration of the complexities of modern American life, directed by Sam Mendes and released in 1999. The film presents a provocative, multi-layered narrative that delves into the psychological and emotional lives of its characters, examining their struggles with identity, sexuality, and the pursuit of happiness.At the center of the film is Lester Burnham, a middle-aged man played by Kevin Spacey, who has become disillusioned with his life and decides to shake things up by rebelling against his mundane job, unhappy marriage, and unfulfilling suburban lifestyle. Spacey's portrayal of Lester is a tour de force performance, bringing to life the character's sarcastic wit, seething anger, and poignant vulnerability.Annette Bening delivers a nuanced and powerful performance as Carolyn Burnham, Lester's wife, who is struggling to maintain control over her family, career, and personal life. Thora Birch is outstanding as the couple's teenage daughter, Jane, who is grappling with her own insecurities and frustrations. And Wes Bentley shines as Ricky Fitts, a mysterious and troubled teenager who becomes involved with the Burnham family and unlocks a world of beauty and truth that they had previously ignored.The film's themes are deep and multi-layered, touching on issues such as the pursuit of happiness, the emptiness of the American Dream, and the complexities of human relationships. The script, written by Alan Ball, is a marvel of narrative economy, weaving together multiple storylines and characters in a seamless and engaging way.Mendes' direction is exceptional, using visual metaphors and symbolism to heighten the film's emotional impact. The cinematography by Conrad L. Hall is stunning, capturing the beauty and banality of suburban life with equal grace and precision.In conclusion, ""American Beauty"" is a cinematic masterpiece that is as relevant and thought-provoking today as it was when it was released over two decades ago. With its complex characters, rich themes, and stunning performances, the film is a must-see for anyone who appreciates powerful, provocative cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"""It's hard to stay mad, when there's so much beauty in the world.""","Winner of 5 Oscars, including Best Picture, American Beauty (1999) is a romance drama starring Kevin Spacey (as Lester Burnham) which tells the story of three simultaneous relationships and their impact on one another: A sexually frustrated father's infatuation with his daughter's best friend, said daughter's peculiar attraction to the strange yet curious new boy next door, and Lester's stern, industrious wife's amorous affair with her business arch rival.Woah. A film like this has no business being *this* good. I never thought I'd be saying a romance drama is now one of my favourite movies of all-time, yet here we are. And I truly mean it by the way, for those of you reading this on Letterboxd, I am seriously pondering putting this in my top 4, which I also didn't think I'd say for a very long time. Whilst I'm likely going to come to the conclusion to keep my top 4 as it is, this is still definitely in my top 10 at least.But now onto why I'm rating this so highly. The main reason is none other than the story. A wholeheartedly deserved Oscar for Alan Ball, the writer, speaks volumes to just how astonishing the writing is. How he was able to transform a romance plot into a script which explores themes such as perversion, homophobia, drugs, suburban dysfunction, and most of all family, is simply awe-inspiring.I'm still in shock at how spectacular this picture was, I haven't seen a film this extraordinary in a while. Funny thing is, for the first two acts, I was sat there wondering how on earth this got such stellar reviews! Don't get me wrong it was still pretty damn great during those acts, but I didn't think it was worthy of the critical acclaim that it so received just yet. But Act 3, oh my word. It was that sensational that I watched it back about half an hour later! I just couldn't stop thinking about it. So many unexpected moments, moments that even made me stand up in shock, that made it all the more enthralling. The story advances so peculiarly, in ways which at first you think make no sense at all, then you soon realise they make perfect sense. If that doesn't scream masterpiece I don't know what will. And I adored the cinematography too. There were some very powerful & dramatic scenes which the cinematography accompanied very well, and it helped to strengthen the impact of those striking, and sometimes even dark, segments of the feature.Certain members of the cast were outstanding. Recipient of the Best Actor Oscar, Kevin Spacey, was an excellent lead. Initially it seemed like he didn't suit the role but once I got into the movie I could see that he was actually a phenomenal choice. He presents his character arc so well as he highlights both Lester's overwhelming determination to woo the girl of his literal dreams and his slovenly insouciance to the responsibilities of the working world. I have to admit it baffled me at first to see Annette Bening (as Carolyn Burnham) nominated for Best Actress, but in hindsight as I look back as her performance, I get it. In the aforementioned dramatic scenes, she was one of the prominent figures who, as a result of contrasting with Spacey's character, had a staggering presence, and those scenes would not be the same if it wasn't for her and Spacey so she deserves her plaudits. I would also like to praise Chris Cooper (as Colonel Frank Fitts) who was undeniably phenomenal, to the point where I find it impossible to believe that this role could've been played any better by anybody else. Having seen him in a similar role in the film October Sky of the same year, it doesn't surprise me that he absolutely smashed his performance out the park here. From a certain point within the movie, he creates a sense of fear within you everytime you see him on screen, and whilst that's partially aided by the fairly erratic behaviour of his character, it is primarily thanks to Cooper's faultless acting. Nothing short of remarkable. And I also appreciated the acting of Wes Bentley (as Ricky Fitts) as in contrast to his father's turbulent nature, he was rather obedient and stolid, and it is this contrast which allows you to see Bentley's highly admirable showing in all its wonder.In conclusion, this is undoubtedly a must-watch. It doesn't matter whether or not you're a fan of the romance genre, as you will definitely be entertained, I can assure you of that. This picture is simply too astounding to even want to miss out on. You may have noticed that I haven't even mentioned any negatives (I did say Act 1 and 2 weren't amazing, but they were still fairly brilliant to enjoy), and that's because there pretty much aren't any worthy of note. I wasn't the biggest fan of the editing but that's it, and besides, it was such a minor downfall that it didn't in the slightest affect my rating. So I see absolutely no reason not to give this a try, and I honestly can't fathom why anybody wouldn't at least take a liking to this movie. It is a sensation.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

A character study with an almost poetic quality - a modern classic,"When a film is able to combine taking itself seriously with attaining an ironic distance from its subject matter, when it manages to be both dramatically valid and powerful as well as humorous, then it may be on course for greatness. American Beauty is that kind of film.The starting point for screenwriter Alan Ball is a dissection of modern suburban life, a philosophical look at themes that have been frequently discussed in film in recent years: the meaning of life, integrity, truthfulness, midlife crises, and - of course - lust. A mushy dabble around these themes often results in a trivial movie, but in American Beauty it is all handled elegantly, and the film is anything but trivial. As directed by first-timer Sam Mendes, this is a character study with such remarkable rhythm and precision that it attains an almost poetic quality. And that's not because of the most obvious segments, such as the plastic bag shot, but rather how the film brings our deepest secrets to the forefront before rendering them harmless. Yes, we may lust for our teenage daughters' friends. Yes, we may be closet homosexuals acting as homophobes. And yes, we may be desperately hung up on keeping up appearances. But know this: It doesn't matter, because everybody does.Just like Forrest Gump five years ago, American Beauty is both an homage to and a satire of everything arch-American. The result is simple entertainment with artistic depth. Mendes' aforementioned direction is arguably the film's greatest asset. As far as directorial debuts go, this is up there along with the very best in movie history. It's hard to imagine Mendes being anything other than a unique talent.Still, the be-all and end-all for a dramatic comedy is its characters and our ability to see ourselves in them. In American Beauty, there's not only a wide array of them, but we're also absolutely spoiled with brilliant performances. Kevin Spacey has had a great decade, from his mini-breakthrough in Glengarry Glen Ross in 1992 to his commercial breakthrough in films such as Seven and The Usual Suspects. Here, he finally gets his big break as a leading man, a responsibility a lot of people ostensibly doubted he could carry. The fact is, however, that Spacey rises to the occasion. He's also the kind of actor who looks better middle-aged than he did as a young adult, meaning that we'll probably see a lot more of this guy in the coming years.Spacey is surrounded by pleasant and impressive supporting performances. Annette Bening (the gal who crushed a lot of women's hopes when she married Hollywood's most eligible bachelor, Warren Beatty, in 1992) delivers a wonderfully manic part, while the trio of kids - Thora Birch, Wes Bentley, and Mena Suvari - all give very credible performances. Birch, a former child actress who was great opposite Elijah Wood in Paradise, has an exciting future ahead of her. Most impressive, however, is John Sayles regular Chris Cooper, who delves deep and strips down bare in a challenging part.American Beauty may well become a modern classic. It is simple in its own quirky way, but it's exactly this simplicity that makes it so universal and timeless, transforming its concise observations on life into a pensive and poignant tragedy of classic proportions.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
One of those movies that makes you excited to live,"I was hesitant about watching this movie after all the reviews about an old man having an affair with a young girl, but after finally watching it, it's one of my favorites. It just made me see the beauty of life, how even though there are painful and messed up things (as well as beautiful things), it doesn't mean we have to act like they don't exist. We just have to realize that every little thing in our ""stupid little lives"" (as the main character says) is meaningful. It's when we take all that for granted that unnecessary problems start to occur, families get broken up and we resort to lesser means of finding fulfillment. I think the scenes/story of Angela and Lester is meant to signify coming alive. Angela made him feel things he hasn't felt in a long time, and actually wanted to take care of himself. At first, he thought his end goal was to get with her, but eventually he realized that it was to see his life from a positive perspective. Maybe the reason he was drawn to her was because it allowed him to finally realize the beauty that he already had in his stupid little life.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

"The harsh consequences of our contemporary society, shows how fear is the main culprit of trying to keep up appearances and not accepting ourselves as we really are","American Beauty is a chronicle about ordinary people living through relatively ordinary dramas and that, in a way, end up reaching equally ordinary conclusions. Perhaps this is precisely the secret of the film, which, at the end of the projection, manages to lead us to curiously intense emotions: the fact that its message is universal. How to avoid identifying with a man as normal as the one played by Kevin Spacey? Directed by Sam Mendes, following the routine of a group of ordinary citizens, the plot portrays a family in the process of breaking up. Lester (Kevin Spacey) and Carolyn's (Annette Bening) marriage is a sea of coldness and arguments. Suddenly, he starts fantasizing about Angela (Mena Suvari), a teenager who is his daughter's friend. From then on, the protagonist makes major changes in his life that end tragically.Sam Mendes' cinematographic debut, American Beauty has extremely symbolic moments that visually express the concepts inserted in its plot, skillfully captured by cinematographer Conrad L. Hall. The first and most important of these elements, which should be visible to any viewer, are Mendes' framing that insistently highlights the presence of roses in the environment in which some sequences take place. These are not simple roses, but American beauties. Present in the original name of the film and in its literal national translation, american beauty is a variation of rose that is very common in the United States, visually perfect, but without smell or thorns. The subtlety with which Mendes presents them makes a parallel with the American suburban families that star in his story and that, apparently perfect with their beautiful homes, cars and smiles, are emotionally and evidently empty.The main couple, composed of Carolyn and Lester, has so many facets that their characters, added to the fantastic interpretations of Annette Bening and Kevin Spacey, can be analyzed from multiple perspectives. The apparently controversial relationship that the two share, extremely maternal, is what stands out the most. It is enough to notice Carol's corporal imposition on Lester, who is constantly bowed before his presence, or the childlike treatment he receives from his wife. This dominant-dominated involvement is evident to the point that a sequence with sexual content between the two appears to be almost incestuous.The fact is, Lester is unhappy. Ignored by his wife and daughter, he has worked for over a decade at a magazine that confines him to eternal servitude and the betrayal of all his youthful dreams. An existence where ""Yes, sir"" is as common an expression as ""Excuse me."" That's when his entire perception is altered by a magnificent vision: Angela, his daughter's teenage friend. Swept away by this new passion, Lester wakes up from the 'coma' he's been immersed in for years and decides to give himself a new chance. His goals are humble: he doesn't want to be rich or elected President. He just wants to respect himself and be happy. How not to be moved by a purpose so simple and, at the same time, so complex? Initially a defeated guy who can't even express his opinions aloud, Lester gradually regains his self-esteem through small victories. One night, for example, he has an argument with his wife and manages, after years, to say what he really thinks. His huge smile right after the fight highlights the importance of that apparently ridiculous situation. And his next sentence is a little pearl of common man wisdom: ""It's great to realize that we still have the ability to surprise ourselves.""But Alan Ball's beautiful script is not just a midlife crisis: the story is a small revolving machine gun that does not bother to spare some of the most deeply rooted values of the American way of life (and of any reasonably industrialized civilization - read itself: dedicated to consumption). From the gay neighbors (apparently the most balanced in the film) to the family that lives next door to the Burnhams, everyone has something to hide: the great truth is that keeping up appearances is an art to which we all dedicate ourselves - and the film, in turn, , is dedicated to exposing this little hypocrisy that has become the norm in today's world.The film has a multitude of details and symbolism that at first may go unnoticed by the viewer. The house where the families live reflect what they aspire to be: perfect and symmetrical. Inside Lester's house, all the furniture is symmetrically placed, has cool colors and has a specific function and at a given moment, it becomes clear that they are more important to his wife than himself. The garage, where he becomes his refuge, is a messier place, colorful and open to novelties. Which reflects directly on the couple's relationship, where Carolyn has much more space and much more power than Lester. Nor does Jane's room bear any resemblance to her personality, which ends up making the film incredibly fascinating, as it talks about appearances, about projecting an image of something you are not. And the Burnhams are far from a happy, close-knit family.Kevin Spacey, however, is largely responsible for the success of American Beauty: there is not a single moment in which Lester's ""saga"" rings false - despite the absurdity of some situations. His initial lethargy is convincingly replaced by hilarious cynicism, finally giving way to absolute serenity. The expression on the actor's face when teenage Angela reveals to him that his daughter is in love represents, in itself, one of the most touching moments seen on film in years. When he finally says 'Good for her', the last movement of his transformation takes place: Lester finally realizes that happiness has always been within her reach - his frustration is what kept him from realizing it.The other characters, however minor participation some may have, in no way can be considered disposable or supporting, as American Beauty is a work of many protagonists. Jane Burnham, played by Thora Birch, has the usual problems of adolescence that add to the upheavals that her family suffers, and she doesn't quite know how to behave in the face of it. When she meets Ricky (Wes Bentley), her new neighbor, she sees in him a possibility to put aside her fragility. Furthermore, newcomer Wes Bentley surprises by portraying a young man whose apparent madness is mere disguise for his poet's soul. Contrasted with the passivity of Jane's father, Colonel Frank Fitts (Chris Cooper), Ricky's father, is extremely disciplinarian and castrating, and throughout the film one understands the reasons that made him that way. Probably partly to blame for his wife's sanity, the colonel also makes his son's life untenable. The apparent one-dimensionality of Chris Cooper's character turns out to be a clever mask of the true complexity of his feelings.Almost everyone in American Beauty seeks something, but ends up giving up or getting frustrated. Jane wants new breasts, but she gives up when she realizes that what she has is enough for the boyfriend she finally finds. Angela builds a sexually active persona to be accepted (a kind of search for otherness in pre-internet times), but when confronted with who she never was, she reveals herself as just an insecure little girl. Carolyn wants to achieve material and professional victory, but she does not have the competence to do so. The colonel wants a world governed by order and discipline, but fails when trying to do this in his own home, exposing how much his family is a failure. In the case of the colonel, the failure is even greater because he does not fall alone, since he does not even realize that his biggest defeat is far from his son: his catatonic and lost wife. Only Ricky and Lester, in a sense, by giving up the materialistic pursuit and acceptance of others, supposedly find their happiness.Ball's script builds a side shadow announcing the protagonist's death and developing a series of small arcs that can open up countless possibilities to the public regarding the author of the murder (the recording of Ricky and Jane, Ricky with the keys to the gun cabinet of the father, Carolyn learning to shoot). It is a well-made primary narrative resource, but it is built through a script that develops so much thematically that, many years later, little or none of it is remembered. The basis of multiple themes and the acidity on which the ""who's going to do it"" of Lester's murder is based is much more perennial and striking.American Beauty shows the consequences of a completely dehumanized and materialistic society that contrasts with the most intimate concerns of being. It seeks a critical look at our reality, in which we play roles, we constantly put on masks to try to fit into patterns. Our society is like a great masked ball, which changes over the years: son, father, grandfather, etc. All this to form a lifestyle, an aesthetic based on appearances and artifices, which began to take shape after the Second World War with the promotion of the American way of life. It is interesting to see how these masks are lost when sex appears on the scene, when individuals allow themselves to be carried away by these passions. From Lester to Colonel Fitts, passing through the teenagers Jane and Angela (Jane's friend), all succumb to desire and let their authentic yearnings and insecurities show through.Sam Mendes' film presents the harsh consequences of our contemporary society, shows how fear is the main culprit of trying to keep up appearances and not accepting ourselves as we really are. We deny, hide and use a multitude of masks in order to adapt and survive the established patterns. Undoubtedly, appearances are deceiving.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
The Beauty of American Beauty,"The American Beauty is a movie about - you guessed it - beauty. And not only are we talking about appearance, but also the beauty of the simplest things in life. As the main character says, ""Today is the first day of the rest of your life"". And you'll know it full well when you reach the end of this masterpiece.The movie was released in 1999 and directed by Sam Mendes. Kevin Spacey, embodied into Lester Burnham, tells a story about a middle-aged father trying to sort his life out. And his unbalanced in life wife Carolyn and anxious, misunderstood daughter Jane are really not helping him out. Each of them have their flaws and seeing them struggling to straighten things out is a true pleasure to watch.Now, right off the bat I want to say I've loved the movie. Seeing the plot unravel and the characters change in meaningful ways is frankly astonishing. Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening (as Carolyn) and Wes Bentley (as Ricky, a creepy neighbour next door) really outdid themselves in this one. At first they caused me to cringe horribly (obviously as intended). But later on with their engaging performances we realize how endearing and relatable these people are. Discovering their complex (or sometimes the simplest) views on life really warms a viewer's heart.The movie was quite funny and I've lol'd a few times. The tone is mostly light - the audience can relax and enjoy a good film. What we also need to talk about is the soundtrack, which absolutely appealed to me. The music really gave the atmosphere of the movie a nice touch. And last thing, the dialogues were top notch, mainly the ones between Lester and Carolyn. The asparagus scene genuinely amazed me and it's definitely gonna stay on my mind for some time.In conclusion, the filmmaker was successful in his role - making me self-reflect and have a good time. The charming characters and their complex stories are truly worth a rewatch. American Beauty is certainly a title I'll come back to.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

A very overrated film in my opinion,"How good is American Beauty? Well, it depends on how emotionally you enjoy being drained. Also, I feel this movie is massively overrated because the whole disjointed dysfunctional family aspect is way overplayed. I could not take Spacey seriously as a character- why did he start smoking pot and working out, suddenly? Why is the wife unhappy and if they are unhappy than why not get a divorce? Despite 1999 being one of the best year for American Cinema I can't believe this one won all the awards and accolades. Regardless, you can judge for yourself but in my opinion American Beauty has not aged well at all.",,Anonymous,Drama
"Thinly-conceived, but arrogantly brilliant...","Black comedy from screenwriter Alan Ball is alternately cynical and satirical as it examines life behind the Red Door in garden-filled suburbia. Unhappily married husband and father fantasizes about his teenage daughter's sexy girlfriend while his uptight real estate agent spouse has an affair with her mentor; meanwhile, their daughter gets to know the troubled youth next door, who has icy, dysfunctional parents so rigid they're like horrible cartoons. Overrated picture is thin--and so preconceived to be shocking that it seems rather embittered (although most audiences were not put off). Conrad Hall's Oscar-winning cinematography is exceptionally handsome and the cast is excellent (especially Kevin Spacey, who gives a slyly intricate Oscar-performance), yet the film is hampered by an over-ambitious third-act, unnecessary bursts of melodramatic nonsense (often with a sexual undercurrent), and smarmy vulgarities. Oscars also went to Sam Mendes for his direction, Ball for his original screenplay, and--incredibly--the film as Best Picture of the year. **1/2 from ****",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

It's nothing more than an overblown, exaggerated view of a dysfunctional family set to the backdrop of a suburban lifestyle that, for the most part, seems totally unrealistic. While Kevin Spacey usually turns in consistent performances (although he always seems to play rather offbeat characters), I felt his performance here was very weak. He plays a middle-aged man going through his midlife crisis period but to me, just seems unconvincing. Even Annette Benning's performance seemed way below par. Quite frankly, definitely not worthy of Best Picture and not one that I would want to own.",1.0,Anonymous,Drama
Finding your identity,"What is, and how do you define beauty? Beauty seems to be subjective as people's personal preference differ from person to person. Beauty is however all around us, and you just have to look hard enough to find it, and to appreciate it.American Beauty pitches several people in different stages in life, all trying to find their purpose in life. The ideal is similar for everyone as there is a perceived objective agreeable way in living one's life. The thing is that all the people we meet struggles to find this true way of living one's life, and is therefore stuck portraying a perceived life that looks good on paper, but in reality doesn't work.You can't review this movie without mentioning some of the many symbolic moments in this great film. Take the rose for instance. The rose is a marvel of true beauty given that you view it in a field full of similar flowers. When you isolate one flower, the beautification changes and you find thorns and a more complexity than what is usually perceived when one notices a flowerbed full of roses. The symbolic meaning of the rose is true in that regard, and the same case goes for the people and families we meet in American Beauty.As with the rose, there is so much more to this film than the pebbles. The way in which the movie alternates between stories, while simultaneously keeping a coherent message across all stories is marvellous to watch. The movie likes to change viewpoints while in the middle of a dialog to show us the viewer how the character in display feels. This is one of the main purpose of the character of Ricky.This movie truly has one of the best movie soundtracks of all time. Paul Newman captures the essence of identity and finding purpose excellently and the score gives so much more to this already great movie. As with the score, the cinematography is also excellent. There are simply too many clever camera tricks used to measure everything from power to mood, for me to be able to put them all into this review. However, I want you to pay attention to all the metaphors visualized during the movie.One has to mention the great acting of Kevin Spacey in particular. This is a performance taken to the next level, and it's a well-deserved Oscar for best performance.With a great score, and a marvellous cinematographic directorial vision Sam Mendes has created a masterpiece of a movie and it is astonishing to watch.My score: 93/100.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
To do what you need or what you want?,"""American Beauty"" by Sam Mendes is a rather philosophical movie about whether we should conform to societal roles or pursue our inner desires. Set in modern-day America, it resonates with our potential and everyday experiences. The film highlights many issues that people often face in their families, such as exhausting routines, struggling relationships that decline over time, and misunderstandings that lead to unnecessary actions. It contrasts living rationally with our consciousness versus living emotionally, making decisions based on our unconscious mind. Like in real life, rationality can lead to a quiet, but dull existence, while emotions make life more intense, with all the ups and downs that come with it. It seems the truth lies somewhere in the middle. I highly recommend it, especially if you have a family and can relate to the main characters.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

American Beauty is Still Beautiful,"After all these 25 years, American Beauty still shows America in all its ugliness and with such sardonic humor. Is sardonic the right word? Director Sam Mendes uses Spielburgesque videotaping; even the ""King of Real Estate"" Peter Gallagher made his breakthrough in Sex, Lies and Videotape. Alan Ball, the writer intersperses the lyrics of such well chosen songs with the dialogue that you cannot separate dialogue from music at the most moving moments.Choreography BR Paula Abdul doesn't look like choreography at all....except for the funnily lame cheerleaders. But her touch of class makes you realize how well this film was planned and executed to the last detail. The list of songs used itself plays like a playlist you would want to put on a loop.Annette Benning continues to amaze us, just as when she conquered Warren Beatty. Kevin Spacey has faced his comedown. Thora Birch, while steadily working has never broken through to stardom, nor have the stunningly beautiful Mena Suvari or Wes Bentley. Chris Cooper seems to have had his day as well. But this ensemble cast has created a perennial. It's such a pleasure to be able to laugh at the tragedy of lives gone bad and to know that beauty is sometimes so grand that we can barely sustain its grandeur in spite of it.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"A bit pretentious at times, exaggerated at others but will still touch a nerve with those of us that look at our `stuff' but wonder where our happiness went","Lester Burnham is stuck in a rut - he is having a midlife crisis, alienated from his wife and daughter, sexually frustrated and longing for a feeling that he had as a young man that responsibility robbed him of as an adult. When he meets his daughter's best friend it kicks off a realisation that his life needs to change, starting with quitting his job and acting less responsible.  Meanwhile the lives of both Carolyn and Jane Burnham begin to change in different ways as they also try to deal with the empty days that they seem to live.When this film came out it jumped almost to the top of the imdb top 250 list - much as many films that make a big audience think or feel something do. Also it gained award after award and was basically held up as a generally great film.  I saw it at the time and was very impressed by it as it touched a nerve in some regards.  Watching it several years later I still am able to take some thinks from it but am more open to the faults that are within it. The actual plot is exaggerated in terms of it not fitting in with the average audience member's experience.  However it's wide wings will mean that it will speak to a large section of it's audience.The points it has to say are very broad but are delivered in a reasonable manner - i.e. not overly veiled but not rammed down our throats.  I like to think I am a few years off a midlife crisis but I can see my life in Lester's feelings, as many of us can - hence the film's success.  This is not to say that the whole plot is perfect for it is not.  The film is slightly arty and, sadly, a bit pretentious.  I almost dare not say it as I know many audience members were very touched by the `bag scene', but I did think to myself that the film must be very good to be able to carry off a scene that is so full of cheese and pretension!  This happens at several points throughout the film in different ways and does take away from the film somewhat.  Likewise the film's lapse into `whodunit' towards the end doesn't really work either.  Happily the central plot and the classy delivery from director Mendes makes for a great film.The cast greatly helps and were appropriately rewarded for their work. Spacey may have been in the process of losing his edge by this point in his career (hopefully he'll get back to his best, but he hasn't at the time of writing).  Here he is great and his semi-comic delivery helps smooth out some of the unlikely edges on his character.  Bening is given a lesser role in terms of not being central to the story but her character is actually more emotionally real than Lester - she has to deal with life like the majority of us whereas Lester flees from it.  Birch is good and underplays well while it is nice to see Suvari in a film that isn't average.  Bentley has the least role of the film as his character is the most abstractly drawn and least realistic.  He is OK in the role but he is limited by what he has to work with.  Janney's role is small and one dimensional but her performance is great - it is hard to believe that this is the same woman that plays the super confident and talkative CJ in West Wing!  Cooper is as good as ever and small roles are well done by Gallagher, Bakula and Robards.Overall this is a very good film but I find it hard to accept that it has been consistently as high up the critics (amateur and professional) lists as it has been.  It has a good plot that has broad enough characters so that most viewers will find something to relate to, but this stretch also opens it up to problems that serve to weaken the film somewhat.  That said, this is still a film that is thoughtful, artistic, character driven and moving - and when a big Hollywood film manages to do that then it is a cause for praise, not complaint.",,Anonymous,Drama

life affirming,"I've had an account for close to 2 years now and after watching this film I felt the need to write my first review. To sum up 'American Beauty' in one word would be near impossible, Kevin Spacey's portrayal as the sick to death suburban husband and father who's desperately trying to figure out when and where it all went wrong is undoubtedly Oscar worthy on it's own merits, but as we all know Spacey always brings something to the table that others can't offer.He takes us through a journey of mid-life self discovery and is able to accomplish what many forty-something ordinary..unhappy, bored with life husbands and fathers cannot, he's the feeling in your gut, he's the voice in the back of your head, telling you to do it, do what would end the misery and open yourself to the beauty of the world.To watch this film for the first time 15 years after it's release and it still have an effect on the viewer says a lot for the film itself, it is becoming increasingly difficult for anything pre-2000 to stay relevant, especially in this modern mess of a world but 'American Beauty' delves into both adolescent and adult life with the tag line '...look closer' being so subtle yet so pertinent.Coming into a review it is incredibly important to remain objective, but of course if one is writing passionately it may appear subjective, reading a lot of negative reviews about 'American Beauty' it appears one of the main critical points made is that the film is full of cliché's, or is described as one big cliché. It's not hard to see where these opinions come from but it's important to realise that not all great films need to be bursting with taboo matters and subjects, sometimes the simpler stories are the most eye opening...'American Beauty' along side 'Fight Club' in my opinion is one of the most life affirming films that I have had the pleasure of watching, teaching that there's so much beauty in the world, in places and things you would never even think to look twice at, you've just got to be ready, and willing to be in that place, where you've not nothing to lose.To reiterate, 'American Beauty' cannot be summed up in one word, you just have look closer, if you're ready.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

Don't Understand,"I'll will go ahead and say that I think there a lot of films out there (not just films but books as well) that I perceive as being ""faux"" deep. American Beauty is just this kind of film. The premise I thought to be a pretty typical premise, the main theme I thought to be a pretty typical main theme, the characters and acting I thought to be pretty typical. In the end though, the thing that turned me away from it was the execution. I just thought everything about this movie was soooo cookie cutter. For example, we took a break in the middle of the movie (I was watching it with friends) and they all started to talk about how cool it was that the main character smoked weed and was an adult. I rolled my eyes because that is the kind of hip bullcrap that directors and writers put in movies to sell to audiences. My final assessment of the movie was that it was Office Space, but without the comedy. Before people think that I am crazy I will explain this theory. So the main character goes through a religious style experience that shows him he should stop living life by other people's rules. It goes well for a while, but then it starts to alienate the man from his wife/girlfriend and drives her away. He ends up really hurting his best friends/neighbors and daughter. Then at the end of the movie the main character realizes that this lifestyle he has been leading really has no substance and that everything that he had before that lifestyle got out of hand is what gave his life substance. Of course, Office Space has a happy ending and American Beauty really doesn't, but the main theme is the exact or close to the exact same thing.

His character's journey is both tragic and liberating, reminding us of the complexities of chasing happiness in a world full of societal expectations. Annette Bening is equally captivating as Carolyn, whose relentless pursuit of perfection becomes a poignant reflection on discontent and self-worth.What makes American Beauty so remarkable is its layered storytelling. Alan Ball's Oscar-winning script weaves humor, heartbreak, and existential musings seamlessly, leaving the audience reflective long after the credits roll. The film's exploration of beauty in unexpected places - a plastic bag swirling in the wind or the raw honesty of human emotion - invites us to question what we consider truly beautiful.Visually, Conrad Hall's cinematography is a revelation. The symbolic use of color, particularly the recurring motif of red roses, adds depth and artistic flair, while Thomas Newman's hauntingly beautiful score sets the tone perfectly, pulling viewers deeper into the story.Mendes' direction strikes a balance between sharp satire and profound introspection, ensuring every character and subplot contributes meaningfully to the larger narrative. The result is a film that is not only a critique of societal norms but also a celebration of the extraordinary hidden within the ordinary.American Beauty is a timeless classic that dares to challenge and inspire. It's a film that holds a mirror to our own lives, asking us to see the beauty, chaos, and imperfection within ourselves. A must-watch for anyone who appreciates cinema that speaks to the soul.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
A complex film with a multitude of themes,"American Beauty is not overrated. It seems as though every time a movie gets so much praise at the Oscars makes it automatically bad. That's pretty idiotic. I don't get the negative backlash. The themes and characters are still timeless,and still resonates with us. Also, the bullshit about pedophilia gets me wondering why any human being would believe such trolls. I guess you could interpret that however.The movie is about Lester Burnham who is going through a mid-life crisis. He has a controlling wife who always nags at Lester, a rebellious angst driven teenage daughter, a horrible corrupt job, and he falls in love with his daughters friend. As you could probably tell, his life just goes downhill from here.This is one compelling and engaging movie. From the opening scene you are instantly thrown into Lester's life, right down to the explosive finale at the end. I don't think people get how much depth there is in this movie, or maybe they forgot. The movie was highly acclaimed by critics and was nominated for a lot of awards, yet for some reason people started hating on it years after. The movie has a multitude of themes however, from lust, marriage, purpose, motivation, insecurities, being ordinary, and homosexuality. Those are heavy topics, but the film actually has some dark acid wit to it. It's not a particularly depressing film, the characters are very interesting as they go through their own problems.The movie is a masterpiece, it has such a beautiful yet haunting score and the dream sequences were Lester fantasizes about his daughters friend gives symbolism and meaning behind his character. The plastic bag scene I have mixed feelings about, I could understand why they wanted to show it, gives meaning to one of the characters traits, but I thought the delivery was cheesy. The pace is suitably slow, I love the atmosphere of the film and how the film takes its time to flesh out the characters and themes. Sam Mendes does an excellent job at directing making each and every scene stand out.The flaws I have are some questionable scenes. Like when Lester is eavesdropping on his daughter and her friend and they hear something outside, Lester thinks they hear him and loudly runs down stairs. First of all, how did they not hear Lester? They hear one tap on the window but not the loud running just outside their door? Also, like the bag scene there are a lot of heavy handed moments in the movie in terms of acting and throwing symbolism's and metaphor's.Overall, the movie left an impact on me. Lester's mundane routine gets me worried if that stuff will happen to me in the future. Well, it probably will, since I already feel as though I have mid-life existential crisis's. Oh gosh. Anyways watch American Beauty, it holds up and its on Netflix.Score: 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Brilliant drama,"American Beauty is a brilliant drama, so powerful and moving. Having read roughly what the film was about before I started watching it, I was pleasantly surprised by how multi dimensional it turned out to be. There was much more going on than I expected and all the story lines were interesting in their own way.The plot goes much deeper than I imagined and it really is just a brilliant drama. It also has its comedy moments which help the film to flow. The cast in this all delivered very strong performances and made it seem so real, especially Kevin Spacey. Wes Bentley is also deserving of a mention for his portrayal of the very mysterious neighbour. The way it ended won't be to everyone's taste but for me it makes it more memorable.Overall it is a brilliant drama that I would highly recommend and I would certainly watch again.

surburbia,"unlike some, i find the topic of the mediocrity of suburban life to be very interesting, as i can relate to the environment... often people say that these tales are of no value, and that characters in these settings should ""just get over it""... or ""why does anybody care about a bunch of spoiled boring people?""...i'm not of the opinion that suburban life is irrelevant... it's the situation many people find themselves in, and in it people face different struggles... perhaps not as monumental as fighting giant worms or dodging terrifying political violence, but still valid and human...thus, i have watched many movies that tackle the subject... a common slant is to infuse a little fantasy or poetry in the otherwise mundane, which brings out certain truths or extrapolates on the human condition...American beauty is no different... while other movies like ""lawn dogs"" firmly establish the fairytale idea early on in the movie, American beauty plays quite straight until its main character's fantasies are used to unlock hidden truths about the world he lives in... objects are given dreamlike significance, etc...American beauty also slips into an unlikely set of events, much like the awful ""desperate housewives""... our protagonist (played by kevin spacey) attempts blackmail to fund a life of teenage ambition... he gets a job at a burger place to annoy and frustrate the people in his life who have in turn, annoyed and frustrated him...what American beauty struggles with is its innate heavy handedness... at times the wisdom dispensed in the movie is trite, or just lame... it suffers from its absurd events, and clichéd ideas of people... if someone doesn't agree with your idea of fun, they're probably in the closet and violent...still, annette bening gives a great performance... it is funny and charming in places, and it does make you think... a good movie to see to introduce the idea of satire, social commentary, and drama... similar movies i've seen have been slightly better however, like the solid and bruising ""safety of objects"", or the devastating, vicious ""happiness""...i don't think this movie is a classic, but it is powerful and interesting in places... it's sad that the IMDb doesn't allow decimals, because this would be a 6.7 or so... worthwhile...",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

"""I feel like I've been in a coma for 20 years, and I'm just now waking up""","This film, alongside Fight Club, marks the best film of 1999. It's deep, complex and enchanting. The film explores themes such as the definition of beauty, the dangers of obsession, or the delusion in denying who you are, amongst many other themes. At the same time, it's just an excellent film, with a brilliant story that can be watched without trying to analyse it.Kevin Spacey's character is very well written. His life has turned docile and he no longer has anything to live for. In a situation like this, it makes perfect sense for him to be obsessed with a girl. It's not particularly the girl that matters, it's finding something to live for in a life that has nothing to offer him anymore. Anyone who has ever obsessed over someone can properly connect with this film. You build up an idea of them in your head, only for that idea to erode away slowly, until you're faced with the ugly reality of who they really are.It's possibly to go on and on about the complexities of each character. The only criticism of the film one could argue, is that apart from Kevin Spacey's character, none of them are particularly likeable. However this could be argued that it was deliberately written this way as stereotypes of modern America. Regardless, this film is a masterpiece, and the ending is very impactful.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
A weird everyday family story,"With 5 Oscars (best movie, director, actor leading role, cinematography and writing) and 3 more nominations (actress leading role, film editing and music) it is listed as one of the leading films in the history of cinema. Weird film, with Kevin Spacey being the only character in the play that played more as a comedian and much less as a drama, an element that sealed the film's weird character. The film is powerful, a mirror of relationships in a modern family. A family broken up inside, where its members seek communication, joy, love, esteem, outside the family context. Just the opposite of what the family window showcases, that is. And all this is embedded in the social context, with its anchors, its distortions, its exaggerations, its impositions, but also its instability. To conclude that the family self-destructs itself, which is ultimately the only element on which she could find support.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Awesome Movie,"Well worth seeing, especially if you're a Kevin Spacey fan. Different than I expected, but fantastic. A lot of character development through out, where as I was expecting most to be focused on Spacey, a lot was spent on all characters which makes the movie all the better. You will not be disappointed if you decide to watch this movie. Very complex character interactions. Some odd/creepy parts but I think that it gives the movie its interesting touch and willingness to cross some lines made it unique. Along with Spacey, Chris Cooper also does a fantastic job and plays his typical character as a strict military man. Annette Benning also was fantastic. Great movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Helplessness behind the mask of madness,"I have to say it is quite obvious why this film swept the Oscars awards. Captivating picture, detailed performance, deep thought, valid illustrations. Although some clips and characters are a bit weird, surprisingly a taste of dark humor is added, spicing up the story.Besides, 'American Beauty' reminds me of a paralleled story, An elephant sitting still, which similarly reveals the tiredness and irrationality among the society.Personally speaking, the plastic bags metaphor is a little stereotypical and the camera guy is kinda creepy, which got me a bit distracted.Above all, a decent work can speak for itself and pop out spontaneously. Light 9 is a valid score, worth watching for several times.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
American Beauty,"Being a big fan of David Lynch, I quite enjoy a movie that is a little ""off"". Having a political science degree, I definitely enjoy a movie that deals with deep issues like society and expectations. Sam Mendes' 1999 Best Picture winner embodies all of the above aspects that I like. About 20 minutes into this film, I was certain I was going to enjoy it. I wasn't wrong.American Beauty highlights one suburban family's struggle with cultivating the normality that is expected of theirs, and every other family in America. The perfect house and lawn, the successful parents with good jobs, the well-adjusted high school teenager. There is just one problem with this picture--it doesn't exist. Carolyn Burnham (Annette Bening) is a real estate agent vying for top spot in her market against a good looking competitor sweeping the field. Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) makes a decent living in a job he hates increasingly more with each passing day. Jane Burnham (Thora Birch) is the disillusioned youngest daughter in the house, struggling to fit in at school and eager to start her life. When a run-in with one of Jane's friends sets Lester headlong into a mid- life crisis, each weave of the Burnham family's seemingly perfect life comes unstitched.The overarching theme of this movie deals with the question, what is normal? The fact is, that answer is different for each individual. We see three different variations of normal just in the Burnham's neighborhood, let alone outside their block. Expecting life to come together into the cookie-cutter image you've expected since you were cognizant of your place in the world just isn't reality. Unfortunately, many people don't understand that false reality and attempt, for far too many years of their life, to create what they've always expected. True liberation comes with learning to be yourself. For that reason alone, you should make time for American Beauty. Oh yeah, and Kevin Spacey.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

Something much more than I expected,"Whether you like it or not, you always watch a movie with an expectation.

I got a movie so filled with life lessons, so rich in so many ways, that I think it spoke to me. I loved the characters in this movie. The one that sees all the beauty in the world. The frustrated middle-aged man that is not happy with his life. The tough guy that does not know how to handle the social situations and problems he and his family is facing. I loved the music. I loved how it told such an important story with at times comedic means. Although I might have preferred a different ending, it still felt right.I don't know if you will like it.

The brilliant direction by Sam Mendes and permanence from Kevin Spacey (less we forget) is really what pulls it together. The dialogue was also fantastic and had me laughing at several moments ( seriously that dinner scene after spacey quits his job is absolutely hilarious).
Honestly my biggest problem of the film was the whole 'Spacey's character is going to die at the end' draw. It felt unnecessary in the theme of the plot, the ending voice over of spacey talking about his life felt quite out of place honestly.

Hollywood Goes Post-Cynical,"Lured by rave reviews and a sexy ad campaign, I was nevertheless expecting not a whole lot from this Big Hollywood tragi-comedic look at a dysfunctional, upper-middle-class suburban family.  I mean, you've got the mild-mannered guy-in-a-suit who's going through a mid-life crisis (Kevin Spacey), the materialistic wife (Annette Benning), the snarling, goth teenage daughter, the sexy blonde cheerleader--stereotypes all, or at least they would have been stereotypes in the hands of a less capable director, screenwriter and cast.  But here, they're modern archetypes. If there had been nothing else to this movie, I would have been amazed and gratified simply on account of the skillful navigation of the fine line between caricature and character.  For instance, I would normally roll my eyes at the simplistic cliche and cheesy humor of a scene where the shallow, materialistic wife pours cold water on an abortive love-making session because she's afraid her husband will spill beer on her $4,000 couch with its Italian fabric.  But here, it makes sense, and the characters' motivations and interactions are believable, and it's even a little sad. And there's the arrogant, vain cheerleader:  In most movies you're expected to despise her without qualification, but here you get a few subtle hints of her underlying isolation and vulnerability that make sympathy possible, in spite of the fact that her character remains basically a prop.  All the characters, lead and supporting, morally ambiguous as well as evil, come out looking human.  While I wish Hollywood could make more movies about ""normal"" people, instead of the privileged suburbanites it identifies most with (maybe American Beauty could have transcended mere excellence and attained immortality if it had been about, say, an auto lube technician married to a receptionist), it seems that the film-makers have deliberately chosen the familiar milieu of a critique of the American Dream to serve as a vehicle for a broader message.  Spacey's family has the big house, the picket fence, the mini-van--but they don't have happiness.  That's the cliche, but this film rises up from 30 or 40 years of cynical cinematic commentary on the soulless emptiness of bourgeois family life to tell us that there is life beyond disillusionment, beyond (and within) the inevitable ugliness around us, and that it has been there all along. It does so in a way that isn't heart-warming in the way we're accustomed to (it has dispensed with sentimentality as well as cynicism, as they are two sides of a coin), but it is hardly cold, and it is touching and thought-provoking.",,Anonymous,Drama

So this is just being real. Taking issue with a fictional movie is ill-directed; your and society's reluctance to sit with this is and accept systemic issues what makes society so easy for perpetrators to operate within.

It's also funny that this is called an American Classic when the director, Sam Mendez (Road to Perdition), is in fact English.Spacey stars as Lester Burnham, a loser who hates his wife (Annette Benning- The Grifters, Mars Attacks) and whose daughter (Thora Birch- Patroit Games, Ghost World) hates him, whose life changes when he black mails his boss, falls for his daughters best friend (Mena Suvari- Atomic Train, American Pie 1 & 2, The Musketeer) and is introduced to the world of drugs by his neighbour (Wes Bentley).I know wrote in a previous review that I see ""To End All Wars as better film-making triumph"" and I still stand by that, but you just can't help but to be drawn in to this wonderful movie by the amazing Academy Award winning combination of Alan Ball's screenplay, Mendez's direction and Spacey performance.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

American Spacey,"Rambling, unedited and unprofessional review of AMERICAN BEAUTY, which has not aged well, and it's NOT only because Kevin Spacey and his current problems... yet that's what Hollywood has claimed: Spacey's sexual abuse allegations (against young boys) has made this seem all-too-real (but these are the same people that flew to France to hand Roman Polanski his Oscar, and later signed a petition to get him off from finally facing said rape charges here in America)...Instead, BEAUTY, in deliberately trying to play on cliches, never fully progresses past them for the characters to be fleshed out as actual humans...Especially Annette Bening in what could be the WORST performance in an Oscar winning feature, screaming her lines as a shallow, work-motivated suburban real estate agent yuppie-from-hell as if she were in another movie altogether, or auditioning for an overboard parody of upper middle class families...And she seems created just to make our central hero look cooler and become more sympathetic, but he didn't need help since Spacey is actually quite good, charming, the suburb dad version of the usual ""lovable loser"" herein lusting for his bratty-deep, morbid daughter's sexy blonde friend... And how would his borderline Goth daughter be a cheerleader in the first place?But she has her own admirer, crushed on by the next door neighbor's even more morbid son... And his dad's a Marine who represents what Hollywood hates: An extreme right winger, homophobic, in the military, cold to his wife, abusive to his son, and get this... he's a homosexual and... well let's not spoil the ending...Overall, one of the aspects that inspired other films is the ghostly piano score, mellow, haunting, overly-moving, which you now hear the likes of in every ""important"" film's trailer (it used to be the more upbeat piano theme for Terms of Endearment)...Other than that, AMERICAN BEAUTY stole more from past films (or rather, cliches from past films) than it actually created yet, still, you can't say it isn't entertaining being a fun ride when not trying to be too deep, or too obviously trying to prove a point or agenda...Maybe if it were a more straight-line comedy instead of telling us to Look Closely the audience could judge for themselves what to get out of the story, because, for the most part, the themes are as forced to the viewer as Spacey's character's life was forcing him into the kind of submission he eventually dug his way out of...Yet, maybe... that was the intention all along.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
American Beauty,"Despite all the plaudits - including 5 Oscars, 6 BAFTAs and 3 Golden Globes - I didn't love this film. It focuses on the trials and tribulations of ostensibly happy, humdrum daily life with all of the idiosyncrasies engendered by the bored, frustrated and jealous people whose lives are pretty empty of meaningful experiences from day to day. I struggled from the outset to see why anyone would be besotted with the rather skeletal ""Angela"" (Mena Suvari); perhaps that is what makes Kevin Spacey's performance so appreciable as the pretty unlikeable voyeur (""Lester""). Are we supposed to like him; sympathise with him, hate him - all of those? I didn't know - and I don't suppose that I really bothered much either. His self-induced mid-life crisis was rather tedious as a storyline, regardless of the actor's (superb) quality of character delivery. Clearly Sam Mendes had a vision for this - but like life itself, it is all over the place. By the time we get to the repressed gay aspects of ""Lester"" and the shame/depression and brutality that it appears to evoke from his thoroughly flawed personality I needed to come up for air...

Sam Mendes Gets It Wrong -- Again,"Sam Mendes' entire film career has consisted of woefully misguided attempts to dissect the many ills of American culture without remotely understanding them. Perhaps he should spend some time slinging his arrows at Britain's problems before jumping across the pond.""American Beauty"" is a movie about American suburban malaise set in a version of suburban America that simply doesn't exist. Its characters are either gross and grotesque caricatures or mere vessels for regurgitating Alan Ball's pretentious screenplay, forced to utter lines that never sound like things people would actually say. Kevin Spacey gives the consummate Spacey performance -- one-note snideness delivered in a sardonic monotone -- that he gives every time he's in front of a camera, while poor Annette Bening is unwatchable in a frenzied performance that I have to believe was forced on her by the director, since she's never again been as bad, either before or since. The worst of the film's dialogue is reserved for all of the angst-filled teenagers, and most conspicuously for Wes Bentley, a tortured and philosophic youth who reads a ridiculous soliloquy about the beauty to be found in a plastic bag as if he's reciting Shakespeare.The film has a weird preoccupation with homosexuality that doesn't really fit and makes itself most manifest in the character of Chris Cooper, a closeted ex-serviceman who, true to the film's form, is depicted as a goulish representative of conservative America.What is the point you ask of all this glib satire?

One of the Best films of 1999!!,"A definite addition to my Ten Best List for 1999,  is AMERICAN BEAUTY which is sure to earn Kevin Spacey, Annette Benning  (robbed in the past for her work in BUGSY and THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT),  and Alan Ball (most original screenplay to come along in awhile), Oscar nominations. It is the story of what suburban life and the pursuit of the American Dream can do to an American Family. But unlike the critic's darling from a few years ago ICE STORM, which left me freezing, this film is genuinely funny and moving at the same time. The ideas projected by director Sam Mendes literally leap off the screen.  Spacey's edgy performance as the ad exec pushed over the brink by the pressures of having to have it all and his passion for ""The American Beauty""  he missed when he was young enough to enjoy it, offer a visual feast.  Annette Benning as the Queen of suburbia, Spacey's wife, is  a sort sexy, gorgeous, Martha Stewart gone mad, convinced if she has just one more motivational seminar she will reach nirvana.  She is in a word ""wonderful."" The boy next door is sort of cross between Timothy Hutton in ORDINARY PEOPLE and Benjamin in THE GRADUATE.  He deals drugs, observes life around him through a video camera and convinces almost everyone that he is the straight arrow next door.  We know immediately, that like everyone else in this movie, he is not as he appears.

The Best of 1999,"In an interesting shout-out to Sunset Boulevard (1950), you, the audience, already know the fate of the main character, Lester Burnham, played wonderfully by Kevin Spacey, as soon as the beginning credits to American Beauty (1999), are over. This is an excellent film. The best film from 1999. It is well worth, the Best Picture Oscar, that it won from the Academy that year. The plot of the film is a great exploration of life and the hang-ups, that accompany life, into old age. Lester is a clown, who is 43, but a person we can all relate to, especially if you are well into middle-age. Many taboos are covered in American Beauty (1999), and may be difficult for some sensitive viewers to watch.Sensitive issues are covered, like voyeurism, that is practiced by the boyfriend of Lester's daughter, Jane (Thora Birch). Then, a relationship begins to develop between Lester and a young, out-going, 17-year old girl, named Angela (Mena Suvari). Angela is a friend of Jane's from school. There also are moments, that explore homosexuality, which changes the direction of the film, at the most unlikely time. It is a crazy script, that explores the human personae, in all of its forms. Chris Cooper plays a tormented father, known as Colonel Fitts, who has no real idea, who he really is. His flirtations with his sexuality and his faith, has driven him to a boiling point. American Beauty (1999), is a great examination of the consequences, resulting from, the misinterpretation of different feelings. It is an excellent commentary on the mid-life-crisis phenomenon, that all of us have. American Beauty (1999), also travels along, with its tough, mature, sensitive story, with a wonderful music soundtrack.PMTM Grade: 9.2 (A-) = 9 IMDB.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
A Masterpiece,"This movie is probably one of the greatest I've seen in my entire life. Every character in this movie plays his/her role phenomenal. A movie like this doesn't come around every so often. This movie deserved every academy award that it won (but it did deserve more.) Kevin Spacey plays Lester Burnham. This is probably one of the greatest acting performances in history. If you saw the movie then you would realize why I say this.The movie has a very dark tone about it. The theme of this movie goes much deeper than you realize, and explains how beautiful and how bad life could be.From Start to finish this is a masterpiece and I strongly recommend it. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Breathtaking,"This has to be one of the, if not the best films I have ever seen. The performances by Spacey, Bening, Birch, and all the other actors were amazing.

Possibly the greatest....,"This has to possibly be one of the greatest.....screenplays of all time. That's right, screenplays. I didn't much care for the movie itself, but I had an edge: before ever seeing the movie, or knowing who the actors in the main roles were, I read the screenplay by Alan Ball - and fell in love. The way it was written, the sheer POETRY of the words, made me want to just sit there and read for the rest of my life. I could physically see the action happening in my head, without even knowing who played the characters, and every single word was just as impactful (if not more) than if I had seen it on the big screen.This is an overall EXCELLENTLY written movie, with an incredible plot line and especially the twisted ending. The music also helps to bring out the true emotions of the film, utilizing every millisecond of the instrumental power provided by the excellent composing skills of Thomas Newman to intensify the raw power of emotion this film possesses. I love the script, I ADORE the soundtrack, and I highly recommend this to anyone who has ever listened to any of Thomas Newman's work, or seen any of Alan Ball's scripts.",,Anonymous,Drama
Ages like a rose,"Tragedy meets melodrama meets the fearless hip '90s, following the Burnham family as they deal with their first-world problems. Lester and Carolyn (Spacey and Bening) are getting older, and both are trying in their own way to hang on to the last moments of what each thinks is the prime of their lives; while their teenage daughter Jane (Birch) is having issues of her own, dealing with finding her identity and not feeling pretty enough next to her ""friend"" Angela (Suvari). Neighboring Fits family (consisting of Bentley, Cooper and Janney) work their way into the mix because the son is stalking Jane. A film that speaks to those who have seen a midlife crisis, and is still entertaining to those who have it to look forward to. Oscar-winner is entertaining right from the get-go, and is an experience as flawless as a rose upon first viewing. However, after you've seen it a few times, the rose begins to wilt, unmasking contradictory characters and inexplicable events that unfold just to appease its themes of confinement, conformity, redemption and sexuality—why does Lester lecture Carolyn about materialism right after HE's the one that bought a Pontiac Firebird? Why didn't writer Ball or director Mendes at least try to make Bening's character slightly redeemable? All the many other questions to raise require spoilers, but the list goes on... Hard to completely hate because it's easy to understand why so many people like it.★★½ (out of four)",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

One of the year's finest,"Watching ""American Beauty"" is like looking into a handful of American lives slowly plunging into moral and emotional devastation. Although these people are gaining a sincerely fulfilling happiness, they are also slowly losing their grip on human value and order. This is not your average social commentary, it has something most satires lack; poignancy. On one hand, this is a scathing examination of the facades and truths that surround a seemingly ""perfect"" suburban family, displaying what it would be like if everyone's true colours emerged, as they liberate themselves from the painful phoniness that society forces them to live by. One the other hand, ""American Beauty"" is a thought-provoking and emotionally devastating character study of two families finally achieving joy for the first time in their lives, unaware of the profound impact they are having on themselves and each other, and neglecting the consequences that will inevitably follow. ""American Beauty"" shines in almost everyway, from it's stunning imagery of beauty fused with violence and tragedy, to it's darkly hilarious script, this is one of those rare films that stay with you for a long time. But the main thing that makes this movie soar are the performances, Kevin Spacey and Anette Benning are simply sensational as the feuding married couple exploring new realms of life,  Wes Bentley, Chris Cooper, Mena Suvari and Thora Birch also showcase excellent performances.

Beautiful!,"The first time I saw ""American Beauty"" was when I was around 8 years old so it's a hazy memory. Unfortunately I had to go to bed about 40 minutes in, but some scenes have stayed with me since (I'm 17 now). The second time I saw American Beauty was on the eve of my blonde friend's birthday party (I must've been around 15) and I was totally gripped. Unfortunately I had to force myself to bed as it was on late, and left 40 minutes in, in order to be awake-looking for the early morning start the next day. Yesterday, I finally got the chance to see American Beauty the whole way through. And it was amazing.Those first 40 minutes hadn't really left my head before. They were just absolutely gripping, full of incredible visuals, cinematography and absorbing writing and character development. Thankfully, the rest of the film doesn't disappoint either and accumulates to being one of the greatest films I have ever seen. I wasn't expecting to give it a perfect 10, as I only reserve that for the most special films, but this really is an incredible and outstanding film. It thoroughly deserves its best picture award!What makes American Beauty works is its well-observed characters. At the centre of the film we've got Lester Burnham, who is fantastically played by Kevin Spacey (another throughly deserving award winner) and is going through a mid-life crisis. We can highly sympathise with him and his childish rebellion. You feel sorry for him and his loveless marriage, his ill relationship with his daughter and unforgiving job. You're almost rooting for him when he rebells. However, his acutely observed character is also wonderfully flawed by taking drugs and having vivid fantasies about his daughter's which are beautifully filmed.The other characters are also as gripping and never shunned. We've got his controlling wife, also going through a mid-life breakdown, his moody daughter and her sexy friend as well as the weird family who've moved in next door, with their strange son and awful army dad. The film would need very little plot at all to keep it entertaining as all the characters are memorable and well-crafted, which means American Beauty never has a dull moment. Right from the startling opening, which confesses that Lester is going to die, the film never loses its grip on the audience as we're all in suspense as to who kills Lester and why!The playful screenplay by Alan Ball is incredible. It's also philosophical and very deep at times, as well as being consistently gripping and entertaining. There are some hilarious moments as well as some emotional and touching ones. As flawless as the script is the directing by Kate Winslet's ex. There is some breath-taking cinematography and striking visuals which add fuel to the already high burning fire. About every single shot is perfectly framed, making the film even more involving and seductive. American Beauty felt hypnotic at times, sucking you into the world of the film like Black Swan and The Artist achieved so memorably.American Beauty builds up to an incredibly powerful and emotionally-charged ending. Bringing together all the characters and leaving some ambiguity, so we don't feel at all patronised. Lester's final narration is very touching, memorable and rounds the film off perfectly. American Beauty is an amazing achievement in film-making. It's a beautifully observed drama about family life and the baggage which comes with it. There's great use of humour, superb writing, Oscar-worthy acting and sensational directing. American Beauty is the full package and is quite simply one of the greatest films I have ever seen. It was worth the 9 year wait!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
An American Masterpiece.,"This movie is one of the best film displays of ""The American Dream"" or ""A Suburban Life."" It communicates through the audience in a way that can be seen as both dramatic, comical, or creepy. Its displayed in such a way in which you get a different view of what the person is saying each and every time they say something. The storyline can occasionally be all over the place, but the slow suspense that is added that is yet so fast made me never want to even pause it. Its one of the movies that are one and done. And not because it is mediocre, but because the dark humor and message behind it leaves you left with a feeling that you never want again, in the best way possible.

Suburban nightmare for America,"STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsAmerican Beauty follows pretty much in the outline of Fight Club,the best film I have seen in a very long time,in it's themes about commercial fulfillment,the barriers constricting the boredom of life,and human emptieness.The best scene to reflect this I found in here was when the films main charecter Lester,played by Kevin Spacey,has a go at his wife after she makes a quip to him about not spilling any of his beer on an expensive new sofa she's got.This scene quite brilliantly reflects how the commercial value of our possessions has become our main cause for concern,rather than concern for each other. Or maybe this is just the suburban situation in America.Whatever the wake up call was aimed at,whoever it's targeted towards ought to take note.Though the main character is initially seeming quite intent to accept his boring life,we learn that underneath the kind of easy going exterior he puts on,a lot of people are actually taking advantage of him,his boss,his colleagues,his daughter,his wife.This movie remarkably portrays how glamourous and satisfying breaking free from a constraint on your life can be.Aside from the main character, all of the other characters are pretty sad cases as well.His wife is a self obsessed,over expectant career woman,who only gets sad about what's bothering her.His daughter is a distant,stubborn teenager ,who does'nt give any clear indication of what she wants.Her friend is a narrow minded,pretentious,and stupid slapper,who prides herself on how sexually explicit her shenanigans with other men are.And as for the new neighbours,well.....................perfect example of how American families are supposedly losing the ability to communicate,understand,love,and,heck,even know each other.This film perfectly captures you in each of these shallow people's miserable lives,and gets you caring about their various outcomes.All the performances are,obviously,excellent,and Sam Mendes provides unique,insightful direction into a film which requires these new touches.Overall,having seen it,I'm glad American Beauty won all the oscars it did.For once,they gave them to a film that truly deserved it.*****",,Anonymous,Drama

Interesting Collection of Cookies,"American Beauty made quite a splash during its original release but to many of its early admirers it has not aged all that well. I generally liked it as a flawed film initially and feel the same today. I think many of the characters are a little too broadly drawn for sure. I also think it feels rather uneven throughout. Despite these considerable flaws there is still quite a it to enjoy if you just give in and go with what it is offering.

I began watching this as a joke. I was pleasantly surprised.,"Call me immature, but whenever I was looking through a list of top rated movies and saw one about Kevin Spacey wanting to bang a teenager, my interest was well caught. That is genuinely how I began watching this film, just to see how well it aged considering how Spacey's career has turned out. I have to say though, I'm absolutely shocked at how well this movie turned out and how memorable it was.Kevin Spacey; admittedly; is a very good actor. He absolutely shines it in this role as Lester, by far the star of the show, as Kevin Spacey does do good with sadistic roles. That isn't a joke. I mean, it literally says that on his very own IMDb page, check the Trade Mark section. ""Often plays cold-blooded and sadistic characters,"" last I checked, which was as I write this, it does indeed say that. For the sake of it, I'm going to ignore the controversy, although it has bothered me how not very many, if at all, new reviews I've seen for this movie that don't talk about the issue. I definitely think it's worth mentioning for the context of the film. It's like as time went on more and more inside jokes you could apply to this movie were created, which made it so much more funny. Enough of that, though.Like I said, the actual movie surprised me. A lot. I like to think of the movies I watch, and how good they are, partially based on how well I remember them after some time, along with their merit. I have to say, I've watched a few other movies after this one, but I still remember it very well. I don't even need to think about it.That being said, it has its fair share of issues which keeps it being higher than a seven. I know that a lot of the dialogue is supposed to be cringe, but there's a difference between bad dialogue and dialogue that is supposed to be bad. This might be unpopular, but in my opinion, the weakest link in the cast is Wes Bentley playing Ricky Fitts. I know who he is supposed to be as a person, and he looks the part and feels it, but I genuinely don't enjoy the way he delivers lines. It isn't good.Another issue I had with this movie were a few of the plot points. I don't want to spoil anything for this old movie, but Jesus, Colonel Fitts takes some huge jumps of logic to get to the conclusions he does get to. No normal person would think like that.I do believe this movie is worth seeing. It doesn't, by any means, contain the most gut wrenching things I've ever watched in a film, but it'll be good for a laugh and a few, ""What am I watching right now,"" moments.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
don't believe the hype,Number 2 on the IMDB list of all time best movies? Academy Awards out the wazoo? Frankly I expected MUCH more out of this movie. It was good. But JUST good. Many parts were downright vulgar and offensive. I saw it with my wife so it wasn't a problem but I would strongly caution against seeing this movie in mixed company. The very first scene involves Lester (Kevin Spacey) masturbating in the shower.I don't see what the big deal is about this movie. I have seen all of these actors do much better in other roles so it isn't the acting. The story is pretty good but it is not Oscar caliber in my opinion.

The music is perfect as well.Everyday normal life, can look ""perfect"" on the surface. But be a living hell. For those people trapped in mondane unfulfilling lives. In a subtle but clear way, we see how the characters are victims to themselves. The characters live their life like they're inside invisible cages.It's so very depressing, even disturbing, like a sort of psychological horror. More so because it's also relatable to so many.All the characters starts on their own personal journey, to in their own way, break free from this ""prison."" They need different things and go about this change in different ways. But all these different characters-progression blend together beautifully and comes to a compelling and satisfying climax.I think this movie truly is beautiful but also scary. It's very depressing. A sort of cautionary tale of how you can die before you die, if you let your life become a routine and deny everything inside you that tells you what you truly want and need. It can happen to anyone. It's not uncommon at all.What brings the movie down a bit is that it's a bit boring and pretentious. But the message isn't wrong. Sure, we should appreciate the beauty of small things in life and be present to them in the moment, to be able to be aware of this beauty.

Petty and Uncreative,"Without a doubt, American Beauty is the most overrated movie I have seen. For those of you who have read Joan Didion, this script smacks of Play It As It Lays.What happens when a ""typical"" suburban professional male realizes his dissatisfaction with his life? He reacts in an insubstantial and unconvincing way. My job stinks - quit my job. I have trouble communicating with my daughter - smoke dope. My wife is distant and cold - fantasize about another woman. And so on. Yes, it is Mar-eye-ah cracking a boiled egg on the steering wheel all over again (Didion reference).Here's the question I really wanted this movie to explore: if, at midlife, Lester really feels that his life is not what he expected, where does he want it to go, what will he do about it, and can he get away with it.Sorry, but get religion, join the French Foreign Legion, or start a home-based business. If you're life is a joke Lester, don't make it worse by becoming a cliche.",,Anonymous,Drama
Some notes on how it ends,"I discussed this with a friend and she, too, didn't like the ending; her quarrels was quite different from mine, and I think we were both right.  I would advise you not to read on if you haven't seen the film.  Yes, I know it's announced right at the start that Lester will shortly be dead; that isn't what I'm about to reveal.MY problems were as follows.  The film tells us about Lester's imminent demise TWICE at the start.  It struck me at the time as unnecessary; I later found it was done so as to manipulate us into a silly game of guessing and second-guessing towards the end.  Which one of the suspects before us will commit the fatal act?  Will it be (a) the daughter, acting in concert with her lover?  Or (b), the daughter's lover, acting alone?  Or (c), the frustrated wife, smarting with shame?  Or (d), the fascist-minded neighbour? In fact, we start by thinking we know that the answer is (a), but this is a trick of presentation that amounts to simple cheating.  By presenting a not particularly crucial scene TWICE Mendes makes it seem important.  But in any case, what's the point of this cat-and-mouse game with the viewer?  Suddenly the picture becomes conventional and just a little stale.Well, as everyone still reading knows, the answer is (d), which brings me to my second problem.  The neighbour is driven to murder only because he's led to believe, falsely, that Lester is gay.  How does he come to believe this? Sheer, flimsy chance.  Had a window frame not conveniently occluded his view, had he not happened to watch a few ""incriminating"" minutes of videotape out of the hundreds of HOURS stored in his son's room, the tragedy would never have occurred.  It's almost an eighteenth-century farce.  Lester is not in any sense ""doomed to die"" at the start of the film; nor does he play with fire; his eventual death is as meaningless as, ""and then he was hit by a falling piano"", except that - and this is what makes it worse than the falling piano scenario - we are made to examine the fatal chain of events at ridiculous length.Here are my friend's concerns.  She thought a sudden death at the end was simply gratuitous; a tacked-on piece of pessimism to a story the logical conclusion of which would be happy.  The death is (my friend pointed out) a good deal unhappier than I'd noticed.  There's no indication that the neighbour will even be suspected of the murder; there's every indication that Jane and Ricky WILL be suspected.  The videotape we saw twice will also be seen by the police.  The two lovers cannot now flee to New York, both of them are likely to be imprisoned, and, to add insult to injury, Lester (like the film as a whole) ignores their fate entirely in his blissful ruminations on life that are meant to sum up the story.  It's one thing to concentrate primarily on Lester to the exclusion of everyone else.  It's quite another to tell us Jane's story as well, showing us incidents that don't concern him and which he will never even find out about - and then, in the end, leave his daughter in the lurch by simply forgetting about her.  If Mendes wants to bring Lester's daughter into the story at all he can jolly well treat her with respect.My long complaint may give a false impression.  As it happens a sour conclusion is not nearly enough to sour the film as a whole: it's just so GOOD throughout.  Simple, beautiful, moving scenes - the moment when Carolyn cries after degrading herself in front of potential customers, or the dinner-time argument after Lester quits work - are presented with an almost arrogant freshness; I was all the more disappointed with the conclusion because I had been lulled into believing that the film-makers were so skilled they couldn't possibly let me down.  (And - think what you will of me for saying this - the sight of Thora Birch undressing and standing there topless would be worth sitting through a bad movie to see, let alone this one.)  Taken all in all I'm very glad ""American Beauty"" was made.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

...,"It's difficult to say anything about American Beauty. It's about life, but using the word life causes so many associations to take place in our heads. I'm talking about raw life - as in how nothing really matters, and at the same time, everything matters. I wish these stupid words could express how I feel. I feel silly about putting any of this into words.This movie should be watched with your soul. There shouldn't be any judgments of any of it. Your mind needs to be quiet.I first saw it when I was maybe 20, and of course, I loved it, and of course, I had so many ideas about it. I could have told you about the cultural and social themes. The judgments of each character I had but now I understand that we shouldn't be judging any of them. With one exception if you'll permit me. And that's the character named Ricky Fitts. The first time I watched it, I thought he was creepy and weird. Now I'm 32 and can see he is the only person in the film with any clarity. Much like at the end of Fight Club, when Tyler looks at Tyler and says, ""My eyes are open,"" and puts the gun in his mouth, Ricky is ""enlightened?"" He's living with his eyes open. I don't want to make this all about Ricky, but I'd like to be like him someday.This movie is on the very short list of perfect films. Each character is a caricature of so many of us of how we lose ourselves. We lose ourselves in the eyes of others and their expectations. We miss the beauty. The monolog at the end sums up all we should ever feel - grateful.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

"A beautiful, thought-provoking film","I am Lester Burnham. Well, I'm 42 and I've been married for 15 years. I don't think one has to see themselves in this film to appreciate it, but how can I know?One comment I'd like to make as a reader of books about writing--American Beauty is a model for how to take derivative concepts, or specific textbook instructions, and make a unique mix that is art for the ages. The film owes much to ""Sex, Lies and Videotape""; some to ""Ordinary People"" and ""The Ice Storm."" Others have pointed out that the ""from beyond the grave"" narration is not original. Every book on dramatic writing quotes Tolstoy: ""If there is a gun hanging on the wall in Act One, it had better be fired by the end of Act Two."" And yet this particular blending of these ideas is new. If you've ever tried to create a story or a song and you became frustrated that you were just borrowing ideas, perhaps you'll understand why American Beauty is such a role model for me.It's hard not to become more introspective and more honest with yourself after seeing this movie and I think that makes it great.",,Anonymous,Drama

Pitch-perfect dialogue, superb acting, and outstanding technical aspects. The story's a bit abstract but I really liked it. Kevin Spacey gives perhaps his best performance and Annette Bening is just as good. The kids aren't the typical annoying teenagers - probably because the actors are twentysomethings, not teens - and feel completely natural in these roles.

One of the greatest films in history!,"Complex Characters: The film offers characters who are multi-dimensional and deeply flawed, allowing audiences to connect with them on a human level. The characters' struggles with their own dissatisfaction, their desires for something more, and their inner turmoils are effectively explored, making them relatable and compelling.Stellar Performances: Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening's performances are unforgettable. Spacey, who plays Lester Burnham, a man going through a mid-life crisis, delivers a nuanced performance that earned him an Academy Award. Bening's portrayal of Carolyn, Lester's wife, grappling with her own ambitions and disillusionments, is equally praiseworthy.Visual Storytelling: Mendes' use of symbolism and visual storytelling adds another layer of depth to the narrative. The iconic imagery of the plastic bag dancing in the wind has been widely discussed and interpreted. The film's cinematography is both beautiful and thought-provoking, presenting suburban life in a new and evocative light.Theme Exploration: ""American Beauty"" explores a range of themes, including the search for happiness, the existential crisis, the critique of materialism, and the façade of the perfect suburban life. These themes resonate with many viewers because they deal with universal human experiences.Provocative and Bold Storytelling: The film doesn't shy away from addressing controversial subjects such as infidelity, drug use, and the sexual awakening of teenagers. This bold storytelling style makes the film daring and distinct.Screenplay: Alan Ball's Oscar-winning screenplay is sharp, witty, and layered. It provides a delicate balance of drama, humor, and tragedy, presenting a well-rounded narrative that keeps audiences engaged from beginning to end.Original Score: The musical score by Thomas Newman is another highlight of the film. It complements the visuals perfectly, enhancing the emotional impact of key scenes.In summary, ""American Beauty"" is a great film because of its rich, complex characters, its exploration of universal themes, its stunning visual storytelling, and its memorable performances. It continues to be studied and appreciated for its depth and sophistication, making it a classic in American cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Just watched it again and wow, much has changed in my perception of this movie. The characters are complex and real. I loved Annete Bening, she portrayed the unfulfilled woman outstandingly. Allison Janney, a small role, but intense. You can see the polished happy facade of a tipical family, struggling on the inside.

Dark comedy mixes wonderfully well with serious drama, creating a dreamy though realistic narrative sprinkled liberally with fantasy. Spacey has never been better; his range and delivery are amazing. Equally deft supporting work from Bening, Suvari, and Cooper, with Birch and Bentley creating a lovely, nuanced young couple that is rooted in their individual and collective uniqueness. A fiercely strong debut for director Mendes.",,Anonymous,Drama

Although I wouldn't quite call him a villain in this movie, the way he acts is disturbing. Its more of a creepy air to that he gives to the main character as the movie progresses that just hits the nail on the head.Once again this movie is distressing and overly sexual for my liking but I understand the reasoning behind it so I don't care that much.The plot is good and shows how abandoned and alone people can feel.

A failed attempt to expose the horrors of the Nuclear family.,"American Beauty follows a man and his family as he rediscovers his true self during a mid-life crisis.  Spacey's character develops a crush on his daughter's hot friend, smokes pot with the neighbor's kid, and quits his job.Beauty isn't much more than an interesting fantasy for the viewer, a ""what if I really did what I wanted?""  It falls short of any real social commentary or entertainment.  In addition to its general lackluster, the film contains a non sequitur sub plot about the neighbor's homophobia, which, having nothing to do whatsoever with the rest of the story, comes out of nowhere to play a pivotable role.If you found Beauty interesting, there's two other films I would strongly suggest.  If you liked the this-is-an-american-family-with-some-disturbing-problems aspect, watch Tod Solontz' ""Happiness;"" it's more disturbing and fits together better.  If you liked the I'm-a-corporate-employee-who's-discovering-who-I-really-am-and-loving-it aspect, watch ""Fight Club;"" it's a better film, and it's ""Take this job and shove it scene"" is infinitely more satisfying.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Hilarious, Charming, and Dark","In spite of the controversy over leading actor Kevin Spacey in the decades that followed the movies release, and some rather uncomfortable parallels between plot points shown in the film with that of the real world, ""American Beauty"" still captivated me and wowed me with a deep introspection on perception, self-worth, and the nature of beauty. Each of the characters in this film are flawed in some way and are really interesting. I really loved Spacey in this one, Lester is a character that, although he has a pervy infatuation with his daughter Jane's (Thora Birch) best friend Angela (Mena Suvari), is awesome to root for. I love the moment that he just stopped caring and just through caution to the wind, it reminded me of another late 90s movie about a guy stuck in a dead end job with nowhere to go in life (""Office Space"").Really good cinematography, great sets that made it seem like I was watching a sitcom, it also felt like ""The Truman Show"" in a lot of areas. Something about these late 90s introspective movies that focus on a mundane boring life. I don't know it seems like that was in the cultural mist at that point in time and I'm not complaining because it still holds up today for me as a young person in 2022.I loved nearly every second of it, it is a quality piece of filmmaking that is really hilarious at times and really touching at others.

For anyone who has ever wondered what the future might hold or questioned what could have been.,"Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey), 42, has spent years trapped in an unhappy marriage and an unsatisfying job. His relationship with his teenage daughter Jane (Thora Birch) is almost as strained as that with his career-driven realtor wife Carolyn (Annette Bening). When Lester becomes infatuated with his daughter's friend Angela (Mena Suvari), it marks the beginning of a severe mid-life crisis that sees him revisiting the carefree ways of his youth, but at a cost.Full of heart-rending pathos, yet told with an irresistible streak of dark humour, American Beauty is a thoroughly absorbing bittersweet drama, a poignant tale that peels back the layers of suburban life to reveal the pains of growing up and the disappointments of growing old. The big-screen debut of director Sam Mendes, the film boasts superb performances from an incredible ensemble cast (Spacey is particularly great, but no-one puts a foot wrong), excellent cinematography, and wonderful music (both score and soundtrack).10/10: one of the finest films of the 90s and well deserving of its five Oscars.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

"""Never underestimate the power of denial""","American Beauty is an exploration of midlife crisis and the illusion of a 'normal' family. Lester Burnham (Spacey), his highly strung wife Carolyn (Bening) and resentful daughter Jane (Birch) each struggle to find a sense of purpose to their lives as the facade of their happy home deteriorates. The story follows Lester on a journey to turn his life around after meeting his daughter's provocative friend Angela (Suvari). His lust for the teenage girl inspires a new lust for youth which he captures by discarding all of adult life's responsibilities in an attempt to re-live his youth. As he quits his respectable job, takes on a position flipping burgers in a fast food joint, and starts smoking pot he finally gets the object of his desire  but was it really what he was looking for? Kevin Spacey's performance as the world-weary and rebellious Burnham is magnificent. The honesty which Lester gives off while everything around him radiates artificiality is astonishingly powerful - aided in no small way by Sam Mendes' use of lighting and colour which is remarkable. Visually, every shot is a work of art, a portrait of discomfort. You can really feel the unease as the camera takes you on a journey through the Burnham household, furbished in blue-greys and white  not so much as a fork out of place - mixed with the stark contrast of red roses. In short, an absolutely breath-taking film, American Beauty is shocking yet humbling, sad yet tranquil and ultimately beautiful.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
A mainstream film that is artsy.,"American Beauty was a huge success upon release(especially critically) and its easy to see why. American Beauty doesn't trailblaze a path into hitherto untouched cinematic territory, but its presentation of vivid characters in interesting situations makes the story seem fresh. In part because it's not a complete downer and in part because it doesn't cheat the audience, American Beauty is emotionally satisfying. There's a sense of poignancy at the end, but also the feeling that we have been on an incredible trip through the lives and souls of three perfectly-realized characters. In a year that boasts few truly memorable motion pictures, Mendes can stake a claim alongside the likes of Kubrick and Egoyan as one whose cinematic vision both challenges and entertains.",,Anonymous,Drama

Spacey's mid life crisis is sharp and believable as he attempts to change is life, quiting his job, buying a 70's Pontiac forebode and working out in his garage as his wife cheats on him with a local real estate tycoon. His daughter, played by the now grow up Thora Birch, is at similar odds as she deals with her creepy next door neighbor and her young but sexy friend played by Mira Suavi.

"Very good, but not quite great","Re-watching American Beauty 11 years later, I must admit, I was somewhat underwhelmed. The impact it had on first viewing didn't quite last. The film was praised for its deconstruction of the American dream and portrayal of the dark undertones of suburban life, but the fact is that was done more powerfully in Todd Solondz's movies, and American Beauty just doesn't seem very shocking - maybe it was more so in the 90's, I'm not sure. As a drama, though, it's still very powerful, and the characters are compelling, lovable and despicable at once, and it does a very good job of making the viewers care about them - in complete contrast with Happiness, with deliberately keeps a wall of coldness and distance. The wonderful acting helps, especially from Thora Birch, who at that point had the potential to become one of the greatest actresses of the new millennium.At the time of its release American Beauty was hailed as a masterpiece - it doesn't quite seem like one now. Rather, it's a good drama with some fantastic directorial work and some truly great moments, and a very humble movie at that. The fact that I don't consider it one of the top films of the 90's doesn't change the fact that its Best Picture Oscar was one of the best and gutsiest choices the Academy made that decade.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

From that moment until the ending credits rolled, I did not blink, I did not budge...except when I laughed...and BOY did I laugh.  The movie itself was a bit....shall I say..oh...weird.  My fiancee didn't like it too much, cuz it was too weird for her.I thought it was a very serious movie, but with most of the serious scenes, it contains lots of humor.  That's why I thought this movie was very good & original.

A powerful drama depicting the rotten and unwanted reality which is there anyway however much American society likes living in constant denial.,"There had always been a tradition among the Americans themselves as well as the rest of the world, not without exceptions, of course, to believe in the unity and the firmness of the interrelationships within the typical American family. Before the sixties it had been the privilege of most families on U.S. soil to say that ""The bonds which hold our family units together make us the greatest nation on this planet."" Nevertheless we should not disparage the family values of the rest of the world for our country consists entirely of the indigenous populations of a multitude of states around the globe. We ought to be fair and unbiased when judging ourselves and everyone else, indeed. But as far as fairly judging ourselves is concerned we have come to the point when all our illusions can no longer shield us from the bitter truth. And that is when cinematic masterpieces like 'American Beauty' are born.The film catches us completely off guard and awakens a kind of nostalgia towards the past of our great country when parents were respected and teenagers' only income stemmed from respectable diligent part-time work and not from the sale of drugs. Back then a high school education was considerably more impressive and its quality was incomparably better than the relative knowledge of a few pages of Shakespeare and a few simple mathematical formulas we have today instead of a thorough and systematic academic programme which United Kingdom for instance has.As we watch 'American Beauty' we start to panic and think about our own families especially if our children are teenagers. On the screen in front of us we can see the disintegration of two middle-class families not much different from our own in most cases. Some of us begin to take preventive measures soon after leaving the cinema. And that is the way it should be. In fact it's the only way it should be. Therefore movies like 'American Beauty' are a blessing in disguise, even though the rest of the world may experience a feeling of triumph or scorn and even be encouraged to continue to tamper with our security, prosperity and well-being.

Look closer...,"With some of the best writing, characters, and scenes ever put to film, American Beauty is simply a luscious and beautiful movie. It has so much substance in it that you could watch it thousands of times and never get bored.In all honesty, I wasn't exactly the biggest fan of Kevin Spacey before I saw this movie. My overall opinion on him was that he was a so-so actor that had his good movies and his bad movies. This film changed my mind all together. Spacey's performance is heartbreaking, perfect, and most importantly, realistic. The entire time he is on screen, he literally is just magnificent. Wes Bentley was also captivating to watch, and it's really a wonder that he's not a bigger movie star. His performance in this film was just flawless and incredible. He is quite the scene-stealer, and often outshines some of the other actors.Overall, American Beauty was a fantastically good film with some of the best writing around.

One of the best movie I've ever seen.,"This movie is fantastic. Sure this movie has fantastic acting and directing and music and all that jazz, but it also possesses unique qualities that typically are only found in Indies. This rare gem (not using the cliché lightly) combines the great standard aspects found in a blockbuster with the profound feelings found in a good independent film.It's quite philosophical. Mainstream movies tend to not rely on ""deep"" thinking like riskier movies do. I know people like to say ""If you enjoy philosophizing, you'll LOVE this movie!"" about their favorite films, but I believe in this case it's true. I left the movie with a deep sense of enlightenment. I admit I bought into it harder than I believe the average person would (I believe due to a great cynicism of society.) I wouldn't call American Beauty ground-breaking, but it did shake me somewhat.It drives home its main idea without being preachy, which is pretty hard to do. It starts subtle and keeps growing to the end.American Beauty also has some roots in forests Hollywood doesn't tend to grow it, another nice fruit. As liberal as I feel I am, I (embarrassingly) admit I felt a little uneasy about some elements of the movie. But I view that as a good thing.I think the main reason people might dislike this film is because of its corny aspects. American Beauty does have a couple cheesy elements, but most of them are purposely cheesy. But I admit American Beauty does fall victim to two too noticeable slapstick-like instances that seem out of place because the rest of the movie is so good. I was so enthralled by the movie that when these gimmicks happened I was pretty upset. It's not as though other popular movies wouldn't have these occurrence, it's that while watching this movie seems too good to have them. I got the feeling that, in one of the scenes, the director kept re-shooting the scene and telling Spacey to be MORE obvious. But I can't stress enough that I felt this way in literally two scenes.This is definitively a lasting film. I watched 13 years after it was released and loved it. Even though it's not totally exactly perfect, I gave it a 10/10 because of rounding errors.I highly recommend this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"""I rule!"" Do you? Do you though?","Suburban life isn't all rose petals, jail bait cheerleaders and gay neo-nazis in the closet! Something much darker lies beneath the veneer and whatever it is, it's not only dark, it's beautiful. American Beauty is a mid-life crisis tale that's heavy on the men's lib message.
Spacey gives his I'm-so-bored drawl and every word he utters conveys the cynical sarcastic disdain he feels for the world. But his performance is not without levity. Watch him as he says, ""I rule."" It's fantastically subtle. Subtle in a look-at-how-funny-that-is way. When he finally begins to assert himself, it is remarkably poignant. Watch him throw asparagus against the wall. No, it's not a potential precursor to domestic violence. It's a declaration of independence whereupon you happily applaud Spacey's descent into me-me-me world. Meanwhile, his daughter Missy Miserable, played by Thora Birch is committed to the dead stare demeanor. Her only guide as she navigates the teenage wasteland is blonde bimbo Jenny Jailbait. Thora is a disillusioned youth in need of a more thoughtful peer. Enter the eccentric and creepy Ricky Fitts. As far as Ricky is concerned, Mena is a bland blonde and Thora is a glowing angel of tortured teendom.
Ricky is an immediately endearing character for the fact that he appears to have been born with a paralyzing birth defect - the inability to blink. Ricky's sole purpose in life is to mock the stuffy suburbanite pursuit of perfection. This is something he can do simply by standing in one place without blinking. Observe his psycho-killer stare as he balances sincerity with pretentious existential insights. The epic plastic bag dance is so stunning that wide-eyed Ricky feels like he might pass out from its beauty. For Ricky, a plastic bag is a bigger tearjerker than Lester's morning grip in the shower.As cinematic as this film is visually, you still get bits of that late 90s staple, digital hand-held technique. You see, the only way you can catch the raw truth of life is through the seemingly cold and impersonal lense of a digital camera. Yes, this came out the same year as Blair Witch. American Beauty is a cul de sac of tragedy and sickly stirring dreams where one's ambition and desire supersedes any responsibility to anyone else. Well, at least that's what it is if your name is Lester Burnham.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
......Wow,"Seriously, this is a movie that changes your life. No really, watching this film makes you think so deeply and really captures what a ""film"" is supposed to do.I found myself relating to every single character, the way these characters are presented are unlike any I have seen in any movie. They nail everything you usually expect from a movie that you don't get. Every time you watch it you notice something, whether it be actions, scenes, or quotes, each thing you see represents something beautiful...I'm serious. I always find more beauty each time.The story is relate-able and not cliché'd in any way. It's about a man who's unnoticed, a man who's hardly there, but if you just look closer. Lester Burnham is this man, he is ignored by his controlling wife, and his rebellious daughter. The man who moved in next door, Ricky Fits, is about change everything. I don't want to expose all the beauty. But please watch this movie as many times as you can to capture it's deep, compelling story and message, you'll really be glad you did!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"""American Beauty"" is to 1999 what ""The Graduate"" is to 1967","I think that it's appropriate that ""American Beauty"" came out in 1999. In that year, I was as old as my parents were in 1967, when ""The Graduate"" and ""Bonnie and Clyde"" both came out. Those were both movies that presented things differently than most movies previously had. Entertainment Weekly called 1999 something like ""the year that changed movies"", citing ""Election"", ""The Blair Witch Project"", ""The Sixth Sense"", ""American Beauty"" and ""Being John Malkovich"" as examples.Anyway, ""American Beauty"" is an indictment of the suburban lifestyle. Middle class Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) has a steady job and a typical family. His self-indulgent wife Carolyn (Annette Bening) seems absolutely bent on training their teenage daughter Jane (Thora Birch) to be ""perfect"". But then, when Lester catches sight of Jane's friend Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari) at a dance, the whole Burnham household begins to go through some massive changes. Changes which will irrevocably alter everything.This may be the perfect movie. I can't even begin to describe how good it is. With top-notch performances from its main players (plus outstanding performances from Wes Bentley, Chris Cooper, Allison Janney, Scott Bakula, Sam Robards and Peter Gallagher), an excellent script by Alan Ball, and A-one direction by Sam Mendes, you can see why it won Best Picture.Just an extra note.

worth seeing!,"Every time I see a plastic bag, flying through the air, I have to think about this film, ""American Beauty"". Although I wouldn't say it's one of the greatest films I've ever seen, it left its marks on me.The story about an ordinary American family in an ordinary American suburb with ordinary American jobs, whose whole life turns upside down, when the father, Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey), falls in love with the beautiful friend (Mena Suvari) of his daughter Jane (Thora Birch), therefore recognizes his rotten life and tries to change it, plays with the idea of the American Dream and uncovers its unreality.When Lester masturbates in the shower (and the marital bed!), when his wife Carolyn (Annette Bening) totally freaks out, because she's not able to sell a house (real estate!) and their daughter Janes only problem is how to get enough money for a boob job, everyone starts to think about the ""behind the scenes"" of every all-so-lovely, perfect, suburban family. This is probably what director Sam Mendes intention was, when he exaggerated both camera work and dialogs. Because when the neighbors's boy Ricky (Wes Bentley) starts to philosophise about the beauty of a plastic bag dancing with the wind, it's on the edge between craziness and truth. But by using this concept for the whole film Mendes created a worth seeing spectacle, fitting every film evening.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Beauty of an American Midlife Crisis,"I was in college when this movie first came out and now I'm the age Kevin Spacey was in this film. I watched it again and read some negative reviews by people who can't even spell. If you weren't old enough to watch this movie in the time period it was made, you shouldn't be allowed to review it. This movie portrays the America I grew up in. It shows a couple stuck in their dull American corporate lives. This movie opened my eyes when I was coming of age that adults don't have it all together. They miss their youth and simple pleasures that made them feel alive. The mundane routine of a job you hate and a stale marriage makes you feel dead inside. This movie made me understand what a midlife crisis is. The nostalgia of a car that made you feel alive when you were young and the desperation to feel anything at all when your life has become a prison with no surprises or adventure left. Parents can grow to resent each other and become toxic, fighting over the most trivial things. The perverted fantasy and attention of a young pretty girl woke something he hadn't felt in years, and unfortunately sometimes fantasy gets confused with reality. It's supposed to be disturbing. All of it is. It's not glorifying it. It's a critique of society in America, and done in such an artistic and creative way. That's why it received the acclaim it did.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Excellent movie that will really stop and make you evaluate your own life.,"American Beauty, released in 1999 and starring Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Wes Bentley, and Mena Suvari, couldn't be ordinary if it tried. The movie is a deep, wonderful, and penetrating film that will leave the viewer not only questioning their life, but American society as a whole. The movie hits on many key points ranging from conformity in society to individual perception, and really hits home the concept of social disillusionment. The tag line of this movie is ""Look Closer"", which is exactly what American Beauty does with its portrayal of the Burnham and Fitz families. On the surface both families appear to be well-off and happy, but in reality they are struggling greatly with what they want and what they think will make them fit into society. For example, Colonel Fitz on the surface despises homosexuals because he believes that they are not conforming to society's view on marriage, however, in reality he is upset that he cannot break the bonds of social conformism and be gay himself. The truth is, the only happy people in the movie or those who are able to break from society's rules and live their lives according to their own perceptionsunfortunately for most, they reap the consequences society deals to those who are unwilling to bend. Ricky Fitz is sent to a mental institution and ostracized by society because he does not keep the society's view on beauty. And Lester Burnham, though finally able to embrace happiness after waking from his twenty year coma, is killed. American Beauty combines not only great acting and directing, but also includes the audience by asking many questions that will make them stop and evaluate their own lives.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Excellent, Thought Provoking Movie","American Beauty is a modern masterpiece and rightly deserves it place in the top 250. The cinema has been producing a lot of terrible movies lately.

The acting, directing, score, mood, cinematography are all superb.Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) is suffering his mid-life crisis. His bitchy wife Carolyn (Annette Bening) is annoying him. His moody daughter Jane (Thora Birch) isn't helping. Things start to change when he sees Jane's cheer leading friend Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari) at a school function. He starts having fantasies of a naked Angela covered in red roses. His actions that follow change his family for the worst.Sam Mendes has created something that will stick with the viewers of this wonderful movie. We witness are family that looks perfect on the outside crumble into to something horrific. How one person's actions can effect everyone around him. Kevin Spacey is superb in his role as the unstable husband/father. He portrays him so well his character is disturbing and we kind of feel sorry for him but at the same time we don't. Annette Bening is great as the wife/mother who we really don't like but feel sorry for. Thora Birch is also great as the daughter who has developed a crush on her neighbour.

look closer,"A beautiful piece of work by first time director Sam Mendes. Easily one of the most accomplished film debuts in the history of cinema. The story centers around a man named Lester Burnham (the wonderful Oscar winning Kevin Spacey) a man who has lost passion in his life. His wife Caroline (Annette Benning in an equally stunning performance) is a workaholic real estate agent. Both are frustrated with their marriage which is basically just for show. Sexually frustrated Lest lusts for one of his daughter's (Thora Birch) girlfriends,Anglea (Menna Suvari). This lust begins Lester's search for happiness in life, so he quits his job and begins to flip burgers just like when he was a kid. Caroline is very frustrated with the fact that she has to be the breadwinner of the family and has an affair. Meanwhile the boy next door,Ricky is videotaping the Burnhams the daughter Jane in particular. The two strike a chord with each other and begin a romantic relationship. Ricky's father, Frank is a homophobe who suspect Ricky is homosexual because he is spending some time with Lester, of course this is not true. All Ricky is doing is scoring Lester some drugs. As the story progresses Lester gets used to Angela, and Angela starts to warm up to Lester.This film is a must see for anyone who appreciates film!",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
My extended review of the film,"'American Beauty' is a film about people and how they live. At times it is a biting satire with sharp wit and acute observations, at other times it is a deep drama about unhappy individuals in American suburbia, but all the time I found it an enjoyable film to view, both because of the things it has to say and the high cinematic quality of the production.The best part of the film would probably be Alan Ball's original screenplay. It is alternates from amusing and touching, perceptive and funny, and the characters are all very well developed and feel real. A common complaint I hear about the film is that the characters are thin, but they are just the opposite. We acquire an understanding of what makes each character tick and what each characters wants out of life. Some are motivated by the idea of success and luxuries, while other are prepared to settle for a simpler lifestyle. Some of the characters also have their own individual secrets that are revealed towards the end, and by watching the film again one can pick up their insecurities about their secrets.Another complaint I often hear is that the film is too literal and straightforward. This however is quite a subjective judgment, as where does one draw the line between a film being too complex and not complex enough? If a film is overly complex and too hard to extract meaning out of, sure some people would look deeper, but others will be put off. I feel that 'American Beauty' has quite a good balance between how much it blatantly states and how much you can extract by closer examination, and what is said out loud is not unnatural. It is in that way a film that can be enjoyed by almost all people: casual moviegoers and avid film buffs alike.There is not really much else that people tend to complain about, and really there is hardly anything at all to not like. The types of flaws that one might find in the film are what you expect to find if judging whether one of two films in an all time top 100 list is the better of the two. They are not the type of flaws that should affect one's viewing experience, unless of course one expected to find something more in the film than it offered. But that again is subjective.The technical aspects of the film are wonderful. Thomas Newman's score is very low-key and simple when needed, and more zapped when required. Conrad L. Hall has meticulously set up every single shot. His use of out-of-focus backgrounds and foregrounds, high and low camera angels, and swooping shot is perfect. The film all flows very well, and some jump cut editing is perfectly woven in. The set décor and art direction paint a colourful picture of suburbia but yet they also manage to bring out the monotony of all the individual places. Plus the use of the colour red in the film basically speaks for itself.To compliment the film's other virtues, the cast give it their best with good results. Each actor and actress perfectly suits their characters, and it a shame about the lack of acclaim given to many of the performances. Spacey and Bening do some brilliant stuff as a discontent couple who are learning individually to enjoy life but yet are still full of anger, and Birch is perfect as their insecure teenage daughter. But the often unmentioned great performances come from Chris Cooper as the army type new neighbour, Wes Bentley as his teenage son, and Alison Janney as his wife, who seems just a little too detached from life. Then of course there is Mena Suvari as Birch's school friend who values her looks above everything.This is a film that touches on many different human concerns. Beauty, as in the title, is a key theme, and ideas about different perceptions of beauty run throughout the film. Bentley films a number of sequences on his camcorder, and we are shown the digital pictures. There are also the windows that everyone uses to spy on one another. People see things in many different ways because we are all different, yet we are all striving for a common goal of contentment, and the film tries to show this. 'American Beauty' starts off as a mystery thriller because we know that Spacey has died and that Birch has asked someone to kill him, but the mystery is the end is how we all function and how we are able to find happiness in life.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Also other theme (sexuality orientation, money). I found the movie very complete. And the naked scenes was so hot. I enjoyed their body. I wanted these girls like the father.

Even those with Attention-Deficit disorder won't be bored but is it memorable?,"When I go to the movies and see a film from the American family genre I expect that it's going to give me a slice of the current reality of family values.  Nice try American Beauty but your shoes cannot fill the likes of Ordinary People.  The fact is that Ordinary People existed long before Terms of Endearment, The Ice Storm, and American Beauty and it got everything right.  It was real.  I can see how some families play favorites and suffer the ramifications of a child's death so much that they forget that they still have a son who is alive and well and dying for attention.  That said American Beauty exists as a trifle that achieves some level of greatness but is far too unrealistic to be considered 20 years from now.Consider how Lester Burnham is a pediophile who loves to get naked in his garage while he lifts his weights.  Consider how he gives a long and strange speech about oral sex to his boss to get severance pay and then winds up working at a fast food restaurant.  Does this remind you of your father?  Or for that matter how Annette Bening is a materialistic mother who would rather have her Italian sofa for all of her ""future guests"" to see than accept her husband's long awaited advances.  Huh?  Did I miss something? There is nothing American or human for that matter about these characters. They are lifeless and soulless and they exist only as cartoons.  Their actions make no sense.When you take the time to rent Ordinary People you see a slice of the reality of the American family.  Donald Sutherland is a tax attorney who allows his son to make mistakes along the way but never ever gives up on him.  Aren't the majority of baby-boomer fathers like that?  Mary Tyler Moore plays Beth Jarrett as one of the coldest and meanest mothers ever to grace cinema.  She plays favorites with her boys and leaves all of her love in the grave with her deceased son.  Don't a lot of parents who have lost children behave as though a part of them died as well?American Beauty achieves something unique but it's not something I'll be pondering 20 years down the road.  Kevin Spacey is brilliant with his role but you can truly tell that he was trying to make human a man who simply wasn't written as anything more than a caricature.  Annette Bening over-acts throughout the film and she simply doesn't know that we get it already, your a selfish and psychotic shrew!  The cinematography is excellent though I often ask myself how many roses died before this film was considered a wrap. Thora Birch proves here and later in Ghost World that she can act with the best of them.  American Beauty does entertain and there is never a dull moment.  Does it matter and is it memorable though in the long term?8/10",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Such a beautiful gem of a movie,"I am writing this review for American Beauty after the third time in three weeks that I have watched it and it grows on me each time I watch it. The first time I watched it, I thought maybe this movie is more of a comedy than a drama but after watching it today, I can say this is definitely a drama with some funny moments in it which is what I want from a drama rather than it taking itself too seriously. Kevin Spacey, who is simply brilliant stars as Lester Burnham , a sexually frustrated, average American husband/father who is undergoing a mid-life crisis as he hates his job and his relationships with his wife Carolyn (played superbly by Annette Bening) and daughter Jane (Thora Birch) are strained due to a number of reasons, one being that he becomes attracted to his daughter's best friend, Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari). Add to that, the arrival of their new neighbours, the Fits, Frank (Chris Cooper), Ricky (Wes Bentley) and Barbara (Allison Janney) who seem to have problems of their own. All of these intertwining story lines, acting, music, directing and the script make this movie, in my opinion, an underrated classic of the 1990's which churned out some great movies and what a way to end the decade with a fantastic movie such as this. Hard for me to find a negative with this movie but positives from the movie are the storyline, the beautiful music and score of the movie, directing and of course, the cast of the movie which won the SAG Best Ensemble Award. With the cast, everyone knew their roles in the movie and played them accordingly, Kevin Spacey as the lovable loser, Annette Bening as the ambitious and materialistic wife, Thora Birch as the self esteem-less daughter and in one of her first big roles, Wes Bentley as Ricky, the likable next door neighbour who loves his camcorder and Jane's friend, Chris Cooper as Col Fits, a homophobic, strict disciplinarian father, Allison Janney as the silent wife, Mena Suvari as the egotistical best friend and even Peter Gallagher as Carolyn's real estate rival, Buddy Kane. This film deserved it's Oscar's for Best Picture, Best Director (Sam Mendes), Best Original Screenplay and Best Cinematography as well as the other nominations including Best Actress-Annette Bening but in saying that, I thought the acting standouts besides the two leads could have been nominated as well including Best Supporting Actress- Thora Birch or Best Supporting Actor- Chris Cooper who put in one of the performances of the year 1999 and has stuck with me ever since or Wes Bentley; either one, take your pick, they were both great.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Don't let the 5 Oscars fool you!,"The film American Beauty is set on morals that are low. I being a christian am offended by the content in the film and how it is presented. I can understand its purpose, though. A bag flying in the wind, and just wanting us to look closer at the beauty that surrounds us. I being a huge fan of the cinema am not a huge fan of the film American Beauty. The material in this movie makes it stand out, and I understand that some teenagers set low standards in their life, but does Hollywood itself have to pick this for the Best film of the year? The Cider House Rules is very artsy, and The Green Mile is spectacular. So are the Insider and The Sixth Sense, but of the 5 nominees the way the world is going we act like we have no choice but to pick the nastiest. This film is very poor, its entire topic is about sex and immorality, cheating on your spouse, and so many other problems that America has now days so why joke about it in the movies. We need to start caring about what the children need and need not to be exposed to. I think this film has some good qualities in acting but come on, used to it was not dignified to even talk about things like that. And, now, our entire aspect to be living is to see how naughty we look like. What today needs more of is honest hardworking people who have other business to take care of, Hollywood here me through you know although this isn't your real lives you don't have to act it out knowing that you are the ones who influence the American people.

"""A little too overrated.""","The film is the showcase of American people lifestyle. However I do believe that films do present things with a little exaggeration and that they are mostly not true (Unless of course based on true incident.). But considering that 40% of all is true I pitied while watching the movie, because of the sad lives of the American families. The story of the film is good and is told from the perspective of a Man named Lester. He is having trouble holding everything together and especially when his family doesn't show much respect to him. There are interesting things too when he gets attracted to one of a friend of his daughter and even fantasizes to have sex with her. While the film does not offer anything great in the story but there is a little feel of reality in that which might make you curious. I have always loved family dramas because they are the best source of information about the middle class people of that country. To be really true I felt like laughing after watching the film. Having watched a lot of dramas in various languages we have the portrayal of American family which is so sad.PROS:The film has emotional dramas mixed with a little humor at appropriate places. There are misunderstandings also. There is a hidden message present in the film. I feel happy to say that the director was able to portray a very important thing – ""Happiness"". When you will focus on the characters, you will found out that no one was happy in reality. All of them were hiding behind a sense of misjudgment. Sometimes even this is conveyed through dialogs when the characters say to each other's that you are just a sad old man. The movie wanted to convey that you have to really find happiness somewhere; otherwise ultimately you will get frustrated. Then this frustration ultimately leads to a lot of further problems.CONS:While everything including the story and the acting of the cast was perfect, I felt like some kind of energy was lacking in the film. It will give you instances to laugh or feel bad but all comes too slowly and have a dull demeanor.MESSAGE: ""Find Happiness.""VERDICT: ""A recommended watch.""",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

One of the year's finest,"Watching ""American Beauty"" is like looking into a handful of American lives slowly plunging into moral and emotional devastation. Although these people are gaining a sincerely fulfilling happiness, they are also slowly losing their grip on human value and order. This is not your average social commentary, it has something most satires lack; poignancy. On one hand, this is a scathing examination of the facades and truths that surround a seemingly ""perfect"" suburban family, displaying what it would be like if everyone's true colours emerged, as they liberate themselves from the painful phoniness that society forces them to live by. One the other hand, ""American Beauty"" is a thought-provoking and emotionally devastating character study of two families finally achieving joy for the first time in their lives, unaware of the profound impact they are having on themselves and each other, and neglecting the consequences that will inevitably follow. ""American Beauty"" shines in almost everyway, from it's stunning imagery of beauty fused with immorality, to it's darkly hilarious script, this is one of those rare films that stay with you for a long time.

It simply is sensational!Kevin Spacey stars as Lester, who is viewed by his family as a total loser. With a new outlook on life after meeting his daughter's girlfriend, Angela (very well played by Mena Suvari), he decides to change his life completely. These drastic measures affects everyone around him, including his neighbors. The blend of humor and drama is seamless, with the dry humor being very effective - and funny! Kevin Spacey steals the show, and gives an incredible performance. (And he is looking mighty fine, too!)'American Beauty' is a film that deserves numerous viewings, and needs to be watched alone at least once - to allow all your senses to open up to all the different elements, while you ponder about how relatable this is - possibly to your own life.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Good entertainment - but the ""acres of meaning"" passed me by!","A Suburban Joe enters a mid-life crisis which involves quitting his well-paid job and starting an affair with a teenage girl.We all know that real tragedy is usually some medieval king deciding if he should wage war or make peace on his neighbour. A million miles away from the safe American suburbs where nothing actually happens - or does it?While the acting here is first class and the story is a bit witty and a bit kinky, I think people are going a bit overboard about it. Best Picture Oscar? Well that shocked me more than the film itself!Mid life crisis is one thing, but Spacey takes it to a Spinal Tap like ""11"" and then some. This should be a slapstick comedy really, but it takes a dark turning for reasons that I don't fully understand. Maybe this is what makes it such a critical winner - give 'em enough murk and they can see anything. People that are well fed, safe and healthy can be tragedies too?I almost want to crib other people's reviews on this one. I enjoyed it, sure, but where is the depth? What are people really enjoying here? What are the key points being made?Is it - as I suspect - people having safe, but boring, lives and looking on this movie as what would happen if they cut lose and went a little crazy themselves. But are very unlikely to do so. Does this film contain some kind of hidden suburban fantasy that I don't share?Is this film anti-monogamy? Or am I seeing things in the shadows and mist? Being single I have often viewed marriage as being a little boring - and the thought of a sexless marriage sends shivers down my spine. A personal view only, for all you married folk!Yes - liked it, but its classic status has to be explained to me more clearly. This is an urban black comedy and a bit different from the norm, but that alone doesn't make it all that special.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
A beautiful movie,"I saw a sneak preview of American Beauty recently and all I can say is that I intend to see it again.  This is a WONDERFUL movie that is worth the money to see in the theaters (the only movie I've been to where half the audience broke into applause during the film).  Kevin Spacey plays Lester, a man who, while going through a mid-life crisis, begins to lust after a teenage friend of his daughter's.  Spacey is, of course, a fabulous actor and really shines in this role.  There are a few interwoven story lines involving Spacey's relationship with his control freak wife (Annette Bening, who is good if a little bit over the top in this role) and daughter, and the family next door, which includes a military general father, a mother who is apparently clinically depressed, and a very interesting son who is obsessed with filming beautiful things (including Lester's daughter Jane).  What is unusual about this movie is that the plot is not unusual or particularly unique--it's a couple of families in an anonymous American suburb and how they relate--but the filming of the movie is absolutely beautiful, and is done in a way that makes the film alternately hilarious, heartbreaking, and horrific.  It is definitely for mature audiences--there is some violence and a couple of frontal nudity scenes (both of which are essential and very tastefully done)--but older teens might enjoy it as well.  Be wary of how the media chooses to portray this movie--it may be called a ""black comedy,"" but, while sometimes hilarious, it is definitely a drama.  Go see it--I don't think you'll be sorry.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Amoral materialism,"Wow, suburbia must just be the worst, huh? Well, that's not really the point, but it is the implication of Sam Mendes' feature film debut as director, working from a script by Alan Ball. The actual point is about living lies to the point of feeling numb and finding a way out of it. It's just that Ball and Mendes used the cultural perception, essentially working off of the foundation set by things like the novel Revolutionary Road (that Mendes would later adapt to film) or The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit about how the conformity of suburbia deadens the individual. I think it's easy to see how this appeals to so many people, but I feel a certain distance from it. I think the ending pulls all of its threads together really quite well, and it's impeccably made, but I get the feeling that there are too many strands running around at the same time.Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) lives his life on autopilot as his wife Carolyn (Annette Bening), a real estate agent under the competitive shadow Buddy ""The King"" Kane (Peter Gallagher), and their teenaged daughter Jane (Thora Birch). She has a best friend, Angela (Mena Suvari), a sexpot of a young woman that Lester becomes infatuated with. Next door moves the Fitts family, headed by Colonel Frank (Chris Cooper) with his son Ricky (Wes Bentley) and his wife, the zoned out Barbara (Allison Janney). So sets the stage for Lester to come out of his middle-aged shell, using Ricky as inspiration because he doesn't follow the rules, selling weed to keep himself in video equipment that he uses to film everything around him while quitting jobs at will.I think what keeps me from really getting on the film's wavelength is the overall outlook on life. It's ultimately a materialist point of view about all we have is what is here, but the script also reaches for some kind of gauzy metaphysical meaning through Ricky's videos, in particular that central video of the plastic bag floating in the wind. I don't think the film makes a terribly good job at bridging the two competing ideas since it dramatically works as finding meaning within the self with Lester's ultimate completion of his emotional growth while the rhetoric around greater meaning from Ricky as he watches his videos with Jane feels almost like an afterthought.So, Lester takes Ricky's example and some knowledge he has about his company's management's financial misdeeds to get himself a year's salary and benefits as he quits, takes a job with no responsibility at a fast food burger joint, and focuses on working out in order to more appeal to the version of Angela in his dreams. Carolyn starts an affair with Buddy, and Jane and Ricky start their own little version of awkward dating, all while Angela is off to the side with Jane talking about how she thinks Lester is cute and describing all of the nasty sexual adventures she insists she's had in her nascent career as a model, none of which probably happened. All of this happens while Frank tries to keep a tight leash on Ricky considering his previous history of violence that sent him to a mental hospital, all while Frank takes every opportunity to rhetorically attack, behind their back, the gay couple living two doors down.The gay couple is the little rhetorical key to everything that Ball was trying to do with his script with Ricky providing the key phrase that they're shameless because they feel like they have nothing to be ashamed about. And this ends up where I feel like the film took on too much, because it's obvious that it's the central core of the film, and yet Lester's journey is all about how he wants to sleep with an underaged girl. The film tries to split the difference with Lester turning Angela down, perhaps discovering that all he wanted was to feel better about himself to the point where an underaged girl would want to sleep with him, but it represents the limits of this sort of materialist approach to looking at life. Why should Lester turn her down? What moral principle does the movie present that determines whether he should or not? Should he feel ashamed for wanting to do this?So, the moral center of the film is honestly a mess, this embrace of ""do what you want"" while sliding up to the idea that ""what you want"" could actually be bad without actually addressing what a limit could be, and it shows what refusing your inner self will lead to: the violence of Frank who ends the film with a shocking bit of murder. The implication being that he turned to murder because he denied who he was inside, making it the source of his general approach of beatings to his son.Honestly, the film is far more confused about its central point than anyone really seems to realize.And yet, I can't help but admiring it to a certain extent. Just because its morality is fudgy doesn't meant that it isn't worthwhile in its depiction. There's something compelling about Lester trying to find fulfillment, reaching out to Carolyn as he grows once more, getting rejected, and just finding confidence within himself. There's something interesting about the young people looking for some kind of greater meaning in the world beyond the thin veneer of consumerism that has come to define their parents lives. I appreciate all of that.And, on top of it all, Sam Mendes comes to the cinematic medium, employing Conrad Hall as his DP, and making an absolutely beautiful movie to look at from beginning to end. The delicate use of shadows from Hall are always a joy. Mendes brings the appropriate kind of theatricality to the production that recalls more Bob Fosse than Julie Taymor, especially in his show stopping moments like when Lester first notices Angela at the pep rally, quickly jumping into Lester's subjective view of the world, zeroing in on both characters artfully. And, Mendes is obviously great with actors, getting fantastic performances from everyone involved.So, I admire the film. I like to look at it. I appreciate all of the performances. I appreciate the moral groundwork while finding it incomplete dramatically, the film unwilling to really deal with the implications of its own moral code, choosing a way out without dealing with it instead of fully grasping with it. So, I end up slightly mixed, but the craft really is what pushed it over into something good and quality in my mind. It's certainly better than The English Patient, at least.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

"""American Beauty"" is a film that is seen through a lens.","The main focus that was taught about ""American Beauty"" was that it was ""Reality vs. Appearance"". I think that the entire movie was scene though a lens. It was obvious that Ricky taped everything and saw everything in his video camera; but the rest of the movie was seen and talked by a dead narrator. This is related to everyday life for some people and it showed a story through experience. I also strongly agree that Angela is a symbol in the movie, and she represents Lester's old wife, and the way his wife used to be. He fantasizes about Angela, and whenever he thinks about her there are always roses in the scene. Lester sees how Carolyn used to be through the representation of Angela. There is definitely a comparison of these two women throughout the film.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Best Movie of the Year?,"I saw American Beauty last night and I can't stop thinking about it. It was one of the best movies I have seen in quite awhile. I don't want to give anything away so I'm  just going to give some tidbits. The acting was brilliant. Kevin Spacey was in his best form, I really think this is the perfect role for him. Annette Bening was great, and her hair was even better. I'm not real familiar with Wes Bentley, but his portrayal of Ricky Fitts was spectacular. The direction by Sam Mendes was beautiful. He created such a great feel and vision it's hard to not want to see it again just for the images. I think schools should consider showing this movie to film students to show them how to completely create a mood with such few gimmicks. The mood Mendes created made me laugh and feel uncomfortable at the same time. I guess it was a little bit like the way we all feel about life itself, which is what the movie is about anyway. You must see this movie if you are serious about film, and you should see this movie if you still like to be moved by a brilliant story.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Best Movie of the Year,"`American Beauty' is a film that comes along and says things like few films have ever done before. A film that is maddening brilliant in how it audaciously blends the absurd with the dramatic.Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) wakes up one morning and announces in a voice-over that his life is miserable and that the highlight of his day will be his morning jerk-off session in the shower. He then proceeds to tell us about how, one year from now, a certain incident will occur. For the next two hours we are exposed to the incidents that lead to that moment.Lester and his wife Carolyn (Annette Benning) have no marriage. They hate each other and they do not relate to their daughter in any way. Jane (Thora Birch) has little respect for them, in return.Lester's life changes when he and his wife force themselves to go to a school basketball game, where Jane is performing on the cheerleading team. There, Lester becomes entranced by Jane's best friend Angela (Mena Suvari).This attraction seems rather frivolous at this point in the film, because it appears that the attraction is based solely on sexual desire. Angela is a beautiful, cocky young woman who's sole philosophy is to not be ordinary. She feels that because she is a stunner--a seductress--she is beyond everyone else. The ironic thing is that towards the end of the film, she is emotionally crippled when she has to admit that she is ordinary. The sad thin, in turn, and what lies at that heart of the movie, is that one does not need to be extraordinary to be ordinary--that beauty lies in everything, as long as such beauty is appreciated.Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley) is the mysterious new next door neighbor who becomes secretly obsessed with Jane--videotaping her at every turn. At first, this activity turns Jane off, until she becomes entranced by the reasoning behind this. His father, Wes, caught him doing pot one day and sent him to military school, where Ricky almost killed a boy--in turn, he was sent to a sanitarium. The family moves in next door and you are given a dose of true dysfunction.It is through Ricky's obsessive video collection--through which he videotapes the world--that we get to learn the theme of the movie. It is through Ricky that Jane begins to live and learns to love herself. Ricky, one of the saddest characters I have seen in film history, is a boy who learned to appreciate the beauty of life while trying to escape the horrors of his home. His father Wes is an evil man, haunted by demons that are later revealed, who is obsessed with discipline.I can't say much more about the movie simply because there is just too much to say about it, and also because I don't want to spoil the process the characters take to change their lives and how these lives end up--especially in the very `suspenseful' final minutes.All I can say is that there are scenes in this film that have hit me like few other scenes have hit me. Much is not seen of Barbara, Ricky's mom, in the film--but one scene, where she looks at her son's beaten faced is so shocking and tragic because of the line she tells him when she touches his face. The words are uttered by a woman who--as the audience can tell--has been emotionally paralyzed by her husband. The words are ironic in the context in which they are said--but the fear and motivation is perfectly understood.Annette Benning has given the performance of the year. May they give her the Oscar this very woman. This woman juggles drama with comedy like only a true master can. There is one particular scene, where she fails to sell a house, and she begins to cry. Just when you think she is being melodramatic, she begins to beat herself senseless--only to then contain herself. Ditto for Spacey and the bravura turn he gives as a man who basically decides to reclaim a lost life--and focus on what is truly important in his life. From anger to smugness--every expression is as three-dimensional as the next, showing us that he is one of our greatest actors.The film is completely adept in exploring the dysfunctional lives of characters coming to terms with the meaning of their lives. These are characters who are miserable in their present states. These are characters who decide to change. Some succeed and some fail--sometimes on their own or based on the actions of others. Others, after claiming happiness, only loose it and seek to punish the ones that took that momentary nirvana away from them. Alan Ball directed this complex gem with the finesse only a true master could posses.The theme of the movie centers around the concept of what is ordinary and what kind of beauty lies within the ordinary and you leave the theatre, after hearing the final voice-over, looking around you and truly observing the significance of everything and how the importance that you give to objects truly reflects the way you perceive yourself and your place in the world.The metaphors are explored beautifully (i.e. rose petals) as are characters motivations (i.e. the color of hedge clippers). A film so complex in meaning, it will take more than one viewing to fully digest. A film so important because, like few before, it truly makes a brave and relevant comment on our place in the world and how we relate to others. A film that, for me, blew away just about every other film I saw this year.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
the best film of 1999,"Today I finally saw American Beauty and I must say that it is awesome. Actually only one other film made me feel this way in 1999 which is Fight Club and as much as I feel sad for the ultimate commercial failure of that one, I am extremely happy that for once, a film as mercilessly critical of the consumerist society of our contemporary world as American Beauty has for once been embraced by the American film-going public. It clearly struck a chord throughout that country and deservedly so. A faultless and constantly witty script turns all the cliches of American suburban life, that seemingly untouchable microcosm of American lifestyle upside down. That said, its main themes and considerations are apparently  universal enough since it was able to draw constant heartfelt response -whether chokeful aughter, worried cry or deadly silence - from a packed audience of all ages as far away from the troubles and tribulances of the American family as Turkey at the screening I attended. All of the cast shines but the film is a clear tour de force for Kevin Spacey. His is a performance that is able to connect with the viewer even though the character does not invite 100 per cent identification. If there is any justice, he should be given every acting trophy in this world for this performance. After an instable choice of fils and big voids of non-acting due to pregnancies, it is a relief to see Annette Bening on top form again. She is one of the finest actresses around and she perfectly captures this all-American careerwoman who is constantly on the verge of hysteria although the character sometimes dangerously ventures into the territories of caricature. The three young actors are all incredibly talented and sholud be congratulated for bravely taking these roles in an age where most young actors choose to chart the safe waters of teen comedies and slasher flicks. It is hard to believe in the transformation of Thora Birch from the cute little girl she has been in the likes of Monkey Trouble and All I Want for Christmas into the confused and, frankly, evil-intentioned adolescent of this film. Mena Süvari displays the perfect physical embodiment of what constitutes beauty and both she and Wes Bentley have clearly great career prospects ahead of them.

the ultimate tragedy...,"The immediate storyline and message this film portrays might be somewhat ""cliché"". From the outside these middle-class suburban families appear to have the perfect lifes, but if you ""look closer"" (these are words that mark the movie's poster) not all is what it seems. However, this film completely transcends this narrative, not in the least by the mesmerizing soundtrack by Thomas Newman.The film questions the immutability of our selves and our personalities by exposing us to characters that are trying to come to terms with themselves. They are practically all becoming aware of a primordial denial of their indiviualistic self, but the film also blocks the idea that this results in an easy transition, and likeso confirms the overall complexity and the impenetrable nature of the human psyche.So even if we are true to ourselves, if we are so-called authentic, new questions and difficulties arise. This is shown by the next door teenager that does not care what people think of him, but he might even be the most troubled of all. Everyone is forever doomed to fail, because we can only know ourselves through the lens of the other, though we have a fundamental but impossible urge to escape this image. This is what makes the movie for me one the most beautifull representations of the tragedy of everyday life.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

America the Beautiful/America the Violent,"American Beauty shows the contrast between the two faces of America.American Beauty extends the idea that nothing is ever perfect. It is set in a small suburb; it shows the contrast between American the beautiful and America the violent. American Beauty shows this idea with Jane Burnham. At the begging of the film she is unhappy with her body while she is looking at best augmentation on the Internet before school. Jane's appearance is a dark gloomy feel, but as the film progresses and Jane has a relationship Ricky Fits. Jane becomes progressively better looking and more appealing to the audience. She becomes an almost natural beauty in the film much more so than Angela who everyone thinks is a goddess. The real message of the movie is that there is no such thing as beauty, but everyone espiers to be beautiful. In the very begging of the film there is a shot of a rose. As you might know a rose looks beautiful but it does have thorns beneath it just like all of the characters in American Beauty they all have something to hide.American Beauty shows the shady underside of suburban life, or having a mysterious neighbor and a not so perfect marriage.

Breathtaking and near flawless Steinbeckesque dramedy.,"I view the characters in this film much as I view the characters in John Steinbeck's 'Of Mice and Men'. Each character in the book has their dreams, their goals, whether simple or fancy, they are dreams and most of them know deep down that they will never get there, but in order to lift themselves from the reality they are in, they need something to look forward to. In each character is a desire to be somewhere else, and in each character there is a major flaw, a weakness. In creating characters like these, Steinbeck has given each character redeeming features in such a way, that however hard you try, you cannot pick out a villain. Each and every character is a 'good guy', but each has their flaws that lead them to tragedy, and that is an excellent dynamic.In American Beauty, Lester, Janie, Angela, Carolyn, Ricky and Frank are all made out to be bad guys in some way or other, but each have their dreams, each have their flaws and they are all led to tragedy in one way or another because of them. Oh, and each are 'ordinary'. Its this Characterisation that really makes the film, aside from the cracking cinematography, acting, direction and ball-busting script. I would be very surprised if Alan Ball's inspiration was not partly because of Steinbeck. As you can see, I love this film.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Obsessions can be deadly,"Ahh, the joys of middle age. I remember a day at work, when a customer referred to an old gray haired guy who had waited on him. I didn't know who he was talking about; then it dawned on me; he was talking about me. Middle aged men, like Kevin Spacey, do have these fantasies from time to time. The girl in question is so unapproachable and so unconquerable, it should never have been an issue. In the meantime, we have the guy next door, with the hangups and his sexual identity issues. It's a sick mix. It's intriguing, but who would want to be there? Of course, marriages begin to fall apart, people begin to try to be what they are not, and the dominoes start to tumble with great dispatch. Someone is going to get hurt; someone may even die. Like Gene Wilder in ""The Woman in Red"" if our lives ended right now, it may be worth it. Unfortunately, tomorrow is another day. What were we thinking? Is this bravery or foolishness or madness or hormones or what? The sense of betrayal that filters through everything puts a pall over the ether.The acting is excellent.

The theme of the film is that people are not always what they appear to be.,"American Beauty is a 1999 drama film directed by Sam Mendes and written by Alan Ball. The film stars Kevin Spacey as Lester Burnham and Annette Bening co-starring as Carolyn Burnham. The film also features Thora Birch as Jane, the daughter of Lester and Carolyn, Mena Suvari as Angela, Wes Bentley, Chris Cooper and Allison Janney are also featured in the film.The film centers around Lester Burnham and his relationship with his wife, who is an over-achieving realtor who has drifted away from her husband, a non-existing relationship with his daughter, Jane, who he thinks hates him, and finally with Angela, his daughter's friend in which he is infatuated with. The film also delves into the relationship of the Burnham's new neighbors, Colonel Fits and his wife and son Ricky.The theme of the film is that people are not always what they appear to be. For example Angela was a beautiful girl, Lester sees her as this sex symbol, yet in the end finds out that she is indeed a virgin. Colonel Fits runs a tight ship at home and wants everyone to conform to the way he sees things. He beats his son Ricky after he falsely admits to being gay. In the end it is revealed that in fact Colonel Fits is gay.The film uses red rose petals as motifs several times throughout the film whenever Lester is thinking of Angela. The use of narration by Lester gives the audience an insight into what he was thinking and feeling. At the lowest point in Lester's life, his thoughts of Angela drove him to do things like buying and smoking marijuana, in efforts to relive portions of his childhood.Another theme in the film would be that youth and beauty equates happiness. When Lester did things like lust after a teenage girl and smoke marijuana, he seemed happy. Ricky sees beauty in everyday life, videoing as much as he can for fear of missing it. He shows Jane what he considers the most beautiful thing he has filmed: a plastic bag, tossing in the wind in front of a wall. He says capturing the moment was when he realized that there was ""an entire life behind things""; he feels that ""sometimes there's so much beauty in the world I feel like I can't take it ... and my heart is going to cave in.""",,Anonymous,Drama

A cynical and satirical look at American middle class suburbia,"Over the years, American Beauty has been regarded as one of the best movies made. It's such a huge part of film culture that I had to see it at some point.American Beauty follows Lester Burnham, a sexually frustrated suburban father that goes through a mid-life crisis after being infatuated with his daughter's best friend.After viewing this film for the first time, I honestly did not know what to think of it. I was sure I liked it but I didn't know much. It's been more than a week since I've seen it and hasn't left my mind since. The tone of this film is so interesting and the way writer Alan Ball has constructed this world and the characters within it is done really well. There is a level of cynicism and sarcasm within many of the dialogues that reflect the attitudes of each character. The characters have interesting traits and beliefs that make them compelling characters. We mainly follow this world through Lester's point of view. It was fun to see the way he views his life and the people around him. I'll admit this role hasn't aged well for Kevin Spacey but he does such a tremendous job as this person. His performance here is one of his best. There is a strange factor to each of the characters and they all play an important role to Lester's arc by the end, which I thought was communicated brilliantly. I loved the commentary Ball gave towards middle class suburbia in America. Characters symbolise different people in the comment such as Carolyn, played phenomenally by Annette Bening, who has the need to seem successful and maintain her reputation even though it may not seem like it.Sam Mendes did an excellent job directing this film espcially considering this was his debut. The film looks absolutely gorgeous not to mention how well done the cinematography is. Thomas Newman's score is also beautiful to listen to and the way some songs are implemented into scenes elevate the quality of them. An amazing scene between Lester and Angela, played marvellously by Mena Suvari, stands out to me because of the stunning cinematography, music and acting. However, there is a scene with CGI that looks outdated and, as much as I like Alan Ball's script, a scene involving a plastic bag came across as a bit pretentious in my eyes.As of right now, I think American Beauty is a solid film. It's got a fascinating satirical outlook into middle class suburbia that I've not seen before and the way Alan Ball presents it through his dialogue and characters make it extremely memorable. It's possible, after a few rewatches, I may like this film even more.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Beautiful,"About 20 years ago a great film was made. It was American Beauty- the acting, the writing, the direction. My Gosh - I still get goosebumps throughout this film. Spacey is a great actor despite his dark unfortunate past. I still watch this film on repeat.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Still Wonderful,"It'd been a solid 15 years since I had seen this, but I'm thrilled to report that much of it still works. Spacey and Bening are wonderful as the lead couple who feel like their lives haven't turned out the way they'd hoped so they go to elaborate lengths to get their spark back.I've heard several people say this is just another dated 90s/early 2000s white people problems movie and that none of the characters are likable, but these people feel real to me. No, they don't make the best choices, but most human beings don't either. I like that this film reflects that we're all imperfect and have flaws. Lester's obsession with his teenage daughter's friend is very creepy, but in the end, he realizes that being with her won't reclaim the time he lost or help him in any meaningful way. Carolyn's obsession with being the best in real estate, making money, and being a status obsessed harpy won't make her any happier either.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber?,"The general theme and concept of the screenplay closely parallel Hemingway's story, ""The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber"". Inner peace and strength, respect of one's self, and becoming a whole person independent of the actions and influences of others... might come late in life, but never too late. Burnham, like Macomber, ""finds himself""... although he does not live long to enjoy it. Nonetheless, this change means he still wins in the end.There are other similarities between the movie and the story. It is worth reading... one of Hemingway's best.Not casting aspersions on the screenwriter here, but in general, it's obvious some of the best literature gets ""farmed"" for new work. Rear Window was just about plagiarized from H.G. Wells' short story ""Through a Window"". There are countless examples.",,Anonymous,Drama
A Tribute to the Beauty of Life.,"It happens very rarely. You meet people in life who leave you with a lingering sense of familiarity. People, who no matter what they are, leave you with a sense of having asked a few questions; questions you have been wanting to ask yourself for a long time but have been putting it away simply because you don't want to face them. That's what happens when you start understanding the characters of `American Beauty'. It's like looking at the mirror and seeing someone you don't want to see, you don't want to know.This film is an acknowledgement of our times; the pain and the curses that it bringsand the hope that it still instills in individual inspite of it. The story begins in a slow, casual narrative with a kind of indifference that makes it extremely tragic. But then as you zoom in to the lives of the characters you sense the dormant passions, the fears, the hope. Sam Mendes has done an excellent job in scattering a handful of characters in a plot where they are caught in the ebb and flow of life. Even if they run, they don't go very far, and finally come back to where they started. The background music complements the sensitive slowness of the film in a manner that is quite soulful. The camera acts almost like a silent observer and its role is, to have no role in the story. It just documents actions, reactions, emotions and feelings. In the noninterference of these other ingredients of film making, what gains poignance is the story, the plot, the lives of the characters. All the character in this film, the father, the mother, the daughter, her friend, the daughter's boyfriend, his father, his mother the neighbours  all of them are all caught in a society which has sapped their spirits in some way making them dysfunctional pieces of life. Life, which leaves no purpose, no meaning. It is a simple rambling on of mundane existence which one seldom questions. Yet one cant blame the society because what makes a society is the people. And one can't blame the people either. They are caught in such a black hole in time, which refuses to acknowledge them, as individuals with their individual preferences, which they can't live with, can't live without! The loveless marriage of Kevin Spacey, the stage of his life determining his need for a sensuous relationship if not a fruitful one, his life drifting away in front of him like he never belonged, his wife's new lover, his unhappy job situation, his lust for his daughter's friend are not connected events yet they have a bearing on each other leaving him no room for escape. Yet he tries to be an understanding father, a compromising husband, a faithful employee. He tries but fails. He is a guy I have seen next door, you have seen next door. He could be anywhere, but only in a time like this, when individualism has brought with it the bane of isolation. You empathize with him and wonder, `Haven't I ever felt this way?' And then when you see this man changingslowly but steadily transforming himself to what he would really like to be, you feel happy for him. He is beginning to understand his space in this world and Kevin Spacey does a wonderful job of portraying that transformation in the character. He has got into the character like it was he. The collage of the other characters brings out the fears, the insecurities, and the confusions that we live with. Annette Bennings' portrayal of the frustrated wife is absolutely fantastic. The character lives through her emotional outbursts, her rigorous routine life, her crippled relationship with her husband, and her unsatisfied professional life with such amazing chaos and yet it is so simple actually. It is so natural! Her internal traumas are well portrayed by the actress and you feel sorry for her even when you know she might have had a way out of the tragic situation she is in. Thora Birch is the absolute teenager. Caught between socially accepted concepts and her own self which does not fit in there, like any other teenager anywhere in the world in times like these she wonders whether she is a freak! Allison Janning and Chris Cooper are stunning in their short roles. They portray the senselessness of a system that breeds self-denial as part of societal ethics, some cope with it some take shelter in letting their minds wander. They are like two sides of a coin, so different from each other in dealing with truth yet so similar in what they are running away from.Wes Butler as Ricky is perhaps the only one among the characters who has retained his sanity. His ability to see beauty in small, inane things surface so gently through the chaos in the film that one suddenly realizes what one is missing. It questions our inability to fathom darkness and touch light, our insufficiency to deal with our schizophrenic selves caught up in the mess of societal paradigms. He retains his individuality by being a part of a system that is rotting. In fact by helping the system to rot. His dealing in drugs thus becomes symbolic of a person who is helping a dying system die. He is abnormal. He does not fit in; perhaps that is his way of not conforming. But the most poignant part of the film is the end. When you see Lester's entire life pass through a haze of the present, you feel so completely awed at what beauty life actually holds for every one of us. As the glorious days of his childhood, the loving days of his marriage, his daughter float across his mind, and you hear him say how full of gratitude he is for all the wonder and beauty life actually has to offer, you just sit there in that balcony seat and shut your eyes for a second to glance into your soul. You wonder, `Why did all that laughter have to die?'",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Sub-Lynchian,"Sam Mendes' 'American Beauty' is a fun satire on American suburban culture, but in my opinion it hardly deserved it's Oscars.  Potato-jowelled Kevin Spacey, in the lead role as a middle aged man undergoing a mid-life crisis, is very funny, his behaviour unreasonable yet appealing at the same time. But the symptoms of his crisis (lusting after his daughter's best friend, buying a fast car, etc.) are all quite unoriginal.  Annette Bening plays his ambitious, shallow wife (and there's a degree of misogyny in the way the film takes Spacey's side over hers, when coupled with its portrayal of Mena Suvari's teenage bitch): the other adult characters (the repressed bigot, the cheesy salesman) are similarly cliched. Fundamentally, this is quite a shallow film, albeit one that makes you laugh.The younger characters are, if anything, even more problematic.  Mena Suvari plays Angela, the young sexpot for whom Spacey falls: her performance is poor, fluctuating wildly between tough girl front and inner vulnerability. What's interesting about real people is that we can be two things at the same time: but Angela goes from bad girl to good, and is never in between. The screenwriter also makes a common error in believing you make a character seem sexy by getting her to swear a lot; but Angela always seems forced and knowing, ironically (from the viewer's perspective) utterly failing to represent the combination of playfulness and naturalness in real teenagers which would offer an explanation for Spacey's lust.  Maybe this is even intentional cowardice on the part of the film-makers - it's safer by far to make a film about a middle aged man in love with a dream, than by one really attracted to an actual (younger) girl. By making Angela so clearly symbolic, they escape the risk of getting attacked by those hyper-sensitive to portrayals of paedophilia.Thora Birch's character, Jane, is Spacey's daughter.  The film decides to largely exonerate her of responsibility in its wider farce: it mocks her mode of, like, speaking, but it caresses her more than it puts in the boot: her ludicrous desire for plastic surgery is, for example, hardly touched. Plus, as in all Hollywood movies, even the 'plain' girl in the plot is necessarily played by a beautiful actress.Meanwhile, Wes Bentley's character is another stock part: the weird kid who turns out to be all right; but not because weirdness is OK, but rather because he's not really weird after all. He may not be weird but he is a drug dealer, though presented in a wholly positive light as if morally uncorrupted by his criminal trade.  Even if one has no problems with cannabis use, it's strange that he is presented as a role model (in contrast to the suburban hypocrites) when his ability to make a fortune out of his work is obviously derived from that very hypocrisy (if drugs were legal, no-one would get rich selling them): but this film lacks the intelligence to see that he is a part of the picture (and not apart from it).  Also, his interest in filming things, reminding one of numerous other movies including 'Peeping Tom' and 'Sex, Lies and Videotape', helps the plot along but is one of those devices one suspects are of more interest to film-makers than to the general public.The film ends by giving Spacey a moment of epiphany he has done nothing to earn (if he really had found meaning in his life through quitting the rat race, that would be different but all he has actually done is played out his fantasies without yet counting the consequences).  Indeed, it gets all solemn and meaningful in a long drawn out conclusion.Overall I have been very hard on this film, which I actually enjoyed.  But fundamentally it is a very compromised satire, one that mocks its characters but forgives its audience, even though the two are really the same (and when a braver film would dare to do things the other way around). Anyone can laugh at unhappy families.  A real revolutionary would aim at the happy ones.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Kevin Spacey gives one of the best performances ever,Why are all movies from the year 1999 about average people escaping their average life to accomplish their desires? That is a question I will probably review later but American Beauty is a prime example of this. Kevin Spacey plays Lester your average man in the late 90s who begins to tire of his day to day life and after seeing one of his daughter's friends he begins to try and make sexual advances towards her. The film centers around the ideas of identity and beauty as characters seek to find themselves such as discovering that times have past them by. Beauty is a common thread in this movie as the title suggests even if it is a small things like a bag blowing in the wind. The use of music in this film is one of the best I have ever heard as every song reveals emotion or how a character is thinking. Kevin Spacey is great in this movie and I still respect him as an actor(maybe not off screen though). Kevin Spacey is great at playing the pathetic character looking for more out of life. The use of the rose in this movie is very important as it symbolizes desire whether it be the desire for sexual relations or to be through with an average suburban life. The movie is a borderline watch on Netflix as many will probably not enjoy the film as it does not offer too much in terms of action but does in terms of message and cinematic merit.Also I forgot to mention just how brilliantly directed this film is by Sam Mendes and I am glad he has made a comeback in recent years with 1917 and Skyfall.,8.0,Anonymous,Drama

Realism at it's best,"American Beauty depicts almost every marriage around the world, the gradual fading of passion and the eventuall robotification of the couples, where everything becomes a boring routine and nothing seems to bring back the joys of the past, which leads to desperate attempts to feel alive and relevant again.Kevin Spacy performed a masterclass of acting, you could feel his frustration and sadness, all the same while you could see in his eyes that while he gave up on his social life, he was not ready yet to give up on his self. His wife of course (I don't know her name, sorry), did an excellent job at portraying the sterotype middle-aged wife where she wants to show herself as the one taking care of their lives and needs while still needing care and attention.The script alongside the cinematography were superb, specially the last scene where the flashbacks hit, it made me cry, we witnessed the sad truth about the beauties in life when overtime, they turn into a sad and hopeless liability.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

A near perfect rose,"I can't believe this is only Alan Ball's first writing credit. _AB_ is not a naturalistic film by any means, not like _The Accidental Tourist_ or _Shoot the Moon_. It is entirely artifice, especially in circular plot construction and directing flourishes, but it matches art with a big, beating, very human heart. The acting and directing are top notch--my only complaint is that one or two images might have been _more_ arresting, and that _AB_, like most American films, seems to refuse to let two actors do their stuff in a single two shot--rather, they insist on cutting back and forth between the two even when dramatically unnecessary, as for a reaction shot. Sometimes this is used to cover bad acting, but I find it hard to believe Spacey & Co. needed cover of that color.My only other complaint is that what may have been the most tragic character in the film is made too unlikeable, and fails to seize our sympathy. Had the character been allowed to win it, the movie's end would be doubly powerful. While prejudice may be loathsome, movies are _not_ about prejudice--they are about people. And this film has some great people in it. You will be kicked in the head. Do not resist.",,Anonymous,Drama
Years Later - Sixth Sense was still robbed,"Looking back years later, while American Beauty was a pretty good film, the Sixth Sense, M. Night Shamalan, and particularly Haley Joel Osment were quite simply robbed (by the ""Academy""). Comparing the two for picture and performance, the Sixth Sense was phenomenal in comparison. Direction was intelligent, and Osment was simply brilliant. It spoils the credibility of the Oscar - which I wonder if they realize - or more importantly, if they even care. Unfortunately, this will continue because the insider ""agendas"" will always reign supreme.I find it interesting that when trying to submit a review for any film, IMDb requires that you must include a minimum sized review for it to be accepted. This will only prevent people from being succinct in their opinion (which is a bit silly). At any rate, Kevin Spacey's performance as a middle-aged man in crisis was very well done, but Osment's performance was nothing short of brilliant. There is a difference.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

Disturbing at best,"Watching that movie knowing about Kevin Spacey's troubles put everything in a different light. While it is already a very weird story full of perversity, seeing Spacey infatuated with a teen, just makes it even worse. Though the movie is quite disturbing, you cannot help but see the beauty in it: how it is filmed, how Ricky sees the world while his family is broken, and how the director shows changes in each character. You cannot help but see the world through Ricky's eyes (and camera), as if he was to tell you, ""look through my eyes, I see the world in a better way than you could"".

American Beauty by Sam Mendes,"The beauty is one of the most important themes, which has been often explored in songs, poetries and plays. They would transmit different kind of emotions, as they still capture the audience attention. The songs about beauty describe the desperate pursuit of it, in the darkest moments through the most miserable places. The singers would express their emotions in the saddest way, which is often filled with poetic rhymes and touching musical notes. In the poetries, the authors express their feelings with difficulties, when they would find something touching. In the plays, the main characters often act long monologues and soliloquies, to express their feelings and most of the time their doubts. Especially when they would try to move on, by facing unexpected tragic moments. Some plays would end in bad way, which the main characters die only after, they have found something precious that they have been looking for. Others would end in good way, which the main characters live in the peaceful places, where they express their happiness through a long final monologue. After Sam Mendes has directed some plays, he seems interested to explore the theme about beauty. Especially after he read the script written by Alan Ball, which has been offered by Steven Spielberg who saw a potential in Sam Mendes. In 1999 came out American Beauty by Sam Mendes, with Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Wes Bentley, Chris Cooper and Mena Suvari. The movie's plot: Lester Burnham is a depressed 42 years old man who is unsatisfied with his job, he has also difficulties to talk with his wife Carolyn and his daughter Jane. But since Lester falls in love with Angela Hayes, who is Jane's best friend, he starts to change his life. Carolyn and Jane change their lives as well, until an unexpected conclusion would happen. The movie from the beginning to the end, is filled with mise-en-scènes to create images to look like paintings. These mise-en-scènes are helped by the lightnings to make the scenes more atmospheric, especially when the main characters express their emotions in the specific moments. All the actors played characters who have in common, that they are searching for something important in the course of the story. Kevin Spacey was excellent as Lester Burnham, who initially was excluded like he is not as important as Carolyn and Jane. Until Lester would meet Angela Hayes to change his life, as he starts to do sport to get physically fit, he quits his job to find another one and befriends with the new neighbor Ricky Fitts who would give Lester pots to smoke. Annette Bening did a well done performance as Carolyn Burnham, who tries to be as successful as her real estate competitor Buddy Kane. Then Carolyn would have an affair with Buddy, to have found the success she has been looking for. Thora Birch was really good as Jane Burnham, who would initially act like her friend Angela Hayes. But since Jane falls in love with the neighbor Ricky Fitts, she would be herself to not imitate anymore the behavior of Angela. Wes Bentley did a well done performance as Ricky Fitts, who once he meets Lester and Jane Burnham, he would show both of them a way to find something they missed. Since Lester starts to smoke pots, thanks to Ricky, Lester would kind of live again the youth he missed. Jane would initially not trust Ricky, by looking him with bad eyes. Until she finds a way to be confident with him, as they would have a relationship to be close with each other. Then Chris Cooper was excellent as Colonel Frank Fitts, who would be initially seen as a restricted and homophobic character to not express any emotions. As he would often hit his son Ricky for a foolish discipline, until something would change him to be more emotional and less restricted. Finally Mena Suvari was also excellent as Angela Hayes, who would be seen as an avoided teenage girl. Especially when she tells stories on the time where she had sex with a lot of men, until it would be find out she is a girl who wants to be just a popular teenager. The script was elaborated to see how the story would be developed, from the beginning to the end by creating a workable narration. The score by Thomas Newman creates the emotions needed, to make the scenes poetic and atmospheric. As the tracks of the score are compatible with the most important scenes, by making them unforgettable and emotional. American Beauty is one of the best Sam Mendes' movies, it is also one of the best movies of the 90s.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

Kevin Spacey, has already stared in two of the most important movies (in cinematic history; 'The Usual Suspects' and 'Glengarry Glen Ross' and his quality rarely drops.

Spec-tac-u-lar,"On the one hand I understand why the movie is dated especially after Kevin Spacey's allegations, as well as us living in a post-9/11 society. But you know what that still doesn't prevent me from saying that this is one of my top 3 favorite movies of all time. Even better than Banshees of Inisherin. Yes I'm going that far, this movie's that good. For problems first, at times it is a bit uncomfortable and yes I can see why people wouldn't get into it because of it being a bit uncomfortable. I also think while the ending monologue is still amazing, I think the last 20 minutes of the movie could've been a bit stronger. They're not bad but it's a little bit underwhelming. Aside from that everything else about the movie ranges from ok to phenomenal. The cast I feel like is a bit mixed. Some of the cast are very bland like the people who play Ricky and Angela. But everyone else is amazing. The two standouts are definitely Annette Bening and Kevin Spacey. Both are funny as well as showing why they can really turn in a great performance. So many of the jokes are very hilarious. Even after an uncomfortable moment there's a joke that is so gross and bizarre but also out-of-the-ordinary that I couldn't help but laugh at how bizarre it was. The letter scene is probably my favorite joke from the movie. The letter itself is hilarious and Spacey really nails the scene in showing how to turn in a phenomenal performance. The cinematography is absolutely inspiring. So much of the angles, the shots and the colors, it makes the movie feel alive and it makes it stand out from any of the other Best Picture winners. The music is also phenomenal. Thomas Newman is my favorite composer and this is one of his best works. Even during the uncomfortable moments, the music still fits the tone showing the reason why Newman is probably the GOAT for film music. A true crime that he didn't win for this or some of his other nominations. I should also mention the implanted details of the messages in the movie. Yes I know for some people it says they're hammering it in. But not really for me because for me they're done brilliantly and it makes it more of a symbolic movie meaning that there's so much symbols in the movie like the 1's and 0's forming a jail cell on Lester's computer meaning that he hates his job or the red door meaning danger or the roses meaning superficial beauty. These messages are done very well in my opinion. At first I was interested to watch it seeing as how I've seen people think it deserves to be dated or other people thinking it's a masterpiece. 1917 I thought, was going to be the better movie out of Sam Mendes' filmography but at the end of the day this is the better film in my opinion. Not only is it one of my top 3 favorite movies of all time, it's probably my favorite Best Picture winner of all time for now at least. I'm still planning to watch The Godfathers Part I and II. But for now American Beauty is my favorite Best Picture winner and I'll keep admiring it for why it's one of my favorite movies. Man oh man oh man.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Exquisite movie.,This is truly a classic movie for those people who appreciate real art when watching films. The movie is basically all about the lives of American suburbanites but put in a very realistic way. This is a great psychology movie because it shows a large amount of information on developmental processes. The acting and the dialogue in the movie are of course the best part. The movie is primarily based on Kevin Spacey's role which he captures and absolutely stunned me when seeing him. Wes Bently was also very good.

Sex, drugs, infidelity, murder, masturbation, and rose petals!  Why didn't anyone think of this before?  They have; but they laughed it off!  Kevin Spacey (fun to watch as always, never different as always, but fun to watch)is held forward as an everyman ""hero"" because he heroically quits his job with a full year's salary as a safety net.  Watch how he bravely gets a low level job at a fast food joint (I wonder if all of the other employees have $60K in their pockets?), starts smoking dope with the kid next door, dreams about jumping a high school cheerleader, tells his wife he's withdrawing from their marriage, and actually tries to listen to his daughter for the first time in a decade!  zzzzzzzz!

A beautiful film,"American Beauty is the epitome of perfect emotional cinema. It boasts great direction, screen writing and performances all round, making it, in my opinion, one of the greatest films ever made.The story follows Lester Burnham, a man who seems to have lost all hope in life, as he is stuck in a joyless marriage and has trouble connecting with his teenage daughter. This all changes when he meets Angela, his daughter's best friend. From then on, Lester decides to take back control of his life. The question is, how will it affect those around him?Kevin Spacey gives a career defining performance and once again nails it as Lester, a man so fed up with life that he needed a radical change. The evolution of the character is done to perfection and Spacey's Oscar winning work is the proof. All other actors do their parts in great fashion as well and make the movie even better. With inspired performances like these, the film only gets better with a magical combination of Alan Ball's script and Sam Mendes' debut as a cinematic director. Among other things I love about this film, I can't go on without mentioning the heart wrenching soundtrack that pulls out a wallop of emotions.American Beauty is a wonderful, yet ultimately tragic tale of how people can hide their true selves. However they choose to change, one thing is certain: it will affect everything in the status quo. Lester's story is the example of that and it is one that I will heartedly support every time I watch this movie.Rating: 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Not quite there, but close.","As great as this one is, I had trouble getting through the back and forth bickering and fighting between all of the characters, it was just too much! How can a film have such an all-star cast, with no likeable characters lol? It does cross some sensitive lines, and issues, which I could have done without as well. I would have done this one much differently. Not sure what the producer had in mind, and this movie did receive critical acclaim, but for my money, it was not quite as great as it could have been. I do watch it on occasion, but always have to take a break from the overall negativity of it. Hey, it's hard to argue with its success, there is no denying that, but this one is just too gloomy, downtrodden, and miserable to enjoy. 6 stars for the all-star cast, that's as much as I could give it.

Is someone out there afraid of what I am about to say?,"For the life of me, I cannot understand all the acclaim over this movie.  It's ""message"", if one could call it that, is little more than a bad joke. Contrary to what you may hear, this film is not, I repeat, NOT a social commentary on current-day life in suburban America, mainly because it has absolutely nothing to do with life in the suburbs. Believe or not, most suburban fathers do NOT lust after their teenage daughter's friends, do NOT try to blackmail their employers, do NOT obtain drugs from the youth next door, and do NOT quit decent jobs to flip hamburgers and ride around in sport cars. Another amazing fact is that most suburban mothers do NOT cheat, or cart their lovers around in their SUVs for a quick bite to eat after having wild sex at the local motel. You'll probably be surprised to learn that the vast majority of suburban daughters are NOT plotting to kill their fathers, that they do NOT expose themselves for the camera of a voyeuristic ""boy-next-door"", or that their friends do NOT try to seduce their fathers with the skill of a street hooker. I also daresay that the ""welcome wagon"" is NOT likely to be led by a local gay couple, and I wouldn't be too concerned about the macho military man next door letting loose with his repressed homosexual tendencies and kissing his male neighbor. And last but not least, most suburban fathers need NOT worry about someone sneaking into their homes and blasting them to eternity. All of this, incredible as it may sound, is what this film asks us to accept.Do you want an accurate portrayal of the life and problems of suburban America? Go rent ""Parenthood"", which came out about 10 years ago, but is still infinitely more realistic, sensible, and intelligent than this highly overrated nonsense.",1.0,Anonymous,Drama

4.15.2024,"You can barely count on a film at this moment with a title of AMERICAN BEAUTY to guarantee you something dreamlike experience, (though it permeates all the cinematography) but it also hardly do a absolute satire as it's came from Hollywood, so my point now here it probably take a dip into the neutralism. It's not actually neutral, rather mellow, and did what Hollywood can best do, what you might expect the Hollywood films do? LA CHINOISE?The only part that appreciable maybe for me in that movie is probably those didactic loops (it's lame, and sterile but that's what it all about) across the whole film, and these freak psycho who loves Pink Floyd, and being accused by the director to make those avant-garde rock music enjoyers' stereotypes much deeper.I found that in the beginning that the feeling of dying cinematography in Hollywood. There are good composition and somehow okay lighting, but one of things that make it ratty is that the connections between shots and shots, that you can barely find those threads of meaning structures in it (they don't want to actually, this isn't what Hollywood made for, it's mainly for entertaining instead of the self-expression of directors) It tires me a little at beginning, like tasting a bucket of greasy junk foods, but it gets milder when it breaks down into those classic Hollywood three-act structures.We had two wilted men who tried to sight rape those two budding girls with one sexual profligacy, whom made the whole film like a kiddie porn (Nabokov is giggling), and a cynical young daughter, with a documentary camera POV and a self-imagined POV, which I think can basically satisfied the audiences' voyeurism at the beginning of the film. Later we are through into the conflicts between the desires and desires, all those characters seems to not happy with their sex life except this gay couple, and indeed I think this is a pretty gay movie, simply because when you reconstruct the whole plot and you probably will find if the ending scene of Ricky's father turn to be a gay didn't happen, this film will be too cruel to the gay people.You can count on it with not simply a drama like Billy Wilder's SUNSET BOULVARD, which they both have the same beginning of a dead people talking as a narrator. It's pretty a didactic way of teaching you how to live or appreciate your moment, but for me this is not the fundamental way of the cinema. Like, you can simply read any literature or philosophy textbook to gain a much deeper understanding of life in merely ten minutes, and what this film is all about is the entirety of textualized as a parable, but forgot to do what films might really being good at such as the interlinked between shots and shots, it's not these mechanical ending of special montage, or surreal imaginations in hero's mind.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

The Best Film of 1987,"I finally got around to seeing this, and, while it wasn't a bad movie, and the acting was strong, I can't believe it was so overwhelmingly adored when a vastly superior film in the same vein, The Ice Storm, was all but ignored just recently. The Ice Storm touched on very similar themes in far more subtle and rich ways, and didn't rely on the cheap ""shot"" in the end for its devastating effect. The lost, bewildered father, Kevin Kline in the Ice Storm, is left alive to face life and hopefully resurrect his family rather than ascending to omniscient bliss on the wings of his own self-centeredness. Maybe I'm just holding this movie to a higher standard because of all of the awards and hype--it had its moments.  But the Annette Benning character didn't do a thing, Kevin Spacey's character displayed every single self-referential, moral relativist trait that makes the baby boomers like a plague of locusts on this nation, and the bit about videoing the dead bird and the paper bag, may seem hip to many moviegoers but is merely regurgitated 1980s art school trickery. The one thing I really liked about American Beauty was the handling of the gay marine next door--it was incredibly touching when he came into Kevin Spacey's garage and then disappeared again into the rain--it was also incredibly satisfying to see this stereotype, the hardass, homophobic marine blown apart once and for all--fag-hating marines will never be able to show their faces again in the neighborhood after this treatment sinks into the country's consciousness.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

American Beauty is a masterpiece in its purest form.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Pretty good but deeply flawed,"American Beauty tries really hard to be a intense commentary on modern society in the so-called ""civilized world"". The portrait of a disillusioned middle-aged man given by Kevin Spacey is superb and deserved the praise it got. Although his character shows obvious psychological and moral flaws, one could only sympathize for his decision to choose sincerity as a cure to his disillusioned life. Spacey's character, the flawed man that conveys more humanity than anybody else, is nothing new to the cinema industry: think about One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest (which is, anyway, a far superior film) for instance. But while not revolutionary, American Beauty is very well crafted around Spacey, and the rest of the actors give out fairly good performance. On the psychological level, this is a film about comprehension and respect, and a beautiful one.However, on the social level, this film fails miserably. And that's where ""beauty"" comes in.Such lines as ""there's so much beauty in the world"" and the infamous plastic bag scene are absurd and irritating. There's nothing beautiful in a piece of trash that pollutes our environment, there's not that much beauty in the world anymore considering that we keep destroying it, considering that numerous species of animals seem doomed to extinction, and especially considering that none of the characters in the movie seems to care about it AT ALL. The plastic bag scene would have worked with a bird... or even with a rat, if one wants to find beauty in what most people can't... but with a plastic bag it's just fluffy and hypocritical. Fight Club - another movie that explored the ground of psychological disillusion and flaws in our society - got into a lot controversy about its violence when, in fact, was delivering a much more carefully constructed message about respect for nature and what our society has to avoid.In other words, this movie works in a beautiful way around the human characters, but all it pulls out is a ""enjoy your life"" message that ultimately seems, if not in contrast with what the movie was saying in the beginning, very mild and inappropriate anyway.That's why I think this movie is interesting, but not a masterpiece at all. Not even close.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
Number one favorite movie,"I was only five when this movie first came out, so I didn't get the privilege of watching this and fully understanding it until just recently.If you look at this movie at its surface level, this is what you have: A rebel, a nut mother, a dad going through mid life crisis, a teenage boy who isn't what people think, a sex crazed girl, and two parents that don't really have control.If you REALLY watch the movie, you see so much more. It's movie about simply finding beauty in things. It's a very heavy movie, with a lot of ""hard to swallow"" material. Some people my find it hard to get past some of the strong sexual material, but honestly, this shouldn't stop you from seeing this wonderful movie.Once of my favorite scenes is when the wife comes home to a new car. Her and Spacey start to rekindle some flames when she goes and comments about getting beer on the couch. Spacey then goes to tell her how she cares more about her materials than actually living. I think that describes a lot of us, especially in 2013.I laughed, I cried, but most of all, a felt hope. My life was changed watching this movie.

A modern Bunuel?,"This movie IS American, if not Hollywoodian. So that's the bad part. It is so fscking American. Not French, not European. It drags out of everyone anything that one can drag. Comedy, tragedy, fun, blood, you name it. Pandering to the galleys. Hate this.In the background, however, something else plays along. Everyday life stories. Concentrated, if not distilled, but everyday life. Marriage. Disappointment. Sexual frustration. Borderline craziness. But everything hidden carefully behind well-devised normality, one that is anything but normal. Nobody in this movie, sympathetic or not, in the end turns out to be a freak on the inside; propped up by an outwardly stable construction. And this reminds me of the master of this topic, Luis Bunuel.Many didn't like him, not the communists and neither the fascists, because nobody would come out of his stories as the good one. Each and every person would fight for his own, in his own little prison cell in which he fights his own insanity. And so here. Lester Burnham isn't better, really. He is advantageous only because of the situation that allows him to come out slightly better. Angela, the most empty person in the movie finally concedes to still be a virgin. So he can't actually sleep with her; as much as he would have wished. He is kind of hero only, because someone mistook him.Everyone tries to pretend to be good, or do good, like in the Angel Exterminator by Bunuel. To give an example. And yet without the least chance to escape from his tightly fitting corset.Do not we all betray ourselves when we pretend to be good, a start a happy marriage, childhood, parenthood, neighborhood, work relation? When, in the end, we end up as career-minded real estate agents, masturbating to the thoughts of our kids friends, fighting our dads by playing out just the opposite life of what our dads were hoping for, becoming paralyzed by overwhelming husbandry, exploiting work relationships, lying to one another for career reasons, threaten with blackmail, are inconsiderate to our partners' wishes?Not 'nobody is perfect'.

"Much more than just a drama, a film that could change your life!","'American Beauty' is not just a film to view or a story to adore, it is something more like a vast experience, a journey to witness and when do you realize these things? it is when you meet the protagonist, this very ordinary and common man called Lester Burnham, played beautifully by Kevin Spacey, but it is not Spacey, whom we witness on screen, it is Lester the man. Let's just forget everything else and simply stare at Lester's life as he narrates to us. The fact is it is not just Spacey who breathes life into the film, almost every character shines in their respective roles, giving a perfect team work. What the film demands for is, how you, the viewer studies the various characters. What supports Spacey's brilliant performance are an excellent support from Annette Benning, Thora Birch, Wes Bentley and Mena Suvari. Apart from them the rest other cast give a worthy support. You can't help but gaze at the entire cast performance and get involved with them each mentally because you are forced to see situations from their individual perspectives. Nothing more to say, watch out this film yourself and you will realize that a life can be much more than you ever thought. Trust me, you will think it over and over again, its not just a film but a mild experience. Without a doubt, its a 9.9 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Soap opera for bourgeois-bashers,"Pier Paolo Pasolini once said, ""Whatever the bourgeois do, they are wrong"", and the 20th century is littered with literature, cinema and art dedicated to bourgeois-bashing. Nothing, it seems, appeals more to the pseudo intellect and culture vulture than a good jab at the middle class.Why?As Mailer slyly observed, ""the 'artist' labours under the illusion that he is fundamentally classless"". Such an individual is therefore free to attack the mores of the stilted conservative middle-brow. He is of course bohemian and liberal and free from the constraining modes of bourgeois thought. Invariably though, he is as middle-brow as the types he attacks, and sheepish at his lack of noble peasant heritage. Therefore such polemics are merely self-flagellation.'American Beauty' is an incredibly contrived piece of work. Contrived to illicit huge guilt assuaging, middle-brow applause and all the attendant awards that brings.Its viewpoint is that of the artistic liberal. The middle-aged, middle-class heterosexual union is stagnant and repressive. A veritable breeding ground for infidelity and discontent. The corporate workplace which financially sustains it is soul-crushing and corrupt. The harshly disciplinarian, ex-military father is a implosive, repressed homosexual who collects guns and Nazi tableware. The 'out' male homosexual couple are paragons of attractive, fully functioning gracious humanity. And guilt-free capitalists to boot.All of the teenagers are deeply unlikeable and speak in inverted commas as if distancing themselves from their own existences. But they are basically good kids corrupted and misled by their parents false values.These characters are drawn in crude broad strokes, reducing them to soap-opera /pantomime types and thus allowing the (almost entirely middle-class) audience a sense of detached superiority.Inevitably the film trips over its own muddled morality. It's middle-aged 'hero' is merely regressing to juvenilia, his 'freedom' a contextually different reiteration of the obsession with eternal youth and beauty. The male teenage protagonist obtains his funds through drug-dealing. But the proceeds pay for his technologically assisted insight, so thats okay.And, hey. It's only grass he's selling, after all.Despite all of this the film is not unenjoyable. It is beautiful to look at (visually it owes a deal to Lynch and Kubrick), and the fabled Kevin Spacey charm makes it's central character more sympathetic than he otherwise should be. Thomas Newman's ubiquitous new-agey score ties it all together, cleverly adding to the films entirely spurious sense of significance. The tedious symbolism likewise flatters it's audiences (no doubt) refined sense of aesthetics.One of the most overrated films of recent times.",,Anonymous,Drama

"A really fine, unique movie about life, but not for youngsters.","Please don't get this movie confused with another 1999 movie, ""American Pie"", which was a funny but rather crude movie about horny teenagers all trying to get laid.""American Beauty"" is about real life, about dysfunctional families who don't realize why they are crazy. Until Lester (Kevin Spacey) figures it out. Quits his job, quits pretending he is something he is not, and learns to really begin to deal with life. There are lots of laughs, but also lots of drama.Make no mistake, this is a movie about Lester's life and death. ""American Beauty"" has the courage to look at ""us"". It does so through the eyes of Lester Burnham who tells you at the beginning that he will be dead within the year. Interesting concept!!There are several other stories in the movie, but they are there only as they relate to Lester's. In some spots, it would be easy to walk out of the movie because of where you think it may be going. But stay, watch the whole thing, see how it all fits together and I think you'll agree it is a rare movie among all the special-effect, mega blockbuster that seems to be turned out like beanie babies. Although this one is totally different, the way its messages come through may remind you of movies like ""Fargo"" and ""A Simple Plan"". If you didn't think those were fine movies, skip this one.Kevin Spacey gives an award-quality performance. Most middle-aged men will quickly identify with his character. But turn the roles around and women should just as easily identify.The reason I say this movie is not for youngsters is because they have not lived enough to comprehend and identify with the characters. But the sex and language are not nearly as bad as some mainstream movies. There is nudity, and graphic discussion of sex acts and body parts among teenagers in this movie, but it probably was necessary within the overall context. I give it 9 of 10, a must-see for any adult who enjoys examining his or her situation in life.2009 edit: I have watched this movie several more times and have enjoyed it as much as I did on the first viewing.2014 edit: I upgraded to Blu-Ray for this movie, it is worth it.",,Anonymous,Drama
"Self-aware, but pretty good anyway","Almost every technical aspect of this movie was great. The story is compelling and original: there are other movies about mid-life crises, but this one is more complex and has several side plots that include the family and neighbors. The acting very good all around. Spacey is still just a little pushy, but it rarely gets in the way. The Ricky character is a bit overwrought. The pacing was excellent too, because the writing gave you just enough time to think about what you were seeing, or at least get your instinct involved. And of course, it's shot well. For those who think that sort of thing doesn't matter much, this movie will provide many great examples proving my point about the effect of good camera work to the average Joe.Before you read the rest, keep in mind that I actually recommend this movie for the above reasons. They've all been covered in detail by many others I'm sure, and rightfully so. However, it often gets hyped as ""One of the best movies I've seen"" whenever anyone makes a list that goes beyond 5 movies. This is as much a reaction to that as it is a review.There are some funny moments and some graphic ones. There's a good amount of tension and release. All this adds to the realism and is expertly portrayed by the relationships between parents and children and the parents themselves. My main problem with the film is the issue of self-righteousness which seems to be praised throughout. Lester's character is supposed to a hero, and that's fine. But he's a flawed one at least. I think the film tries to convey the opposite message. Selfishness abounds in this movie to the point where it becomes preachy. The message ""do what feels good"" were subtle enough to fool a lot of people into thinking there was more here than there really was. Tarantino would've had a gospel choir sing a song called ""do what feels good"" I think. Mendes was smarter than that.Still, it's well worth watching, but make sure you're mature enough to see past the flaws. A man with Mendes' talent could've easily gotten rid of the preachy implications of Chris Cooper's next-door visit to Lester's garage (I don't want to give it away but you'll know when you see it). Ricky's emotive recount of how he felt filming the plastic bag is kind of vomit inducing too. But these small miscalculations really took a lot away from an otherwise great movie. It wouldn't have been so obvious and wouldn't have been so forceful on the modern existentialism, but it would've been more real as a result. It could've been a masterpiece. Should've been a contender.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Philosophical and Ironic - every film student needs to study it,"I just read a long review of ""American Beauty"" on Wikipedia and it stated that film critics' opinions of it had declined over time, and that it was ""overpraised"" when it was released. I cannot agree.This film is deeply philosophical - it is about ""the meaning of life,"" with particular attention on the lives of middle-aged, middle-class adults and their teenaged children. ""American Beauty"" is also very funny, in a sarcastic, dark comedy manner, that I find very appealing. How many films have you seen there the ""narrator"" who introduces the film, and concludes it, tells you he is dead, but that this is not important to the story he has to tell.By the way, Wikipedia did not note this key fact: the ""American Beauty Rose"" the hybrid flower that is displayed symbolically throughout the film is known to be very beautiful, but it is also prone to infestation by fungus so it often has a very bad smell. Even a flower can be ironic.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Best of 1999?,"American Beauty was an interesting foot note in the explosion of avant garde films of 1999.  But I have a severe problem putting it close to the top of that year.  Most people feel that one of the more overlooked films of that particular year was Fight Club which deals with some of the same ideas only on a much broader and more anarchistic way.American Beauty should be looked at as an American tragedy much like A Raisin in the Sun. But just because it's ""like"" A Raisin in the Sun doesn't mean it's also great.The film contains some great acting from Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, and the entire cast but the story is overly cliche at times and lacks the reality that it sets itself up to be.  If all of this is supposed to be taking place in a real world, as Mendes sets up, there are several substantial problems.  It seems in his world POT has no smell and successful drug dealers are not the brightest bulbs in the house.To many times this film tries to be a character study and is unable to because of the unbelievability of the characters. Again, this is not a problem with the acting but rather the film making.I suppose I was more impressed with The Sixth Sense and Fight Club as potential motion pictures of the year.Again, not bad, but not great either.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
American Beauty isn't,"At the end of this film, Kevin Spacey's character talks about the idea of one's life passing before one's eyes at the point of death. If such a phenomena is true, then I fervently pray that, at the moment of my demise, the two-plus hours I sat in the theatre watching this dreadful movie will be omitted by the Great Film Editor in the Sky. I knew as I left the theatre, long before the awards, that this movie would win the Oscar for Best Picture. It's EXACTLY the sort of condescending, self-important tripe that Hollywood likes to honor. Both ""The Insider"" and ""The Sixth Sense"" were superior movies. I'm no genius, but I demand that a movie be smarter than I. I knew every plot ""twist"" five minutes before it happened, only erring on when Lester would be killed, but not by whom. Unbelievably stereotyped characters. Not particularly funny. I guess that because Lester beats off in the shower or lusts after an underage girl, we are supposed to think this movie is worthy of praise. I wonder how many people would praise the movie if Lester had lusted after an underage BOY? The ONLY good scene was the film within the film -- lovely and poetic. But one scene does not a good movie make, let alone a Best Picture. ""American Beauty"" is nothing more than an extended sitcom (though one that would only be shown on HBO). An utter waste of time. The Hollywood marketing machine has pulled off another cultural coup.",1.0,Anonymous,Drama
Modern Day Hero,"I'm not much of film critic. I mean, don't get me wrong. I know how to watch, and praise, or bash a movie. I mean this may not be very eloquent but...This freaking movie rules!!!Lester Burnham is hero to men everywhere. Not saying I approve of any of his choices, well outside of finally breaking and standing up for himself that is. This movie was hugely popular for the time it was released, as was another certain hero for men everywhere...Stone Cold Steve Austin of the WWF (now E). There was a guy who was doing exactly what a huge portion of the population was doing...kicking his boss's tail and getting away with it!!! Even guys I knew that hated wrestling knew and admired who Stone Cold was.It was much the same for guy friends of mine who don't particularly like movies. Well, outside of Die Hard and stuff. However this was a movie that any regular could get into, because they understood.Parts of the film unfortunately don't shine well, his apparent obsession with his school aged daughters friend. That may in fact tarnish the movie in some aspects because of Mr. Spacey's...um...past.Nonetheless, outstanding performances from Spacey, Benning, Gallagher, Birch, Suvari, Bentley,
Janney and Chris Cooper in particular.

A masterpiece,"American Beauty (1999) is a thought-provoking and visually striking film that earns an 8/10 for its compelling yet slightly flawed execution. Kevin Spacey delivers a standout performance as Lester Burnham, capturing the complexity of a man undergoing a midlife crisis with dark humor and pathos. The film's cinematography is stunning, with its use of color and framing adding layers of meaning to the story. Thomas Newman's haunting score complements the film's tone beautifully. However, while the film's exploration of suburban discontent is powerful, some aspects of the narrative feel heavy-handed, and certain character arcs could have been more fully developed. Overall, it's a great film with memorable moments but leaves room for refinement.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

Beautifully grotesque,"Though it's fashionable to find this movie artistic and meaningful, it's mostly a collage of other films.  The essence of the movie seems derivative of the very first scene in ""Blue Velvet"" where the camera starts up high over a sleepy suburb, then descends slowly until it moves into the grass and finds a festering hole full of bugs.  The message being, of course, that beneath the clean sterile exterior is a messy, dark, and unpleasant actual existence.The film techniques were extremely reminiscent of ""Risky Business"" with the lingering closeups--and the rose petals evoked the camera shot in that movie (far better) of the hose slowly penetrating a large shrub.The movie itself takes it's central plot from ""Lolita"", self consciously so. The real problem is not with the movie per se, rather it is done a disservice by the wacky response to it.  This isn't the best movie of the decade, it didn't deserve best picture, and it isn't a stark revelation about the secret heart of the American family.What it is is a reasonably funny movie about a rather pathetic middle American middle aged father who has let his personal crisis get away from him.  In fact, the real underlying message of the movie, one I've not seen before, is that the American family is being deeply hurt by a modern culture that has rejected personal responsibility.  Spacey methodically rejects everything that is supposed to make life worth living: work, family, religion; and embraces teen sex, drugs and the cult of the body.  What does it ultimately get him?This movie is kind of a throwback to the seventies with movies like ""The Last Married Couple in America"", ""Serial"", and ""Middle Age Crazy"".  It's worth a look, but for those who start spouting about the MEANING and the ARTISTRY, I'd advise them to get a life.",,Anonymous,Drama
By any other name,"American BEAUTY (1999) Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Chris Cooper Rated R. 5 Academy awards. Tagline: ""...look closer.""If this film bothers you, you're not alone. It does push buttons. The suburban middle class dream sometimes is not exactly what it appears to be on the picture perfect surface, and it gets taken to the wood shed here. The white picket fence can only hide so much from view before the dark secrets are finally uncovered. The Thomas Newman musical score is evocative with a hovering sense of sweet melancholy, yet it has a thoroughly haunting, icy-edged poignancy that cannot be resisted; it reflectively explores the hollow rewards of the death trap known as the rat race with all of its inherent disillusionment. More than a musical underscore, this is a sublimely eloquent work of art by Newman, perhaps his signature best, so very beautiful that when I hear it, it overflows and I don't know how I can possibly hold it all inside. This is a film that is funny, sad, disturbing and strangely beautiful. This movie is new every time I watch it. I never seem to remember everything that it contains, yet at times it's somehow impossible to forget a single moment. For cinema lovers especially, this motion picture is a masterfully crafted experience. Warning: This movie is not for those who are looking for simple escapist entertainment or for those who tend to hide their head in the sand. It's far from simple and it's uncompromisingly blunt.

What Is Up With This Film?,"What Is Everyone Talking About?I saw this film on the recommendation of people whose opinions I trusted. They said it was a masterpiece. I feel like I saw a different movie. American Beauty was one of the biggest turkeys I've ever seen. I very nearly walked out on it, which is something I don't do. I found the plot contrived and predictable and the characters cartoonish. The suburban schlub Dad? The frustrated wife? The brooding teenager? The closeted gay psychopath? These aren't characters, they're cliches. Spacey and Benning were good, as they always are, but no actor can rescue a script this far down in the trash. The scene with the bag blowing in the wind was the single most brainless thing I've ever seen in a movie, except in Z-grade sci fi or horror (and it gives some of those films a run for their money.)

So to actually be able to sit in a theatre and watch a genuinely inspired and original piece of film as this is a very special occasion these days.

Kevin Spacey gives the performance of his career as suburban rebel Lester Burnham. He is the obvious focal point of the movie, but I was also impressed by relative newcomers Thora Birch, Wes Bentley and Mena Suvari, and also the seriously underrated Chris Cooper ('Lone Star'). The only minor quibble I have with the movie is Annette Bening's character, which to me doesn't have the depth of the others, and often just comes across as a stereotypical shrewish wife. Apart from that, it's difficult to fault 'American Beauty'. A recent second viewing on DVD was just as enjoyable and impressive as my first viewing on its original cinema release.

Kinds of make you appreciate what you have.,"This is one heck of a drama starring Kevin Spacey and Annette Benning as Lester and Carolyn Burnham, who lives in a nice house surrounded by a white-picket fence in an upscale neighborhood. But, in reality, Lester is having depression as he despises his job, quarrels with his wife, and has a daughter, Jane (Thora Birch), who can't stand him.This film deeply highlights the negative effects of a broken-down and uncommunicative family in America, from Lester having an infatuation with Jane's friend, Angela (Mena Suvari), to Carolyn getting more obnoxious and distant toward Lester. Jane also developing a friendship with a shy neighbor Ricky (Wes Bentley), who lives with an abusive father, adds onto the chaos. All these course-of-events and the resulting consequences are depicted here, sometimes making your mind numb and making your jaw drop. The plot is full of tension and dark, dramatic moments from start to finish, and you'll also get some chuckles from its sarcastic and witty humor.I thought, though, that many of the dialog is delivered very pretentiously or in a phony way, especially that of Lester and Jane. I guess that's how we get to sense their artificial chemistry and their relationship is really a front.It's definitely not a film for the entire audience to see, as there are much adult themes such as language, sexual references, drug scenes and violence. Almost every bit of thing that makes a film rated R is contained in this movie and, sometimes, the film penetrates your thought so deeply you are left feeling depressed at seeing some of the worse in humanity and how insane or psychotic some minds of people can get.I like the film for its suspense and cinematography, but I also feel disgusted at the over-the-top psychotic and immoral portrayal of the characters in this movie.

"8.7/10 - Creative, captivating and Meaningful","God, this film has so much more impact when you get what's the meaning behind all the motives and that kind of stuff. I mean, sure, first time watching it I had a generally good time, but the second time was so much better. Absolutely love that.American Beauty is a 1999 film by Sam Mendes (the guy who did 1917), and it follows an american family (in more than the one, obvious way) that has some big issues, both with themselves and with each other. The main focus of this film though, I'd say, is Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey), the father of that family, that feels trapped in a sedated state, living on auto-pilot and keeping his head low. But one day he feels this immense, powerful attraction to his daughter's best friend, Angela Hayes (Mena Suvery), and goes through a huge mental shift.Like I said, I did enjoy the film the first time - the plot is interesting, the cinematography felt somewhat unique at certain points, the soundtrack is quite solid. But I couldn't help but feel that I missed something (not to spoil anything, but it's related to the color red as a motif and certain analogies between the characters), and so I did my research and watched this film again. And oh boy, it made it so much better.The cinematography is actually brilliant. There are a lot of subtle techniques used there that I totally adored - the way that this film shows the family members apart, even when they're all in the same room, to emphasize the isolation. The way that Mendes often filmed scenes in a manner that made characters look trapped.And above all of that, the message, the ideas here, were truly fascinating to me. It all felt fresh and unique, and was presented in quite an ingenius way. I like that statements the film makes about the American society, the world's chase after beauty and material, the meaning of life. And yeah, I know that it sounds like rubbish, but I guarantee you that American Beauty has interesting takes on all of the above, and it's totally worth checking out.My problems with this film are mostly about the characters - especially Jane, Angela and Ricky. I do think that they're good and generally well written - well, for the purpose of the film - but it feels like certain lines and exchanges could've been more well written when it's about those three. Again, they all do fit into the film's general idea and message, and they all do a great job in that, but I felt that at times their dialogue was just a little weak, that's all.But yet, to sum it all up, I'd say that I really enjoy this film, both plot-wise and much much more now when I feel like I see the full picture. It's a captivating, brilliant and creative piece of cinema, that could've maybe been more sharp at certain points but overall feels quite ingenius.

A holocaust; a black plague. An experience that chews at the thin fabric of sanity like a sanity-eating rat until we're left wrapped into a fetal position on the theater floor, hugging the cool concrete for comfort in a pool of our blood and vomit, our skin bathed in cold sweat; our muscles twitching.

For a fine example of this check out 1997's film ""Happiness,"" that though disturbing, sheds away from Beauty's gratuitous excess.Years from now, people will wonder what all of this film's hype was about as it will not stand the test of time.",1.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Good, but not great, statement on modern America","American Beauty had such a massive impact on popular art-cinema that at times it seems a bit of a cliché. It has the weird depressed artistic kid, the self-help infatuated business people, the hyper-sexualised blonde girl, the emasculated dad, the evil corporate boss, and the repressed homophobic military man. Yet, I think the feeling of cliché that can affect the viewer of this movie is mostly the result of the influence it had on how the disaffection of modern American culture was portrayed in the television shows and movies that followed rather than due to an inherent flaw in the movie.This is a movie about the meaninglessness of modern American life. It shows the breakdown of the family unit, where all family members are against each other in a domestic cold-war. Individuals working in companies are treated without respect and do not feel any purpose and hence motivation to perform their job well. Those that do feel passion for their work do so out of a lack of true self-esteem and embrace a self-help, Tony Robbins type culture that comes across as extremely odious to those that see through the mask of professionalism. Youth are depressed and disconnected from their parents; those that have a more creative streak are out casted by materialistis in the school system and readily engage in devious behaviour. Old school Americans feel lost in a system that no longer respects toughness and stoicism but are unable to embrace the emotional and sexual liberalism of the modern world.American Beauty attempts to capture the malaise of modern America and provides somewhat extreme versions of the different manifestations that this takes. Watching this movie I was struck by the fact that every character in this movie was white and middle-class. In this sense, American Beauty is limited by the fact that it is a presentation of the ills only affecting a small and privileged group within a wealthy, developed country. This fact could be viewed as reflecting the fundamental immaturity of the individuals portrayed as they are not able to enjoy their privilege. On the other hand, suffering is always subjective, and all humans face pain in their own way, framed by the circumstances that shape their lives. It therefore displays the confusion and absurdity of a very specific social class, but does not act as a more robust statement on humanity as a whole.One key point in American Beauty is the role of sexuality. Individuals are shown to seek refuge from their lives through sex: both fantasy and real. The movie displays the futility of this approach. The fantasy either will not meet our expectations, or will die off into another form of boredom or pain. There is no real redemptive quality to this message: no one seems to transcend it or come to terms with the reality of it. Lester Burnham, played by Kevin Spacey, seems to encounter this head-on later in the movie, but this experience hardly plays an important role in the development of his life or character nor of the movie.The weakness of the movie lays in its beginning and conclusion, which both involve Lester speaking of his past life as if in some kind of afterlife. This is the narrative technique used, but is not properly incorporated into the rest of the movie or explained. Possibly the movie was saying that the foolishness of life is only fully seen by those that have ceased living, or that there is some kind of religious meaning to all the suffering that plays out in human life. However, it has the feeling of something tacked onto the movie without much reflection on what it is meant to portray.Finally, the bleakness of the message is made viewer friendly due to the fine work of the director, Sam Mendes. It is shot in a soft, playful and stylistically lush way. The colours are bright and the movie is upbeat. All of this led to the huge popularity of this movie as while presenting a harsh message, American Beauty is an enjoyable, playful and humorous film.This review is taken from www.amateurreviewspace.blogspot.com",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
A Well Crafted Portrayal Of The Death Of The American Dream,"This film is, without doubt, one of the greatest cinematic masterpieces ever made!  It's singular troubling element is that various sectors of the American public, divided strictly along age lines, will either love or hate this film for all the 'right' reasons. And therein, lies it's greatness, for truth has many facets""American Beauty"" tells the story of one American family (the Burnhams) who have achieved the great 'American Dream'; the one that grew from myth to reality at the end of World War Two. This atypical couple have achieved the sprawling suburban home with picture perfect lawn and two car garage (along with expensive vehicles to fill it). The trouble is, all of this material wealth is supported by mentally and physically consuming jobs that each has come to hate in their own way. They have little if any time for family or each other, and have become strangers within their own homes: both to themselves and their offspring.Then one day, Lester Burnham (played flawlessly by Kevin Spacey) says,- stop the world, I want to get off.  And trust me, you will enjoy the unique manner in which he accomplishes this task. The problem is his spouse, Carolyn Burnham (in a brilliant portrayal by Annette Bening) does not want to get off, and therein lies the heart of the conflict that will ultimately destroy their imperfect union and lead to the death of one.This film touches quite deftly upon so many of the key elements of the present 'American Social Nightmare'(including latent homosexuality and pedophilia, male menopause, pornography and drug usage -just to name a few), that it is difficult to find fault with it at any stage. How is it possible to argue effectively with the truth?Look for great acting by all, including newcomer Wes Bentley as Ricky Fitts and veteran actor Chris Cooper as his father, Colonel Frank Fitts.  Nor should one overlook the great teenage ""Lolita"" portrayal by up and coming actress Mena Suvari.Each scene is a snapshot, yet the film flows so evenly that you become more than just an observer - you are there as a participant.  And that, indeed, is the very essence of great film making.  This film well deserves all of the accolades it has received and much more.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

"Great movie, great depiction of life in 2 hours","I watched the masterpiece, which I had watched in the cinema when it was first released in 2000, for the second time on Netflix. The film is in the black comedy drama category, and it tells the story of
middle-aged American family members so beautifully that I am sure that all viewers will find one or two empathetic events. The plot of the film is so beautiful and fluid that it has processed the obsessions,
angers and disappointments of all the characters in 2 hours so magnificently that you can match each of them with your observation and experience and say 'wow'. While processing the family psycho-drama, the fact that the obsessive colonel, who wears a
disciplinary shield, takes his shame revenge from the main character Lester (Kevin Spacey) when he cannot find a response to his instinctive homosexual action is presented as a wonderful cinematography. Personally, the fact that I am 42 years old like the main character Lester in the film also encouraged me to examine the character of Lester more deeply while watching the film. The film received the Oscar for best director and actor it nominated in 2000. Additionally, if the Oscar for best actress had been given to more than one actress, Annette Bening, Mena Suvari and Thora Birch would have deserved it more. Besides two teenage girls, Jane's (Thora Binch) mother Carolyn (Annette Bening) is the main character who is unaware of herself, cannot cope with the dynamics in their life and finds escape in entrusting herself to a sneaky colleague as a partner. Although the film deals with midlife crises, there are things that every age group can take away from this film. It can be very enjoyable
for those who watch it again and embark on a new journey in the same land. Enjoy the movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

They were trying too hard, and that refers sometimes even to that bunch of good actors, too, who haven't really been able to save some too unreal moments in the script. It has some good ideas and scenes, but they sink in the pretentious, leveling dullness. In fact, besides their particular dramas, all characters are more or less alike (frustrated), and the fancy obsession with recognizing beauty in everyday life (to clean a bit the sad story) was not that convincing.

The film analyzes dysfunctional families and through color and lighting important symbols are revealed throughout the film,"Sam Mendes creates a film of beauty incorporating several issues of dysfunctional families using creative symbols through color and lighting throughout the film. Every time I watch this film I enjoy it more and more, although it does leave you with a sour taste in your mouth in the conclusion of the film. In my eyes this film deserved the awards that Medes received because it is like none other. The film emphasizes how the behavior of individuals, especially within dysfunctional families can lead to disturbing and harmful behaviors given the proper situation. The color, lighting, and different angles through the film make it unique and one of a kind.Kevin Spacy does an exquisite job playing the character of Lester Burnham; a middle aged man who questions the way he has been living his life and has had enough of being treated like he doesn't exist by his wife and daughter. Lester is the main character in the film and he is going through a mid-life crisis through the majority of the film.Carolyn Burnham, is a character played by Annette Bening, is Lester's wife in the film and lives for success and material things. Her idea of a family is being seen as picture perfect among others.Thora Burch plays the character of Jane who Carolyn and Lester's daughter. Like a normal teenager she is often misunderstood by her parents. Her best friend is Angela, which is played by Mena Savari; an aspiring model, whom likes the attention from boys and men. Jane falls in love with Ricky (Wes Bentley), the boy next door who is also misunderstood by his parents and others. I really did not like the long recordings that Ricky did throughout the film, although the recordings were definitely necessary in regards to what he saw as beautiful, I did not think that they needed to be so long and occur so frequently throughout the film.The film puts a twist on the meaning of beauty and death through symbolic messages, such as the color of red. Red roses and a red door are only two of the many symbolic messages that are displayed in the film. There were several images that could be disturbing to some, but all in all Sam Mendes had a great message to viewers. The theme can be defined by the following; never underestimate the power of revenge, enjoy the simple things in life; because they are beautiful, and live your life to the fullest because you never know when it may end.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Everyone should see this movie,"I believe that everyone should see this movie.  Aside from the fact that the acting borders on phenomenal and the fact that the cinematography and script were masterpieces in themselves, the THEME of this movie should be witnessed by all.I have read many reviews that talk about how this movie is trying to express how complete devotion to our jobs and material goods leaves us empty and worthless as human beings.  I have also read reviews that claim this movie tells us what happened to our good old American family values.  And while these claims are completely accurate, they are still only part of the deeper message presented in this film.  I know that the title is ""American Beauty,"" but I believe that it is only being used as a symbol, like everything else in the movie.  Yes, America is know worldwide for its excesses in all forms, so it is a good example of a trend that plagues humanity as a whole.See, the emphasis of this movie is on beauty.  Not beauty as we normally think of it, but beauty as all that should be admired and respected and loved in the world.  ""American beauty"" represents what we are TAUGHT to perceive as beautiful.  A nice car, a supermodel, and so on.  The message I got from this movie is that nature is beautiful, and by nature I mean everything in this world in its natural state.  Humans are beautiful when they are honest, but not when they try to fit the molds our societies make for us.  This is so well expressed in one scene in the movie when Ricky is asked why he is filming a dead bird and he replies, ""Because it's beautiful.""Ricky later shows us the most beautiful thing he ever filmed: a plastic bag being blown by the wind.  The symbolism here is magnificent!  The plastic bag, as a representative of man made culture, being completely controlled and driven by pure nature.  This movie doesn't condemn our society and point fingers at the causes of our unhappiness.  Instead it gives us hope and direction toward a better path that we left a long long time ago.  Don't let anyone tell you that this isn't a happy movie, for it is full of hope. And more importantly, it is full of beauty.  See this movie, and more importantly, THINK about this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Without Spacey's dazzling performance, it would just be another pretentious and amateur glorified independent film","Almost eight years since first seeing it, I still cannot fathom why everyone was so smitten with American Beauty. There is practically nothing about it that seems relevant as to why it won a smouldering amount of critical acclaim then, and still has yet to show me why it will stand the test of time as the years go on. Instead, it still is just frighteningly average.Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) is in a downward spiral. After years of living the good life, he has hit his midlife crisis. His wife, Carolyn (Annette Bening), is straying away from him and is stuck in her own rut of depression, and his daughter Jane (Thora Birch) just seems to loathe his very existence. But after a new family moves in next door, and Lester meets Jane's gorgeous best friend Angela (Mena Suvari), he begins to turn his life around.The plot description really does no justice for what little good there is in the film, but it does say what is wrong with it. It is just plain uninteresting and far from blazingly original. Breaking the film right down to its plainest terms, makes it just another story about redemption. Spacey's Lester just wants to be redeemed for everything that has happened and brought him to this moment in his life, and spends the whole movie seeking that one true thing. It never bothers lingering on what was wrong in the first place, and it never makes us truly understand why he needs to make such a radical change in his life, and rip up the family unit even more so on his way doing it. Much of what Lester does is not darkly comedic, satiric or even dramatic. It comes off instead as awkward and disturbing. There is a fine line to walk between both, but this film cannot do it. Instead, it falls flat on its face right from the start, and barely ever recovers.First time director Sam Mendes and screenwriter Alan Ball set out to craft the perfect take on dystopic suburbia, but really are only half baking the whole thing. What some may have taken to be perfection at its very core is strictly pretentious. There is a lot of attention given to the vivid colours in the film (used obviously to show certain emotions), but the film's underlying messages are far too mixed for any of them to actually matter. The long, straying shots only help add to the confusion that sets in rather rapidly, and its attempts at genuinely effecting moments do nothing for it. It struck me most often as an homage to ideas from the past and present, but nothing more than that. The work done here is amateur at best, and bites off more than it could ever chew. Some of the dialogue is indeed very clever, but the majority either comes off as useless or just a sheer attempt at being powerful. It only drags the movie out even further. And do not even get me started on that silly plastic bag.But while the filmmakers and the film itself meanders a bit too often, Spacey is actually quite uncompromising in his performance. He has yet to do anything since (Se7en and The Usual Suspects notwithstanding) that even remotely compares to it (unless you count his wonderfully narcissistic and deliciously evil take on Lex Luthor in Superman Returns), and I doubt he ever will. Spacey paints Lester as a closeted basket case beautifully, and at times, rises well above the screenplay and the film's limitations. He has just the right amount of dry wit and dramatic tendencies to pull off such a brilliantly written character. His voiceovers, as ridiculously pretentious as they slowly become, are reassuring and at times, poetic. His zany performance is calculating and brilliant. Never once do we as the audience see an actor, we see a man whose life is slowly deteriorating all around him. The only problem is, he outshines everyone around him, and manages to completely spell out how Ball managed to completely sidestep writing anyone else nearly as good (or just left them to the audience's own enigmatic devices). All of the other actors do as best as they can to overcome this hindering, but Spacey's presence is felt throughout, and all of the actors show it in their performances whether he is on-screen or not. They may as well have been mimes.I digress however. The film is nice on the eyes, especially when not in the dark or through the lens of a worthless videocamera disguised as a unique plot device. The score is also fairly well done. And the comeback story that takes place always makes for a rather enchanting picture (albeit one that has been told far too many times).But American Beauty's pretentious over and undertones drag it down into just being merely watchable, if only to witness Spacey chew up and spit out every last ounce of scenery and character moments. He never lets up once, and singlehandedly does the film some form of justice. There is nothing to look closer at. It is just another overpraised film that seemed relevant at the time, but has slowly began to die off since. I wish it was only Spacey's performance that won awards instead of the entire movie. It did not deserve any of its accolaids.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

"Important movie, but it's still trash","I respect the significance of a film like American Beauty, but when people start babbling on about getting great deep things from it, it really gets my back up.  For the uninitiated, American Beauty is another one of those ""let's blow the cover off middle-class suburbia and expose the yuppies for the disturbed, demented, unhappy, pathetic losers they truly are"" movies, sort of like ""The Graduate"" for our times.  In fact, the filmmakers are guilty of the same sort of hypocrisy they profess to satirize.I always have a big problem when filmmakers set out to expose middle-class life, then depict every single character as a neurotic or an aspiring nutcase.  The truth is, American Beauty is no more an accurate depiction of suburbia than ""Father Knows Best"".  If you were to show suburbia as it truly is, you have to show the characters as so empty and so mind-numbingly boring the audience would either walk out or fall asleep. But then again, isn't that the reason suburbanites flock to the movies in the first place, to escape their private humdrum?I won't rehash the whole movie, but on the finer points:  since the story is told from the point of view of Kevin Spacey's character, everything he does is presented as heroic; when he shrewdly scams his corrupt employer for 60 grand then spends it on a hot car, or leaves his dull office job to work at Burger King (because he likes it), we're supposed to cheer him on, as we would a rebellious teenager.  Which is fine, except this guy has a home and a family and a mortgage, and he's neglecting all of them. Selfishness is cool.  Then when he gets a chance at sex with the high school kid he idolizes (that's rape, by the way), he thinks better of it and refrains.  This is supposed to be Spacey Doing The Right Thing.  It is not. It is Spacey Not Doing The Wrong Thing (if I refrain from committing murder, can I get the key to the city?).  Annette Bening's character is presented is bad because she's materialistic and a shrew.  When she and Spacey attempt to make love on a sofa, she frets because he might spill his can of beer on it and ruin the upholstery; this puts the ki-bosh on he whole affair.  But isn't a lot of what she stands for just simple adult responsibility (disguised by the filmmakers as kooky fanaticism).  Neither of them are good parents to their daughter; Spacey doesn't care, Bening only postures at caring, but at least she puts an effort into posturing.There are so many ways to pick this movie apart, because it touches people on so many levels, but what are the filmmakers trying to say?  It seems like they're espousing the old Timothy Leary mantra of tune in, turn on and drop out.  Just start a little Haight-Ashbury behind your own picket fence and everything will be all right.  The irony about their idea of ""exposure"" is that audiences aren't embarrassed by it; that is, they don't feel ""fingered"", as it were.  Instead, they respond in the most positive ways; they relate to the characters or they'll say ""I know someone who's just like that"" (even I know someone who's a lot like the gay Marine colonel) .  Maybe one day someone will come along and expose the filmmakers, these so-called truth-tellers as the stupid shallow cretins THEY are.  I would guess that they consider teens and young adults as its target audience, because only someone who hasn't lived would be a sucker for this trash.  American Beauty is a trashy movie, reeking of pot smoke and glorified rape fantasies.  2** out of 4",,Anonymous,Drama

A disturbing abstraction,"This is art that presents a stark and disturbing image. It is most definitely not a film for the average audience and those who pan this film all say more or less the same thing, which when translated into the absolute basics is that they didn't get it. There's no reason why they should. This film is not for them.For those of us who have had to deal with extreme relationships and who have had to deal with blind, angry, people whose existence is intractably anchored to things that are ultimately meaningless, this film most definitely strikes home. The challenge is to be able to extract yourself from such dysfunctional people before you yourself are destroyed by it. Spacey's character is that person - destroyed by the soullessness but with a tiny, if perverse, ray of hope.Some get this film. Other do not. It's up to the viewer. My rating is not based on the notion that it makes me happy or fulfilled, or anything like this. I rate the film on what it is, what it does, and how successful it is at doing it.

Middle America in a frame,"Few people will be able to completely uproot their lives and begin it again, but that Lester Burnham's journey in American Beauty: he wipes his hands clean of his pitifully ordinary life and lives life how he wants with his own goals. And to see it is thrilling.Of course there's a little more to it than a hasty decision to turn it around. Several factors converge in this extraordinarily tight drama: Lester discovers his daughter's friend Angela, a 90s Lolita. He also finds his bland job to be on wobbly ground, and lastly he gets new neighbours, a military family with a strange boy, Ricky. These together create a change in the meek Lester and create a magnificent film.The real question I had after seeing this film was: ""What's wrong with American Beauty?"" and then I couldn't answer my question. I'll start with the most well- known aspect of the film, its acting. The entire cast is sharp as their respective characters. Led by Kevin Spacey as Lester, original Yes Man (""I rule!""), you will find something relateable in at least one of the characters, good or bad. Their personalities and actions are entertaining, their motives are all there, and if a character is intended to be likable, you will like them. It's just as a good film should be: honest and unforced, but with just an edge to help you in the right direction.I've briefly mentioned how tight American Beauty is. The plot is wonderfully self contained but also organic, it feels very plausible. There's a reason things happened as they did when they did. I can't find any plot holes. Much credit has to be given to the script and writers, and bonus points for being an original idea when so many excellent dramas have ""Based on"" in their credits.But more than characters, plot and script, American Beauty is also visually wonderful. While much of it is observed as life is, Lester's fantasies have a brilliantly symbolic and colourful side making them stand out as more than dreams. This leads to the deeper aspects of the film, such as recurring symbols, numerous metaphors (the bag...) and of course the moral.For a film concentrating on failure, I found a very positive message out of the film, and that was to enjoy life and all the beautiful things in it, and to never trap yourself. Like the tag, look closer, find yourself looking past the black and white (into the red?) and see beauty. It all sounds cheesy, but unlike Spacey's later work Pay It Forward, it doesn't come off the screen that way.From a cynic to seizing the day, American Beauty is a dark film with a big smiley face over it that blends until its climax. An engrossing fiction that for many isn't too far from real life, I think this film can speak to people differently as you age, and that power to draw different meanings from different viewings is a sign of a true film. A full film and a fantastic way to close out a millennium. 9.4/10",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
A classic Kevin Spacey hit.,"If you are not a fan of Mr. Kevin Spacey, you will become one. The movie revolves around this one ordinary person, whose life is going to become not so ordinary. A hidden theme which I think movie is trying to give is, the violence and hatred towards homosexuals. Just a classic movie, like none other. The plot of the movie is more beautifully acted than written. Also the low parenting skills are shown here, and how teenagers behave when not given proper guidance. The family comes prior to anything else is beautifully taught. A middle age couple around 40 also needs to have his/her sexual needs satisfied. So couples especially women, do keep that in mind, else don't blame that no one told. The teenagers in the film acted well above the expected maturity.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
A Timeless Masterpiece Disguised As a Simple Satire,"Since the 1980's American movie audience has been inundated with mindless movies in which macho stars blow up dozens of buildings and machine-gun down hundreds of villains and their underlings.  However, I am glad to see that both critics and movie audience understood and greatly appreciated `American Beauty,' a recent movie which deeply explored the meaning of reality using methods employed by cinematic giants like Federico Fellini and Akira Kurosawa.""American Beauty"" innocently and rather deceptively starts with a satirical portrayal of an ""average"" American family (with commonplace problems like the parents' mid-life career frustrations and uneasy relationship with the rebellious teen-age daughter).  However, soon after the movie begins, the viewer is faced with a foreshadowing and suspense of an impending disaster. As the movie progresses, the ""average"" family deteriorates into drug use, adultery and murder conspiracy, and the viewer begins to realize that the problem posed by this movie is not confined to the predicaments experienced by this ""average"" family.  The real problem is with the fundamental flaw in the modern American value system--its social convention, morality and what is expected of an average member of the society.  Moreover, through the use of Fellinesque fantasy sequences, rich use of cinematic symbolism and cinematic warping of time and space, this movie even questions our perception of reality.  That is to say, the movie shows us alternative ways of perceiving reality and confronts us with the fact that reality (or the perception of reality) is wholly subservient to our psyche.""American Beauty"" is a rightful descendant of masterpieces like Kurosawa's `Rashomon' and Fellini's `8 ½,' which redefined the meaning of reality. This movie is a timeless masterpiece, and the critical and public acclaim showered on this movie is well-deserved.",,Anonymous,Drama
Every single frame is adorable!,"Believe me, I've seen a lot of movies (each year a try to watch about 200 films I have not seen before), but American Beauty surpasses everything. It's the best picture I've ever seen. I never before focused on one single film as my favorite (there were always about 1,000 fav films), but with American Beauty it is different. It's just perfect, brilliant, marvelous, divine. Every single frame is adorable - and yet, it's so simple - there is no need for hoards of extras, for elaborate sets or meaningful events in the course of the story. Just a few strange people, people just like us. This film features some of the best acting performances ever to be seen on screen, esp. Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Wes Bentley & beautiful Thora Birch. Witty & intelligent dialogue that's rare in today's cinema, and the structure of Alan Ball's script is just perfect - the best plot narration I can imagine. Marvellous cinematography - one of the rare pictures in current cinema that denies fast-paced camera moves, but instead just sits there in static images that tell you so much more than every camera move ever could. I'd like to say more about that film, but my breath is still taken from watching it the fifth time last night. Besides, I fail further words that could describe it. It's just masterly accomplished regarding any aesthetics, the contents, the acting, the photography, the editing, the story, the art in itself...A grateful bow to first-timer Sam Mendes and his crew.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Possibly the most overrated movie of all time,"I enjoyed the sequence at the drive-thru. I also thought Scott Bakula's small performance was pretty good. Outside of that, this was my most painful experience in a theater since ""Club Paradise.""What was this movie trying to say? Marriage is a bad, arcane, suffocating institution? Adultery, pedophilia and drugs are good and liberating? All Marines are bigoted psychotics who abuse their wives and children, and are all of course closeted homosexuals? Perhaps that is what they think in Hollywood.I was watching this movie with my girlfriend. Towards the end of this interminable nightmare I walked out. I walked back in when she didn't follow. After the movie, I told her that this movie was so critical of every good and decent aspect of American life, that it was a shoo-in for Best Picture. This movie does not entertain, it does not make one think, it just aggravated me. I had never wanted my money back so bad.",1.0,Anonymous,Drama
A hilarious yet relatable drama about inner-beauty.,"To start this off, I truly believe it is a 10/10 movie--it's my favorite movie of 1999 (the year it was made) and my favorite movie of all time. My review will not be biased, so please continue reading.The plot: a man in his early 40s (played by the amazing Kevin Spacey) is possibly the most average man of his age that you could think of; he lives in a suburban house with his wife and teenage daughter, to whom, do not care much for him nearly as much as they used to. Lester Burnham, the 42-year-old main character, works as a sales agent, where he has worked for the past 15 years. Lester is simply tired and bored of his life, and wants more--he wants a wife who is willing to please him sexually, a daughter that loves him, and a job that's flourishing with excitement and overall, much different from the one he has now. His wife is a real-estate agent who seems to care more for her competitor, the Real Estate King, more than him. After going to his daughter Janie's cheerleading event, he spots her friend--Angela Hayes- -the girl who is exactly what Lester needs in his life; he falls in love once again, this time to a teenage girl who claims to be a sex-crazed person with aspirations of being a model. In hopes of revving his inner-self, he develops an obsession for the girl.Okay...so why is this so good? Well, first of all, Lester Burnham's words are like poetry--his monologues emphasize how you must get the best of life before it's over--after all, it could abruptly end tomorrow--it doesn't matter when you read this, the sad truth is that you could die whenever. The atmosphere in the film is marvelous; it shows how everyone has their strengths and their inner-weaknesses; it also depicted just what makes a person happy, and how that affects everyone else around them. It really is a gem of a film, both inspiring the audience whenever possible, and allowing them to laugh at the relatable truth about life and human-beings.I'm not telling you to go watch it--but you should. Even if it doesn't change your life forever, you'd honestly be entertained for the entire 2-hour movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

American Beauty is a pure masterpiece.,"American Beauty-****-A Masterpiece- Directed by: Sam Mendes, Written by: Alan Ball Starring: Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Chris Cooper, Allison Janney, Peter Gallagher, Mena Suvari, Wes Bentley.Sam Mendes' first feature presents an affectionate and satirical look at American life in the suburbs centering around a dysfunctional family trying to find the meaning of life amongst all the chaos of their lives. Spacey is trying to relive his teenage years which leads him into domestic, professional, sexual, and financial difficulty. Bening is his uptight wife and looks for sex from other extramarital sources. Birch is their teenage daughter who is attracted with a kid next door obsessed with his video camera and whose family troubles involve psychological disorder and sexual repression.Mendes develops characters for his satire, not caricatures and keeps the perception of society reasonable and believable. The characters are certainly not role models, but they are likable. Spacey, our protagonist, is sexually attached to a teenage girl, quits his job, and smokes pot. What's heroic or likable about those qualities? That is where Mendes (along with Ball)'s genius comes into play. The members of society we normally look down upon are the film's heroes, mostly it is because they are the normal characters of today's society.That is the piercing honesty that makes this film so acidic in its delivery. Cooper's character, a homophobic marine, a man society would most likely look up to is the film's antagonist. This reflects cultural shifts and the irony of the proposed American lifestyle over the true perception we have over our lives. That is the poison this film holds to our heads and refuses to let go until it forces an honest reaction over all the programmed reactions we force ourselves to have for the sake of being well-liked and appreciated in our communities.The romance between Birch and Bentley is the only relationship in the film that is driven out of love and not sex or status. Bentley's character is the most ironic point Mendes makes within the film because he appears the weirdest and most perverted but he turns out the most honest and beautiful. This further emphasizes Mendes' point that life is different from the outside looking in rather than the inside looking out.Mendes changes the way we look at each other and the way we look at ourselves. He questions appearances and frames of mind, much like Todd Solondz's Happiness. Though that film's mastery is evident, this is the most connectible American drama/satire released in years.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
a spectacularly entertaining and thought provoking achievement,"Often when reading or hearing other people's reviews or comments about some film I wonder if we've watched the same film at all. This especially applies to this film.This film - again - is about liberation from cowardice, social roles, self-denial people so often put themselves in. The sadness and humorous irrationality of the character's lives alternate constantly. Brilliant satirical comments and the tragedy of existence are always present in this fine film. The transformation of somnambulent, internally dying, fed up Lester (Kevin Spacey, who is awesome, superb in every scene) is very similar to Fight Club's Jack's transformation to non-conformist, socially liberated and confident Tyler Durden. Though Fight Club is even better film than this.Lester hates his work, he hates the circumstances and interactions he finds himself in, he feels beaten to the ground without getting up, at least not without help.  After feeling comatose and humiliated for some time, the beautiful teen age vixen Angela (Mena Suvari, great role) triggers some change in his sexually deprived monotonous life. He starts fantasizing of her submerged into corny surroundings with red flowers. Angela's comments to Jane about her father's lacking muscles prompt him to become an addict of weight lifting. Which together with his re-acquired habit of smoking weed from his new neighbor Ricky Fitts (impressive Wes Bentley) rejuvenate him. He starts feeling alive - confident and good about himself. Prepared to improve his life. He believes he is not such 'a colossal loser' after all.The wife Carolyn (wonderfully hysterical Anette Bening) and the daugther Jane (beautiful Thora Birch) are confused about Lester's sudden change. They are all alienated from each other. Carolyn resents Lester's sudden irresponsibility and tries to fill her life with goods and material success. As long as the facade is fine and her material situation good, all is well. She has succumbed to superficial pretentiousness and has reduced herself to a caricature, whose main goals are to maintain the facade of a happy family, success in her work and gaining more materia. She is an impostor.Voyeurist Ricky films everything he can with his camera so not to forget the transient, ephemeral nature of things. He wants to remember the beauty of a particular moment - be it death of a bird or a leaf in the wind. There's a lot of zen in some of his comments, he he has learned to see beyond the appearance - beyond the facade. His own tragic existence according to structure and the rules his father colonel Fitts (Chris Cooper) has laid down for him has pushed him to value the unique beauty of various phenomena. Colonel Fitts has beaten his family into submission - his wife is lethargic, but Ricky still hustles and attempts to find something meaningful. He understands life as an ephemeral experience that has to be seized fully and passes his attitude to Jane & Lester.Eventually the film is about the fragility of life - death can come arbitrarily and unexpectedly- through no mistake of yours or via just a misunderstanding. You live only once and there's lots of potential beauty you miss when living the daily routine consists of chasing the things you don't really need. Or even if you need, it takes courage to wonder at things and it takes a lot courage to let go and be free - to be honest to yourself and happy.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Review of ""American Beauty""","What to say about ""American Beauty""? Hmmm. I have never seen a movie that cogently blends together elements of a pragmatic social satire and a poignant domestic tragedy. Though, this is by far one of the most messed up films I have ever seen. . .it is also one of the best. Kevin Spacey gives one of his most memorable performances with his Academy Award Winning Turn as Lester Burnham - a character that is definitely flawed, but you just can't help but like him. Another aspect of the film I admired was the soundtrack. Thomas Newman really succeeds in creating a provocative, yet beautiful score that adequately complements the movie's overall tone. In the end, I feel that ""American Beauty"" is a movie that most people can and will enjoy.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
lethargic and uninspiring,"First off, let me say that I thought Kevin Spacey's performance was outstanding.  He has the talent to take an otherwise unambitious script and make it gracefully well directed.The movie as a whole, though, is generally uninspiring despite its forced over message to the contrary.  Yes, the simple pleasures of life are what bring us peace, joy, and contentment, but come on people--there's more to it than a paper bag blowing in the wind or buying your dream car.  While the movie tries to convey to the audience the need of living life to its fullest, it seems to reject the most important need to all of us--each other.  From the start of the film we see the family members diving head first into the depths of despair because of their hatred for one another. They then attempt to reconcile their depression and hopelessness by means that are merely self-serving.  In the end, that could never lead to true happiness.The film is not a fair portrayal of typical American suburbia, and perhaps that was not its intent.

I was young.,"Age 16, this was one of my first experiences of cinematic depth containing such emotion and meaning that I could share with no one I personally knew. I remember choosing this movie to go see with my high school girlfriend and her cousin. I can say without a doubt that this movie had a direct influence on a good bit of my life, some good, some bad (though it was common sense relatable to most and to my acknowledgment, went to my head, but as I said, I was young and an idealist...still am in the heart.)I don't know what exactly went on with Spacey these past years what exactly what he did but his performance in this film and some others as well made him one of my favorite actors of all time. Wes Bently as the next-door teenaged neighbor was good as well and I thought it looked promising that he would have a pretty big career but that was a misfire on my end. Anyway, all performances were pretty stellar and some were very surprisingly comedic, with a very intellectual screenplay by Alan Ball, along with some daring and bold direction from Sam Mendes, American Beauty is, well, I will put it this way...When someone asks me what my true favorites are, I think of maybe 4, 5 right away and then instantly after that, American Beauty is where my heart, mind, and feeling instinctive, without choice, go to.Oh yeah, I thought the bag scene was really heartfelt and meaningful and **there is just a hands down great topless shot of Thora Birch (Who knew?!)

You have got to be kidding?!? People paid to see this?,"The bigger question is, who paid to produce this garbage? Kevin Spacey, what were you thinking? Did they really pay you enough to sacrifice your soul? Although, being moral is a goal sought after by too few today. A movie doesn't have to be 'snow white', so to speak, to be a good movie. Put some of the sick and twisted at the top of my list of favorite movies-Clerks and Four Rooms for example. My reaction is not prudish. This movie made me ill at the first scene, and more so as soon as the premise was established. My biggest fear is that the vast public acceptance of this trash will lead down the slippery slope into even more disgusting and presently taboo subject matter in an attempt to normalize immoral, unethical, illegal behaviors, and dress it up as movie 'art'.

Thought-provoking movie about our lives with great performances.,"I just saw this movie with my mom and sister. I know it had a lot of things in it that would probably make you feel stupid when watching it with your mom but I didn't feel that embarassed. I wanted to watch a movie about real life with my mom so we could have something more interesting to talk about and I thought this would do it. It did. This movie tells the very truth that, I think, most people block out of there minds. Life is full of problems and we all have them. Even if they are differant than other people's problems, they still affect us all in the same way. I would give the movie an A just for that message. Also, most people on this Earth are too preoccupied with their life because they think they have it so bad, that they never stop to look at what they've got. If they were to look and see the many beautiful things in life just once, they'd see that their life is great for that reason alone. Well about the movie, it's great. I think it's the best movie this year so far. The performances are undescribable. Everyone does outstanding jobs, but the best by far is, of course, Kevin Spacey as the ever so true Lester Burnham. He does so good at bring the character to life that it's the best performance I've seen in my whole life and the best in movie history. He is your average person who starts to get fed up with his whole life and lives like he should've lived his entire life: doing anything he feels like doing. Even if that means masturbating right in front of his wife. His life being changed sets off the whole mess that messes his family up more than it already was, which was to say, a lot. He smokes weed, works out, listens to his music he used to when he was a wild teen, even falls in love with his sisters friend. More and more he changes, so does his family. Well, you can figure the rest out for yourself, can't you? Go see it. You'll look at life in a whole new way. You'll realize that your not the only one with problems. Even the people who live in a nice house with nice jobs have it bad. I just hope we can all learn that someday. We might not now, but trust me, you will. American Beauty: A+",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Top-notch 90s classic,"'American Beauty' is a film that deals with death. The film is about Lester's final months. Lester doesn't know that he will die. We find this out within the first minute of the film. We know this just from the opening shot of his own daughter asking her boyfriend if he could kill him for her. We know right away that he is a loser, a geek, and a terrible father and husband.The film details the lives of Lester and the people around him. Lester is married to Carolyn, a perfectionist and an emotional woman. Her and Lester hate each other. They are married with a child but they are not in love. Their daughter is Jane, who is spiteful of her parents behavior. Her parents constantly argue and betray each other. Why should she be happy and proud of her parents who aren't particularly supportive of her, though they try to be.During one of their attempts to be involved more with their daughter's cheerleading, Lester falls for one of her friends, Angela, who he then constantly tries to woo and impress. This eventually leads him to change himself into the person he thinks that he wants to be. Meanwhile, the family has new neighbors. Frank, the homophobic father of Ricky, who is in love with Jane and videotapes her through his window. When Ricky becomes friends with Lester, Frank begins to suspect that he is gay.'American Beauty' does something that isn't done enough in American films today. It actually makes us feel for the characters. None of these characters are bad people. Their decisions are bad, but all any of them want is for things to work out for themselves. They are all very good people. They just got too caught up in what they think society wants them to do or doesn't want them to do, though Lester rebels instead. He is sick of how society treats him and how everybody treats him. He goes a different way than he is expected and attempts to become his own person. He lusts after a teenager, despite the fact that he is middle-aged. A lot of middle-aged people secretly do this, however, it's only a serious problem if they act out on their desires. Does Lester do this? It's a difficult question to answer, though I guess, in a sense, he doesn't. But why does he lust after her? Does he lust after her because he is beautiful or because she is a mirror image of what beauty is supposed to apparently look like?Carolyn is an interesting character. She tries incredibly hard to sell a house at her job and berates herself for failing. Is she past the point in which she isn't able to even feel anything anymore? Has she become that numb to her problems? These people are not close and their marriage doesn't mean anything. The only people in the whole movie who are actually happy are their two gay neighbors.Jane wants breast augmentation surgery, but why? Her breasts already look pretty big. Does she think that people will like her if her breasts look fake? If they were any bigger, that's what they would look like. Why does she feel that people wants girls that look fake. She is already lusted after by Ricky. Ricky, at first, appears to be a really strange person. Angela speaks of rumors involving him going to a mental asylum. They may or may not be true, but that's not the point. The point is that he is unashamed of who he is and this makes him an interesting character to compare with all the other characters.His father doesn't seem to realize that his son is on to his mental tricks and that Ricky only tells him what he wants to hear rather than speaking his mind about the issues that he brings up. Frank doesn't really hate homosexuals, but the way he was brought up allows him to think that way. This is especially evident in a surreal scene toward the end.What I haven't mentioned is the sheer intensity of the film and the events leading up to the death of Lester. Indeed, the last thirty minutes of the film remain very suspenseful and revealing. They are full of so many bizarre coincidences and misinterpretations that it's actually quite funny to watch at times. It's a painful final act, but it's also a surprisingly insightful depiction and comment on loneliness and being hopeless in troubles. The last ten minutes are surprisingly honest and unique in that the viewer feels enlightened when, in reality, the things we are told are things we all know but don't realize that we know any of it until we are reminded by a film like this.Do people need to watch films like this? Absolutely. How else are we able to be reminded of what we know about human existence. The things that are brought to light in the final minutes are not things we learn, but rather things we know and pick up on when we are infants and are developing. As babies, we make mistakes and learn from them. We don't remember those mistakes, but we remember what we know.The philosophy behind this film is that a lot of us were brought up to not make mistakes and to learn what the parents and teachers teach in elementary school and in our early years as humans. But in this being done, we are not able to develop into our own people. Instead, we take what we can get, use it, and then grow up having learned nothing except that we should only know certain things. 'American Beauty' is one of the ideal examples of brilliant film-making.",,Anonymous,Drama
Rescued from the ashes by superb acting,"I was not and am not a fan of this movie.  True, it won the ""Best Picture"" Oscar.  Yes, Kevin Spacey gave an excellent performance.  But I think that the movie tries to villify ""normalcy"" to a ludicrous extreme.  It takes what is commonly thought of as the ""American Dream"" and contorts every angle of it, so that what looks ""normal"" from the outside is the opposite, and vice versa.  This may seem a good plot at first, but the movie plays it to the point of ridiculousness.  In fact, the only thing that saves this movie in my opinion are the performances by Kevin Spacey and Annette Benning.

Self-Liberating,"""American Beauty"" is one of my favorite films, for me watching it feels kind of like a pat in the back, like I've found someone who thinks just like me, one of the best feelings there is next to being distracted.Its the story of Lester Burnham, a man who's going to die a year from when we first meet him. He wants to set himself free from everything that's making him feel depressed while also feeling attracted to his daughter's best friend.It's one of the ""self-liberating"" films that came out in 1999, along with ""Fight Club"" and Office Space. A sub-genre I think first started with François Truffaut's ""The 400 Blows"", a film that isn't afraid to speak to its audience and really touch people. ""American Beauty"" is a film that turns to you and asks ""How do you feel?"".Talking about this movie could go on forever, its obvious that movies like ""Lolita"" inspired it apart from others I'm not really sure of like ""Kes"", ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", ""Blue Velvet"", ""Citizen Kane"", and ""The Godfather: Part II"".I hate to mention every single technical aspect of a movie in a review, but this film sort of deserves having everyone who worked on it mentioned. The performances in this are all amazing, no character is left underdeveloped and we leave the film thinking that we actually know these characters, something very hard to find in films (e.g. Dazed and Confused).I can find identify myself very much with the characters, specially Lester (Kevin Spacey) and Ricky Fits (Wes Bentley), and even the others I can understand up to some level. Like Lester's wife, a person who's lost herself to materialism while striving for perfection. Or Lester's daughter, someone who feels lonely and ignored by her parents.The simplicity in the cinematography fits the story perfectly, unlike films like ""Magnolia"" that give a human story the wrong cinematographic approach and make it feel more like a thriller or comedies like ""The Big Lebowski"" that turn away from the comedy and give the film more style over substance. The score and the soundtrack also add a lot to the film, letting us know the state of mind of the characters or enhancing a feeling to the audience.Finally, it's hard not to love the beautiful and poetic script by Alan Ball (my favorite writer after Charlie Kaufman), dealing with themes of death, materialism, and redemption. It's a film that shows the beauty in cinema as an art form, in the way that what the film says couldn't be said as well in any other medium. For example, had it been made as a play, we wouldn't understand the characters as well for the intimacy that cinema gives us would be lost.I'd recommend it to anyone who liked ""The Ice Storm"", ""The Virgin Suicides"", ""Little Children"", ""Lost in America"", ""The Kids are All Right"", ""Donnie Darko"", ""Lost in Translation"", Wes Anderson movies, or any film I mentioned before.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
It isn't like fooling a American audience would be that hard,"First off, the idea of sounding the Death Gong for suburbia had been done perfectly a year earlier by Todd Solondz's ""Happiness"". No one else could improve his ideas. ""Donnie Darko"" had to incorporate Time Travel and a demonic rabbit to take Todd's ideas further.Secondly, all of the characters in ""American Beauty"" are horrible cardboard cut-outs of human beings. And that WASN'T intentional. It was just bad writing. A self-loathing homophobic ex-military character? How is that not a stereotype? Hey, Allen Ball, how long did it take you to come up with that one? Or the career minded mother who has NO redeaming qualities? Mena Suvari's character was the only one with any substance, but she looks like a martian and I can't buy into the idea that Lester is really attacted to her or what she stands for.Thirdly, the heavy hand of the director or author's voice manifests in the character who constantly carries around a CAMERA and NEVER MAKES A MISTAKE. That is a poorly conceived and executed idea. It's like they think their audience is dumb and needs to be spoon fed principles of symbolism. I can picture the process of creating that character. I bet Mr. Ball and Mr. Mendes thought it was a great idea. That's a huge part of the problem.There is a principle in writing called ""Killing Your Baby"". If you have an idea you think is good, the only way you can be sure is if you dismantle the idea. If you can dismantle it, and the idea retains its goodness, then the idea is good. In the dismantling process, you can find the problems in the idea and fix them.Some of the problems with Ricky Fitts are a little obvious, like the fact that he is a dramatic character who is unfaltering and without any tangible conflict. Oooh, he hates his ex-military disciplinarian father. Ooooh. It's just another two-dimensional aspect. A truer conflict would be if he resented the homophobia and disciplinarianism but also loved his father very, very much.If anything, American Beauty shows that you can take a horrible script, give to talented actors, dress it up with slow fades, pans, and tracking shots, top it off with a great soundtrack, and fool millions of Americans into thinking it is a great work of art. Really what you have is a pretentious, heavy handed, and dumbed down soap opera quality flick. At least the title has some irony.btrDave Hendrick",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

As Lester rebels against his hollow existence, his wife Carolyn (Annette Bening) and daughter Jane (Thora Birch) grapple with their own crises of identity and connection.Review:
Few films capture the dissonance between the polished veneer of suburban life and its underbelly of dissatisfaction like American Beauty. The film artfully dissects themes of desire, repression, and the quest for freedom. Kevin Spacey delivers a career-defining performance, balancing humor, pathos, and menace as Lester, whose personal awakening is both liberating and deeply unsettling. Annette Bening is equally compelling as Carolyn, a character whose perfectionist tendencies mask profound insecurity.Cinematographer Conrad L. Hall's use of vibrant, almost dreamlike imagery-such as the iconic red rose petals-heightens the film's surreal quality, emphasizing the gap between fantasy and reality. Thomas Newman's ethereal score further enhances the film's introspective tone, making every moment resonate with unspoken emotion.American Beauty excels in its ensemble cast, with standout performances from Wes Bentley as the enigmatic neighbor Ricky Fitts, and Thora Birch as Jane, whose relationship with Ricky forms the emotional core of the story. Each character's journey intertwines to form a tapestry of existential longing, making the film as profound as it is unsettling.At its heart, American Beauty questions what it means to live authentically. While some elements of the story, particularly Lester's fixation on Angela, are controversial and uncomfortable, they serve to highlight the destructive nature of misplaced desire and societal pressure.Verdict:
A darkly comic, visually stunning, and deeply thought-provoking film, American Beauty is a cinematic masterpiece that remains as relevant today as it was upon its release. It's a film that dares to expose the cracks in the façade of the American Dream, leaving audiences to ponder its truths long after the credits roll.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Beautiful and compelling,"I know this is comment no. 940, but what the hell.American Beauty is in some ways the antithesis of the equally brilliant Fight Club. Both concern men with their best years behind them, stuck in meaningless, middle-class jobs, who embrace extreme behaviour in an attempt to recapture meaning in their lives, with fatal consequences. Fight Club is the more dangerous, more radical and ultimately more nihilistic side of the coin. American Beauty is on safer territory, but its ultimate vision of the beauty of life is more affirmative and uplifting. Both films are masterpieces in their individual ways, but it says something about Hollywood that American Beauty will probably win the Oscar, whereas Fight Club probably won't even be nominated.On top of this, one can only marvel at the performances, at Thomas Newman's wonderful and memorable score, at Conrad Hall's glowing photography, at the poised and profound script, and at Mendes's loving direction, his debt to theatre immediately obvious. The plastic bag sequence had me in tears. If a film leaves me feeling, as Ricky puts it, that God has looked straight at you, then I give it a 10, whatever its flaws. Like Good Will Hunting, this film transcends cinema and touches your life, without ever stirring your cynicism. For that reason alone, American Beauty is a triumph.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Must Watch!,"I had made a mental note to read all the reviews here before I decided to watch, Incase I was wasting my time or anything, but I'm so happy I didn't do that, because this movie had so many twists and turns and was truly a masterpiece from start to finish. Such a good ""coming of age"" film and will absolutely make you sit down and think well after the movie is over.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
This film was terrible!  Overrated and all that good stuff!,"First of all for all the people who said that they didn't like this film i tip my hat to you, because unlike most people you actually saw this film for what it was, a cop out.  I am probably one of the most open minded people and I watched this film with an open mind hoping and praying that it would get better every moment longer that I watched.  And I'll tell you what, it didn't.This man Lester (Kevin Spacey) is going through a midlife crisis, the highpoint of his day is when he wanks off in the shower.  He lives his life in fear of doing what he wants and conforms to be the person his wife Carolyn (Annette Bening) wants him to be.  See she's shagging not her husband but Buddy Kaine the Real-estate King (Peter Gallagher) her business's competition.  Their daughter Jane (Thora Birch) is the average misunderstood child, and her dad fantasizes about her friend Angela (Mena Suvari) so much that Jane says to Rickey (Wes Bentley), their new next door neighbor (he's her age) ""It'd be nice if I was anywhere near as important to him as she is.""  Rickey is your average guy; his hobby is filming things, has lots of groovy high tech equipment, his parent's are a little nutty, and yet he still manages to be a very successful drug dealer. And this my friends is what Hollywood thinks your average middle class suburb is like.I watched the film again to make sure that my inner cynic hadn't missed the point (Like the tag line: I ""looked closer,"" and closer, and closer, and closer)I hadn't missed the point.  First the fantasy scenes were overused and very cliché.  Next I couldn't help but chuckle about half of what Hollywood thought it was like growing up in a middle class suburb.  In fact you could say I found this film almost offending, coming from a middle class suburb myself.  The characters were very unrealistic, maybe this is because everyone was over-acting, maybe... but I highly doubt it.  The only character who had realistic qualities was the daughter Jane, (on Rickey being sent away)""well they can't put you away just for saying weird things,"" one of the only realistic statements in the entire film, but even her character lost that off-hand reality.  The ending was a rushed, sloppy, mess making one after another thing fall creating a over-dramatized tragedy. The ending is predictable and the dialog is unconvincing, despite the fact that the film was sloppy seconds the soundtrack was fairly well written and constructed, but even that couldn't save it.If you haven't seen this film I wouldn't recommend it.",,Anonymous,Drama

Philosophical and Thought Provoking,"American Beauty (1999) is a film about Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey), a suburban father slipping deeper and deeper into depression, struggling to deal with his bitch-on-wheels wife and a daughter that hates him. When he meets his daughter's attractive friend, that sparks a mid life crisis, and he decides to turn his life around. The plot sounds trite when you describe it; A man going through a mid life crisis dealing with family issues, lusting after his daughters sex kitten teenage friend. The characters are all cliché; the midlife crisis dad, his bitch-on-wheels wife, his sassy teenage daughter that hates her parents, the homophobic military man next door, and the promiscuous high school girl. We've all seen those characters in movies before. What amazes me about this film is how they brought all these characters together and produced a philosophical movie that makes you think about society. ""My wife and daughter think I'm this chronic loser."" Lester complains, and they see him like that for good reason. ""Just look at me, jerking off in the shower, that's the high point of my day, it only goes downhill from here"" Lester comments as we see a visual of a body blurred by the glass door of a shower, facing away from camera as his arm moves up and down. When you see his infatuation with his daughters friend, Angela (Mena Suvari) you find it amusing and somewhat comical. You see how he acts during his midlife crises, what he says and his actions are also very amusing, and you wish you could get away with doing stuff like that. Carolyn Burnham (Annette Bening) is a real estate saleswoman who is obsessed with the idea of success. ""That's my wife, Carolyn. You see the way her pruning shears match her gardening clogs? That's not a coincidence"" Lester remarks introducing her in the beginning of the movie. Carolyn has an obsession of her own, her public image. Jane Burnham (Thora Birch) is the stereotypical teenage girl, sassy, parent-hating, and insecure. She's the opposite of her friend Angela. She's solemn, non-promiscuous, and she's not attractive in the way our society defines it. ""I need a father who's a role model, not some nerdy geek boy who's going to spray his pants every time I have a girlfriend over."" She remarks to her boyfriend Ricky. She's embarrassed by his dad, and the way he lusts after Angela. Most people that review this movie see her as a bad person, but as a fellow teenager, I can empathize with her. To me, the most thought provoking and intriguing character is Ricky Fits (Wes Bentley), the strange boy next door who video tapes all of his life experiences and sells drugs. Ricky seems to find beauty in everything he sees, and seems strange from the outside. When you look into his family though, and you see his abusive, homophobic, marine father and his defeated mother, you realize what's going on behind closed doors. This movie has so many different lessons about society. First of all, the tagline, ""Look Closer"" is a lesson in itself. If you just look at everybody without paying attention to detail, you won't notice anything wrong, but if you look closer, you realize that everybody is in some way or another, trying to fit in. It also taught me that if you look close enough, you can find beauty in everything. For example, the plastic bag scene where Ricky films a plastic bag floating in the wind for fifteen minutes. While people may say ""It's just a plastic bag, what so beautiful about that."" To which I would say that beauty is subjective; what one person finds beautiful might be repulsive to another person. This movie also beautifully illustrates the disillusionment phenomenon we all have experienced, which is when you realize something is not as good as it once seemed. It also taught me to not judge a book by its cover. From the outside, the Burnham's look like the perfect family, but behind that bright red door, it's a totally different story. This is one of those movies that if you get it, you'll love it but if you don't, you'll hate it. If you come in to it watching with an open mind, all you need to do is sit back and watch, and be amazed by its beauty. If you want a philosophical drama movie that will make you think about the society we live in, then this is the movie for you. If you're going to watch a movie, I encourage you to watch it with an open mind. This movie taught me many valuable lessons about society, all while being entertaining and funny at times. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Awesome,"Right now I think this may be the best movie I've ever seen. It has some of the same elements as The Dead Poets' Society, Ice Storm and Fight Club, but I liked it more than any of those.But those are just comparisons, and I don't think this movie copies from anything that much, like some people have commented.The story is rich, so much better than all the calculated Hollywood stuff.This movie contains stuff that might offend some people, but I found those parts very good. Despite some elements that warrant the R-rating, this movie doesn't have anything 'cheap' in it.

A must watch for everyone who loves life,"I am watching this movie after a long time again. Just because this movie connects us with the course of our lives. Most of us shall identify ourselves in this movie's characters. The role of Lester is simply awesome. He portrays the image of a looser so beautifully. And the change in him finds him finding meaning in his life. How true it is in our lives too? We are all occupied with our image of the whole world leaving behind the things which makes us happier. We try to do things to make other happier forgetting that it is also important to be happy ourselves instead of living a hollow life. The life is indeed beautiful. It is only on us to see it in different perspective. The whole world is full of beautiful things, full of hope, happiness and blessings. The only thing is how we come to know the path to arrive at it. We all have the same craving for love, fulfillment and success with contentment. And in some point of life, we do attain all these. But for some moments only. The movie is completed with the redemption of Lester, the only way to meet an end. This movie provokes one to think life in a different way than one is looking presently. And this is the beauty of the movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"In Mendes' Curdled 'American' Dream, 'Beauty' Runs Deep!","An acerbic, darkly comic critique of how social conventions can lead people into false, sterile and emotionally stunted lives, American Beauty is a real American original.Something's rotten in suburbia and it doesn't take long to get to the source of the stink – the Burnhams. Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) is a middle-aged burnout who is a marginalized husband to efficient, well-scrubbed Carolyn (Annette Benning) and a disregarded father to sullen teenager Jane (Thora Birch) and whose everyday life has degenerated into tedium. Browbeaten Lester is rejuvenated by the vision of a blonde Lolita. That the object of his obsession happens to be his daughter's best friend, a calculating sylph named Angela (Mena Suvari), matters not at all; he leaps into his fantasy like an enflamed teenager. Unhappy Carolyn undertakes an affair of her own while Jane, repulsed by her dad's hormonal attraction, secretly welcomes the attention of Ricky Fits (Wes Bentley), the strange, self-possessed boy next door. And just when things seem to be falling in place for the Burnhams, it all comes crashing down. If this sounds too depressing, guess again!Although it's difficult to believe that humor can be found in this toxic portrait of superficial suburban values, predatory sexuality and domestic violence, rest assured it earns its laughs at every turn. Screenwriter Alan Ball gives the viewer a brief, horrific tour of crossed wires, inchoate longing, dashed illusions and resentment that wells from poisoned hearts with staggering self-assuredness. Sam Mendes (in one of the most promising debuts in cinematic history) whips the audience around from humor to horror to something poetic and humane. He suffuses the proceedings with a palpable sense of danger, keeping film-goers unsettled until the very end as to what exactly motivates these complicated characters. But he never loses sight of the humanity behind even the most reprehensible acts, a balancing act pulled off with unusual acumen.American Beauty turns out to be emotionally satisfying, thanks in large part to a remarkably nuanced performance by Kevin Spacey. He commands the screen with a performance of subtlety, vulnerability and supreme confidence, in which he expresses mordant self-mockery and poignancy in a single gesture. He brings flawless comic timing to Lester's self-absorbed, infantile and rapacious behavior while holding on to the pathos of Lester's rage. Benning turns in her finest performance to date and all three teen players give sturdy and courageous portrayals in roles that would daunt actors twice their ages.Visually daring, dramatically astute, and beautifully acted, American Beauty is a tart, funny and tremendously sobering movie about the deepest recesses of personal unhappiness. There's a sense of poignancy at the end, but also the feeling that we have been on an incredible trip through the lives and souls of three perfectly- realized characters. The result is the kind of artful defiance that Hollywood is usually too timid to deliver: a jolting comedy that makes you laugh till it hurts!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Insight into a typical American life,"American Beauty gives a deep insight into the lives of Americans on a different levels. And more importantly it emphasises with God's beauty that is all pervasive around us while we are blinded owing to materialistic aspirations.A typical American family of Burnham's consisting of Lester (Kevin Spacey), Carolynn (Annette) and their daughter Jane (Thora Birch). Marriage is superfluous. Daughter is confused teenager who falls in love with neighbour Ricky (Wes). The pro-sake life of Lester suddenly gets spiced up when he falls head-over-heels over his daughter's friend Angels (Mena Suvari) and re-discovers his passion for life, a reason for existence and more importantly his identity.All the character's parts are well-etched out. The portrayal of Lester's re-kindling his energy is portrayed effectively, as subtle and as convincingly as one falls in first love.And narrative voice-over words of Kevin Spacey are extremely spiritual yet convincing. The movie did not register well the first time I watched it. However last week when it was aired on telly, and could see the subtle messages the movie is interlaced with.",,Anonymous,Drama
"an above average, but unfocused, movie","When I stepped into the theater to see American Beauty, I must admit I was a bit skeptical.  Whenever a large mass of people urges me to run to the theater and view a film, my first instinct is to run in the other direction. For this particular film, I resisted the urge.  I must say I'm glad I did.A synopsis of the film can be found in others' comments.  Hence, I will forego the summary and cut to the chase.  American Beauty is only moderately Beautiful.  The film is not a profound comment on American society. Neither is it a well-focused, original piece of art.  What American Beauty is, however, is a collection of beautifully wrought moments created by the union of actor and director.Listening to the words of the film, one feels that the writer is trying to tell several stories at once.  Sure, this kind of  writing can pull awe from any audience, of the wow-I-can't- believe-he-got-so-many-things-into-one-movie variety, but the same can be said for special effects artists who manage to effect a bridge explosion and a monster's foot in the same movie.  As audience members, do we seek breadth or depth?If you seek breadth, this movie is right up your alley.  Not only does it tackle unhappiness in the workplace, it ties it in with marital degeneration, gays in the military, drug dealing, teenage sex/high school angst, and sexual power, but it ties it all together with the uber-concept of ""Beauty.""  It's a pity that all these cliches don't add up to some larger ""whole"" that communicates something to the viewer.  Indeed, the attempt to do this seems harried and last-minute.There are some good moments, as I said.  Annette Bening and Kevin Spacey are superb, and the teen actors do a wonderful job of fulfilling the roles simply, without Hollywood ""emotion."" For all the good acting and good direction, though, I wasn't watching a movie; I was simply eating a ""scene salad.""",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

Most of the acting was very good, but the plot was so convoluted and based on a series of misunderstandings (Come on!  How could the weird neighbor's father think that his son was gay based on a bad viewing angle from his window?) that it just detracted from the movie while I felt like I was yelling at the characters in the movie for all the stupid things they were doing and dangerous situations they were involving themselves in.Most of American society is not this screwed up.  Perhaps the main theme here was that characters in the worst situations can still find beauty in their lives, but if that involves a drug dealer falling in love with a flying plastic bag, then count me out of this idiotic mantra.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

The movie combines different genres to form a very interesting mix-- drama, suspense and comedy.American Beauty is definitely praise-worthy, especially with the way the story went. The characters' lives get messed up in very unpredictable ways that will make the viewer stick till the end. The alternating mix of comedy, drama and suspense work under the spell of the beautiful score.The characters are also a secret to the film's beauty.

People actually like this tale of a man in a serious midlife crisis lusting after a teenage girl, and his adulterous wife cheating on him. And his daughter hooking up with the art freak drug dealer next door. Okay, we have a movie here. It could be a decent one.But when you meet the art freak's father he acts so homophobic you can just say ""Yep. He's Gay."" They began to lay it on thick from the beginning, throwing all sorts of crap like this at you and hoping that at least some of it is good. Its a movie that reads like a book, and the book happens to be somebody writing random words and going to the publisher and saying ""I think their might be a book in here."" And yet the book is passed off as some sort of abstract art. Its just one overdone moment to an equally over done moment.When we have an effective, true film like the Insider, something so chilling and effects all of us, and so well made and acted, I kind of want to see that win.

Mixed Feelings,"Some of this movie is brilliant. Some of it puerile trash. I find it's treatment of the characters to be largely without warmth. They are unlikable with a couple of exceptions, such as the Ricky and Jane characters. This unlikability is unrealistic. Surely, some people are very unsympathetic, but this movie goes out of it's way to take ""normal"" people and portray them as twisted freaks. For the most part, reality is not this harsh, not this glaring. People live with each other, see their faults, love them or not, but this desolate despair from emotionally stunted jerks that this movie portrays as being the norm, it's almost deliberately dishonest. If that is truly the experience of the people behind this film, I feel sorry for them. It's not that way for most people. Maybe if you are a teenager you experience life that way in your immaturity.An obvious hatred for what the makers of this film deem to be the morally bankrupt lifestyle of many Americans, overly consumed by the material and appearance. Everything in this world is bad. It only becomes good when they do things that are not only insane, but wholly irresponsible in people that have children that they should be caring for. Sorry, but I don't think it's acceptable to actualize yourself at the expense of your daughter.Does this happen in suburbia? To be sure. But it disturbs me to see so many people talking about how realistic this movie is, it just simply isn't.Furthermore, some of the stereotypes, such as Ricky's homophobic marine father who turns out to be gay himself, are embarrassingly trite, pat, and roll your eyes predictable.Having said that, there are also incredibly moving scenes in this picture. Ricky's description of the beauty of a plastic bag flying about in the wind will stay with me for a long time. It is one of the most lyrical, powerful and lovely moments I have ever seen on film.Also the ending, where the sometimes repulsive Lester has an epiphany and finally grows up is quite wonderful.Should you see it? Yes. But don't expect a masterpiece.",5.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Perfect, in every sense of the word","If I had to describe this film in one word, it would be 'brilliant.' Nothing has truly captured the mundane and inner thoughts and demons surrounding people and their human natures quite like this before, nor has any film been able to play it off in such a unique manner. It's a timeless film that somehow manages to be incredibly insightful, without ever feeling a slight bit dull or boring. It's interesting, entertaining, cleverly shot, well written, and fantastically acted. There is little to say the film didn't do right. Kevin Spacey gives one of, if not, the best performance of his career and he is well deserving of his Oscar win. His portrayal of the character Lester Burnham can often be imitated in many aspiring filmmakers works today, but even though it is often imitated, none can replicate the brilliance that Spacey puts into the performance. His acting is not only realistic, but also endlessly enjoyable to watch, and you won't want to take your eyes off the screen when he steals every scene he possibly can. The other actors in the film are quite great as well. Annette Bening gives a wonderfully poignant performance as Carolyn Burnham and provides a greater glimpse into the struggling suburban wife we have all come to know at some point in our lives. Her performance isn't just an advance on a stereotype however, and neither is the character, but rather a fresh perspective on how someone so mundane and yet trouble-filled can be living throughout their own life. Though no performance in the film shine quite as notably as these two; Thora Birch, Wes Bentley, Mena Suvari, and Chris Cooper all give quite notable performances on their own- with somewhat less screen time to let their roles shine. The film is written beautifully, and its incite and story is so incredibly down to earth- and yet so wonderfully magical all at once. It's direction is perfect, with it being Mendes' first effort, it truly shows how impressive he is as a filmmaker. The film is also shot beautifully, and is well deserved of its Oscar win for cinematography, with its endlessly perfect and interesting shots that truly help the film to keep up its amazing stature. The one flaw I can see the film being ridiculed for, is it being slightly predictable at times, but even with this small flaw- American Beauty seems to make it not just a flaw but a quirk of its story- by providing such realistic values and lifelike scenarios- that you can't help but feel like if you were in the same situation, you could predict it yourself. In the end, American Beauty is a timeless effort from all those involved- filled with some wonderful writing by Alan Ball and wonderful direction from Sam Mendes. Spacey's performance, as is the film, is timeless and all in all both go in my personal favorite moments in all of film history.

The Image of Success,"The Burnhams are a typical, upwardly mobile family: a father with a well-paid job in advertising, a mother who is a driven real estate sales agent, an angst-ridden teen age daughter who is at an age to despise her parents. They live in a lovely home with a white picket fence, lovely roses, and a red door. Everything about them projects an image of success. And yet-- Lester (Kevin Spacey) hates his advertising job, which makes him feel like a prostitute selling second rate wares to stupid johns. Caroline (Annette Benning) is frustrated at being second-best in the real estate business. Daughter Jane (Thorah Birch) finds both of her parents vapid and doubts her own validity as a person--particularly when compared with her beautiful, sexed-up best friend Angela (Mena Suvari.) Their lives, like the lives of so many others rushing ""to get ahead in the world,"" have become less about actually living than about maintaining and improving upon the appearance of success so prized by society.What is most astonishing about the film is its complete believability. Speaking as one who has worked a great deal in advertising and sales, I was amazed with the accuracy with which Ball's powerful and darkly funny script captured the lives of those whose values rest exclusively upon external achievement--Lester's growing and barely concealed hatred for advertising and Caroline's constant use of self-help tapes and personal success mantras are truly commonplace in the business world.Now, if American BEAUTY were merely this and nothing more, it would still be an astonishing film. But it goes considerably further than that--for Lester, suddenly motived by a lust for his daughter's friend Angela, realizes how completely unenjoyable ""keeping up appearances"" has become. And he explodes the status quo in such a way as to bring every one's petty materialism and mask-like personaes into a sharp, very funny, and pitch-black focus as the shallow and meaningless things they are. And in the process he both finds and destroys himself forever.The cast is astonishing throughout, with Kevin Spacey the ultimate ""I Can't Take It Any More"" man and wife Annette Benning the ultimate vision of every hard-core sales representative it has ever been my misfortune to meet, a woman determined to ""project an image of success at all times"" even if it kills her. Thora Birch is a remarkable young performer, as is her boyfriend Wes Bentley, and Mena Suvari is perfectly cast as the youthful beauty for whom Spacey develops an unexpected passion. Mendes' direction is flawless here, and he navigates the both the complicated appearances of success and the personal shallowness it conceals with tremendous clarity, never overplaying his hand in either direction.Perhaps the most telling bits of the film are among the most subtle, as when the film posits the tiresomely yuppie but nonetheless considerably more honest gay couple next door as more genuine than the Burhams, Caroline's eternal efforts at ego building through motivational tapes, and the way in which Angela (in time honored teenage fashion) naively attempts to use sex as a weapon to conceal her own insecurities.The film is extremely funny, but it is also ultimately devastating. A great many people--particularly those who equate ""an image of success"" with successful lives, will despise the film. But like it or not, American BEAUTY's take on the failure on the failure of the American dream is easily the most successful and deadly accurate satire on life in these United States since the equally wicked NETWORK. This is the real thing, people--and it may be too close to home for many. Watch it at your own risk. Strongly, strongly recommended.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Should Be Renamed American Treasue,"I watched this movie for the first time ever last weekend and was so blown away. I did not expect the twist and turns in the end. I cried in the end so mad and heartbroken in the end but also the unexpected twist at the very, very end. This really is an American treasure and over all good film. I definitely recommend this to anyone. I liked the bluntness in this film which you don't get a lot sometimes. It doesn't feel like this film is 14 years old which makes me think I am too old. I can't give this film enough justice you must watch. I would put this on the Top 100 films to watch before you die.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
When people think of suburbia i don't think the first thing that comes to mind is what goes on in this film.,"In our society if you have money, a family,and a good job then there is nothing that could possibly go wrong in your life. Your life is perfect, and you should be happy with what you have. But as American Beauty shows us this isn't true. It doesn't matter if you live in suburbia or not. American Beauty is a great film, some people might think that it's going over the edge with what goes on in the movie, but I think it's just showing every possible thing that could be going on in a family. The casting in this film is one of the best jobs I've seen, there isn't one character that seems out of place. I think American families can learn something from this movie. I would recommend this movie to anyone who isn't afraid of what is really going on in this world.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
american beauty,"American beauty is a well good shown and represanted life of family that has a lot of problems in it and how they are trying to work around them and somehow trying it to fix them,i would say this this movie had some strong messages in it also,about how fast life can past fast and how regret about making some decisions can have a big mark and effect on us in a future and take a big toll on us,spacey for me give performance of lifetime here and for me he may be one of those actors that are able to put them selfs in a very difficult roles but somehow act like that is the easiest mission in a world,rest of cast werent on his level,except chris cooper but they were solid in their roles,american beauty was sometimes depressing movie but it had some really strong staff and messages in it",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
one of my favorites.,"after the ""usual suspects"" and ""the life of David gale"" i had great expectations of this one when i came in its possession. the first 10 minutes or so almost disappointed me as i began seeing the feature as a ""self-indulgent"" attempt in giving moral and ethical excuses. but then the characters are developed very well with such realistic aspects that strikes close to anyones personal life at least at some moments in time. unlike ""the godfather"" for example, this is not an instant classic for its artistic merits but because of its content.family and individualistic dis-functionality here is not something taken to extremes with wacky scenes for the purpose to raise its entertainment value. the feature is deeply sarcastic with quiet many comic-tragic situations.the tone and the dialogs are made for anyones understandings, as shown for the general public agreement in rating this productions as one with the highest score ever. technically this addresses teenage, middle age and gay issues(as related to a standard American family with generally only one child) and the relations in-between.for example the Kevin spacey visual fantasy is one of a kind at least as generally seen on the silver screen. also, an interesting aspect rarely seen; that of an ""abusive"" wife(i guess unless one asks an ultra feminist this question, i think i can safely assume this aspect here as general).while ALL actors are playing their roles excellent(the plot itself definitely helps with that or at least in how we perceive those as be) i was/am mostly focused on Kevin spacey. here is an example of an actor that has always choose his roles carefully.(his NEW movie as a director ""21"" is the only one kind of disappointing , but hey everyone deserves a ""try"" or 2 right?). in here he resembles so well an ""ordinary"" American and the life( or parts thereof) he might have in the ""suburbs""(same actually could go for the wife, Annette Bening).his whole , new found approach towards life changing resolutions creates situations of pure simplicity, yet generally socially ignored in any over developed consumer society; that is the reason for which the title has ""american"" in it and not ""chinese"" for example. all the characters will make the viewer reflect on past, present, future... and ""tense""...",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Look closer...indeed,"The tagline of this film is ""Look Closer..."" Well, indeed you should. Look closer and you'll see this is NOT the most original and realistic story ever, this is NOT the best directorial debut ever and this is certainly NOT the masterpiece everybody claims it to be...Well what is it than ? It's an average, rather boring film but, with great performanes from the whole cast. You have to give it that, the whole cast couldn't be better and as for Spacey : he really deserved the Oscar. But all this can't save the film from boredom. In general, I like 'weird' characters. I loved Donnie Darko and he's pretty weird. But these are just way over the top. It ain't very psychological to film a plastic bag for 15 minutes and see the beauty of life in it. That Wes Bentley guy beats it all by the way. I don't believe a weirdo with a camera can sell drugs and make a fortune out of it. When such a guy came to a normal school he would get beaten up ! Especially if he wears that stupid hat.I do have to admit this film has an impact on you when you watch it the first time. It all seems very risky and innovating and especially the characters make a lot of impression to you. So, yeah, the first time I saw it I liked it and I wanted to see it again. But when that happened I really wonder WHAT exactly it was that fascinated me so much. It just seemed boring and so sloooooooooooooooooow. The 3rd time I saw it ( right before this review ) I thought it was a complete mess. Only the actors get some credit after this viewing. Everybody claims Sam Mendes ( Director ) is the best thing since sliced bread, but he sure is not in my opinion. Road to Perdition was boring as well. There were a lot of good films in 1999, The Green Mile to name just one, who all were a lot better than this one. I recommend them ! And if you do want to see this...make sure you only watch it once.

"Movie was okay, but worth all the awards?","Call me jaded, but I don't see what all the fuss was about this movie. Kevin was good, Annette could have been replaced.  I think the kid young man who played the neighbor kid did a better job than anyone else.  There were several very funny moments, and a couple of twists I didn't see coming.  But overall, I've got to ask myself if I have any desire to see this movie again in the near future.  And honestly, I probably won't make an effort.

You must see this film.,"Sam Mendes' tale of self-fulfilment is a masterpiece. Everything works together in a wonderful harmony which is utterly memorable, gripping and beautiful to look at.It rings true, for the most part, because of two people, namely Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening. Spacey is so sardonic, so world-weary and so precise with every word in every line that he makes every second spent with his character joyous, whilst Bening brings a pitch-perfect portrayal of insecurity and suburban façade that frankly puts ""Desperate Housewives"" to shame. The entire ensemble gels together magnificently.But the film is not just made by the supreme acting but also by the fantastic dark comedy. The script, by Alan Ball, is hilarious in such a brilliantly inventive way, the likes of which have not been seen since Billy Wilder.And then there's the visual style. Mendes' images are stunning, memorable and clever (plenty of thanks should also go to DP, Conrad L. Hall). The direction is detectable but not overly forceful. You're aware of the director's hand but it doesn't bother you and this makes you think. It absorbs you into the film completely.This is a wonderful experience and not to be missed. The simple message of the film is born out to perfection and the end is utterly satisfying, but along the way it is moving, funny, intelligent, stunning, devastating and uplifting. You must see this film.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Picture Perfect,Sam Mendes does a great job showing the troubles and problems a teenager might go through during their high school career. I'd have to say that this movie was more based around the father's life and his problems with it. Mendes really portrays well what a troubled father ready to give it all up might do to get things to go his way. The creepy neighbor boy was a bit far fetched but added the third part of the story that i believe it needed. The use of roses was amazing and were perfect for the times they were used. the cast for this was a perfect selection. Kevin Spacey played a perfect role as the miserable father/husband. Thora Birch was the best choice for a wanna popular dark teenager. Overall this was a great movie to watch and one worth its time.,9.0,Anonymous,Drama
A Film Class Favorite,"My new favorite movie! I would never have watched this movie outside of my high school Film Studies class. But the first two minutes of the film seemed to have got my attention. I felt that the tone of the movie was really interesting. Most of the film was quiet and wasn't action packed like most movies that typical high schooler's watch. In the beginning, the movie was really mellow and then slowly the intensity started to build up. The thing that helped make the movie so great was the music. It's a type of music I can't explain. It gave the movie that certain tone that it has.The characters in the movie were great! And if Lester was played by someone other than Kevin Spacey, the film would not be as good. I love Lester Burnham, he's so laid back, he doesn't really get angry at all. He only loses his temper one time in the movie and I found it hilarious because it was so random.It's just a great movie, you have to watch it!Best quote- ""Would someone pass me the *&%^(#$ Asparagus!""",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Beautiful,"American Beauty is a great movie about beauty. Everything you see in this movie is beautiful, even those which seem ugly. Kevin Spacy acts Lester character delicately and beautifully. The script is so powerful containing great dialogues mixed with remarkable scenes. Some scenes are unforgettable. for instance, the scene in which Ricky shows the most beautiful thing he had ever filmed. This scene is so touching. In fact, the whole movie is touching. I felt every characters in the movie. And at last, the name of the movie is some kind of a metaphor. Because American Beauty is the name of the variety of hybrid rose.(according to Webster Dictionary) Spielberg has found a new talent again(Sam Mendes) and of course Sam has done a great job for his movie directing debut. The film deserved to gain 100 oscars instead of one for best picture. Thanks to Alan Ball and all who were involved in making this special and beautiful movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
American Beauty: A Modern Classic,"In many ways, American Beauty claims an obvious spot on the short list of top films because of its litany of recognition, including five academy awards (one Annette Bening overlook shy of the prestigious Silence of the Lambs best picture/director/actor/actress sweep), and overwhelming critical support. However, simple recognition from the film noir crowd does not equate to movie magic (see Donnie Darko, Fargo, or anything by Stanley Kubric). The Academy Awards are also a poor barometer for a film's quality (see Titanic, Shakespeare in Love, or anything by Stanley Kubric). And don't get me started on the Golden Globes. Instead, American Beauty walks the walk.While movies like The Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, and Star Wars touch a nerve because they elicit the inner child in us all, low budget, realistic movies without the aid of CGI are more difficult to endear to the common man. As screenwriters like to call it, there must a ""suspended belief"" that the story being told is both relevant and important. These attributes may be obtained in a variety of ways through comedy, drama, and even horror. However, a true classic does not force feed you the ingredients of a well made picture, but slowly mixes them into the batter little by little. This subtly is the crux of American Beauty's genius.The movie's tag line is ""Look closer."" Anybody who has seen the movie more than once recognizes the value of such a statement. Like the pedals on a rose, the movie's iconic image and foundation for the movie title, the viewer must strip down the flower one layer at a time to get a closer, more relevant look. Screenwriter Alan Ball claims that his motivation for the story was created through his daily life experiences. As viewers, we're convinced he plagiarized from ours.There is no fabricated demagogue who more than slightly resembles your crazy uncle. Nor is there a conniving thief who would be a millionaire if it weren't for his bone-headed partner. Instead we have an underachieving father who is tip-toeing the ledge of sanity and eternal repression from an overbearing society. Sound familiar? We also have a mother who masks her insecurity with a perfect house, a perfect fence, and a perfect smile. We have a daughter who dreams of breast implants, exchanges her pride for friendship with the conceited but popular girl, and finds love in her outcast neighbor. We have a homophobic ex-marine who demands structure from his son but refuses to acknowledge who he really is. We have the gay neighbors that want nothing more than to be the neighbors, period. Yes, they are stereotypes, but aren't we all? Within each character, we find the Id of the everyday person. What can be more relevant than that? Within the hook of a relevant subject matter, lies an important message. These are not static characters that director Alan Mendes and legendary cinematographer Conrad Hall so expertly introduce. These characters want to be more than who they see in the mirror; however, they volley their intentions and desires from day to day, and sometimes hour to hour. It is through the eyes of Kevin Spacey's character, Lester Burnham, that we see a man who reached the breaking point. His inciting incident is a guilty pleasure that no honest man would care to admit: he fantasizes over his daughter's High School friend. Boom. Motivation to get in shape. It is through this Rudy-esquire bildunsroman that we witness a nobody become a man.Through Lester's all-bets-are-off attitude, we experience a man stripped to his foundation. He says what he wants to say and does what he wants to do. He hates his job. Solution? Blackmail the boss and get a year's worth of salary, plus benefits. He hates his body. Solution? Smoke pot while he ""wails on (his) pecs."" The viewer is drawn to Lester because he does what we all can't: become who he wants to be. Like in many movies, we live vicariously through the lead character. But Lester is no superman. His actions, although risky and bold, do not require superpowers or extravagant amounts of money. They require a pulse.Blockbusters like X-Men, Terminator, and Aliens are fine movies. They grab our attention with jaw-dropping special effects, and hold us tight with suspenseful action sequences. But they are not classics. We are not changed, just amused. Likewise, movies like Apocalypse Now, The Wizard of Oz, and Pulp Fiction are well shot, entertaining flicks. But they do not move us, unless you count reaching forward to get more popcorn. It's Rick's goodbye in Casablanca, Michael Corleone's hand being kissed as the new Don in The Godfather, and the way Dr. Hannibal Lector's tongue rattles like a snake in The Silence of the Lambs that change our lives. They strike a chord and let it resonate through our soul. American Beauty sends shock waves.In a society that justifies postponing a diet for two months by claiming it will be a New Years resolution, it's uncomfortable to see an assertive nobody flip one's life around so suddenly. However, it's equally rewarding and encouraging. Lester Burnham is the underdog who made it to the Final Four. He's the obese woman who finally cracked 200 pounds. He's the recovering drug addict who fought his way to a college degree. And he's the fruition of the desires we fear to embark upon. If you look closer, he's you and me.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Ricky has a domineering angry military father (Chris Cooper), and he sells weed.Director Sam Mendes and writer Alan Ball have captured the mood of obsessions and secrets in suburbia. This plays like a voyeuristic peep show as the characters peel back the layers of secrets. It's not creepy but it is enchanting. This movie lures you in, and traps you in something forbidden. Kevin Spacey is absolutely wonderful as a torn man. And Thora Birch is great as the angry daughter. It's the perverse mundaneness of suburbia and its many secrets.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Smart, Subversive, Contrived, and Forever Open for Debate","""American Beauty"" is one of those rare and audacious films that begs the question, ""what defines art?""  I don't think there is a film that received better pre-release hype, more overwhelming praise when it was released, and more cries of ""FINALLY!"" when it swept the Oscars.  Yet it has spawned some of the most heated backlash of any film in recent memory.  Does the fact that it has created so much debate make it art?  Maybe.This is a film that subverts the traditional American ideal of suburban life.  The moments of ""conversation"" at the dinner table are both the most horrific and funniest moments ever put to film.  They resonate at both ends of the spectrum because they ring so true.  Who hasn't been a part of or witnessed such tantrums at the dinner table, a place where families are supposed to connect and rejoice in their everyday life?  Does this type of subversion define art?  Maybe.This is a film that was very deliberate in its direction.  Plastic bags and rose petals have never been more beautifully shot, or more pretentious. Suburban streets have never looked this good, and white picket fences never whiter.  But again, there's something crackling under the veneer, both of this film, and of the life it depicts.  Is this what art is supposed to do? I think so.The performances are phenomenal from Spacey and Benning.  The script is ultra smart and ultra clever, but in the end probably too contrived.  Was the message of the film that our ""American dream"" is also too contrived, just like this movie?  Or was the message that even suburban schmucks like Lester Burnham deserve a chance to live out an authentic life of their own choosing?  We may never know.  I actually think that twenty or thirty years from now this movie will be looked upon as one of the all time greats by critics, with the then modern-day audiences perplexed and asking, ""why?"" That, my friends, is art.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Take the time.,"American Beauty has many outstanding performances, including, of course, the leads played by Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening. There is also an exceptional characterization by newcomer Wes Bentley, who plays Ricky Fitts, the young drug-dealing philosopher.  And the splendid look of the film is perfectly created by cinematographer Conrad Hall, along with wonderful production design, set creation, and, especially, a special effects crew, responsible for those unforgettable lush, red roses.But just about everyone would agree with this.  What everyone does not agree with is whether Alan Ball's script is on par with its interpreters.  Much of the material is actually quite derivative. Ordinary People (1980) and Bliss (1985) are direct inspirations, but there are many others as well, including The Red Balloon (source of the floating bag motif) and Sunset Boulevard (source of the dead narrator concept). And there is some claptrap, such as the hackneyed homophobic military character and the trite soul-transformation when Lester (Kevin Spacey) decides not to consummate his lust for Angela (Mena Suvari) after he learns she's a virgin. Spacey's marvelous acting makes it credible, but there was nothing written into his character to account for such a transformation.In spite of these flaws, there is much to recommend about American Beauty. Directed with freshness and vitality, Sam Mendes and his outstanding cast make you care about the characters and their plight.  Their sensitivity is genuine.  The film reminds us that we need to take the time to smell the roses, or else we will miss that which is truly beautiful.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
"it makes me want to cry. I mean the hype, not the movie","This movie is not nearly as great as everyone makes it out to be. The symbolism is contrived and clumsy. The characters are too stereotyped.

A dark comical masterpiece,"American Beauty (1999) Starring Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening.  Running time: 121 minutes.  Rated R for strong sexuality, language, violence and drug content.Meet Lester Burnham(Kevin Spacey).  He's 42 and he's having a mid-life crisis.  His marriage to his wife Carolyn(Annette Bening) is on the verge of falling apart and his daughter Jane(Thora Birch) hates him.  One night while at a basketball game, Lester spots Jane's friend Angela(Mena Suvari). Lester immediately falls in love.  He then decides that this will be his last chance at true happiness in his life.  So he quits his job and begins working out.  On a minor note, Jane falls in love with the boy who lives next door named Ricky Fitts(Wes Bentley) whose father, Colonel Frank Fitts(Chris Cooper) is a homophobe.This is indeed the best movie of 1999.  Kevin Spacey has never been better on film.  He really deserved the Oscar for Best Actor.  I'm surprised that he was able to top his Oscar-winning performance as Verbal Kint from ""The Usual Suspects"" in 1995 because many actors are rarely able to top a performance.  Annette Bening was great also as the obsessive and frustrated Carolyn who later decides that enough is enough and goes to sleep with a rival realtor.  The supporting performances are great as well especially from Thora Birch who befriends Ricky.  She at first hates him because he's always filming her, as he says that he finds her interesting and later falls in love with him.  Wes Bentley should have gotten an Oscar nomination for his performance as the troubled and misunderstood Ricky.I really liked this movie a lot.  I missed it when it was released into theaters.

"An odd movie that, in its final moments, manages to be almost transcendent.","'American Beauty (2000)' is an odd blend of comedy and drama which come together to successfully compliment each other and make the whole experience more impactful.

It's an experience that will stay with you long after the credits roll. The fantastic screenplay mixes with the amazing acting to create a seamless sort of 'imagined realism' that allows for a true cinematic reflection of real life.

The Only Bright Spot in a Dark Year for Movies,"""American Beauty"" is far from being a masterpiece.  It's not even an excellent film, but it is very good.  The film centers around Kevin Spacey (in an Oscar-winning performance)who plays a man who is experiencing a mid-life crisis.  After meeting his teenage daughter's girlfriend, Spacey goes through an extreme transformation that will effect all those closest to him.  Annette Bening (in an Oscar-nominated role) is almost as good as Spacey, playing his real estate-selling wife.  However, the other actors fall far short of Spacey and Bening.  Chris Cooper, Mena Suvari, and Thora Birch do nothing special in my opinion.  Wes Bentley is also just adequate. The screenplay is excellent and the direction is pretty good by first-time film maker Sam Mendes.  Any other year, ""American Beauty"" would not have gotten any serious consideration for a Best Picture Oscar.  However, its impeccable timing and its lack of competition made it a runaway winner that captured five Academy Awards in 1999.  4.5 out of 5 stars.",,Anonymous,Drama
"Two suburbanites battle out their respective ""dreams"" while their kid take the brunt of their failures.","As someone wrote earlier, this film was indeed overrated. I'm not even sure why, except that it skewers the materialism, complacency and (via Chris Cooper's wacko character) the growing (and eerily prophetic) growth of homophobia (amongst gays themselves--how weird is THAT?) as well as militant ""activism"" and repression which foreshadows the insanity of ""The Tea Party"" (GOD! I hate that stupid name, which betrays all that the Sons of Liberty held sacred!).Anyway, we have a midlife crisis (no big deal--nothing new) but in BOTH parents? That's news. The wife, rather than ""find herself"" through pottery or the ubiquitous ""Wimmin's groups"", she nudges hubby aside even before he quits his job and tries to muscle into the housing boom by emulating her Realtor guru, played with smarmy accuracy by Peter Gallagher's goofily named ""Buddy Kane"".In the final analysis, no matter what Lester (Spacey) does, he can not please his wife, the Jabba the Hutt of consumerism and shallow consumption, who refuses an afternoon rendezvous w/Lester because wine might spill on their designer sofa.Meanwhile, their funky, semi-Goth daughter, Thora Birch, is flirting with aesthetics and its purveyor, the militia-man's' son, Ricky Fits, who is being routinely abused by his secretly gay, paranoid, militant father! You can't make this stuff up...I THINK.Despite a hefty dose of surrealism, one must wonder: how much of this does that average middle and upper-middle-class American actually believe? The answer in this film would be: ""Pretty much ALL of it""! You known teenage America is in trouble and the parents have abandoned ship, when kids ""rebel"" by watching a home video of a plastic bag being blown around by the wind in some ersatz Chaos Theory demo! Sad...sad...sad! Didn't these kids ever see ""Jurassic Park""--if they did, they would KNOW where this ""chaos"" stuff leads, no matter how hypnotic.It's safe to say that none of them can win, especially the kids.

An original idea marred by cliched characterers and a slow pace,"Although this film has flashes of wit and insight, it fails to fulfill its promise.  Ever character, other than the protagonist, is a stereotype direct from Hollywood.  The pace of the film is often excruciatingly slow in a vane attempt to be give weight to lightweight ideas.  There is too much filler and not enough wit.  Kevin Spacey is excellent, but the rest of the cast is shackled with a shallow script.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Genial, unique and well made... and also capable of make you think","I heard for years about AMERICAN BEAUTY because it's on IMDB's top 250, won 5 Oscars including the ones for Best Picture and Best Actor, and has often been quoted (especially the rose petals scene). When I finally saw it few weeks ago I found it very good and gripping, but not deserving of its score of 8,5. I am not saying that is a bad movie, but just very good, and with 3,013 reviews to date, I'll be brief.Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) is a middle aged man depressed for the fact that his everyday life is always the same. He hates his job as a journalist and can't stand his real estate agent wife Carolyn (Annette Bening) anymore, and she is already neurotic for the fact that she doesn't have the success her colleagues have. Their teenage daughter Jane (Thora Birch) is often embarassed by her parents. When the Fitts family moves near them and they become their new neighbours, life changes as their son Ricky (Wes Bentley) tries to evade his strict father (Chris Cooper) with the habit of filming what happens outside his window, and after Lester becomes interested in Jane's best friend and Carolyn has an affair with Buddy Kane (Peter Gallagher), everything around them will change.The acting was great. Kevin Spacey is well suited in playing shady individuals and this is no exception, Annette Bening gives one of her best performances other than being super gorgeous (and she has never been hotter than here), while Peter Gallager, Chris Cooper, Wes Bentley and the other were all pretty entertaining. The direction by Sam Mendes was nice and it's surprising considering this is his debut, and the soundtrack fir the film very well. While the characters at times were a bit unlikeable, I could forgive this because I liked all the other aspects of the movie.That being said, this is one of those classics that has to be seen at least once not only because of its cult status, but also for its qualities and hidden meanings.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Powerful acting,Great story!!!!!!!!!","American Beauty is a 1999 American drama film directed by Sam Mendes and written by Alan Ball. Kevin Spacey stars as Lester Burnham, an office worker who has a midlife crisis when he becomes infatuated with his teenage daughter's best friend, Angela (Mena Suvari). Annette Bening co-stars as Lester's materialistic wife, Carolyn, and Thora Birch plays their insecure daughter, Jane. Wes Bentley, Chris Cooper, and Allison Janney also feature. The film has been described by academics as a satire of American middle class notions of beauty and personal satisfaction; analysis has focused on the film's explorations of romantic and paternal love, sexuality, beauty, materialism, self- liberation, and redemption.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
American Beauty impacted my life,"Middle-aged Lester has an epiphany about his dull life, and in the 20 years after American Beauty's release it seems Hollywood experienced one as well. This gritty, stylish and irreverent film is a shift from previous decades and the typical way that major studios do business.Lester experiences a series of shocks that he surprisingly takes in stride; fired from his job, cuckolded by his wife Carolyn, taunted by his teen daughter Jane, and more. Fantasy comes to the rescue for him in the form of Jane's friend Angela. While his world and the people around him crumble, Lester aims to live up to Angela's positive impressions of him and prove it is never too late to get it back.American Beauty impacted my life. After seeing it with my then wife Jennifer in 1999 in Arlington, Virginia, I vowed not to find myself in Lester's situation. It influenced me to be a park ranger even though it is ""McDonalds work"" to her.Though many of the characters in American Beauty act trapped, some such as Lester begin to realize that it is useless to try to live as others think or demand you ought to live. When they cast aside the pressure and control they are greeted with hostility. ""You can't go around doing whatever you feel like,"" says one of the manipulators, ""there are rules in life."" But there is also so much beauty in the world, and Lester and those like him vow to immerse themselves in it.American Beauty is an intriguing and artful portrait of suburban dysfunction and a middle-class underworld, but also inspiration for rising above circumstances. Compelling film techniques include falling flower petals, spotlighting, fantasy sequences, jarring music, mist, slow-motion, and more. Kevin Spacey(Lester) and Annette Bening (Carolyn) are perfectly cast. The film earned 25 times its estimated production cost ($350 billion, which is 120 times the entire budget of the agency I work for, the National Park Service). By non-Hollywood standards the film still is somewhat tame and I wish the film makers had been even more daring.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

look closer  and get into this black comedic gem.,"I'm forced to say that `American Beauty' is deserving (in my opinion) of its IMDB place. This movie was also rewarded, which is a good thing when undeserving movies continue to win each year generally (*cough* A Beautiful Mind *cough*).Story wise it can be summed up easily. There's the Burnham family, who have just moved into a new home. Lester (Kevin Spacey) feels tired and worn down by his job and his power hungry house-retailing wife Carolyn (Annette Bening). Their daughter, Jane (Thora Birch), in the usual teenage way, hates her parents and hangs out with her friend Angela (Mena Suvari) and the mysterious boy-next-door, Ricky (Wes Bentley). But it all becomes too much for Lester when he begins to lust after Angela and decides to make some radical changes in his life, in a blackly amusing take on a midlife crisis.`Acting? Well Spacey won an Oscar for his work and he can keep it. He's great here. He imbues Lester with, initially, a browbeaten weariness, that turns into a great line in sardonic behaviour. There's a great sense of fatalism about his character (apart from knowing his impending death), as if he knows his new life is a sham also. The fact that he can be incredibly witty but also show the human underneath it all (such as the bitterness directed at his wife), says a lot of Spacey's talents. Quite how he sunk so low afterwards puzzles me. Bening, who was Oscar nominated, is similarly great as a woman losing control. Her control freak nature, belied by a streak of insecurity, is all too believable. In fact all the cast acquit themselves here, all with a darkness inside them (in the case of Ricky and his family), or deep-rooted lack of identity (the Burnhams). Kudos to all.Story? Well Alan `Six Feet Under' Ball does a fine little job here too. The script has emotional drama and darkness (quite bleak at times too), but never loses its sharp wit. It's a balance that is very difficult to achieve but, bless Ball, he does it. The real comedy comes from Lester's newly found laidback observational take on life, where nothing seems to phase him. His reactions, bounced off other characters, can be priceless (his nonchalant snarky remarks to his wife's rival are hilarious). The comedy is never at the expense of the story nor vice-versa. It's too black for that. The story is tinged with a hint of sadness but with a small amount of hope too, with a lot of it summed up in the famous `dancing bag in wind' piece in the movie.Directing? Well Sam Mendes got an Oscar for his work here (against some excellent competition in the last good year for movies, 1999). Well done to him too. There's an excellent soundtrack for starters (Oscar-nominated). There's a great use of moody lighting and nice framing of shots, et cetera. The symbolic use of rose (American beauty is a type of rose) is actually handled in a manner that does not irritate, despite being somewhat heavy handed on occasion. There are some particularly lovely touches  such as the sharp cuts employed when Lester is engaging in a fantasy, that really help us delve into the character's psyche. Overall Mendes lends a very polished hand to an already polished script, and coaxes great performances from his cast.Is `American Beauty' perfect? No, but it is very good. It's most certainly worthy of a viewing to show how you how it is possible to do a drama laced with black comedy and do it very well. And how Hollywood can surprise us and produce an excellent script. More movies like this would be very very welcome. 8.7/10.",,Anonymous,Drama

Anti-American Beauty,"They live in the suburbs, therefore they are losers.That is the sum total of the wisdom imparted by this dreary, pointless and joyless satire of middle-class America, circa 1998. The amazing thing about the film is that the filmmakers (and apparently many in the audience) think this film is bursting with original ideas and deep insights. When in reality, this is a tired retread of antiestablishment cliches from the sixties. The only difference is that films as diverse as DIVORCE AMERICAN STYLE to THE PRESIDENT'S ANALYST to THE GUIDE FOR THE MARRIED MAN to I LOVE YOU, ALICE B. TOKLAS knew how to instill the material with pathos, despair and anger and still show a flair for the wickedly funny and bitingly satirical. AMERICAN BEAUTY is a mean, bitter and shallow examination of people who are mean, bitter and shallow. While those films were daring and fresh, BEAUTY is stale and dirty.Kevin Spacey plays the overworked, under appreciated middle-class corporate drone who drops out of the rat race due to a severe case of the middle-age crazies. Unfortunately, he may be out of the race, but he remains a rat. As played with smarmy snugness by Spacey, the character of Lester Burnham seeks, not inner peace, but self gratification. After resorting to blackmail to get his corporate freedom, he spends his newfound leisure time lusting after his teenaged daughter's cheerleader friend, berating his wife, experimenting with drugs and just generally being obnoxious. Spacey's much praised performance is largely without nuance or heart; a less sympathetic depiction of an ""everyman"" would be hard to come by.Despite the film's supposed antiestablishment slant and vaguely pro-drugs attitude, the film hardly embraces liberalism. The film is not only antifeminist, but anti-woman as well, portraying Lester's wife (played by the otherwise wonderful Annette Benning) as a shrieking, materialistic shrike. (How dare she find capitalism and the suburbs to her liking!) The other women are mere sex objects. And despite the fact that several of the filmmakers are openly gay, the film is condescendingly homophobic as well: The gay guys next door are used as a joke and when a villain is needed for the finale, out trots the neighborhood closet case.Good satire says ""This is us, aren't we something!"" Bad satire says ""This is them, aren't they pathetic!"" AMERICAN BEAUTY goes beyond bad satire. The filmmakers make no attempt to conceal their contempt for the American middle class, a group they obviously view with no respect, no sympathy or even a shred of affection. They do, however, seem to respect their moviegoing dollars.The film's tagline was ""Look closer!"" A bold invitation, considering just how little clothes this emperor is wearing.",2.0,Anonymous,Drama
Art,"I'm not a critic, and don't know any more about the process of film-making than what I've garnered from years of watching movies, but I know what I like, and I know what art is, and this movie is truly art. One of the many things it's about is the masks we all wear, and how well they protect the secrets that they were designed to hide. It touched me, excited me, made me so restless to explore the concepts within it that I didn't sleep much the night I saw it because my mind was so super-charged with ideas. It forced me to look at myself and everyone around me in a way I had neglected, or shied away from in the past. It gave me a new perspective - made me wonder if those masks we all so carefully-craft to protect us are really that: protection, or a prison we can't escape from. It changed me, and that's a priceless gift. I think Alan Ball's screenplay was genius, and Sam Mendes deftly drew something amazing out of the fine actors who populate this film, and then served it up unflinchingly. I am grateful for this movie. It will always be in my top ten. It's why I look at art-read-watch movies-listen to music...because there is always the chance - the perfect hope - that I will feel something like what American Beauty made me feel.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
This movie belongs in one's medicine chest.,"If you want to praise a movie to the skies, how do you begin...? These days it seems all movies need to have a morale. Without one, the movie is doomed to criticism, being too flat, or too simple. American Beauty has a morale; a morale from here to Tokyo. But it's not that obvious.There are several round characters in this movie, all of them are missing something in their lives, and they're all dealing with it in a different manner, one giving a better result than the other. Lester Burnham, the main character, is basically in a mid-life crisis, but there isn't a better way to deal with that than his way. He finds a way to put things into perspective and relive the happiest days of his life.But my real hero is Ricky Fits. His confidence, his soberness, how he doesn't care about what everyone thinks of him, how he rules over his own life, and how he sees beauty in everything makes him my big example in life.Since I've seen this movie my motto in life is: ""Today is the first day of the rest of my life."" And since I've seen this movie I too see more beauty everything that's around me. I started making pictures of the freakiest things that make my wife look to me with a very questioning face. And still this movie works as antidepressant. Whenever I see this movie, even again, I just feel better. I brighten up. I try not to watch it too often - I think I've seen it about five times now - because I'm afraid the effect's gonna wear out.I hope I don't give you too much expectations in case you haven't seen it yet. It's probably all just personal. But please do try to understand what I said.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Great, but certainly no masterpiece","I am shocked at the great reception American Beauty has gotten on the IMDB. #2, only behind the Godfather!?!? Come on! It was great, to be sure, but all of the film's sentiments have been expressed before, and better. The decaying family relationships were stated in the better film The Ice Storm. The idea that even in terrible situations, life is still beautiful was brilliantly shown in (what else!) Life is Beautiful!The one thing that the film did succeed in doing extremely well is the composition of shots. Watch the scene where the neighbor boy records Thora Burch with his video camera. We see the boy on the far left of the screen, staring at her offscreen. Burch stares out at the audience from the television. That is one perfect shot! There are several great scenes like this.The part of the film which truly bothered me, though, was the way they handled the inevitable shooting. Throughout the film, we watch every important character talk about killing Spacey, and we see them all next to guns. This set up reminded me of the ""Who Shot Mr. Burns"" episode of the Simpsons. I don't know about the rest of you, but I thought it was rather obvious who the killer was going to be. I think Mendes put way too much emphasis on the murder which he set up at the beginning (and by the way, did he have to tell us all this at the beginning in the first place?). No one could have screwed up the amazing payoff at the end of the film though. i believe the main reason this film touched so many people must be the last scene.

It is movie to exist forever,"American Beauty is great for me because I watched it once on Rusian TV, about month ago and I still addicted to it. I read a plot and bios of Sam Mendes and Kevin Spacey, a story how this movie were produced. And I realized that Sam Mendes from a good screenplay, small moneys, careful actors has made an outstanding movie. The plot was more crude and ordinary than what it became after cutting.  There were a story with the end known from the start, with an American court and people said something about 'you know, I will die sooner'. There was an obvious homosexuality of Colonel. In movie it is a surprise for an audience and confirmation of the deepest suspicions of the most devoted movie watchers. Kevin Spacey always played miserable worms without any shadow of attraction. He starts the same but in a few minutes we see him charming, sexual and benevolent. He collides with daughter, wife, employer only because he understands that he has misplaced his desires and does not live but survives. His family exists to show the success of his wife. Everyone around is a lier and everybody cripples lives of their dearest. Colonel Fitz treats his son extremely cruel to make him 'a real man'. Father is a latent gay and son suffers from his brutal cruelty and coldness. Ricky (a son) so used to hide his essence that real life has become a film for him and he finds himself in videotapes which he makes. Lester (Spacey)'s wife Caroline is the poorest woman in the world. None loves her and she even does not need it. Her lover is more business idol than a close friend. She lives for shopping of attributes of success. She and Lester see their daughter every day and know nothing about her. Lester tries to be free and happy. He does only really important things. He falls in love. He does not understand that he upsets the ideas of wife and daughter how he should behave that they want to kill him at least in their thoughts. He could be killed by anyone and at the end it is not really important that he is killed by Colonel who fools himself suspecting a gay in his son. The biggest hint in this movie for me that Lester sees in dreams his love (young girl) around roses which his wife cultivates but he does not realize it.",,Anonymous,Drama

Great cast, great writing, great direction, great character arcs.It speaks to a lot of universal themes that we all experience, even if we aren't going to drop out, smoke a lot of pot and buy a fast car.The people in Lester's life have stopped appreciating him and that distance leaves him depressed. His wife is cold, sterile and interested only in money. His teenage daughter is, well a teenager, and she's off to start her own life without her lame family.His infatuation with the hot young thing seems pretty cliché until you realize that it's just that that is waking up and making him finally live for maybe the first time in years.Throw in the mad genius philosopher-pot dealer next door and his spiritual awakening begins.I won't give away the ending, but it reminds us that we should all be grateful for what we have in this world.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Dark and Very Honest,to a Degree,","American Beauty is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding cast.When I first heard about this movie it sounded very basic,a father goes through a mid-life crisis,a subject many films and television series have focused on before,but American Beauty does it in a very different way,we are taken inside the mind of Lester Burnham,we can see exactly what dark thoughts go through his mind and how his passion for his daughters friend develops.Kevin Spacey delivers a truly magnificent performance,he really became this character and put himself in to his shoes in order to truly understand what this man was going through so he could deliver a convincing act,and he went on to win his second Academy Award,and I would say he deserved this even more than his win for Usual Suspects.I liked that the movie didn't just revolve around Lester,we also get to see how the different man he is becoming is affecting his wife and daughter,we get to see how they are changing as well in very dark and negative ways.I feel like everyone can relate to these characters in a way,obviously not as extreme as them,but we have all had times when we craved more excitement than our life delivers,and I think that this is why Lester is such a captivating character,because despite not wanting to,we can definitely relate to him to a certain degree.Dark and somewhat twisted,I would definitely recommend American Beauty to anyone looking for a good drama.A father becomes disillusioned and begins to hunger more excitement in his life.Best Performance: Kevin Spacey Worst Performance: Peter Gallagher",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
A perfect example of exceptional screenwriting,"There are few films, and I have seen quite a number, that have made such an immediate impact on me as American Beauty. As soon as I had seen it I was certain it was something a bit special. Most of the widely acclaimed ""classics"" have the special combination of a very strong storyline complimented by fantastic & complex characters (i.e. The Godfather). Alternately, American Beauty's strength rests entirely on it's wonderful characters, as there is no specific story line to speak of - it is merely a snap shot into the life of an interesting (to say the least!) and apparently ""regular"" American family.Ultimately, the movie's charm lies in the fact that no matter what the age and social status of the viewer, there are characters, or mannerisms of the characters, that the audience can identify with. For instance, Lester's contempt for the man he has become, for the life he has, that seems to have crept up on him without him even knowing or realising it. Or Janie's resentment for her parents - for their selfishness and apparent lack of genuine interest in anything she does. There must surely be countless middle aged men or angst ridden teenagers around the civilised world who could identify with such situations/feelings?For me, the truly unique quality of this film, was that after watching it and becoming completely engrossed in the wonderful array of characters it introduces us to, I actually took a little look at myself, at my life and asked a few questions that I hadn't consciously considered before...Movies that have such an impact are few and far between.

Like a drug,"This movie is like a drug. You watch it and you feel yourself laughing throughout the first half of the movie as it humours you a lot. Then this drug seems to wear off and at the end you feel different. Not depressed but rather enlightened. It numbs your senses.Life is beautiful and easy. But why do we have to insist on making it difficult. The films hero Lester is unhappy but wasn't always so. He has a boring job and feels trapped every single day. Just like us all right? You know it. We cant do anything about it because this is how things are right? This is what we have to do survive and be happy right? WRONG.You are wearing a mask and you can change your life anytime you want. Its only a choice. Lester realises this, and starts to make changes.This movie is wonderful. Watch it you must. Hear the messages you must. Life is short, and what we do of it now is what matters because there is only this moment",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Allan Ball's screenplay is a masterpiece.

True and Original,"...Unfortunately, as a critic once noted about the book under his review, the true parts aren't original, and the original parts aren't true.Let's start with the true parts. As most know by now, American Beauty follows the tragicomic trajectory of an unhappily married middle-aged bourgeois, whose attempt to escape the drabness of middle-class life through a passionate infatuation with another only succeeds in destroying the lives of all involved. Sound familiar? It should: Flaubert dealt with it 150 years ago, in ""Madame Bovary.""But it's not necessary to go back that far. Critiques of American middle-class culture are about as plentiful as McDonald's in Riverside: take Ginsberg's ""Howl,"" Heller's underappreciated ""Something Happened,"" and almost anything by Updike, Roth, or Cheever, for starters. In film, one doesn't have to look farther than Billy Wilder's ""The Apartment"" (literally, in my case: it's on TV as I type this). Anyone recall ""The Graduate""? """"I have one word for you: plastics"" was pithier and more penetrating about American mass culture than anything in this movie.  ""I've Heard the Mermaids Singing"" mined the theme of the misfit artist well before this, and much more affectingly. The related theme of ""sane"" American society as a lunatic asylum, and the ""lunatics"" as rebellious artists, goes directly back to R. D. Lang, and finds much better realization in that counterculture staple, ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" than it does here. (""Beauty""'s subplot deals with the relationship between a next-door neighbor boy, who, we learn, has recently been released from a mental ward.) And let's not even talk about the Freudian cliche of the homophobic military mentality, and its inexorable, violent desublimation.Even on smaller levels of detail, ""American Beauty"" says very little that hasn't been said before. The dead narrator device was done first, again, by Billy Wilder, this time in ""Sunset Boulevard."" Visually, director Sam Mendes likes to film the family scenes as statically as possible, typically relying on symmetrical compositions and austere interior shots to get across the sterility of Lester Burnham's existence. We've been here before. too--in ""Ordinary People."" (Mary Tyler Moore did Carolyn Burnham better in that film, incidentally, than the competently done, but two-dimensional portrayal given her by Annette Benning in this one.) The level of plagiarism is so thoroughgoing in fact that when the sensitive artist character is shown videotaping a dead bird (because, he explains, it radiates divinity), those who know the history of photography will recognize it as an Edward Weston subject, circa 1954.In other contexts these kinds of second-hand themes and imagery might be inoffensive, even hip in an allusive, post-modern way. But the one thing that ""American Beauty"" insists upon is the importance of purity of individual artistic vision, as exemplified in the person of Ricky Fitts, the sensitive boy-next-door artist figure, who obsessively videotapes the things that appeal to him. Why, then, does the film rely so shamelessly on the ideas and images of others?Perhaps the answer is that, when the film does reach for originality, it utterly fails to convince. Partly this is due to a failure of nerve. Unlike the anti-bourgeois, bohemian critiques of the 50s and 60s, whose contempt for middle-class values was unsullied by self-interest, ""American Beauty"" needs those very middle-class filmgoers, desperately. Otherwise, how is the studio going to make back the production costs? Thus, the film shifts the locus of the cultural rot from the ticket-buying, middle-class many, to the well-hated few: the SUV-driving yuppie. Everyone hates yuppies--especially the securely rich, such as Hollywood filmmakers. That's because no one really IS a yuppie--at least, in their own minds. So the film safely critiques a world that no one is likely to recognize that they belong to.Yet, strangely, the yuppie class signals are still all wrong. We learn in passing that Lester Burnham makes a very unyuppie salary of $60K a year, at virtually the same desk job that Jack Lemmon had in ""The Apartment""; and his wife is an unsuccessful real estate agent. How they support the trappings of an upper-middle class lifestyle is never explained.The critique of yuppie materialism is also meretricious. When Lester rails at his wife for fetishizing their Italian sofa--screaming, ""It's just a thing, Carolyn! It's...just...a...thing""--one wishes that Carolyn had gone outside to Lester's freshly purchased vintage convertible and keyed the finish, just to put his newfound ""antimaterial values"" to the test. But that would complicate things unduly.That the film's anti-yuppie pose is just that, is belied by its passing depiction of the neighborhood's openly gay couple. Alone among the film's characters they are depicted unironically as well-adjusted and outgoing--yet they inhabit the same sterile yuppie world as the Burnhams and the Fitts. How is that? One of two conclusions presents itself: either the film is equating the sterility of yuppie life with the sexual sterility of homosexuality (hardly likely, given the film's heavyhanded critique of homophobia), or the film is pulling its punches when it comes to the film's one PC minority. Neither reflects very flatteringly on the film.The film also tries to extend the metaphor of artist as rebel individualist by making Ricky Fitts not just a dope smoker (a standard trope of any Tom Robbins novel), but a dope dealer, and a highly successful one at that. Show of hands: how many of us pro-inhaling Clinton voters have ever known a virtuous, artistic dope dealer? I didn't think so. Yet Ricky isn't the only one who's virtuous--he seems to have only stolid, trustworthy clients and suppliers as well. Maybe this neighborhood isn't so bad--or so typical--after all?""American Beauty"" is expertly acted, beautifully filmed, and tightly plotted, with little surprises in all the right places and expensive production values wall to wall. In other words, it's much like the empty yuppie landscape it critiques. And it made scads of money at the box office. That perhaps, is the most telling critique of all.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Depressing &  humorless, a black eye on dark comedy.","I was never so disappointed in a film in my life.

Unadultrated Performance,"Well, Its arguably one of the most brilliant performances by Kevin Spacey. The devil apparently pulled another great trick. The central storyline revolves around a guy called 'Lester' who works for an advertising agency. The film brings in a lot of musings which redefines 'Crossing the line' issues for every character in the movie that is interestingly woven in an exhilarating plot.At some level, it boils to an individual's feelings of insecurity and his lookout for his/her companion.

Hilariously Interesting,"American Beauty is a romantic comedy that doesn't suck, which is a nice break. It follows a man stuck in an unhealthy relationship with his wife and eventually falls in love with his 16-year-old daughter's best friend. It's an unconventional love story, and it's done beautifully.The plot is great. It's presented in a very comedic way and it's actually very funny. It's interesting and realistic, which is a little surprising, but nothing ever felt out of place. The subplot is also very good, and while I think we've all seen it before I think that it was the more relatable and serious of both plots, which created a really nice balance of both fun and seriousness.The characters are quite good too. You have a good idea of who they are, and they aren't horribly far-fetched either. All of them were flawed people, but not so flawed and that they were obviously fake. A lot of them, especially Kevin Spacey's character, were very likable as well.Like I already said, the movie is very funny. But all the humor is done in a very natural way. During character conversations they might say something funny, but it's part of the conversation and further develops their character as well as furthers the conversation, so it exists as more than just a joke.Overall American Beauty is fantastic. The plot and subplot are very good, the characters are great, and it's incredibly funny without feeling forced. In the end I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this movie, so long as you're willing to be wowed.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

To everyone who likes to see a good satire and don't get impressed facing drugs sex or nudity.,"The Best: Annette Benning,  the smashing majority of the characters, the plot providing an actual satire and the touching directing The Worst: Kevin Spacey's office blackmail seemed came out of Fight Club'. The darker parts of the movie might be boring to some viewers, but those who think that are the ones haven't plunged completely into it. Rating: 7/10Alike millions of Americans, the Burnhams have a easy life in a nice house with green grass and a white fence in the outskirts of a big city. Lester, Carolyn and Jane Burnham are an attractive and kind family, but behind this apparent ideal life is hidden a big dysfunction. Lester, the narrator, reveals us that he hates his job, his wife ignores him and his daughter despises him. He feels his life completely on the ground but an encounter with his daughter's best friend wakes in him long time sleepy feelings that lead him into a radical change. This is the beginning point of a narrative that chronicles how a loser can become a winner even losing everything.The major strength of American Beauty are the well elaborated character interactions, that besides the Burnhams includes a teenager drug consumer/ negotiator, his father a rude ex marine core, Jane's best friend, a real estate manager lover of Carolyn, etc. In his directorial debut, Sam Mendes creates a singular, powerful, and intelligent master piece, about unhappiness, loneliness in the middle age, which tone varies between realism and parody showing Lester's possible redemption of his life, following what his heart tells to reach happiness even if it leads him into a tragic ending.

Takes normal life and turns it extreme,"American Beauty follows the narration of Lester Burnham, a completely average middle-aged working man. When he sees his daughter's friend at a cheer-leading display, he becomes instantly attracted to her. His attitude toward life takes a wild turn that impacts the surrounding community, ultimately leading to a tragic conclusion.While some of the individual segments of the plot are uninteresting, the good parts come together to make a compelling story. The snippets of Burnham and his new mentality are simply priceless; from the moment he quits his business job to the scenes revolving around his new job at McDonalds, it never fails to satisfy. It brings to light a more enjoyable and funny concept of the movie: the rejection of a ""boring"" life to ultimately have more satisfaction with oneself. Kevin Spacey excels as Burnham and deserves his Oscar win of best actor. Chris Cooper perfectly fits the character of Colonel Frank Fits. The rest of the cast is also convincing, although some of the teenagers could have been better played. The ending is brilliantly crafted and involves all the previous content that was introduced in the film.The usage of colors (mostly red) and symbolism (mostly regarding roses) is wonderful. It helps develop some of the nuances in the themes. Plus it makes the whole visual experience much more effective. The movie touches on many themes are all relevant to everyday life. It takes situations and emotions that we can relate with, and plays them to the extreme.It all comes together to make a visually and emotionally effective movie. It can be analyzed for the deep messages on intriguing themes or can be enjoyed at face value. American Beauty is by no means flawless, but it elaborates on themes and emotions in a way that few other movies can. Recommended for all viewers.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
All Along The Watchtower,"I just rewatched this movie after many years and what a masterpiece it is!As a film full of details and symbolism, the scene where All Along The Watchtower plays is just on point. Just like in Dylan's song, Lester starts out as the ""Joker"", wondering if there is some way out of his miserable life but not really doing anything other than complaining and being cynical about it. Until he meets Angela and her still untouched beauty wakes him up. He then becomes the ""Thief"", the other form of outsider who finds a way to survive as an outcast by challenging the status quo and speaking up. And there's Carolyn, his wife, who could be the ""Princess"" in the song watching from her watchtower of rules and morals how things are about to change. In fact, she's also rather curious about it.

A bit draggy,"I went to see the movie not only because of the heaps of nominations it received and the buzz surrounding it. But I like such dramas with irony, parody and dark humor.The starting was good, and held my attention and laughter pretty well. I was disappointed however when the movie started focusing on the daughter and her relationship with the neighbour's only son. In my opinion, it was on the excessive side. On the other hand, Anette Bening's character was fun, full of sarcasm and totally a high point. It would have been better if the movie could elaborate why she was such a control freak and so concerned with career success when she has everything she needs in the material sense.For a while too, it also appeared to me that the focus was on the dysfunctional neighbour family rather than Lester's. Again, we do not know why the mother (neighbour family) seems mentally unwell. Does the movie assume that the audience understand? Or expects the blame to be on the husband? I could not figure that one out too well.My final query is: what came over Lester at the critical point? Why did he not indulge in fulfilling his fantasy?",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

Kudos to writer Alan Ball, director Sam Mendes, score composer Thomas Newman, and stars Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Wes Bentley, Mena Suvari, and Chris Cooper, among others, for putting such a brave and provocative drama with a touch of unique humor that makes this film still a compellingly worthwhile experience to savor.
