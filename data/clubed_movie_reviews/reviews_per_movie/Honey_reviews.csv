Watchable for fans of the genre,"Pros: - Jessica Alba is likeableThe Dancing is good and frequentMissy Elliott, Tweet and other hip hop stars can be seen in cameo roles.It never gets too slow or too boringCons: - The characters don't feel realistic in certain situations...that goes for the plot too. For example, peolpe seem to know a dance routine by looking at it once.The plot is unoriginal, you know where ""Honey"" is heading.Summary: ""Honey"" is a likeable film, but you have to enjoy listening to hip hop and watch people dance.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
not that bad...,"After reading a lot of the reviews on this board, I thought this movie was going to be really bad however I found that this movie isn't really as terrible as some people have made it out to be. Jessica Alba plays Honey Danies, a hip-hop dance teacher hoping to make it as a choreographer, for someone who didn't have any previous dance experience, she sure does a fantastic job! Mekhi Pfifer is good in his supporting role as the barber with a lot of heart.This movie is something that has been done many times before so you can't expect an oscar nominated screenplay etc etc. However, its something you can enjoy and if you are into the music or dancing, then this is definitely something for youa 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"It would have been impossible for this or any movie to be as sweet as Jessica Alba, but that doesn't keep it from trying.","Any comparisons between ""Honey"" and ""Glitter"" are probably due to both movies having script-work by Kate Lanier (who, funnily enough, isn't listed on the completed movie)... and, of course, to their having slightly similar plots. Except that ""Glitter"" is likely to be more of a black mark on Mariah Carey's book than ""Honey"" is on Jessica Alba's.This movie about a kind-hearted young woman in New York who uses dancing to help the people in her neighbourhood (the people that she meets when she's walking down the street... sorry, couldn't resist) and who's plucked from a nightclub to become the Paula Abdul of the 21st century - she even has a little mole on her face - is aptly named; it's as sweet-natured as its title character and has little if any benefit on your system, except to slip down nice and easy and leave not very much behind. It's filled with all the realism you'd expect from the producer of ""Legally Blonde"" and ""Josie and the Pussycats,"" but it's not quite as much fun as either. Part of it is a personal thing (the Rodney Jerkins-executive produced music that permeates the movie isn't my thing, rhythmic though it is), but the thin, originality-challenged scripting and silly dialogue are more of a problem; when our bartender-by-night/dance-teacher-by-day heroine tells a kid ""Your flava's hot"" it's a little embarrassing, although in fairness ""Honey""'s street talk doesn't make you wince as much as some other examples of this kind of thing.To be honest, the movie pretty much goes in one ear and out the other; there's not a single truly dramatic moment, with the setbacks coming on cue (when Li'l Romeo's character gets arrested it, and many other moments in the movie, plays like a less-than-brilliant After School Special) and the characters are right out of Cliches Central, from the almost saintly title character to the sexually predatory rival dancer. (And note to the filmmakers: as anyone who's ever watched MTV, VH-1 et al will confirm, music videos don't credit the choreographer on screen... regardless of what the one that plays next to the movie's end credits might say.)But it's impossible to really hate ""Honey""; the movie's too harmless and good-tempered for anyone to get into a hissyfit over its drawbacks, and though the R&B-flavoured cameos mean a lot of people who see this movie will probably be going ""Who's this Tweet person?"" Missy Elliott is genuinely funny in her very brief scenes. The dancing's also good, which is one of the main reasons to go and see movies like this; and though it doesn't actually seem to have anything like a narrative drive (it just seems to end instead of climax), there have been worse movies from music video directors, e.g. almost anything directed by Russell Mulcahy.Oh yes, Jessica. She doesn't quite seem like the streetwise type, but she isn't supposed to be; she looks the part and comes off reasonably well, as well as having the edge over Jennifer Beals in ""Flashdance"" in that she actually does most of her own dancing. This isn't really the best vehicle for her, to be honest, but Jessica's an undeniable charmer on screen, and far too sexy for this or anything she's been in (with the arguable exception of ""Paranoid"") to be an unbearable experience. All she has to do is improve her choice of scripts...",,Anonymous,Music
"Oh, are you fo' real?","I got a three pack on a DVD at Wal Mart for ten dollars a few weeks ago and Honey was on the cover, never saw the movie, wasn't really interested when it came out, but I figured why not see it for ten dollars? Sounds silly, but who knows? Sometimes you find little treasures here and there that are cheap, plus, I remember that this was the film that really introduced Jessica Alba to the movie business industry. Of course, she's really huge now, and judging from this film, Honey that I watched last night, I have to say other than her looks, I am surprised she made it this far. I don't mean to sound horrible on the film or anything, but this just seemed like a giant rap video for me and the plot was way too average and predictable with some cheesy street slang.Honey Daniels has three jobs: a bartender, a sales girl at a CD store, and also a dance teacher at her mom's little business to keep kids off the street. But more than anything, Honey wants to be a music video back up dancer. Her wishes come true when a director, Michael, welcomes her to the dance floor and makes her a choreographer. All her dreams are coming true, until she realizes that she forgets the more important things in life that mean so much to her. She eventually wants to open a club of her own to help out the neighborhood kids.Honey has the typical street slang which I didn't find attractive, you just can't take it seriously. Alba, she's such a pretty girl, BUT, I'm very sorry, the girl cannot act, I didn't feel an ounce of sympathy or compassion for her character, she played off as this naive little thing, when she could have played it more smart and strong. Not to mention what was the whole Missy Elliot dialog? ""What is this? This? This? Ugh? Ugh?""... it was supposed to be funny, but Missy comes off flat. Mekhi should have had more screen time, the guy is the only one with talent in the film. The dance moves are good, but I just wish they wouldn't have made this into a giant rap video.2/10",2.0,Anonymous,Music
A pleasant surprise,"I stumbled on this while channel-surfing and was pleasantly surprised. Many positive messages tucked in to an appealing story acted out by a surpassingly attractive cast: Be true to yourself; follow your dream (but don't sell out); love your neighbor, stay loyal to your friends, your family, and your 'hood. It reminded me of when I saw Krush Groove as a teen and it gave me a window into a whole other world. Except now hip hop is the dominant pop culture and not exotic anymore. But we still rarely get to see positive characters of color with their emotional depth fully explored. Lil Romeo gives an especially nuanced performance.",5.0,Anonymous,Music

"Jessica Alba so Freakin' Hot, but the Movie Sucks","Hehehehe, of all the movies to watch on vacation I watched this one. Tsk, tsk, unquestionably awful. Stupid doesn't even begin to describe this movie. The dialogue, the acting, everything was just absolutely abysmal. The dancing is good, but cmon I don't pay $3 to rent a movie to see some interesting hip-hop moves. The plot is so contrived, none of the characters are believable and the only funny part is when this one biatch gets her hair extensions ripped out by a sassy soul sistah. That had me peeing my pants laughing practically. The only reason it earns 1 star from me is because Jessica Alba is dancing around in tight clothing. What can I say? The girl has a rockin' body. Grade: D-",1.0,Anonymous,Music
The star of the show,"Jessica Alba is the star of the show; in this movie and in Hollywood since I don't know when. Her situation is something to detail about. Personally, I look at her and I think she has acted her whole life. Everyone talks about her everyday as if she had decades in the business, but she doesn't. I could say I believe she's done over ten films, when this movie was probably her fifth important role. She did a TV show I never saw for two years, but even before that, her name was on the poster of the movies she appeared in. She is a star by nature, a leading star; and ""Honey"" is the evidence that proves my statement.When the film starts, Honey Daniels (Alba) is working at the bar in a disco serving the usual free drinks to her best friend Gina (Joy Briant): ""One, please"", the friend says, and two guys standing right by her get closer: ""Make that three"". Honey, with a big smile in her face, tells the guys: ""Today is your lucky day"", and then Gina interrupts: ""Don't get to excited though; she'll not be here much longerShe's gonna make it"". So the guys ask how she's gonna make it.Right away we find out Honey dances; and that she dances awesomely well. If Alba did her own dance moves I don't know for sure, but it always looks like her; in the dance floor, in the videos, in the dance lessons. OK, the film: Honey has a great talent for dancing and she could be a classic ballerina but she prefers to teach hip-hop in a place her mother owns. She goes to auditions, she works hard, and she ultimately gets recognized.But Alonzo Brown and Kim Watson's story is not about ""making it""; it is about the good-hearted people who fight for what they want, don't sell and don't quit. I don't even know if this is a veridical portrait of the hip hop world, but the video shoots seem real and I guess the artists/directors relationships should be how the movie shows them. What I wanted to say is that in the music world, mostly with hip hop (which I consider the easiest market today), when people make it, it goes over their heads, and they leave everything behind.Although not Honey Daniels; she'll not fall into temptation, and she'll be there for the ones she cares for. It may sound too formulaic, but it's beautiful. Debutant director at the time Bille Woodruff, with previous experience from musical videos, shows us the nice face of his characters' world. Everything is shiny, everyone's happy, everyone's smiling. Yeah, sure some bad things happen, but everything will be ultimately worked out.Great casting work with the youngsters, especially with Zachary Williams as a little boy, Raymond, who needs someone to watch over him; and Lil' Romeo in a tremendous and talented performance as the teenager Benny, who debates himself about being a gangster or a normal child. This plus Missy Elliott's cameo and Mekhi Phifer in the most charming performance of his career, and the some of the best lines as: ""You peoples? Playa, playa, how'd you swing that? I've been trying' to be her peoples for weeks; ain't had no luck"".Not enough? Alba looks gorgeously beautiful in every outfit she wears and her acting skills are way above the film's requirementsShe's stunning now and it is only the beginning.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

Delightful and Enjoyable Feel-Good Movie  A Homage to Hip-Hop and for Those Who Fight for Their Dreams,"In a poor neighborhood, the choreographer Honey Daniels (Jessica Alba) works in a record store during the day and as a bartender in a night-club in the night-shift, and teaches dance to teenagers of her community. She dreams to be successful as a video-clip dancer. When she meets the video director Michael Ellis (David Moscow), she believes that her dreams have come true. When Michael discloses his real intentions with her, she decides to struggle for making her dreams really come true.I have just watched ""Honey"" because of the name of Jessica Alba in the cast. Fortunately I did not pay attention to the unfair and very underrated IMDb User Rating. ""Honey"" is indeed a delightful and enjoyable feel-good movie. Certainly it is not a masterpiece, and it will never be indicated for an Oscar, but it is not its intention. ""Honey"" is, first of all, a great homage to hip-hop, with the participation of many stars such as Tweet, Missy Elliot, Blaque, Jadakiss, Ginuwine among others, and awesome dance choreographs. The story has a good message that everybody must fight to make the dreams come true. The stunning Jessica Alba is wonderful in the role of Honey. The story may be corny for bitter viewers, with most of the characters being nice; horrible, for those who have prejudice against poor people or hip-hop; or great for a viewer that appreciate a great entertainment like me. The music score is fantastic, and the DVD released in Brazil by Universal is outstanding, full of wonderful extras. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Honey  No Ritmo dos Seus Sonhos"" (""Honey  In the Rythim of Your Dreams"")",8.0,Anonymous,Music
not much edge in Alba,"Honey Danels (Jessica Alba) is trying to make it as a dancer in NYC. She's a bartender at a nightclub and teaches hip-hop dancing at a local youth center. Video director Michael Ellis is taken with her dancing. He makes her a star dancer and then a choreographer. Gina (Joy Bryant) is her best friend. Chaz (Mekhi Phifer) is a barber trying to keep the youth center going. When Honey rejects the controlling Michael's advances, he cuts off her career at every turn. Meanwhile she's trying to keep Benny away from the pull of the gangs.Jessica Alba has the acting chops for this simple dance movie. This is very much a simplistic dance movie. There is limited edge. Alba doesn't have enough street in her. It's nothing new. The dancing from Alba is good but not acrobatic. Although complaining about this movie is like kicking a new born puppy. This movie doesn't have a mean bone in its body and it's perfectly watchable.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

well-intentioned but silly film,"Credit `Honey' with at least having its heart in the right place  even if its brain isn't always so easy to find.  The ever sunny and optimistic Honey Daniels holds down two jobs in her increasingly hectic life  a bartender by night and a hip hop dance instructor by day.  She has hopes of one day appearing in a music video, a dream that comes true when she catches the eye of a big time producer named Michael Ellis.  Not only is Honey a smash in her first video appearance, but Michael immediately hires her as choreographer for one of his projects.  As is typical in these strive-and-succeed tales, Honey soon discovers that success is not all that it's cracked up to be when Michael reveals his true colors, setting up conditions for her continued employment that she hadn't quite counted on (in other words, `put out or pull out').  But the always-undaunted Honey is not about to be knocked down that easily.  She uses this little setback to start thinking less about herself and more about the street kids whom she sees turning into drug dealers and gangsters right before her rose-colored eyes. Filled with a righteous zeal and determination, she rallies the neighborhood to raise money for a new dance studio that can get the youngsters off the street, channel their energies in a more positive direction, and turn their lives around.Only the most Scrooge-like curmudgeon could object to the positive, laudatory, pull-yourself-up-bythe-bootstraps message the film is trying to convey, and one would have to be downright inhuman not to feel uplifted by the final dance sequence.  But good intentions and noble aspirations do not, in and of themselves, make for a quality film, and `Honey' is a long way from fitting that bill.  The movie wants to be taken seriously as a realistic view of urban life but very little of what we see ever rings true, starting with Honey herself who, with her invariably perky demeanor, seems like a cross between Little Mary Sunshine and Mother Teresa in form fitting jeans and matching halter top.  Everything that happens to her  from her meteoric rise in the music video world to her purchase of an empty store for her new dance studio to the benefit performance she and her dancers stage to raise the money for the project  all come about way too easily and with virtually no noticeable effort on her part.  We never believe for a moment that any of this would happen in this way in the real world.  Thus, `Honey' is really little more than an urban fairy tale, fine for children, I suppose, but not of much use for adults with a more pragmatic understanding of how life actually works.Jessica Alba is no great shakes as an actress, though she has an infectious smile and a bubbly demeanor that work well on screen.  But it is Zachary Williams, as the adorable, gap-toothed eight-year-old Raymond, who steals the show.   Now that is one hell of an endearing little kid.",,Anonymous,Music
Not Part of the Demographic,"As a middle-aged white Englishman with no interest in hip-hop music I must admit that I am not part of the demographic at which this film was aimed. (I had no idea, for example, that Tweet, Jadakiss and Ginuwine, three performers who appear in it, were actual people rather than fictitious characters, although I had just about heard of Missy Elliott).The title character Honey Daniels is a New York dance teacher; her mother would like her to teach ballet in a prestigious dance school, but she prefers to teach hip-hop to the local street kids. Her dream is to become a famous hip hop choreographer working with big-name stars. She thinks that her dream has come true when she comes to the attention of Michael Ellis, a successful music director, who is able to find her choreography work with some of the big names in the industry. Unfortunately, Honey and Michael have a falling out- he wants a romantic relationship, she wants a purely professional one because she already has a boyfriend, a local barber. After Honey makes it clear to Michael that she is not interested, he ends their association and does all he can to sabotage her career.Honey is the daughter of a black father and white mother. (Apart from Michael, who is white, nearly all the other characters are black). I was therefore surprised that she is played by Jessica Alba. (Apparently Beyoncé was the first choice, but she was unavailable). I suspect that today considerations of political correctness and worries about cultural appropriation would prevent the casting of an actress of mixed white and Hispanic ethnicity in the role, but there was evidently less concern about such matters in 2003. The past, even the comparatively recent past, is another country where they do things differently.The heroine's Christian name is an appropriate one- Alba plays her as ultra-sweet and sugary. It's probably an appropriate title for the film as well, because the plot is almost drowning in sweet, sticky sentimentality, with plenty of irresistibly cute children. The cast put plenty of energy into the numerous song-and-dance numbers, but as I said this sort of music isn't really my thing. Those who like it will doubtless enjoy the film more than I did. 4/10",4.0,Anonymous,Music
You call that a movie?,"This is just dumb. If Jessica Alba and Li'l Romeo (and other guests) didn't star in this thing, I would have never watched it. I mean I don't really hate her, in fact I'm 1 of her fans but this movie is just a movie that suck.Why is this dumb? SImple. It's because the storyline is so gay that I can't even dare to think about it again. The script is written by a bunch of people who wants to make this film a li'l bit more 'hip-hop' looking (actually not). This thing actually make me laugh! I wonder how can somebody write things like that. Yea, I do! But I will never write these things for a movie. However, the OST is really remarkable. It includes Nate Dogg, Jadakiss, Sheek and rappers like that. This point gains 2 marks for this fruity movie.OK. We have 2 points, but how about the lst point? The dance moves. The dance moves are simply the coolest dance moves ever. They're way coooooooooooooooooooler than those in that movie with Omarion in it (the one about a dance crew called li'l saints).

A good watch - Don't take it too seriously,"Although this movie may remind you of other movies - it still is decent on it's own stance - It sends a good message to people - And gives hope for young people on the streets with wasted talent - Honey is about a young woman who gets the chance to become a choreographer for some of the most popular R&B singers - Prior to this she worked in a club as a bartender and also taught Hip Hop at the local community center - Betrayal, lust, hope, fighting for what you believe, and great dancing are the words that come to mind when describing this movie - It's no ""Save The Last Dance"" but hey - who doesn't like ""Honey""!?! - The problem with movies is they are never what you expect - and sometimes exactly what you expect - Don't hold your standards too high because this is no Academy Award winning movie - but it is a little bit of a gem, liked mostly by true movie buffs -",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"Despite what critics said, just give the film a chance.","Yeah, I know that the film was ""formulaic,"" ""stupid,"" & ""just plain garbage,"" but just give the film a chance. It was not as nearly as awful as ""Glitter"" was. Jessica Alba is just way too beautiful that you cannot take your eyes off her. Your eyes almost literally become glued and fixated on her. So... just go along for the ride and have a good time. Don't take it too seriously like ""Lost In Translation,"" ""Mystic River,"" or ""City Of God."" The film may contain abundant cliché elements to it, but once it gets going, the beat gets stuck in your head and you cannot get it out of your head. Casting for a particular movie, whatever genre, makes a huge difference and definitely a determining factor of the outcome of the film's success. The film may be considered a ""mixed bag"" in general, but it was a huge vehicle for Jessica Alba. Just take this film for what it is and have an open attitude for it. The film may be easily forgotten, but Jessica Alba would not have ""Sin City"" or ""Fantastic Four"" without this film, which is single-handedly responsible for getting Jessica out of the two year hiatus after ""Dark Angel."" And I know that people are going to launch of barrage of criticism telling me otherwise, but you have to admit, Jessica Alba's an excellent dancer, isn't she?",7.0,Anonymous,Music
another movie to the record,"I've seen many less entertaining films than this. Replace Alba and the music & dancing though and I've seen maybe two or three.. As a movie this is really a disaster. The plot is extremely predictable and acting for the most part far from good. Also the fact that there may only be half a dozen people on this earth that can pull off lines like ""your flavour's hot!"" doesnt contribute (and Jessica for sure isn't one of them). I read someone before commenting that the video director character didnt seem to have depth. I'd say his looking down and fiddling with his electronic gizmo all the time made him look somewhat unsure of himself, which added to his all evil act just about made him the most complex character seen here. So if you think you'd enjoy the music, or if you just want an excuse to watch miss Albas pretty face for a moment, or you're a hardcore Disney fan you might bear the 90 minutes of Honey show. Otherwise you'll see it for what it is; a great display of a movie executed with zero ambition.",2.0,Anonymous,Music
Don't pay out Honey!,"I thought it was a great movie with a good storyline about a girl with a dream of making it big, helping out those who can't have that life.

The dancing was awesome and Jessica Alba was amazing as Honey Daniels.

Even Alba's looks couldn't save this mess...,"* out of **** starsYeah, yeah we've seen this before over and over. Small time dancer looking to make it to the big time breaks into the big time through luck of chance and communicates with kids through dance, while her parents hate what she does urging she get into another more distinguished profession, she begins breaking it big time, cue cameos from hip hop stars, and becomes a little too big for her friends, falls in love with the guy from the hood but is torn between her career and her man, la di da, and while I really wanted to like this movie, simply for its appeal and the first twenty minutes which really had me amped, this is pretty badly done.The film, which is a retread of so many films with the same story and themes along with plot elements that are badly recycled from movies like ""Dirty Dancing"", ""Saturday Night Fever"", and I swear to god ""Sister Act"", has nothing new to offer. So we have Honey Daniels (Marie was taken), who loves to dance, the girl loves it and she teaches dancing at the local community center during the day, whether for pay or free it's never indicated, but she works at the bar at night, where does the chick get her energy? And where can I buy it? And, by luck of fate, is recruited by a video director after winning in a dancing duel (is there any other?) with a rival dancer and begins her career in the music video industry.Now it's never indicated if she plans on being a dancer, a video dancer or just a teacher, but she has the best of intentions! The really hot neighborhood girl with a heart of gold, don't ya just love them? And we're never sure if the boys hang around her to dance, because she's nice, or if because they're trying to catch a peek at the good. And she begins to get more famous in the video industry with her skills choreographing dancers and becoming a hit in the industry.Now the plot resolution is a bit thin and very jumbled here with a story that goes everywhere including a romance with the local barber whose badly set up with no back story and they get involved with one another. The problem is there's no conflict between Alba and Pfeiffer's character and their romance, there's no obstacles or chemistry so their relationship and focus of, is just boring, so inevitably Pfeiffer has no reason to be here other than as a plot device.Then we witness a lot of sub plots involving the neighborhood kids including Lil Romeo who plays a local kid on the way to juvie with a life of crime, and we witness Honey get into the life of a music star directing videos, and of course canoodling with ""famous"" hip hop stars like Ginuwine and Tweet, and she experiences the same conflicts you'd expect like facing off against obligatory villains, and, suddenly out of the ballpark, comes this odd sub-plot where she conveniently stumbles onto an abandoned gym for sale and wants to raise money to teach and have the kids get off the streets and on the dance floor, but she doesn't have it, so she makes a bargain with the bank to give her thirty days to raise the money. Why thirty days? You naive fool, to stretch out the movie.So, we have a plot development in the second half that should have been the focus of the entire film (raising the money for the center) while we tread through really bad sub plots and under-developed characters including her mother who has no emphasis and wants her daughter ""to see everything in the world"". Considering they're a low class family, it's pretty impossible to travel around the world, and we never know if the mother pressures her daughter because she's an overbearing witch, or because she wants the best for her daughter. Some mothers would accept a really fine, really beautiful, smart, talented and popular dancer whose good with kids, but, parents, you just can't please them sometimes.So, Honey decides to raise the money for her kids and with a lot of plot holes including one big one involving Lil Romeo's character committing a crime, a lot of cheesy elements like a running gag with musician Missy Elliot searching for Honey to have her in her video which wore thin really quickly with Missy's over acting, not to mention there are the always lovable villains of the story which aren't needed but they're there to get the plot moving.Poor Jessica Alba is so far - fetched in her ghetto fabulous get up and horrible slang she delivers in every other word and her delivery just wasn't believable and it's hard to swallow her as a girl from the Bronx while her character is oddly drawn to the local neighborhood kids who are really annoying, there's even a really badly done scene in the barbershop where Honey meets Chaz played by Pfeiffer. So after the dumb hokey climax that really didn't make a lot of sense, and closing credits that really didn't register, we realize we've wasted a valuable amount of our time, only to catch a glimpse of Jessica Alba in a leotard. It's why I watched.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
Bees make Honey,"This movie was on television when I woke up. I think it was on the ""Diva"" station (this is in Canada). Jessica Alba is an unconvincing music video choreographer. She says a lot of hilarious slang all the time, which sounds like an 8-year-old wrote it. Actually, every word spoken in this film sounds like little kids pretending to be adults. I don't know if Alba is trying to have some sort of Latino vibe going on, but it seems almost offensive.There was some sort of thing going on about her teaching kids how to dance, and trying to weasel them into a Ginuwine video.

A lousy hour and forty-five minute music video with one of the worst scripts ever.,"Poor Jessica Alba, her movie career is not starting off good with this extremely long music video. Jessica Alba's TV series Dark Angel was canceled last year and Jessica has now begun her career as a movie actress. Will she make it? Well we will see. I think as long as she doesn't have any more movies like this, she should be fine. I'm sure by now everyone is wondering why this movie is so bad. Well continue reading to find out.As I walked into the theater tonight to watch Honey, I had a bad feeling about it. I like Jessica Alba, she is very attractive and played her role as Max on Dark Angel very well but to me this movie did not look very good. I had a free ticket for the movies, so I figured what the hell. So I sat down and watched the movie. Honey is about a girl named Honey Daniels (Jessica Alba) who works in a club at night and the center (centa as they say in the movie) during the day. All her friends think she has the `moves' to become the world's hottest dancer. Honey is supposed to be poor and live in section 8 but she looks to well dressed and happy to be living in section 8. But that's not important to the filmmakers. Well to continue on, Honey then one day gets a visit from record manager Michael Ellis (David Moscow) at the club, who discovered her because he has spies, who visit the clubs and videotape girls dancing so that he can discover new talent. Honey does not believe who he is at first and then of coarse realizes he is a big manager in the hip-hop industry. Honey then becomes a mainstream superstar, and forgets about her friends and blah blah blah, we already seen this before. The funniest thing to me is this, the movie all of a sudden tries to be a family film by showing street kids, selling drugs and Honey trying to make them discover that their better than that and should all be dancers. The movie gets worse as it goes along and it tries to become way to serious and family oriented. It's final moments remind me of something out of sister act and it is really bad.As for the acting, well Jessica Alba tries; I guess I can give her that. It's a bad script, she tried to make it work and show she has some talent, but her character had way too much `slang' dialog, which to me made it really bad. David Moscow, who played Duncan on my favorite TV show Zoe, Duncan, Jack & Jane, was horrible in this film. I mean his role was laughably bad. I laughed at him being the token white guy in the movie and trying to talk like he was from da hood.  To be honest, his character made this movie. It wasn't supposed to be funny but I cracked up every time he came on screen. As for Lil Romeo, who makes his feature film debut here, he is off to a lousy start. He was so annoying in this film. His challenger in both the music and entertainment world, Lil Bow Wow was off to a better start with Like Mike, which was a very likeable movie. The movie also has a lot of other hip-hop and R&B artist cameos including Missy Elliott, Tweet, Shawn Desman, Ginuwine, Jasakiss & Sheek. There is enough hip-hop & R&B music and cameos in this movie to make it watch able for the hip-hop & R&B fans in the world but sadly I don't fit into this category.The script was horrible. The dialog was like something a five year old would write. The script was like Glitter except they realized it was like Glitter half way through which is why the second half of the film was all about getting kids off the street and moving them into the dance studio. It's part Glitter part Ghetto Oliver and ends with sister act. It's really sad how the writer wrote this screenplay and didn't realize how bad it was.As for the director Billie Woodruff, who is a music video director should stick to the music videos. I guess he was trying to make a hour and 45 min music video but why go pay $5 to $10 bucks to see a music video when we can watch MTV at home for free.So in conclusion, Honey is a total waste of time. If you're a fan of hip-hop & R&B or club dancing then maybe you will like Honey but for anyone who isn't into that music or dancing then this movie offers nothing. It's a very confused movie that never knows its target audience and has one of the worst scripts I have ever seen made into a movie. My final rating for Honey is a 2/10.",2.0,Anonymous,Music
Good for music and dance lovers,"I watched this movie with no expectations at all, I was surprised because I've seen all other comments before watching it.. I thought it was a great movie, I was so entertained and I've probably watched it 4 times in 2 days. But I love music and I love dancing so that had probably a lot to do with it.. So if you love hip hop and to see dancing go watch this I loved it and I'm getting it for my self. The characters where not at their best but when you sum it up I would still give it a 6 or 7 for the music and dancing in the film and I'm going to see it again and I know what I'm getting. I think a few of you are to hard on this film and maybe you just don't like hip hop or dancing I don't know but it certainly reach the same level as you got served yet a great movie. So I will recommend this film but only to those who respect and love hip hop and dancing.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Decent,"I have just watched ""Honey"" because of the name of Jessica Alba in the cast. Fortunately I did not pay attention to the unfair and very underrated IMDb User Rating. ""Honey"" is indeed a delightful and enjoyable feel-good movie. Certainly it is not a masterpiece, and it will never be indicated for an Oscar, but it is not its intention. ""Honey"" is, first of all, a great homage to hip-hop, with the participation of many stars such as Tweet, Missy Elliot, Blaque, Jadakiss, Ginuwine among others, and awesome dance choreographs. The story has a good message that everybody must fight to make the dreams come true. The stunning Jessica Alba is wonderful in the role of Honey. The story may be corny for bitter viewers, with most of the characters being nice; horrible, for those who have prejudice against poor people or hip-hop; or great for a viewer that appreciate a great entertainment like me. The music score is fantastic, and the DVD released in Brazil by Universal is outstanding, full of wonderful extras. My vote is eight.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Surprisingly Entertaining,"After everything I had heard about this movie and how horrible it was, I sat back and prepared myself to cringe as this movie played.  Surprisingly enough, I found myself enjoying what I was watching.  The music was lively, the dancing was entertaining, and the message was a good one.  The message, I felt, was be yourself, strive for what you want, and never give up your dreams.  All things I think are important in life.The characters were stereotypes yet appealing.  The story was feasible, idealistic, and very formula.  But, as bad as the critics crushed this movie, I don't see what was so wrong about it.  It's fun, musical, easy to follow, and not so dark and serious as so much of the movies we see today. Despite what you've heard, I think if you give this movie a chance you'll enjoy it.  I did!",6.0,Anonymous,Music

There was absolutely nothing interesting or intriguing about this movie whatsoever.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
An excellent movie,"This was a very good movie. My favorite part was when Honey's friend snatched out Trina's hair at the beginning of the movie. Now that was funny! Honey is just a typical girl in the music world that wants to make it in the future as a video girl. Not just any video girl, but a dancer. There were many obstacles that approached her, but she don't let it hinder her from making it. She takes it as a lesson learned. She later becomes a choreographer and makes it big. People like Missy Elliott wanted her to organize dance routines for her. Her own mother does not like what she does. But she does her thing for the children in her community, so that they would not grow up, waking up, looking forward for the bad things in life. She is a life saver to some, like Lil' Romeo and his little brother. Through it all, she becomes successful no matter was brought in her way. She became her own woman.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

"Like honey, it leaves you wanting more","Part Fame, part Flashdance and part 8 Mile, Honey is a movie about an aspiring dancer who makes it to the big times only to realize that fame and fortune are no substitute for helping neighborhood kids.Jessica Alba plays the title character Honey Daniels, a hip-hop dance teacher at the local center by day and a bartender and dance floor extraordinaire by night.  It is during one of her late night dance floor gyrations that she is videotaped by an assistant for a famous music video director that sees Honey's talent and immediately hires her to be part of his dance pack.At first, Honeys dreams seem to be coming true.  She is working with top hip-hop talent doing what she enjoys the most, dancing.  And it is not long before the director's confidence has Honey choreographing the dance troupes.Ahh, but wait for it, here comes the necessary plot diversions to stretch out the story and give us that warm Hollywood hug of a character that defies the odds and follows her dreams.First, there are the street kids Honey meets while leaving the nightclub one evening.  These kids are talented and do dance moves that had my bones creaking just watching them.  Honey is enamored by the children and takes on the crusade of trying to keep them off the streets and in her studio where the two groups could learn dance moves from each other.Then there is the evil video director (Michael Ellis) who at first seems sincere in giving Honey the fame and opportunity but later turns when she shuns his sexual advances.And finally, in-between and vying for Honey's attention are her best friends who get pushed aside when fame overcrowds Honey's datebook and the local barber (Mekhi Phifer  8 Mile), who pursues her affection and eventually wins her heart.Honey is one of those films that if you can't relate to the music or the class of characters being thrust in your face with rhythmic impulses, you are probably not going to enjoy it very much.  The characters are all pretty to look at, but we've already seen pretty in Coyote Ugly and Dirty Dancing to a better result.It's not that Honey is a terrible film, it's just that it isn't very original.  Did we really think that her friends wouldn't be estranged only to reappear at the end in loving homage?  Did we really not see the Mekhi Phifer character and Honey teaming up to try and raise money through a benefit concert?  And the director who seeks sexual payment for his given opportunitiesof course he was going to blackball her and then see the error of his ways and apologize later.  Been there, done that.Maybe I just don't get it.  I wasn't raised in the hood, nor have I aspired to be something that only costs a few thousand dollars and my dreams to accomplish.  Funny though, this movie made me wish I was.  The kids all wear clothes and shoes that I only pass in the shop windows or when looking on-line at things I can't afford.  And if I had the encouragement of absolutely everyone around me to try and put on some kind of benefit that might reward me for being a good person, well giddy-up.Don't get me wrong, not everything in Honey is negative.  Some of the songs were tap toeing and the kids were definitely cute even if they were from the typical type casting of young-kids-from-abused-families-that-peddle-drugs.But to review the movie as a whole, Honey is probably an appropriatewww.gregsrants.com",4.0,Anonymous,Music
If only they had remembered to include a plot...,"This movie, if the director had cut out all of the acting and concentrated on 90 minutes of music videos, it would be immensley more entertaining. Ms. Alba was at the screening I attended and admitted she did not know how to dance prior to being signed for the movie. This was very evident in the movie when she was surrounded by actual dancers. The plot was extremely contrived and is full of ethnic stereotypes. From the evil Black drug dealer to the rich White yuppie drug buyer. Interestingly enough, Ms. Alba's Hispanic roots are completely ignored, perhaps to escape any comparison to Jennifer Lopes as she repeatedly stumbles over the ethnic slang that predominates the dialog. The screen play could have used a little bit more humor to counter balance the sometimes dark subject matter. The ending made little sense and reminded me of a scene from ""The Brady Bunch"" as they had to put on the 'Big Show' to raise money.",,Anonymous,Music
"In the end, 'Honey' ends up being a jazzy, fun dance film","Honey (Alba) is a sexy, tough music video choreographer who shakes up her life after her mentor gives her an ultimatum: sleep with him or be blacklisted within their industry. When she declines his offer, he fires her and makes sure she doesn't get another choreographer job.'Honey' has it's heart in the right place even though it's brain veers of course sometimes. Alba leads the cast well and adds much pizazz into the dance scenes. Missy Elliot has a good cameo. The dance scenes, obviously, carry the film with fun moves and songs. The final dance number is definitely the best scene in the film and it brings the movie to a good, refreshing close. So, even though it is uneven, In the end, 'Honey' turns out to be a jazzy, fun dance film with it's heart in the right place. ***",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Possibly the worst movie I have seen,"This film is terrible. Based in the same kind of genre as ""you got served"" this film is going to appeal to an incredibly small minority of people. Unless you are particularly into synchronised ""hip hop dancing"" this film will leave you wondering why you just sat through it. The main character can't act fantastically well, the story line is also weak and easily predictable. I would recommend this film to young people into hip hop and are easily impressed by a group of people dancing in time together. If you are over the age of 15 though this film should not appeal to you in the slightest. This was a waste of an hour and a half for me.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
Terribly generic and predictable film,"I just saw this movie last night. And I loved watching it, only because I love my gf and if she is happy with something then I am. If I wasn't with my gf, then I would have hated this film and never ever have seen it, for it is a complete waste of time.Well, maybe not. This movie is really for for two kinds of people only. Anyone under the age of 10 and people who love hip-hop culture and the icons that go along with it(my gf is the second obviously lol). I like hip-hop music and all but a movie that is just trying to cash in on the current hip-hop craze will just not do it for me.First the writing was horrendous. Characters were all one-dimensional, and were really just plot devices, and had no depth or feeling whatsoever. The dialogue literally sounded like it was written by a 10 year old, which is why 10 year olds would love this movie. It was extremely predictable! Actually I knew what was gonna happen throughout the whole movie before it even started. As I said it is a movie about hip-hop culture and if you know anything about that then there will be no surprises. But I guess that is why it is written like that because you are not supposed to be using your brain throughout the movie, just your instincts and hormones. Watching the women in tight revealing clothing dance like they are having sex with the air, and watching everyone else get into fights.The acting was equally bad. I'll never forget the guy during the opening credits who is talking to Honey asking for a free drink. It honestly sounded like he was reading those lines off of cue cards. And I wouldn't be surprised if he actually was! Everyone was bad! Bad! Bad! Bad! Maybe the only screen presence that was mildly entertaining to watch, was Missy Elliot. Although, she only had two 1 minute scenes (sorry M.E. fans), she was funny.Billie Woodruff's directing was also equally unimpressive which I have to say was surprising given that he is a music video director, and the music video scenes were just so bland, and booooring. I guess being a good music video director just doesn't translate very well to being a good movie director.Please if you are considering watching this movie, save the $10, and go see either Last Samurai (although severely cliched and laden with egotistical stereotypes, I'm sure is still a LOT better than Honey), or What Alice Found (Amazing drama, with top quality acting, writing and directing, even though it doesn't have all of the hype and mass marketing of Honey or Last Samurai). But then again if you are under 10 or you just go crazy for anything associated with hip-hop culture, then go out and see it now, cause you will love it!",1.0,Anonymous,Music
this movie is awesome,"This movie is wonderful, because it's great dancing on hip-hop music, but there is also A storyline that's perfect for this movie. The humor is great and the street culture is used for the storyline(it actually tells young girls and boys to get out of the thug life, because there are other things in this world then shooting someone because he disrespected you, i mean that's stupid). And Honey(Jessica Alba)has this really great strong personality, and there is one scene that's really great, that's when the director try's to seduce Honey to have sex, but when Honey says STOP IT, girls like Paris Hilton would think, ooh geezzz, i probably surrendered myself and let him screw me. This is A movie every (Beginning)celebirty must see, cause then they understand that Hollywood is SOMETIMES pretty corrupt.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Surprisingly entertaining,"Having the opportunity to see Alba on screen again was enough of a reason for me to rent this movie, even though the reviews had been less than wonderful. What I discovered in this cheesy lined, somewhat predictable flick was an entertaining mix of music and dance with a nice little ""feel good"" story line. I can't wait for the Alba to be given an opportunity to really act. She has great potential but she hasn't yet been given the opportunity to display any of her talent (except her beautiful good looks - men want her and women want to be like her). All in all, the acting here isn't fantastic and the story isn't something we've never seen before but it does contain some really great dance scenes and some not so bad moments as well.7/10 An entertaining evening!",6.0,Anonymous,Music
A movie can only be predictable if it has a plot to predict,"Like my summary says, this movie can't even be called predictable, as it needs a plot in order for that to happen. Any faint hope of conflict was either wiped away within 5 minutes, or danced away. When entering this movie, I thought that it was centering around the main character getting her big break in music video dancing, however when she reached that goal within the first 30 minutes, it seemed the movie just draaaaaagged on for the next hour, with the odd interruption of an exciting dance sequence. When we finally see a good conflict, it turned out to be simply the end of the movie, and not a good conflict at all. So in total, you start the movie, see a faint glimmer of a plot, have that glimmer die within 20 minutes, watch an hour long music video, then have it end. How great.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
A positive and entertaining film,"This film is about a young dancer who has a chance to make it big by choreographing the music videos.""Honey"" is a uplifting and vibrant film.

"How simple, charming dance flick it is.","One of the first films in the revolution of modern dance flicks, though I know I saw it too late. Nowadays there are many films are coming out since the younger generation showing very interest in the dance. I especially don't know how 'Step Up' made a successful franchise, but the sixth is on the way.Honey is a main character's name played by Jessica Alba. A passionate dance, choreographer, when her dream coming to true that hits a roadblock for some reason followed by other issues. So now she has to come up with a solution to solve all the problems and that's the film tells how she overcomes them all at once.A simple story, even the choreography was ordinary, but not a bad film. I anticipated Alba to give a show that not to forget for the decades. This is now obviously a decade old flick and disappointed with her character, especially with her dance moves. But young Alba in a sexy pose on the poster, no one can just ignore it from watching.Overall, I enjoyed it. Since I'm watching it delayed, I should not compare it to the present scenario. Even though it has been only 13 years, in which all the fields rapidly advanced, so the dance. I suggest you just go for it with an empty mind if you want to see it. Soon I'm going to catch up with its sequel, but I know it won't be as decent as this one.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Music

Not only with her dancing but her chops in the more dramatic scenes with family, friends, and the youth at the community center.The clothes in this film. The early 2000's baggy look in full effect. The jerseys everywhere worn by everyone. It is fun to see all those now old school player references from the NFL and NBA: McNabb, Urlacher, Iverson, Sprewell...Flutie? Yes, a Flutie San Diego Chargers jersey can be easily spotted as well as numerous Oakland Raiders jerseys.And what's Lil' Romeo doing walking around, by himself unattended at all hours all the time in this movie? What's he, like, five years old in this?It's a trip to see Fonzwoth Bentley in the mix at the barbershop. I always enjoyed his roles during this time period. Jadakiss plays a big part of this movie, and I had forgotten about him. Tweet also plays a hefty role and full disclosure, I really don't remember her as a musician at all.The director Billie Woodruff, himself a real life music video director made two of Toni Braxton's greatest videos for two of her greatest songs, Makin' Me High, and Un-Break My Heart from that glorious time of the mid-90's.Missy Elliott bats cleanup at the end of this film and does a fantastic job. Loved her then. Still love her now in 2023.Again, this is a timeless tale of a girl trying to make it and at the same time, save a community of young people.If you want to revisit the fashions of visors worn upside down and hear the proper usage of terms like, feemin', then Honey is worth all one hour and thirty minutes of your time.It was totally worth all one hour and thirty minutes of mine.

Just as ridiculous as you'd expect.,"""We just peoples.""Can you believe that I actually went to the movies to see this? Sure, I was like 16 at the time. And I was on a date. But that's still kind of embarrassing.   You usually couldn't get me to touch one of these movies with a ten foot pole. The whole ""dancing"" genre just does not appeal to me in the least. But there's exceptions to every rule, and Jessica Alba is an exception to every rule. So against my better judgment, I gave Honey a try.Every imaginable cliché from this kind of movie is conveniently collected here in one neat package. The impossibly sweet and sunny heroine with a heart of gold, who achieves her dreams of dancing, but must deal with the sinister pitfalls that come along with success. The stern, disapproving parent, who is totally convinced that their child is throwing away her talent. The rift that grows between the main character and her friend, as her career takes off. The perfectly diverse, multicultural cast. The whitewashed, sanitized view of ""urban culture"", where the only bad guys are the drug dealers (whom the precious children are saved from in the end, of course). And the horribly unnatural ""slang"", that no real person on earth actually speaks like. Some of the meager entertainment that Honey has to offer, comes from how forced and hilariously awkward the dialogue is.Your tolerance for all that could possibly be much higher than mine. I'm the guy who automatically turns up his nose at any dross like this, churned out just to appeal to young urban (a.k.a. black) people. Surprise, some of us are immune to this kind of derivative, pandering nonsense.What I am thoroughly UN-immune to, though, is attractive young actresses. The star of this movie, in particular. So maybe I'd better climb back down off my oh-so-high horse. Getting to see Jessica Alba half-dressed and dancing around suggestively - holds some appeal for me. Not nearly enough to rescue this movie, but enough to make me not rip it out of my DVD player and throw it in the garbage. What can I say? I'm male.",4.0,Anonymous,Music

"""Honey"" is sweet, but is otherwise empty.  6/10","I typically try to stay away from movies like ""Honey"" because they appeal to such a limited audience. It's basically music video flash and glitter - the ""Flashdance"" of the 21st century, made for a braindead audience raised on MTV. I was raised on MTV unfortunately, so naturally I fit into this film's demographic, which is why I did like this movie, though it faded from memory very quickly after viewing it. Jessica Alba is sweet, to say the least, and she truly comes alive as Honey Daniels, who dreams of being a music video choreographer. She storms the dance floor in the local club and eventually gains the attention of a prominent music video director who wants her to work with him on his projects. Of course, this puts a strain on the life she already has with her friends and family, as well as her commitment as a dance teacher at the local community center.This movie resembles ""Flashdance"" in a lot of ways that are too numerous to mention, but that did not stop me from liking ""Honey."" Jessica Alba gives a great performance and I'm probably sure it was her that kept the movie from going off the tracks. Unfortunately though, it is her and only her, plus a few exciting dance sequences that really make this movie memorable. That is why I rated it a ""6.""

Not a bad dance flick but nothing special,"Honey has a dream to make it in life with dancing and she gets her big break when she is offered a job to be featured in a music video and a dance choreographer. The film had some decent ingredients although not very original, but it's a shame that the outcome is boring and predictable. It has some flashy dance moves in it but nothing remarkable, if I just wanted to watch some dancing I would watch some bboy videos instead. The part about Honey(Jessica Alba) being a good samaritan plays a big part near the end, but after the first hour, I was bored and just wanted it all to end. When I first saw the trailer, I was interested but nothing I wanted to rush out and see. But finally got around to watching it, and although the movie isn't that bad compared to other dance flicks out there it's nothing special either. If your interested or like hip-hop music videos give this a shot.

honey dances,"OK the film was corny, but think of what it is trying to say. if you believe in yourself then you can do whatever you want. the acting wasn't so good, but hello check out the dancing. have u ever seen dancing like that. i find it disturbing that u don't find the dancing at all good. i am a dancer and the choreographing for the dances was utterly superb. getting kids of all ages to come and show that level of skill. i bet that you don't know anybody half as talented as those dancers. that was professional dancing, if you don't agree go ask a top choreographer. i suspect that you haven't really looked at the film and the message that it is putting across to the viewer. dancer is a fantastic hobby even if you think you cant dance. try going to classes or getting a friend to teach you. i want to conclude this but saying. DANCING RULES.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
watch it for the dancing,"I watched this movie for the dancing, for the music, for the cameos and because I think Jessica Alba is gorgeous. So I quite enjoyed it! But if you're watching this movie and expecting a proper storyline, believable characters and any sort of surprises in the plot... you'll be very disappointed! Its a very predictable movie, and most of the characters are very two dimensional and there are some very cringe-worthy lines (""Your flava's hot!"").BUT... its still good fun, and the dancing is fantastic. A good movie just to drift along to, and if you're into hip hop and rnb (like I am), you'll enjoy the music and cameos as much as I did. Watch it for the dancing, not for the plot, and you'll be happy!",7.0,Anonymous,Music
This movie is cliché-o-rama.,"I watched this movie with a cousin of mine. She is into this sort of thing - acting like your hip-hop, dancing, and clichéd teen drivel. But even she couldn't take it. Jessica Alba is totally miscast as Honey, a character that is some sort of Latino, but Alba is too white to play. Honey wants to be a dance choreographer, but encounters obstacles, such as a horn dog mentor who wants her to sleep with him, or she'll be blacklisted. Along the way, she tries to help Lil' Romeo's character, a young man on his way to a life of crime. Really. This movie is totally ridiculous. Lil' Romeo tries to pull off a grown up and tough persona but fails. Miserably. So does Alba, who, between this and Dark Angel, has lost the ability to act. People could say that this movie is good because of the dancing, but I see the choreography as contrived and over-sexual to make up for the fact that it lacks the same things this movie does: any sort of groove or flavor. This movie, while not the worst, could be a slight train wreck, right down to the cheesy and predictable ending. If you're a teenage girl who like hip-hop and teen movies, go ahead and watch this. If you're anything else, stay away.",2.0,Anonymous,Music
it wasn't that bad.,"i just saw the movie and then read that guys comment on being the worst 1 hour and 45 min. something or another. I admit it wasn't great and on the phony side, but it wasn't lousy. if your not expecting so much out of this movie like he was then it was ok. the movie was mostly for people who like that kind of music. and yes Jessica Alba was dressed too nice for some one who is  living in  section 8. but to tell you the truth I didn't notice it until i read that guys review. i just enjoyed the movie and didn't look for all the wrongs in the movie. i thought it was worthing renting the video. i don't really think it was worth the money if i had seen it and the show. but to rent the video it was ok.",,Anonymous,Music
the acting was at best novice,"the only reason why this movie was not rated 1 is because of Jessica Alba. I'll be fair and say that the only reason why i watched this movie is because Ms. Alba has Hollywood's sexiest body, and I thought I couldn't miss this film, regardless of how bad this movie is... WRONG!!!but... in all fairness, i give it a 3 because Ms. Alba is the sole reason for picking up this movie.But... twenty minutes into this movie, I quit watching. It was a terrible waste of time, I think Jessica is drop dead gorgeous but even then she doesn't save this film from blowing so much.first, let me just start off by saying that this film lacked a plot. its plot was too predictable and a no brainer. second, the acting... i'm sorry but even a 10 minute skit by seventh graders is more believable. After watching this movie, Saw's acting seemed a lot more credible, in fact, dare I say, compared to this movie, Saw was Oscar-caliber.it's a pity that jessica can't act, maybe she should switch over to being a model, as she fits perfectly.all in all, this movie is mainly for kids who still dream big, i for one don't dream big anymore so don't really care for this. and it's also for those who love hip hop and dancing, which i figure i'm too old for. if you aren't any of the above, watching this is going to be a complete waste of time. and also, if you're none of the above, seriously, DO NOT watch it if you've got nothing else to do, that's how bad this is.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
Not a deep story but overall a nice one,"The entertainment industry is probably one of the biggest fields to get into. At least from a natural progression. There are those who have a meteoric rise to stardom but this has only recently come about with the advent of social media. Prior to this, a lot of this was based on reputation, branding and perhaps internal sacrifices. How this was done wasn't spoken of very much because it either was considered not important, confidential or it was actually something more. Again, more recently it has come out that some people were pressured into doing certain things no one would repeat. Unfortunately, this is what many people have believed what this particular work place has turned into. It also gets a little hard to believe just how successful some performers become without this coming to mind. However, when someone does make it big and sticking to their gut and morals, those are the best stories to hear.This movie focuses on this kind of story, following the heroine of Honey Daniels (Jessica Alba). She is a up and coming dance choreographer looking to take her career to the next level. Every day she strolls into the hall her mother (Lonette McKee) rents out in a dilapidated building. People show up and enjoy their time together while practicing their next show. Although everybody looks out for each other, the streets can still be dangerous, which is why Daniels is friends with Chaz (Mekhi Phifer) and Gina (Joy Bryant), who knows how to keep trouble at bay. The script was written Alonzo Brown and Kim Watson in their only theatrical credit. They do have experience in other projects but much of it belongs to music videos, which make sense. The same could be said for the director.Heading this project was Bille Woodruff, a director who has worked with the likes of Toni Braxton, Céline Dion and the Backstreet Boys. The reason why he was chosen for this is quite obvious due to his music video experience. From a story experience, it is a mixed bag. The execution is fine, but the writing itself is very been there, done that. As mentioned before, hitting it big most of the time in the entertainment business means sacrifices have to be made to move up; some of which are inappropriate. This is where Michael Ellis (David Moscow) comes in. Ellis happens to catch Daniels doing her work and becomes her mentor. He's the guy with the access to everything upwards but of course he'll push for what he wants too. It's as cliché as it gets but also probably what many have to come to expect.The acting from the cast is fine. Jessica Alba although not acting much now and is still very successful, does fine here. This would be the movie that put her on the road to starring in Sin City (2005) and the Fantastic Four (2005). Mekhi Phifer and Joy Bryant both play good supporting roles to that of Honey Daniels. Lonette McKee as Honey Daniels' mother is good too. KcKee was in films like The Cotton Club (1984), Jungle Fever (1991), Malcolm X (1992) and Men of Honor (2000). Lastly David Moscow was good as the guy with connections although his role was fairly straight forward. The strongest feature to this movie should be at the least its choreography. Thanks to Laurieann Gibson, that was achieved. Although she had some credits prior to this, Gibson would move on up to other celebs like Madonna and Lady Gaga.Assisting in that visual contribution was John R. Leonetti who was already well established for his skills. Having worked on films like Child's Play 3 (1991), The Mask (1994), and The Scorpion King (2002), it is fair to say he was ready to take on the music genre too. Leonetti's camerawork blends seamlessly with the dance moves and makes it feel very much like an extended music video. Which is no surprise as the film score to this feature is not really there. Apparently Mervyn Warren, who also composed for Steel (1997) and A Walk to Remember (2002) wrote music for this too. Although that's a little difficult to say where because much of it is taken up by the music played for the dancing that happens throughout the entire film. It's probably there but likely no one will be trying to find where it plays.The layers to the story and music are quite thin and uninspired. The story itself though is understandable, the actors are good in their performance and the dance choreography combined with the camerawork entertain on the level that it was intended for.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Pretentious Pap,"I watched this movie because it was kind of... on... I knew I would regret it but I spend too much time trying to avoid awful movies so I thought ""Time for a change"". Big mistake. The movie is totally clichéd and totally unbelievable. ""Honey"" (sister of Peanut Butter and Strawberry Jam) is so ditzy she would not have stood a chance against the ghetto culture she is up against. She is 'attacked' by a gang leader but kind of... walks off... and then jokes about buying some mace. Wow! I wish more ghettos were so covered in marsh-mellows and honey-flavoured-muffins! Good to see a rap movie staying so true to its culture.The emotional manipulation in this movie is just nauseating - she attempts to help a kid getting involved in gangs by getting him a hair cut. Good job Jess: you've shown him what important; heaven forbid that he grows up thinking that only looks matter. Her final advice to him is just genius: ""Don't go back there."" This movie should be a used as a textbook for social workers: It has single-handedly solved the problems of child delinquency and gang warfare.Toward the end of the movie, the 'bad guy' fires all the kid dancers (after a truly ridiculous set-up) and then then ""Honey"" feels sick and nauseated as a black dancer gyrates next to a car. What?!? She has just *directed* and *choreographed* whole sequences of lewd trashy dances, and now she takes the moral high ground? Reflect on this: the movie is morally bankrupt, but it hides this from the audience under a thin veneer. ""Honey"" builds a career by objectifying women and flinging them around half-naked in front a camera like pieces of meat. But that's OK 'cos shes fulfilling ""Her dream on her terms."" Yeah good.I know! Let's really save the movie by starting a charity to get young kids to learn how to be sex slaved media whores in (c)rap music videos! That will really tug at the heart strings of the prepubescent audience who fantasise of being a sing-star. Heaven forbid we do anything to complicate or question their rancid desires which will only lead to heartache. Let's pander to them to get more bums on seats. (Scantily-clad ones, preferably, that are ready to flaunt themselves in front of a video of dissipation.) It's not just that there is no acting or talent on display. It's not just that the characters are shallow and say stupid things like ""I'm just your friend, not a main character in this stupid movie"" (OK I made some of that up). It's not just that the plot is horribly contrived: ""Oh, I happen to know thousands of millionaires desperate to throw their money at your stupid cause."" It's that this movie is crap, but just refuses to admit it. If it did, we could have had a masterpiece on our hands, like Crossroads or Glitter. But alas.",2.0,Anonymous,Music

Sweet as its name.,"This movie is sweet - which fits Jessica Alba, since she's very sweet (get her and Charlize Theron in a movie together and we'd all get diabetes).Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland would have felt right at home in this movie, with the idea of putting on a big show to raise the money for a Good Cause.It's not a deep movie, and not an ""important"" movie, but it's very watchable, the dancing is pretty cool, and who could forget the lineHoney's best friend: ""You're not ducking?

Honey....I lost the plot.,"An incredibly awful hip-hop themed dance movie with as many clichés as a daily soap-opera. Alba plays the lead role of Honey Daniels, a would-be hip-hop dancer, who suddenly changes career direction to become an in-demand hip-hop video choreographer. This is where the movie fails from the very start. We are led to believe Honey's fortune is in dance, not a behind the scenes role. Thus , her ambition and drive is negated by the backtracking nature of the script which was obviously written by marketing executives wanting to capture the hip-hop zeitgeist. Alba is also problematic as Honey. This girl is not ghetto enough it seems, and she comes across as too sickly sweet to be a dancer/choreographer of any magnitude. With Alba, you feel you are watching parts Halle Berry would have thrown away in the bin. Worse still, Missy Elliot makes an embarrassing cameo that should add some much needed credibility points to her resume. Honey...I lost the plot would be a better description of this awful movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
Non-fiction,This move is real. It is base on a woman named Honey who is really awesome and my daughter's dace teacher n NYC.This movie portrays her dancing pretty accurately but believe me she is awesome!Any way... I can't say much more than I absolutely positively love this movie. By the way there s another dancing movie (not related) coming out containing my daughter's break dance teacher. If you don't believe me that this movie is real then ask any New York competition dancer if she exists and the will say she is the best in this business!Okay they won't let me submit unless this s exactly 10 lines so I guess I'll just waste space be saying that she sells seashells by the seashore and peter piper picked plenty pickled peppers that were positively popping!,10.0,Anonymous,Music
"Enjoyable, but not for the serious buff","I'm not in the demographic that should love Honey, but I enjoyed it. I certainly wouldn't recommend paying night-out prices for it, but it'll be a decent rental, and was very enjoyable for my 11-year-old daughter (the one who insisted on seeing it on opening day) -- she gave it a 9. Jessica Alba plays a Mother Teresa-as-hottie type character (think Cameron Diaz as ""Mary"", minus the comedy), Mekhi Phifer as a barber (as IF!), and a few cute ghetto kids who dance... all pretty much 2D stuff, but as eye candy it works for kids or innocuous dates. The movie's been compared to Flashdance, and I guess one could hardly fail to notice the homage in Alba's off-the-shoulder 80s style. Alba is part Jennifer Beals for the new millennium and part Jennifer Lopez pre-J.Lo attitude and Affleck, but she's gorgeous and she's got all the moves. You could do worse.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

actually a very nice movie,"An opinion from R. Deniro movies fan. 'Honey' is not the Movie that drives you crazy, makes you cry or makes you want to try to become a hero and save the planet. When I read the description I thought that ""Coyote Ugly' http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0200550/, has similar plot and got a slightly higher grade. One of those movies which make you flow into a fairytale atmosphere and go out from the darkness of the reality. Really sweeeet. Of course you know that everything is going to have a happy end. I liked the performance, actors, dancers, soundtracks. And yes, you can predict the plot of the movie but it does not spoil it. I hope it will make you want to throw away the beer-cup and try to dance, at least try it. Nobody watches LOL.",,Anonymous,Music
I can bear this Honey (DVD),"I don't like Hip-Hop, Dance and Choreography!But, nevertheless, I found this movie interesting: Jessica Alba delivers a very sincere interpretation, in which she can express a lot of different feelings.The cast is cool, especially the teens and the close friend of Jessica. For me, Joy Bryant is a new face and I think she steals the show!The story is more about dreams, friendship and dedication than about music, dances!If the bonuses are really boring (the videos, the making-of for videos, an endless deleted scenes), the commentary of Jessica with her then boyfriend-director is fun to listen!Finally, a rather good surprise!",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Alba excels.,"I'm surprised that Jessica Alba hasn't had bigger roles in other films. While Honey won't win any Oscars, Alba made the best of what she had.The film involves Alba, playing the character Honey Daniels, trying to make the big time as a music dance choreographer. The plot is predictable- Honey tries to reach the top, but won't do it by leaving the people she cares about. In the end, it turns out how you expect. The middle ending. She doesn't win, but doesn't lose. What we call in England a score-draw.The lack of a climatic ending takes the brass off what was a decent movie. Alba was the perfect character for the role- having the ability to be funny, sexy, classy, girlie, clumsy, amongst other things. There are a lot of notable cameos, including Missy Elliott. Also look out for Lil' Romeo (Benny) and Zachary (can't remember his surname)who plays Raymond. Alba leads the cast well, and her command of the role is impressive. She has to beware that she won't get stuck in the dance-teen-chick-flick genre. It'll be interesting to see her in bigger roles. She is rumoured to be in other films such as Fantastic Four and Sin City, roles which should ask more of her as an actress.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
The Question/Exception of Honey,"Anyway, a comment about the movie that has OBVIOUSLY been touched before: It's a great dance movie. Dance people will like this movie. It has good dancing. It has OK music, especially the Tears for Fears cover that surprisingly was at passing level. The movie also has the same clichés that some dancers might have faced. It also contains a lot of clichés that a lot of other people can understand since they don't know how to read. Especially about clichés: I love how the characters are very argumentative and how they always have the perfect thing to say. The clichés work in such a way that my figure skater friend will like Ice Diaries, and hopefully she's not reading this review right now. Who cares if Jessica Alba can't act - I can relate to it! So basically, big movie lovers will attack this movie, or as my sister calls this movie, ""a video."" It's a dance movie for the sake of a dance movie and not because it was made to be a movie. If you know what I mean.Which then leads us to better questions: Should movies be made for purposes like this? And because this movie was made for this intention, should it be disrespected? Was this movie even made with an artistic and aesthetic purpose in the first place? It's up to you.I also hate how EVERYONE in the movie is stick thin.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Average feel good dance movie,"Honey is quite the feel good dance film. Starring Jessica Alba, in one of her breakthrough films. She definitely does a good job and her character is likeable and easy to root for.As many dance films, there is a predictable story that it follows but it was expected. Nothing exactly stands out and nothing comes as a surprise. Particular we know that the music director which enrols Honey (Jessica Alba), is ultimately not what he seems at first. We were simply just waiting for the inevitable turn or mess up.The dancing is solid for fans of this music genre, including real life artists cameos. The ending is a solid enough feel good wrap to the story.",5.0,Anonymous,Music

$10 for an After School special?,"I just came back from a screening of Honey. What a GOD AWFUL film this is...It is WAS better than I expected, but not by much.If you're fans of the rap stars appearing in the movie, your only going to see them grunt out a line or two, if that much. Being that I hate most Hip Hop, I didn't know who the hell most of them are. I still don't. They have no character what so ever and could have been CG'ed into the film. The only one I knew was Missy Elliot and she come off like some kind of hip hop clown girl. If I were her I would be beating the crap out my agent for getting me involved in this thing. All the other rappers at least seem ""normal"" for rappers. They literally just lend their face. To spite what street cres' they might bring, they could have been played by any wanna-be. Fans of the artist will be left uttering two words. ""That's It?""If you're interested in Alba's hot dance moves, just watch the commercials. That's pretty much all of them. I was an am still a huge fan of Dark Angel, and I love Jess as much as I can love any woman I don't actually know. BUT... Her acting isn't there. She doesn't have the emotional commitment she had playing Jessica Simpson on Mad TV. Honey, the character, comes of looking like a good hearted ditz. As an authentic Bronxite I can assure you there is no such thing as ""Honey"". Living here give you, if nothing else, a strong survival instinct.Mekhi Phifer wanders through the film with his ""Hey, Cool Aid!"" smile. There is ZERO chemistry between him an Alba.Lil' Romeo could team up with Jake Lloyd and do ""Attack of the Cardboard Cutouts."" Boy should stick to music because every line out his mouth sounds like some one claiming they didn't fart, when we all know they did.David Moscow plays the villain and is the only person in the whole film that shows a realistic emotion. Even he's victimized by the script. After being a semi-likable sleazy music video director, he turns into complete asshole when ""Honey"" slaps him after a drunken, unwanted advance. He's still got the best acting in the film.Joy Bryant is probably the most interesting new faces in the film, although the script has her as some street hood bitch pulling an ""Original Cindy"" best friend role to Alba. She's one to watch however.The real dreadful part is the music. I don't mean the Hip Hop either. The Hip Hop was actually survivable, and I don't like that musical style. No I'm talking about the original music between scenes. It's like the worst buy-out music from a bad 80's TV movie. It's so bad me and my friends couldn't avoid laughing at it. It's like it was cut in from some other film and totally blows the continuity of style with the film. I can't believe any one but Al Smithe took credit for that.The real problem is the script. Sitting at the restaurant talking after, we came up with no less than 30 plot devices that could have made this a kick ass film. But the writer avoids drama like the plague, instead pounding us with the same god awful cliché's we've seen on every TV drama we've for the last 30 years. The story is SO one dimensional it's almost delusional. The dialog is painful listen to. I don't know why they let writers who perpetrate these horrors... HAVE FINGURES! The is THE worst example of screenplay work I've ever seen. Drama, is always about conflict. The conflicts in this movie are unbelievable. Not in the over the top way, I mean they just don't hold true.Billy Woodruff's direction is visually unimaginative, but competent. There are some scenes where a particular camera move almost gave some feeling. He might be good for doing music video's but he need WAY more practice to do feature films. Of course, given the written material he was shackled with, it could be said he pulled off a miracle in directing.I thought this film would be a bunch of thugged out fools delivering 'tude to show how ""hype"" they are.I didn't even get THAT! It would have been more interesting if it was filmed as a Mockumentary on video, and it sure would have been cheaper.The movie lacks anything even close to a soul with character's so massively undeveloped that you end up not caring enough to even dislike them.If you MUST see Jessica, hey, it's your money. Otherwise, wait for this to be an afternoon special on free TV.I give it 1.5 out 10 stars.",,Anonymous,Music

Talent is becoming so scarce and dreams are becoming so out of reach. In this movie we are shown dreams aren't always what they're made out to be. Real life takes a tole in this movie.

Do not waste your time.,"Cliche after cliche, oh my goodness, can somebody say ""trying to hard""? This movie was flat out bad. The concept of the movie was just recycled from other films.The dialog was so terrible. I might as well have turned off the volume and just watched the screen, if that much. The writers need to get out of the industry.The acting was less then mediocre, I was surprised by that, I expected Mekhi Phifer to do a much better job, but then again he wasn't in the movie much. As for Jessica Alba... I was so let down, I don't know, it wasn't really her acting, it was her fit in the role. Her character in the show Dark Angel, worked. Her character in the movie A Sleeping Dictionary, worked. But for her to play a dancer, and a dance choreographer, all coming up in an urban neighborhood. No did not work at all. She is supposed to be a dancer in music videos, but her look pretty much did not fit the role, she is good looking but, her body was too skinny, rear was too flat, and chest was not big enough, for the role she was supposed to play. The script also played a big role with her bad performance. I am probably giving her too many excuses, pretty much, I was really let down by her performance. The only person that surprised me was Lil' Romeo. But nothing worthwhile, just had a lower expectation for his performance.Don't watch this movie. Stay away.Oh yeah there was one decent part, the final dance sequence, no spoiler here, everyone knows a movie like this has one. But it was not memorable at all, good but, not good enough to make the movie worth while. At least dance movies like You Got Served have decent dancing to make up for the trashiness of the movie.

She realizes leaving the kids was a mistake and has a dance fund raiser to buy a new building to teach dance lessons.

Jessica Alba is on record as saying when she read the script she was unimpressed as it was just one big cliche .Well,what changed Jesse? It is still just one big cliche ripping off far better movies like Flash Dance , Karate Kid or even Rocky .

Is There Such Thing as Too Many Hip-Hop Dance Moves?,"Sadly, there will never be another Glitter.  That misbegotten mess of untamed vanity and insanity was never distinguished by its tragic celbri-trash idiocy and Mariah Carey's tragic acting skills.  There's nothing really idiotic about Honey, the latest hip-hop after-school special on Beat Street.  In fact, there's nothing about it at all-this is just Hollywood fullfilling its overdue community-service hours, truly and sweetly.  Jessica Alba goes from a dark angel to a street angel, flashing her beatific smile and her glistening abs and her beatific navel as she balances a meteoric dance career with the Bronx 'hood.  So supposedly superior are her dance moves (standard club gyrations mixed with ballet flourishes) that she captivates the hip-hop industry in mere weeks, after being plucked from clubworld by a powerful video director. Honey is fixated on stage cameos at the expense of its very short dance sequences and the idol-worshipping understates the movie's anti-bling moralism.  Despite some sizzle with her love interest, the beautiful Jessica Alba ends up a *major sigh* desexualized mouthpiece for lines such as ""I see kids go from bad homes to bad schools and back"".  On the sunny side, it does have a fair chance at winning the Democratic Party nomination it got.",,Anonymous,Music
excellent! Recommended!,"Honey is a fantastic film full of dance and passion. It's realistic and shows everything anyone would dream of, being a famous dancer who everybody wants! It is extremely good, must see, great film! I personally loved this film, the dancing was full of rhythm and soul and feelings. Gives a true statement of what dancing should be about. Everybody who is a dancer should be dancing with feeling and passion and love for what they do! Take this opportunity to learn to dance well or improve your dancing as is certainly makes you think about how you dance and whether it is good dancing or not! So go on watch this film it is brilliant!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
misleading previews...,I'm not going to tell you exactly what happens but I don't know if I'm the only one who saw the previews n thought oh cool another dance-off movie...then i saw it and it has NOTHING to do with what the previews made you think.I was sitting down getting ready to get into a good movie when it soooo didn't go how i thought. i was disappointed big time and bored. I think it was a waste of money...I'm just glad i rented it instead of paying to see it in the theater. I saved myself about $3. be ready for an unexpected turn at the beginning. thats not a good turn either. you will be going to a totally different story. in all honesty the plot was sweet i guess but not my kind of movie. its more of a save the kids in the ghetto movie than girl gets a break n makes it big.,,Anonymous,Music
"It's a fine movie - nothing amazing, but nothing horrible either","Ye gods, lots of bitter folk reviewing this. It is nowhere near as bad as the other reviewers would have you believe.Alright, let's break it down - it's a hip-hop movie, so of course:* It involves street dance.* It involves kids being kept off the street through the sheer power of dance and corn-rows.* There is, of course, a predictably attractive heroine with a heart of gold (why aren't there ever ugly heroines with hearts of gold?)* There is an evil bad man who offers the heroine one thing but then tries to give her another.and wait for it!* there's a fund raising DANCE at the end!... but aside from it being a predictable hip-hop flick, it's a FUN hip-hop flick. Terminator 3 was god-awfully predictable too, yet for whatever reason people don't rip into it quite the same way as a predictable movie not in the action genre.This is most definitely a chick flick. You'll need to enjoy dancing to ""get"" it, or at least go with someone that does (that you can relate to). If you're bitter, or can only enjoy movies where people explode into technicolor displays of blood and guts - then of course you're not going to like a feel-good dancing movie, stay far away, why are you even reading this review?",8.0,Anonymous,Music
honey is a really good movie,"i'd say that honey is probley ma favorite movie it says a lot about kids on the street and how most of there life's are and ""...if a man takes a woman out on a Friday night in her heels and she can't bring her homegirl, he trying' to get some booty."" just joking. but this movie tells a lot of real life and i'd say it's a definite must see.and that if any1 is talking trash about this movie then they got really bad taste and haven't been out there and see how much this goes with real life.some people are so up there wanting to be famous they don't see how much there decisions affect other people like honey found out. some guys are like Micheal who just want some ""booty"" not the real under the looks. (i know that happens to me sometimes) this is definitely a good movie, i think anyone would be crazy not to like, i mean we got people at my school quoting some of their stuff.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Honeyyyyyyy,"This film is one of the best dance films I've ever seen, and Jessica can move and shes really pretty so they chose the right actress and romeo is so fit :p its unbelievable!! The dancing from everyone in this move is incredible, especially the youngsters, its amazing how people so young can move like that. Its pretty much like a real life story (if you think about it) because there is a lot of people out there trying to make it but they just don't get the chance to. Very good to see a lot of famous people in it (especially seeing as they are all very buff!) I would have to say this is one of my favourite films all time because i never get bored of watching it when its on like everyday, my favourite bit would have to be the end where all the kids are dancing on the stage and everyone is watching them, just makes you light up to see how happy they are, bless!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
its about an eager dancer (alba) is trying to make it big without using her roots.,i loved this movie!!! I found this movie to be a really good entertaining movie one that you should watch for both the dancing and the plot. It was one of the best dancing movies of the year!! I encourage all you people to see it and hey for all those girls out there looking for a movie to watch with your bf without him falling asleep or you getting grossed out/ bored to death!!! we both enjoyed it... or he was able to stand it for me!!! Any ways the point is this was one of the best dancing movies in years it has just as much dancing as it does plot.

Inspiration,"Well many people didn't like this movie, but I thought it was a inspiration for all dancing children. I am a young teenager and I would love to dance or be a choreographer. It would be a dream come true, the actors in the film were excellent, Jessica alba was a excellent dancer and a excellent actress. This is going to be a hip-hop hot movie, it has been the best movies around since bring it on. Lil Romeo is such a great dancer and such a great actor. Many people have had that experience and many people can follow the story lines easy. People might find this movie different and like a whole waste of time, but it might be. People like me who are mad about dancing and would do anything to just be near a great dancer or be a background dance, this film is a great inspiration to us.If I lived in America right now I would audition for ""Honey"" no problem. It is my dream that when I am older I will move to America and meet lil- Romeo. My family know how mad I am about the film; they see me when I watch it. I know everything there is to know about it and more. People think they are fans of movies and they know everything, but they dint until they have seen me! This film is going to be around for a while and is going to get a lot of rating. The people who are in and who have took there time out to make this film ""THANK YOU"" I don't know where I would be today. Still thinking it is too much work and far to hard for me to find out what I want to do be a dancer. But know I no it isn't so hard after all. Thank You Very much for making this insperational film for all us young teenagers. My dream could come true after all, meeting lil-Romeo.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

Nothing Spectacular but Fun,"Honey was nothing spectacular but it was still really good. It's about a dance choreographer named Honey Daniels (Jessica Alba) who dreams of taking her talent and passion mainstream...to choreograph for celebrities. She finally gets her big break but her agent turns out to be a sleaze ball. Then she decides she wants a dance studio in the ghetto for underprivileged kids like the ones she used to teach at the centre and that she had come to love. She also falls in love with some guy, sorry that's pretty vague but I've only seen the movie once and I can't remember the character's name or the actor's. It's a great movie for any dance lovers. My favourite part was the big fundraiser dance at the end, I love the ""I Believe"" song. Anyways, the movie is pretty good.

This was an awesome movie!,I love Jessica Alba!I think she is an amazing actress.Honey was an a teriffic movie and I think that everyone in it played a good job.Anyone who has stuff to say about this movie does not understand how that kind of life is lived.The only chance for kids like that(broken homes)to stay out of trouble and selling crack on the streets is this.Romeo played a good part too!How his crack head mother's boyfriend busted his lip!I mean how can a kid deal with that when there is no one stable in his life?I have nothing bad to say about this movie!I think it was great and frankly I think alot of girls out there that did not like this movie is 'cause they are insecure about how georgeous jessica was in the flick.,,Anonymous,Music
The film is quality,"i think this film is quality. It's interesting. I think the film could be improved by ending it different. I think they should end with Honey teaching in her dance studio, being happy. And also see what happens with her job with Missy elliot when she comes walking in at the end. I would also like to see if Benny (lil romeo) keeps out of trouble once the dance studio has been opened. The film was entertaining because it had loadsa recent music in it and its all outgoing and not boring parts. Anyways thats all i have got to say about the film i just think it's class and i would love to do something like that to do with dancing. I hope there is a second part to the film to see how honey goes on to progress.",,Anonymous,Music
Great for Dance Tips,"Although the movie itself was hard to sit to and watch because it was boring and rather self explanatory, if you're a dancer it's worth watching and possibly buying because you can pick up some great moves.  The storyline was predictable however, and I couldn't sit through the whole thing all the way through. I would have liked to see more out of it. The acting was so-so.  Jessica Alba could have been a little more hot, because I've seen her in better, and the only thing that attracted me to it were the dance scenes and the artists that were portrayed.",,Anonymous,Music
Honey,"People dream today of things they wish they had or one day will have. In order for you to have what you want in life you must pursue it by working hard for it in order for one to achieve it. In the movie Honey, a movie about a girl who wants to achieve her dream of becoming a professional dancer. The movie was directed Bille Woodruff, the main character Honey Daniels is a hip pop dancer in New York East Harlem who dreams of making it big as a music video choreographer.

She want these kids to get involved with her classes so she can help to keep them off the streets and out of trouble. A famous music video director, named Michael, soon spotted Honey, after she was done working as a bartender at a local nightclub. He saw her potential and her talent, so he asked her so she can work for him.Honey was having her dreams becoming true, and her name was everywhere. Also, a lot of famous artists requested her to be the choreographer for their videos. However, Michael crossed the line when he took her to a black and white party. Honey refused to do anything with Michael, so Michael fired her and started to trying to sabotage her career by blackballing her. Honey later on wanted to try to raise money to open up a studio for her own dance class. So she needed help to get a dance floor to make the performance in there. She ends up becoming happy and getting what she wants and what makes her happy. This movie was like a fairytale.As you can see the movie ended up being like a fairytale.

"No honey, not tonight.","Our honey needs money, moves and fame. Alba plays an upbeat dancer seeking what many teenage mtv video afficiandos desire: face and body time in front of a camera, success on a diet of limited talent. While admitting a partiality for mainstream dance films generally -- I saw and enjoyed Billy Elliot as well the ribald Can We Dansu (Can We Dance) --, this film had one mortal flaw: the film's heroine cannot dance. It was simply clear throughout the film that every background dancer to be shown the moves by Alba could already shake her booty better. The rest of the film held few surprises and traded on the usual cliches. The innocent girl with the golden heart wanting to ""make a difference"" and give the local kids a ""better life"". The decent boyfriend whose main role in the film was to be... a decent bf. The vapid pretty, pretty vapid girlfriend, ticked because the two couldn't go shopping together. The manager, just sleazy enough to want to debauch her, but not so sleazy as to be threatening or even interesting. The kids from the hood looking like they just stepped out of a pimple-free middle class suburban day school rather than outta the bronx.  The film I saw which most resembled Honey in target audience was Save the Last Dance (2001) starring Julia Stiles. While not as good as the two first mentioned dance films, it still beats Honey by miles. I might have written a better review for Honey if the film had had more ambition. But why search for excuses for a film made with little love and even less savvy. No Honey, please, not tonight.",,Anonymous,Music

"Good music, good acting, overuse of the word honey","Did I get your attention? Well, scrap the subject... but not completely!Right, I may well be biased, being a Jessica Alba fan, but I expected this movie to be a lot lot worse than it was! Granted, it ripped off many movies - Sister Act 2, Glitter and Save The Last Dance, but I thought that 2/3 of those movies were good in the first place. The 2 main child characters of Benny and Raymond were strongly performed, and Jessica Alba held the whole movie together like she understood the character. People have complained about not casting a ""black"" girl in this role, but it wasn't meant for one. It was meant for someone who could see both sides of the fence.The music used in the movie drew me to it mainly, and I was far from disappointed. The music video scenes were good, and there were no shortage of classy cameos!The messages about kids getting into trouble easily were not completely finished, but the story was all wrapped up well, with a happy ending like this family film should have been.The faults of this movie are simple. It's no-where near original, they overused the word honey in the songs and dialogue, they didn't go into parts of the story deep enough - such as Honey's blossoming romance, her relationship with her parents, child abuse and troublesome teens. -Ok that sounds like there's a lot wrong with it, and it's true. But there's also a lot right with it.Overall, I was entertained and touched for the movie, and by the end, I had the urge to get up and dance.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

Yes,  we have seen the same plot done in many other movies. Some dancer becomes famous overnight and then something bad happens. However the movie still turns out to have a happy fairy tale ending. The plot was totally unrealistic. I know Missy Elliot isn't the way she is portrayed in that movie. And why did they have Lil Romeo to play in the movie? They needed a young teenager who actually know how it feels to be poor and living in the ghetto. They needed to give Joy Bryant more lines in that movie.

"Great Feel Good Movie, Could Have Been Just a Bit Better","From the moment I saw the tv spots for Honey, I got excited. I had previously seen movies like Dirty Dancing, Breakin', Breakin' 2, Footloose, and my favorite, Flashdance. I'm only 13, and I wished I could have seen those movies in theaters, so Honey was my big chance. I figured it would be cheesy, but it was WAY better than I thought. Even the two gangster type guys sitting behind me in the theater liked it. However, it could have been better. The same guy who wrote Glitter wrote Honey, and Honey was a big improvement. So I'd say if he wrote 2 or 3 more dance/performing arts movies, they will probably become classics. After all, practice makes perfect, and people only learn from their mistakes. But anyway, I loved this movie. For a good time, see Honey.   9/10 stars.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

"It was okay, Dark Angel was better!!! :)","I think that Jessica did a way better job in Dark Angel! That's all I have to say. I don't know why she lowered herself to such a low level.

I think that they should have gone into more detail about her relationship with her man, or they should have just left that out completely. It didn't really help the plot any. I liked it though because I like to dance and the dances were great and fun to watch and learn from, but other than that, I really wouldn't watch the whole movie the whole way through again, just using the scene selection is good enough for me! Some say that it was a waste of time but I don't. I think that if you were entertained just a little, than the movie did it's job. Jessica did look out of place when she talked. And the whole ""Flava"" thing was kinda weird, but, it could have been worse. They could've had her sleeping around to get where she wanted to be! :(",,Anonymous,Music
read my comment for my summary on this movie,"Throughout life people will dream of things that they wish they will one day become. IN order to achieve your goals you will need a lot of dedication and you need to be able to put a lot of hard work into what you do. Within the movie Honey, a romantic drama directed by Bille Woodruff, the main character Honey Daniels is a hip-hop dancer in New York's East Harlem who dreams of making it big as a music video choreographer. This movie can be categorized as a fairytale because it has a big dream that becomes fulfilled through hard work and faith.Honey teaches hip-hop dancing class at a local youth center. It's a free class and she encourages and invited local kids to attend. She wants these kids to get involved with her classes so she can help to keep them off the streets and out of trouble. A famous music video director, named Michael, soon spotted Honey, after she was done working her bartending shift at a local nightclub, dancing at a club. Michael saw a lot of potential and talent in Honey and casted her in a music video. After seeing all of her talent not only with dancing but also with choreographing she asks her become choreograph the music videos that he in charge of.Fame is coming in Honey's direction and soon her name is out and people are requesting her as their choreographer. Michael takes Honey out to a black and white, fancy, party and tries to make sexual contact with her. Honey refused to do anything with Michael, and Michael took away her job and started to try to sabotage her career by blackballing her.In the end Honey gets what she wants and raises the money to buy a studio for the kids she used to teach hip hop to at the center through a dance benefit they put on. She ends up becoming happy and getting what she wants and what makes her happy. This is a traditional fairytale.The movie Honey is a fairytale. The movie contains a dream that the main character, Honey, pursues and is extremely dedicated to. Then a conflict comes up and it seems like all hope is lost for her, and she came this far for nothing. But, as in all fairy tales, there is a happy ending in which the main character is able to regain what they once had despite what the antagonist is planning.",,Anonymous,Music
Sweeter than expected,"Jessica Alba must have something, because she keeps drawing me in. This time, I wasn't quite as disappointed as I have been in the past.""Honey"" is a reworking of ""Flashdance"" and other dance oriented films, but this time it has a social message. Unfortunately, I'm not sure it is a good message.Honey is a talented hip hop dancer who teaches her craft or rather, teaches her hobby to other kids.But as Honey herself quickly finds out, the market for her skills is a limited one and some of the people she has to please to cash in on it are pretty rotten people.Nonetheless, she would sacrifice anything to give other kids in the ""hood"" a chance to dance. But exactly why that is, or what it is supposed to accomplish, is never spelled out. It seems no more realistic than teaching every African-American boy to play basketball. Unfortunately, there are more of them in one high school than there are openings in the whole NBA and most of them don't have a chance of making a living at it. So, if they sacrifice everything to follow their dream, what happens when the dream doesn't pan out? Because it doesn't for most basketball players, just like it doesn't for most aspiring hiphop dancers.Don't stay in dance class just to stay off the street, go to school and learn something useful! You're chances of making a living as a hiphop dancer are almost nill.That's about all there is to say about the film.Jessica seems to dance very well, but I am no expert on hiphop. But she seemed fine to me.Her acting here seemed a little better than in her last couple of features, but she was better cast.She remains beautiful and engaging and you want to like her.We'll see what she does next.",,Anonymous,Music
Give it credit,"I think this movie was appreciated more by people who love to dance.  As a dancer...I'm completely in love with this movie, and I think that it has a good message.  About people, dancing...life. I'll agree it was predictable. But unless you're watching some crazy horror film, most stories do have happy endings. This movie is very motivating for people who dance, because it makes them want to get out there and do something with themselves instead of wishing you could do certain things. It makes you want to try to learn new things. Make that's a feeling that can only be described from a dancer's point of view. And the comment about her never wearing the same clothes twice..actually...she does if you look closely. For 2 or 3 outfits you can see that its the same top paired with different pants or a different shirt underneath.  Lighting and camera angles make it look different.",,Anonymous,Music
Inspiration,"This is a fun, feel good movie.  where you can enjoy every second of it. It encourages you to follow your dreams, and is mostly about believing in yourself, which is very important. There are some great songs in this movie (depending on what kind of music you like.)I thick Jessica Alba is a great actress, and a great inspiration to all. If you personally don't like this movie that is your problem!!!!!!!! If you want to watch this movie, don't be put down by all the bad criticism.",,Anonymous,Music
"an inspirational, fun, and up-BEAT movie!","The movie was very inspirational to young adults who hold fast to their dreams.  The movie gives hope to anyone and everyone.  The plot and characters make the movie fun, serious, and hip.  After watching the movie you might be motivated to do something you've been meaning to do. Jessica Alba's character is hot and has a lot of integrity.  Lil Romeo isn't actor material but he brings the plot together.  Zachary Williams is so cute in the movie.  Missy Elliott is hilarious.  The music is the key to the movie and is awesome.  Along with the music videos they are great and very entertaining.  He brings many smiles and tears.  Also, with all the dancing it keeps the movie up-BEAT.  The movie keeps you dancing in the theater or on your couch.",,Anonymous,Music
"A lot of dance, a lot of heart.","'Honey' deals with the balance between success and social responsibility. Jessica Alba plays Honey Daniels, a hip-hop dance teacher at a New York city youth center.  Honey rockets to success with her unique style but starts to loose her connection with the community she loves.  Believing that success is a debt that must be repaid, she uses her new found fortune to start a dance center.  When her new world takes an unfortunate turn Honey is left without enough money to complete the center.  'Honey' is full of hip beats, strong dancing, and a lot of heart.  The topics are relevant, the story inspiring, and by the end the characters are more than images on a screen. The climax is touching and worthy of applause.",,Anonymous,Music
Honey Film Review,"In a modern day fairy tale the film Honey takes the audience through a ""Cinderella Story"" with a hip-hop twist. The story is crowded with incidents and subplots showing the negative side of growing up in bad neighborhood but also a young woman's attempt to liberate young kids to leave the temptations surrounding them. The main character struggles for personal success in changing environments but soon finds out that behind every promise of progression as a dancer lies an ulterior motive.Every fairy tale finishes off with a happy ending but before that can be accomplished a conflict or series of obstacles needs to occur. A major issue in the film is the little opportunity presented to the children growing up in a bad neighborhood in New York's East Harlem. Honey Daniels, played by Jessica Alba, teaches hip-hop dancing at a local youth center and encourages the local kids to attend to keep them off the streets and out of trouble, but the temptations of drugs and violence swarm around them. The drug dealers are constantly looking for willing users, new users and possible future sellers to carry out their ""transactions"" on street corners, specifically targeting the youth. The obvious leader of a group of young kids whose views of right and wrong are obstructed is Benny, played by Lil Romeo. Benny is a dancer who has the most influence on the kids and a tighter relationship with Daniels.In the film Daniels dreams of stardom in the world of dance are answered by famous music video director Michael Ellis, played by David Moscow. Casting her in a music video Daniels takes over the choreography and she is encouraged by Michael to make the transition from dancer to choreographer. But Daniels sudden success comes with a price with Michaels refusal to take no for an answer to his sexual advances and then tries to sabotage her career by blackmailing her out of the business.In the end all conflicts are resolved and the promising youth in the Bronx are provided a dance studio made possible through a dance benefit. Personally, while the choreography by Laurieanne Gibson, who also plays Honey's nemesis in the film, and music, may be enough to grab Honey's target audience of urban adolescents, the film is extremely predictable and filled with horrible acting performances. But if you enjoy a fairy tale including all the good, the bad, the ugly, captivating choreography and catchy beats, then Honey is for you.",,Anonymous,Music
