Decision to Leave...,"An accident results in loss and pain, the rejection of a world that you refrain, you seek withdrawal, isolation, segregation, separation, and transition to a life, where you abstain. But seclusion still has links and ties and cords, that retract and pull and cannot be ignored, reconnection through a box, reveals a secret that's unlocked, that begins to reconnect, and to restore.It's a wonderful performance from Juliette Binoche as she elegantly weaves Kieslowski's tale of freedom into a contemporary setting. Packed full of symbolism that requires numerous visits to absorb, you may find a myriad of interpretations of your own too.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
A Beautiful Film,"Blue is one of those little movies that grows on you.  The more you think about it the more you like it.  That's not to say that it's not enjoyable to view; the cinematography and music are marvelous.  But this is Juliette Binoche's movie.  Everything revolves around her character, Julie, who, in the first scene, survives an automobile accident that claims the lives of her famous composer husband and her five-year-old daughter.  Now alone the remainder of the movie delves into Julie's long emotional recovery.  Not traumatic, or depressing as the subject matter may imply it is instead subtle, graceful, and beautiful.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"""Three Colours Trilogy"": Part 1","Instead of saying which is the best and worst (though have often heard 'Red' cited best and 'White' the weakest, though all three films are generally very highly thought of) of Krzysztof Kieslowski's ""Three Colours"" trilogy, it will just be said that all three films in the trilogy are must-watches in their own way.The first film in the trilogy 'Three Colours: Blue' serves as a very poignant exploration of grief and liberty (in the emotional sense), and to me it is one of the most moving and interesting depictions of grief and liberty in film. It is heavily symbolic, with its intricate use of music, the dominant use of the colour blue in the colour palette, its interesting use of fade outs (though actually different to their usual use, representative of time standing still rather than it passing or a scene conclusion), links to the main character's past (here the use of falling) and the bottle recycling, but not in an incoherent sense.Visually, 'Three Colours: Blue' looks stunning. The whole film is shot with aesthetic grace and elegance and while the use of blue is dominant for symbolic reasons it is never gimmicky or cheap. Kieslowski's direction is thoughtful and never intrusive, and the intricate music score and the symbolic way it's utilised (representing Julie's struggles with isolation) is inspired, ""Song for the Unification of Europe"" is one of the most emotional tracks of music in any film seen by me recently.Story-wise, 'Three Colours: Blue' challenges in a way but also always engages, mainly because of how movingly and intensely it deals with the tragic story of Julie and its themes of grief and liberty. The pacing is deliberate but never hits a dull spot.One of 'Three Colours: Blue' is the astonishing performance from Juliette Binoche, an intensely affecting portrayal that ranks high up with her best performances. All the cast are fine, particularly Benoît Régent and Emmanuelle Riva, but in the acting stakes this is Binoche's film.All in all, a beautiful, thought-provoking and moving film, and a wonderful start for a very interesting trilogy of films. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Impressive,"Often times when viewing an intelligent film like this I have to really contemplate what the implications the film maker making mean to me.  This film was no exception.  Kieslowski, with his background in non-fiction film making, is applying the french political value of liberty to a personal situation.  He is, in essence, studying the human condition through fiction. The meaning of ""liberty"" takes on a very different meaning for Julie in this film.  She tries to gain liberty from her memories and her emotions only to find that it is an impossible task.  This is not a film to casually throw on after supper.  This film requires a commitment by the audience to really consider Kieslowski's implications, for he is telling us (throughout this trilogy) what he thinks makes a ""good"" person.  The score is beautiful and has a character of its own in the plot.  A must see for true film lovers but perhaps a little too much for someone expecting a casual encounter.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
A passage through dark water into light,"This movie is one of my favorites.The disturbing topic of a woman who can't deal with the loss of her husband and child transforms into an essay on the impossibility of isolation. It is a quiet, personal movie that spends most of it's time with the main character played excellently by Juliette Binoche.The color blue is very evident in the film,and a fade to a simple blue screen is used to show times of deep emotion. Although the characters are set in a specific time and place ( France just before the formation of the EU ) the focus on the personal journey of grief transcends the setting.I like the way this film changes from a story about a death to an affirmation to life. I like the way that little things like mice in the apartment loom large in the thought of our main character, where as what others consider important such as finishing her husband's symphony seem very minor .It feels like diving deep through cold dark water to finally swim toward the light. One passes through emotional turmoil to come out the other side. I found it a very satisfying.",,Anonymous,Music
Bleu A Symphony of Grief,"The subject(mourn,lost)is so interesting and profound that this film is a real treasure. It is very difficult to write about 'Bleu' because this film has so many intense scenes,with many details.Juliette  Binoche's vulnerability is in every scene, every gesture, every moment. She plays an enigmatic woman,'Julie,' we're witness to her terrible loss(her husband who was a famous composer and her daughter died in a car crash)She is the survivor,not only of the accident,but of herself too.The film doesn't show us how her life was before the tragedy,but' Bleu' focuses on her personal journey to healing.Julie seems stoic,she did not criy hysterically or stay in bed totally depressed,her grief is intimate and touching.In one scene when Julie is near the blue crystal mobile(which belonged to her daughter) just notice her reaction.Another poignant scene is when Julie is in that swimming pool,suddenly,she stops and she can hear her husband's symphony(all in her head).Bleu also approaches a philosophical question-when you lose everything  can you start all over again?,life is a series of events and choices,Julie moves to another place from the country to a city.She did not want to see her friends,she wants to be alone but is this possible?,her past will haunt her.Another interesting aspect of this film is the use of music instead of dialogue,her silence is a reference of her terrible loss and pain,she is not depressed but sad. Also the meaning of the unfinished symphony of her husband is very profound (is connected with her grief and healing)The photography of the film and the beautiful and delicate face of Binoche contribute to the impact of  BLEU.Kieslowski was one of the most talented directors, I really admired his 'Trois couleurs' trilogy but I think,'Bleu' was his most powerful film.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Music
interesting art-house film,"This is the first of Krzysztof Kieślowski's colors trilogy. Blue is Liberty. Julie de Courcy (Juliette Binoche) survives a car crash which killed her husband Patrice and her daughter. Patrice is a famous composer who was commissioned to produce a piece for European unity. Julie tries to commit suicide and then escape from the glare of her former life. She befriends exotic dancer Lucille. An old friend Olivier is also a composer and suspects the composition is actually Julie's. Patrice had a mistress. Julie has to break out of her darkness. Kieślowski uses everything including color, silence, music and most importantly Binoche infusing this with meaning. This is very much an art-house film and may not be for everyone. The quietness does lower the intensity. It's slow and meticulous. There isn't much of a plot. It's all about Julie's darkness and the reveal that can break through.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Kieslowski: master of visual narrative.,"Krzysztof Kieslowski is, unquestionably, the master of the visual narrative.More-so than even La Double Vie de Veronique (which is much more poetic than linear in it's structure), Trois Couleurs: Bleu is a marvel of visual exposition. Due to the nature of the film, exposition in this case is not necessarily related to plot, but rather to the understanding of a human being.Kieslowski delves so deeply into the true nature of Julie (Juliette Binoche) and in such a remarkable way that by the end of the film we understand her utterly. Free from the clutter of dialogue and, for the most part, interaction with other characters we see Julie alone and in her most natural state. Kieslowski takes his documentary background and conveys his character in an almost voyeuristic manner. Showing Julie in anything but a state of solitude would be false; due to human nature Julie with Oliver would not be Julie, but rather a reflection of her true self which, although certainly interesting, pales in comparison to observing her silently struggle with the death of her husband and daughter alone.Kieslowski played with applying the documentary techniques, which he perfected in his early work, to the narrative form in The Dekalog with tremendous, although at times visually mundane, results. The Dekalog looks like a documentary. Here, he turns over much visual control to his Director of Photographer, Slawomir Idziak, with tremendously cinematic results. Idziak's use of color and light, combined with his groundbreaking filter work, serve to further explore Julie's character. Blue feels like a documentary and looks like a dismal Rembrandt. While Kieslowski concentrates on showing the true nature of Julie through action, Idziak contributes by showing her through light and color.Trois Couleurs: Blue is an almost unmatched achievement in the history of cinema. Never before has a character been conveyed so splendidly and in such a visually stunning manner.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Now looking like a pastiche,"The Three Colours trilogy was a colossus of European cinema in the 90s, but its lustre seems to have faded somewhat - none of the films made the recent Sight & Sound top 100.Here we are though with a 4K restoration of Blue, still getting a raft of 5 star reviews from primarily male critics, but leaving me cold. Blue now looks like a pastiche arthouse movie, populated by luminously beautiful women mooning around Parisian cafes and strip joints with cigarettes in their mouths, and nothing of any consequence happening.Juliette Binoche is undeniably fine in the lead, but this felt to me like a heterosexual 'male gaze' idealisation of a beautiful grieving woman who needed saving from her affectlessness, and without any amatory investment in her it was difficult for me to engage. The film has none of the intellectual provocation and interest of her work with Michael Haneke, which is much more my thing.The cinematography is gorgeous, and the few interesting moments are where the camera homes in on beautiful quotidian detail (a cube of sugar absorbing coffee, a leaking brake line, etc).",6.0,Anonymous,Music
A Bit More Narrative Please,"The movie's narrative basically ends after the first ten minutes. There is practically no external conflict after that, except for the rather uninteresting point of will Juliete Binoche finish the score for the ""Unification of Europe"" song. To tell the truth, I really, really did not care one way or the other.Without plot narrative, we're left with some quite striking cinematography, mainly shots of Juliete which should definitely be in a slick fashion magazine. There's some nice montage of images and sounds a la Godard or Bertolucci, but nothing very memorable except for a sugar cube dissolving and some baby mice. This leaves me in the distinct minority of those who found the film cold and boring. I realize that the director Krzysztof Kieslowski was dying of aids when he made this film, but I can't transfer my sympathy for him to the film. I haven't seen the other two films in the trilogy. I hope they are better.I'm also upset with the false advertising on the DVD which calls the film ""Mysterious and Sexy."" There is no mystery here and one shot of Juliete Binoche's naked back and several shots of her swimming in a bathing suit hardly qualifies a film as sexy. Of course, if they had written the truth ""Morbid and Pretty"" who would buy it?",4.0,Anonymous,Music
A masterpiece of an understudy into human grief!,"BLEU (TROIS COLEURS) / France/Poland 1993 (4 STARS) 23 January 2004: The thing that stands out most about Blue is the expression (or lack there of) of grief. How does a woman, seemingly fulfilled by happiness, react when that happiness is yanked away in one telling moment, in a car accident in which both her husband and her daughter pass away? That is the central understudy - a strong woman's attempts at finding purpose in the seeming absence of meaning.  Mise-en-scene: I watched an interview with Juliette Binoche, where she mentions that Kieslowski refused to make the film unless it had her in it. It's easy to see why. I can't imagine Bleu without Juliette  its not just that she lends her personality to the filmBleu IS Binoche. I was thrown off by the sub-plots of the character's relationships with her mother and the striptease dancer, as I was about the seeming resolution at the end of the film. There were perhaps references that I missed but the almost happy' ending left me feeling un-relinquished. Given that I had shared such an intense journey with Julie, it seemed almost improper to accept that she would settle in to a normal relationship again. Cinematography: The 1st shot of the film - that of a car tire racing - shot from the bottom of the moving car establishes this as not your typical movie'. The sequence-of-shots that follow eerily draw one into the compelling story-telling style of Krzysztof Kieslowski, minimalist in its approach, with a world communicated without dialogue in the first five minutes of the film.  Blue is not your typical art-house film. Its production values are up there with the best, and the cinematography by Slavomir Idziak (who's craft was recognized by Hollywood in Black Hawk Down), is nothing short of stunning.  The lighting is low key and soft, and wraps around the characters to create a mood of subtlety. A distinguishing feature is the detail in the shadows. None of the close-ups fully illuminate the protagonist, almost hinting at her vulnerability at facing the light, though the delicate use of eye-lights does well to bring alive her emotions.  The camera, an intelligently used narrative element, interacts with Julie and partakes in her emotions, respecting them and yet accentuating their intensity as she plods on in an alien world of deep personal purposelessness. The tight close-ups penetrate her soul and force us to delve into Julie's mind and share in her agony.  Editing: deftly uses match on action to create irony while forwarding the narrative.  Sound: The pace is hauntingly slow and silence has been used compellingly. It screams with meaning as it is becomes one of the more important elements as the narrative progresses. Bleu is not a film you can watch, consume and move on. Either you'll feel that you've totally wasted your time and will probably not be able to sit through (the pivotal occurrence is over within the first five minutes of the film without a single world being spoken, and the rest of the film is essentially the protagonist's psychologically subjective journey) or you'll realize by the time you've reached the end that you'll revisit this film at various points in time, explore and read about it, discuss it with people you respect, and try to get closer to the essence of Kieslowski. For there are two now well-accepted truths about the folklore surrounding Kieslowski, whose reputation continues to mount posthumously1. that Kieslowski carefully interwove elements that were rich with meaning and social irony, and 2. that figuring those elements out and appreciating their implications is probably a lifelong learning process.",,Anonymous,Music
"Excellently executed, sensitive and moving drama.","This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Not only for Juliette Binoche's excellent performance, but also for the delicate cinematography, the haunting music and the overall texture of immersion in the world of the young woman. If you are after car chases, exploding jets and gun-toting macho muscle-men, then stop reading now, this is not for you.I enjoyed the other two films in the trilogy (""Three colours Red"" and ""Three Colours White""), but ""...Blue"" is easily the best. Kieslowski's movies are very different from the formulaic action movies that steer you firmly down a plotline, without giving the audience time to absorb any feeling. Without giving anything away, the story centres on the life of a young woman who experiences a great loss, and how everything changes, how she reacts, what happens next and much more. Music plays a central part in the plot and the scene where her finger traces the score as she shapes the symphony for Europe, is unforgettable. As you watch it you are lulled by the music yet also aware of the tension between her lover and her. Simply put, this film is subtle and moving, beautiful to watch, has a haunting musical soundtrack (I bought the CD as well, I have to say) and is never sentimental or cliched, not for a minute. There are little link scenes that join this movie with the other ""Three colours..."" movies - the storylines are separate but overlap.If you liked this, see also ""Three colours Red"" and ""The Unbearable lightness of Being"".

My brief review of the film,"Carefully directed, with attention to both detail and colour, the film is amazing on a visual scope, but it is also powerful on an emotional scope with a number of very intense and moving scenes. It is a story of coping with grief, with characters fleshed out through facial expressions rather than words and actions, and Binoche is a fine choice for the lead. The intriguing music score and fade-to-black editing provide the film with an interesting sensation, in particular alongside the cinematography and lighting, used cleverly to keep things in and out of focus. Kieslowski also plays with sound in an interesting manner, and it is hard to flaw the film on anything. We are told nothing of the background of our protagonist, the supporting characters at times appear haphazardly thrown around, and yes, there is a lot of meandering and not much story, but this surely depicts the state of mind of the protagonist. Really, it is hard to say anything against this film, as it is so well made and moving that it is really just fine viewing. The first entry in a trilogy of films, it was followed in 1994 by 'Trois Couleurs: Blanc'.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
The Greatest Of These,"There's a car crash and a great composer and his daughter are killed. His wife, Juliet Binoche survives.... sort of. She tries to kill herself, but cannot, so she .... puts everything in trust for her mother and her husband's servants, orders the house sold and the proceeds added to the trust, has one night of passion with her husband's colleague, Benoît Régent, then leaves. She rents a cheap apartment, spends her time watching other people, and drifts.She tries to disappear into nothingness. However the world keeps intruding.Since this is the first of Krzysztof Kieslowski's TROIS COULEURS trilogy, I kept looking at the colors. He's obvious in his palette, using blue for sadness, red for life, and a general sepia wash for the anomie and observational phase of the movie.Yet to reduce a discussion of this fine movie to the technical tricks of the trade does no justice to its rich story, and the way everything in the world comes together to bring Miss Binoche to a realization of her own place in the world and her own nature. There are some startling realizations along the way, and Kieslowski and Miss Binoche are patient and deliberate in this portrait, teasing the audience into being interested in this character, who seems to be nothing without her husband and child, and desires to be nothing. In the end, I like to think, like Kieslowski and Binoche's Julie, we are all more than we seem.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Tries too hard to be artsy showing love to be antithetical to liberty,"Julie Vignon - de Courcy, a young Frenchwoman (Juliette Binoche) is involved in an accident that will set her on a journey of self-discovery. We go along with her and imagine what we would have done.This is a good film with a message. It is blurred by the attempt to introduce too many details that are trying to reflect ideas that could have been left out or explained straightforwardly. The lack of direct information and many of the modifications from the screenplay make this an average-rated film.I believe that this film requires common knowledge of the writer and film general that I am not familiar with so the target audience may be restricted.One plus is the Cinematography of Slawomir Idziak that will come to life in the film GATTACA (1997).The film finally comes alive and what on the surface seems like a musical downer of a depressed person in a depressed world can come alive for us if we listen to the voice-over interpretation first.

Magnificent acting by Juliette Binoche who makes a real tour-of-force , she relies on the internalized affection rather than overwhelming displays for expression . Good support cast as Benoit Regent and Florence Pernal ; both of them also make appearances on the followings . The picture has various subtle references about trilogy such as : At one point, we see Julie carrying a box which, as a close-up shows, has prominently written across it the word ""blanco"", Spanish for white; in the next shot we are looking at her from behind, and she pauses in the street as a man in blue passes her on her left and a woman in red passes her on her right , this is a reference to the structure of the Three Colours trilogy - blue, white, red, in that order, mirroring the French flag . During one swimming scene in the blue pool, children in red and white bathing suits run out and jump in the water . Colorful and evocative cinematography by Slawomir Idziak , it is essential to be understood the story . As well as the musical score , Zbigniew Preisner composes a rousing and impressive soundtrack .

And ¨Trois Couleurs : Rouge¨ starred by Irene Jacob , Jean Louis Trintignat , Frederique Feder and cameos by protagonists in the earlier film , Juliette Binoche and Benoit Regent ; ¨Red¨ is for fraternity in the Fench tricolor flag , dealing with emotional connections are mad between unlikely couples and director Kieslowski uses the ending to tie up loose ends .",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Does not live up to the hype,"This film is a critical darling - a favourite of many notable film critics, including perhaps most famously Roger Ebert. But after watching it, I can't quite see what all the fuss is about. Seems a bit like an ""Emperor with no clothes"" situation where one must praise the film lest they not be allowed in the esteemed halls of the famous critics. To me, ""Bleu"" is objectively not a very good film. The story is not that interesting, the characters are not that likable, the cinematography has its moments, but mostly the film has a dull look, and the music quite bad actually considering the importance of music to the plot. You look at your watch and keep going, thinking that it must get good at some point to justify all this lavish praise. But it never does.I think what is appealing to the critics and people who love this flim is that it is rich in symbolism and metaphors. Everything means something else. From reading Roger Ebert's gushing review, apparently there is even some ""meta"" symbolism at play in the larger scheme of the three film ""Three Colors"" trilogy. As clever as all this is, it didn't actually help me enjoy watching it any more than I did. The color blue motif that runs through the film comes across more hammy than clever.My partner remarked ""well, that was a waste of time"" after the film ended, and I can't help but feel the same way, even though I usually enjoy challenging films.

A stunning film from one of the world's preeminent directors.,"TROIS COLOURES: BLEU is a rich, dark film with all the Kieslowski marks: death, silence, depression, and the inner torment of outwardly attractive women.  After seeing the whole trilogy and the DEKALOG, I'm convinced at Kieslowski's great talent, and his very early death was a true blow to world cinema.  Much like Kubrick but with a less ironic nature, Kieslowski loves to make his characters and stories both humanely distant, realistic, and, at the same time, philosophically idealist and dense.  I enjoyed BLEU more than BLANC (which was an odd machismic entry in a trilogy mainly focusing on women) but not as much as ROUGE, which I feel is one of the finest, most beautiful, most well-done films I've ever seen.More specifically, BLEU's focus seems to be on the relationship of a woman's loss of the tactile manifestation of her husband's existance with the ligering notions of his life - especially his music, which pervades the entire film, interrupting at key moments with a blackout and short blast of the overture.  To watch Julie struggle with her husband's abandoned secrets (including a mistress Julie befriends) is shattering, frustrating, and perplexing.Unfortunately, life must move, and, due to that, I can't watch BLEU over and over.  However, I did glean from one viewing the complexity of this picture, and recognize its need to be watched over and over, until Kieslowski's last gasps can be properly understood, which is all we can hope to return to a man whose genius was tragically cut short, but still stands as a giant in my view of cinema.",,Anonymous,Music

What binds human beings together,"This is the first exposure to Kieslowski that I've experienced, and it definitely won't be the last. The subject is so close to the heart of all of us that anyone can relate to this, and it will have something to say to any audience member. This film isn't for everyone, and the painful topic of death and grief, not to mention the insistence on not providing any more light moments or relief than Julie gets, is not the only thing that may leave certain viewers unhappy with this. It is for people who love movies, and it is an intimate work of emotion. The editing is masterful, with subtle and effective use of sound. This has great cinematography, and it is never flashy. The acting is stunning for everyone involved; Binoche sheds every single speck of ""armor"", as far as feelings go, and allows herself to be extremely vulnerable(and again, there are those that will find it to be an excessive strain, though it is worth it). Every character is immensely well-written and entirely credible. The lead is thoroughly developed, as well. This has a marvelous plot. The dialog is realistic and genuine. There is a bit of disturbing content and brief sexuality(a little of which is unpleasant) in this.

Well-made but...,"... kinda boring. Well-made, well-acted and well-shot. The score and the colour grading were good too. But kinda boring as I had a hard time leaving myself invested after 30 mins. It starts off well with an interesting premise but as I was already familiar with the director's style, I thus sensed the pace of the film in the forthcoming hour, wherein I felt my disinterest growing slowly as I was nearing the end. I think it's a type of film that either 1) you tell yourself that you like because it's critically acclaimed or 2) because you missed all the important details and must give it 2-3 more watches. Either or both of these things can be true, however this review reflects my first viewing of the film based on my level of enjoyment. Perhaps if I rewatch it in the future my opinion will change.Watch ""La double vie de Véronique"" (1991) instead at first!

A masterpiece.,"You could say the cinema is littered with great trilogies, some 'intentional', others accidental. However, there is no doubt that Krysztof Kieslowski intented ""Three Colours: Blue"" to be the beginning of a trilogy linked by the final moments of the third film and together they make one of the greatest trilogies in all of cinema. The colours are those of the French flag though you don't actually have to know that or indeed what they stand for to appreciate this great movie. Certainly, the first and third parts are masterpieces in their own right and if the middle one, ""White"" isn't quite a masterpiece it is still a remarkable piece of work.At the beginning of ""Three Colours: Blue"" a car accident claims the lives of a father and his five year old daughtter. His wife, (a superb Juliette Binoche), survives but is seriously injured. The man was one of the world's most famous composers, (and Zbigniew Preisner's brilliant score will testify as to why), though there are rumours that his wife may have written some, (if not all), of his music and Kieslowski's film deals with grief, anger and redemption all anchored in Binoche's performance.In this film, magnificenly photographed by Slawomir Idziak, blue is the colour that predominates; it seems to seap into every frame of the movie and becomes, both symbolically and literally, a character in itself.

And what do we say of that experience, do we ascribe it outside of us? No, that's just a bunch of words.This is what we have here, questions of memory and meaning. A woman as viewer of a movie taking spontaneous shape around her (played by Binoche as placid observer), that pokes holes in herself and provokes questions; finally overcoming it by being pulled forward by what was left incomplete in it.A woman who has lost everything as the film begins, every anchor in her life violently removed in one swoop and she's now cast adrift. We have the whole film as her own inner drift through an interminable flow. Kieslowski evokes this with lush dissonance between visual segments, cuts and fades that leave life in suspense. There is scant story, all about living with these fragments. Music erupts around her in sudden intervals; but music that's coming from inside of her and being hallucinated.It's the world of memory and inner life. Tarkovsky enters this with long, mystifying sweeps of the camera that lift bearings and slip into dreams and ruminations. Kieslowski by contrast caresses their outline, the surface of emotions as they glide over the eyes. It's not difficult like Tarkovsky or Ruiz can be, but pleasant in the way of Kar Wai. It goes down rather easy, you can see it for just the surface shift.Kieslowski had spent the whole 10 hours of the Dekalog training this ability to dream in advance. It pays off here. Each of the 10 Dekalogs was about a narrative that an earth-shattering revelation comes along and creates a change in viewing. You will see this here obviously. But Dekalog had a contrast; some of it was Kieslowski opening corridors in the imagining with his camera, most was characters stumbling into revelations and articulating feelings. Here I'm happy to note this tension is resolved in favor of the eye; the whole is about visual slippage through cracks in story.He lets blue lights shine on screen as music soars in crescendos, he gives us closeup shots of eyes; the eye that colors. At other points he introduces memory as images before a viewer: the funeral playing on a screen, images of her husband on TV that when shuffled through reveal a mistress. Most eloquently, images on TV of someone being cast over a void with a bungee chord as her anxiously precarious drift with nowhere to hold. She's fading from even the mind of her mother.For the end he reserves a tableaux of joined moments from lives as they are suspended briefly in mind. It's all being endlessly relived and combined like the music she works to complete with her composer friend. The music is central here.Not just as the memory of what was collaboratively lived with her composer husband, the emotion that was absorbed and now erupts again, but also as the sheet where an incomplete piece beckons for the work of continued imagination. The shot of this sheet as scribbled notes end and lines stretch interminably is the abstract heart at the bottom of it.Had another woman not made a copy of the score, it would have disappeared when she burnt it. Had she come by to pick up the photos of her husband, she might have burnt them with everything else and never found out about the mistress. But it's all this what eventually pulls her out of herself.",,Anonymous,Music
Blue=Liberty or is it?,"Krzysztof Kieslowski's Blue is the first of the three part trilogy based on the three colors of the French flag, with the other two being Red and White. It follows a story of a woman;Julie, played by Juliet Binoche dealing with the pain and her life after the accidental death of her husband and her daughter. She is completely cut off from everyone else around her life, and she decides to deal with the pain on her own terms. After her loss, she destroys all music notes composed by her husband and sells anything in her house that would bring her memories from the past. She is sad and shaken. She tests her self whether she could feel any love by seducing the man who was working with her husband who was secretly in love with her. No she cannot. She settles into an apartment by herself to be free, to begin life all over again or to just avoid the urge to begin.Krzysztof Kieslowski, who was one of the most prolific filmmakers, was a devotee of such filmmakers as Bergman and Tarkovsky, who explored subjects of faith, philosophy and death. Kieslowski here too dives into these subjects in a fashionable way, playing around with some of the scenes to show the inner nature of the characters using beautiful cinematography and story telling techniques. The use of close ups in the movie has a profound effect in portraying the mindset of a character. We read their faces to understand what it says even though the words are not present to express it.Towards the end there is quite a surprise when she meets the mistress of her dead husband who is now pregnant with his child. How they deal with this discovery and most importantly how Julie deals with it presents a great revelation about her.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Gorgeous and resonant.,"Krzysztof Kieslowski explores grief and loss here with an authenticity, aided by the perfectly understated turn from Juliette Binoche, that is somehow simultaneously beautiful and ravaging. So many scenes leave a lasting impression. The moments of her succumbing to masochistic tendencies in order to feel something, anything other than the unbearable despair over her loss, are absolutely wrenching.Kieslowski doesn't lean towards melodrama for a moment here, never allowing his audience to feel as though they are watching a film take place, but rather presenting such a lived-in study of this level of devastation a person can experience. Binoche is on point every step of the way, somehow being expressive to the audience while shutting herself off from everyone around her. She is my favorite actress in the history of cinema and this is a glowing example as to why; even when she's saying nothing she is saying everything. Her face is so expressive in the most subtle of ways and here she puts that to remarkable use.Of course even if this wasn't such an emotionally profound piece, it would still manage to be a treat for the eyes, with Kieslowski making full use of his color palette in impressively vivid ways. That final shot, a hold on Binoche's face as tears quietly stream down it, was one of the few things that I had remembered from my initial viewing of the film years ago and it's easy to see why; it's haunting.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
freedom at 450-495 nanometers,"""Trois couleurs: Bleu"" (""Blue"" in English) was the first entry in Krzysztof Kieślowski's Three Colors trilogy. Named after the colors on France's flag, the trilogy focuses on stories involving France's national motto: Liberty, Equality, Fraternity. Kieślowski said that ""Blue"" looks at emotional, rather than political, freedom, as Juliette Binoche's widow Julie is no longer bound by family life but can't fully escape her past. This continuing connection is embodied in the lamp of blue beads, and in the footage of bungee jumping (in which the cords become more apparent as the movie progresses, symbolizing evidence of a link to the past). Most importantly, there is the music: much like how music consists not of a single note but of harmony with other notes, Julie cannot stay isolated from the rest of the world. Thus it's an anti-tragedy: Julie's attempt to erase her past call into question whether love and freedom can coexist.This is the first Kieślowski movie that I've seen, and I'm really impressed. His use of scenery and colors to tell the story mirrors Stanley Kubrick's style of filmmaking. Juliette Binoche won both a Golden Globe and a César for her performance, as well as an award at the Venice Film Festival (all well deserved). As for the director, I hope to see the other entries in Kieślowski's Three Colors trilogy, as well as his other works. It's too bad that he retired after finishing the trilogy and then died of a heart attack.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

"Pain, tragedy, mourning, mental and psychological anguish, a cathartic journey towards freedom, in a film that is not for all audiences.","It took me three tries to get through this movie in its entirety. As someone who is currently going through a very difficult grieving process, it was particularly hard for me to watch the film.It all starts with a serious car accident where the main character, July, loses her husband and daughter. She, like myself, feels a need to escape, to isolate herself from others, and she almost annuls herself by not bearing the pain and absence of her lost family. As the film is a kind of metaphor around the concept of freedom, to what extent is it liberating to have these attitudes? I sincerely do not know. As much as we run away, our pains don't stop confronting us, we never stop being who we are.In the midst of all this, the film also launches considerations on the hopes and paths of the European Union project through the troubled completion of a symphony, commissioned by the Union and left incomplete upon the death of July's husband, who was its composer.I didn't know the director Krzysztof Kieslowski, and I believe that few people will. He is one of the directors who never leaves the festival circuit due to his enormous erudition. I don't believe, in fact, that he made films of a more commercial nature. This film won't please everyone, being relatively indigestible and uncomfortable, cold and depressing like the color that gives it its name. The cinematography is very talented, it is full of artistic resources, frames of great visual value and beauty, cold colors where blue predominates and is omnipresent in almost the entire work.We cannot fail to highlight the excellent interpretive performance given here by Juliette Binoche, in one of the most intense, poignant and strong cinematographic works of her career as an actress. Benoit Regent and Charlotte Véry didn't do a bad job either, and each in their own way give a very important support to Binoche's work, but it is the main actress who, due to her enormous merit, sustains the film and really plays.I didn't want to stop writing a few lines about the soundtrack of this film: the film is not particularly sound, as the insertion of music is quite punctual, thought out and meticulously articulated with what we are seeing. And instead of using several melodies, or ordering a vast array of incidental pieces, the film uses only one song, which is called ""Song for the Unification of Europe"" and was composed by Zbigniew Preisner. Made in the period after the Treaty of Maastricht, the film is very ""Europeist"", which is ironic given the prevailing Euroscepticism nowadays, thirty years later.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Bad music,"Though interestingly filmed, in that Kieslowski way, this film is disappointingly predictable and shallow in its layering, and in the exposition, such as it is, of its supposed theme of ""liberty."" And how are we to imagine that the composer of such superficial and badly composed music was famous? A failed attempt to imitate some sombre late 19th- or early 20th-century style? But it is much too banal for that, and perhaps some sort of monumental-sounding minimalist approach was intended. A film in which a composer and his (?) music figures prominently must make a better attempt to provide a convincing score. Binoche's portrayal of emotional deadness was not convincing, either. ""The Decalogue"" is a much greater work.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Magnifique!,"Two tempting routes instantly manifest themselves for us after losing a loved one: wallowing in sadness forever and detaching oneself from life while being very much alive. Neither of them makes a logical sense. Logic aside, however, neither can spare us such an inexorable phase or get us out of it miraculously. Julie seems to have veered into the latter route in order to evade slipping down the abyss of the former. But grief must take its natural course, and suppressing it would result in truly dire circumstances at their worst scenario would be being imprisoned by depression, shrouding us metaphorically until a shroud takes its place quite literally.""Now I have only one thing left to do: nothing. I don't want any belongings, any memories. No friends, no love. Those are all traps.""Kieslowski incessantly tries to save her from such fate and draw her back to life once again. His camera lingers in extreme close-ups on Juliette Binoche's features to draw out of them a smidgen of the sadness Julie does her utmost to bury inside herself. Later on as Julie keeps pushing grief away in her quest of severing herself from the past, she finds herself drawn back to it as memories surround her everywhere and no matter how hard she tries to escape them. When she returns back to her home for the first time after the accident that cost the lives of her husband (a renowned music composer) and her daughter, she asks the gardener if he has emptied the ""blue"" bedroom, which implies her trying of getting rid of the past. She goes upstairs only to find a ""blue""-beaded chandelier, that's likely belonged to her daughter, hanging over her, just like her memories of her daughter. Julie's journey of liberating herself, in one sense, from her past life becomes impeded with reminders of her two dears she lost. Furthermore, Julie's incomplete grief begets anger and irritability that put her mental state at stake. And as memories relentlessly haunt her, she ends up surrendering to them, literally having her head under (blue)water. However, blue gradually begins to mutate its symbolic significance as liberation takes on a totally different definition in Julie's mind. It's here where Zbigniew Preisner's score blossoms into a salvaging tool. There's one scene, in particular, that I found fascinating where Julie and her husband's colleague trying to complete her husband's unfinished manuscript. The shot is pulled out of focus until it becomes almost utterly blurred, forcing the viewer to hear the music playing inside of their heads as they orchestrate parts of it. It's still a liberation of the past, but one of letting go of it while maintaining, nay cherishing its memories instead of eliminating them. A liberation that thrives on a catharsis for all of Julie's repressed painful feelings, bringing forth her deepest sobs and setting her free.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

Stunning.,"At it's core, Blue is really an uplifting story of a woman who loses her husband and child (something I could never imagine the pain of ) and is slowly able to bring herself back into a working society. It's really stunning the way she gathers herself together at the end, but the final shot shows us that she'll never truly be rid of the pain from that situation. We also see how one person in such a tragic circumstance can affect so many lives and I thought that was really touching. Kieslowski does amazing work with colors here as he uses stark, vibrant reds, greens and blues that completely draw the viewers attention and suck them in. I loved the little scenario with the mice in Julie's apartment and how instinctively she tried to kill them but once she realized it was a family she was unable to do it. I also adored the repetition of her diving into the lush blue swimming pool, as a way of almost freeing herself from all of the stress and pain that's building up inside of her. Of course the first thing she does when she emerges from the water is cry. Overall it's a completely sublime film that I couldn't take my eyes off of. The final shot of Binoche (who gives an amazingly subtle performance) staring directly into the camera with a tear dried on her face and another emerges and runs down is truly heartbreaking. It feels as though she's staring right through us and into our soul.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
What Is It Like to Be Submerged in Grief?,"This film is about the most raw of emotions, grief from great loss.

She obviously has the funds to go on which allows her to drop out of her previous world. Her husband had been respected all over the world for his work, but it is implied that she had as much to do with the work as he did. One of her husband's associates (who has loved her and sleeps with her one evening) wants to finish the master's final composition. She destroyed a copy earlier, but it resurfaced as a copy in his desk at his workplace. As she tries to get direction, she finds out deep secrets that were kept.

Was Julie only mourning the death of her husband and daughter, or was her grief further aggravated by the knowledge that she had failed as a wife and mother?Juliette Binoche is asked to do something in this film which is, in and of itself, a great challenge for any performer: she is directed to portray an uninteresting character, a woman who is so grieved and burdened by her past that she is barely able to keep the movie afloat. That she succeeds in doing so illustrates the tremendous talent she possesses, although she is undoubtedly assisted by the ingenious use of editing, which combines brilliant displays of the colors blue and green, and music that transcends the screen and reaches the viewer's soul.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Three Colours: Blue (1993),"Directed by Krzysztof Kieslowski. Starring Juliette Binoche, Benoît Régent, Charlotte Véry, Florence Pernel, Florence Vignon, Emmanuelle Riva, Hélène Vincent, Philippe Volter. (R)After her husband and child die in a car crash, Binoche attempts to retreat from everything she once had (house sold, husband's work destroyed, ties with her mother severed, etc.), but finds it difficult, if not impossible, to abandon her past outright. Unevenly-paced but fascinating drama is artfully lit, photographed and edited--as expected from the title, color plays an important role, with the blue motif used to memorable effect as a calming but melancholy presence. While delivering a brilliantly understated but passionate performance, Binoche dominates as a somewhat enigmatic and unsympathetic character, but those dealing with grief are often difficult and unpredictable; her prickly nature staves off the confrontational and prevents the film from becoming fully absorbing, and the striking final sequence may be a visual marvel, but not an emotional one. First part of the ""Three Colours"" trilogy, each one themed from the colors of the French flag (and revolutionary motto); blue represents ""liberty,"" though it is, of course, not the sort of freedom that most would ever wish for.72/100",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Fabulously absorbing and unquestionably brilliant,"I've got to hand it to Krzysztof Kieslowski, this is immediately captivating and firmly holds one's attention. In his direction and every facet of the screenplay he penned with Krzysztof Piesiewicz, in Slawomir Idziak's active, dynamic, and mindful cinematography, and in Jacques Witta's brilliant editing there's a marginal tinge of fancifulness that quite seems to heavily accentuate the profound, aching emotional gravity of the story. That bent is further echoed in production design, art direction, and even lighting that pointedly weaves in hues of red, white, and especially (obviously) blue into each scene, if not every shot. At the same time, Kieslowski's direction, the cinematography, the hair and makeup, Zbigniew Preisner's flavorful and dramatic score, and above all Juliette Binoche's acting are all characterized by a barbed, brusque forcefulness that truly leans into harsh emphasis of Julie's anguished mental state. The latter quality is further reflected in rather brisk pacing, and all this is something that if not done right can quickly undo a picture, and has in many other instances. There's no doubt in my mind, however, that Kieslowski knew exactly what he as doing, and that complete, unwavering vision fully comes across with stark, powerful, undeniable impact. It's no wonder why 'Trois couleurs: Bleu' is so highly regarded, for it comes at us like a freight train and hits just as hard.It's difficult in the moment to drum up other examples of movies that go for the throat as much as this one does. Every aspect of the writing, and the feature's craft otherwise, is geared toward zeroing in on Julie's effort to isolate herself with her pain, and additional illustrations of suffering and hardship are woven in that she consciously tries to avoid. With her failure or inability to truly divorce herself from humanity - and in fact, growing attachments despite herself - there's a welcome measure of warm sincerity that shines through to counterbalance the more stringent facets of the proceedings. The push and pull of this struggle, Julie's attempted seclusion and the threads that draw her back in, is the bread and butter of this fierce drama, and it's realized with a delicate thoughtfulness that's all the more impressive for how it's hidden behind the veil of the ponderous, unequivocal execution. Furthermore, this is how it goes for most elements of the film, benefiting from sprightly skill and intelligence: Preisner's score, Witta's editing (not to mention discrete moments when music and cuts are ingeniously swirled together), the camerawork; the writing of dialogue, characters, scenes, and the story at large; every performance, though again Binoche readily stands out most. That echo of storytelling in the craftsmanship, and vice versa - light and inviting, versus dark or weighty and assertively stressed - is a master stroke of film-making like few other works have ever been able to achieve.Even with such great acclaim I didn't truly know what to expect when I sat to watch this; certainly there have been other instances of well regarded pictures that I belatedly checked out and found myself disappointed or put out. I feel safe in saying that 'Trois couleurs: Bleu' is fully deserving of its grand reputation, however. It's exquisitely well made from start to finish, with impeccable and carefully shaped contributions from all involved. Kieslowski should be well familiar to any cinephile on at least a nominal basis given the status his films are afforded, and one need not even see any others for this one to definitively prove why. Devilishly smart in how it's put together, fabulously absorbing in the narrative that it relates, and altogether spellbinding, this is without a doubt the type of feature that everyone needs to see at least once. It may not appeal equally to all, but it earns a blanket recommendation nonetheless; whether you make it your top priority or just make a note for a later time, 'Bleu' is a modern classic that's worth every terrific minute.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Excellent for its craft,"A realistic, touching portrait of grieving, with Juliette Binoche shining in the lead role of a woman who's lost both her husband and young daughter in a car accident. Her wound is so deep that she initially rejects everything around her, but in her numbness and isolation the past creeps in, often in the form of an unfinished musical composition. This haunting by music and evolving over time to pick it up again and finish it fits in well with the process she's going through. The pace of the film is a little on the deliberate side, and unfortunately I didn't feel a cathartic connection while watching it, which made me like it more for the craft than emotionally. On the other hand, I did feel as though I should be more gentle and kind to people I run across in real life who may be acting out in their own unseen private worlds of grief. I also loved how director Krzysztof Kieslowski gave us some very nice effects with lights and reflections, including that marvelous shot of the little girl looking through the back window of the car early on. The various effects in blue over the course of the film do eventually start feeling a little forced though. Not bad, but not one I'd be rushing to watch again.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

Then, if you do like pointless visual photography (by the way, what the hell did go wrong with Kieslowski and the cups of coffee?), illogical characters making illogical actions, please go ahead, this movie is perfect for you.

Sad but good,"Three Colours Blue is mainly centred around the character of Julie (Juliette Binoche) whose husband and daughter die at the beginning of the film in a car accident, which she survives. Julie, who was very much in love with her husband, essentially withdraws from her life as an attempt to cope with her tremendous loss. This is also coloured by the fact that her husband was a composer and died before completing a very important work. This music haunts her at the same time. She does communicate with people from her past, and new people, and learns lessons on the journey that takes her to end of the movie.This movie is a relatively small tale, as expected, but magnifies the enormity of loss from a micro to macro level and gives it a tangible feel. Juliette Binoche is excellent as Julie, and the rest of the cast put in great performances. Direction is also particularly good, especially the cinematography. I think this movie would be enjoyed by anyone that likes emotive movies centred around relationships. 4/5",,Anonymous,Music

The Beauty of Blue,"The ""beauty"" of Kieslowski's later films, and his cinematic imagination is particularly special in the way that it taps into and enriches the emotional, spiritual, and aesthetic content of his work.The opening sequence to ""Blue,"" involving the car passing through a tunnel, as we are immersed in the ambient sounds (hearing bits of familial conversation, viewing the swish of vehicles and splash of lights through the window), followed by the passage into late afternoon light (and the silvery blue balloon being sucked out the side window flapping in the breeze), just before the accident, is as astounding in its beauty as it is penetrating in its content....This film is resplendent with cinematic sequences as unique and profound as its opening, and, throughout,"" Kieslowski's use of sound as a way to access Binoche's interior process is absolutely brilliant. Witness the sequence, when she finally feels able to step out into the world again and move into the city after the accident. She rents an apartment on an upper floor of a large, strange vacuous building, and there, that first night, through her window, witnesses the beating of a man on the street, who escapes and runs into her building, the fear on her face, as she listens to him climb the long metal escape stairway, floor by floor, still followed by his assailants, as he comes closer to her could be something out of Hitchcock, but it goes much deeper than primal fear because of everything she has gone through and is trying to recover from.Still, it is not only the imagery (Binoche blurry through window, staring vacantly somewhere as she experiences intimate relations for the first time since the accident), or ambient sound (the sudden clamor and echo of the indoor swimming pool as she comes up for air from under water) that reflects the nature of her psyche, but Preisner's haunting music that simultaneously takes us back to her husband and her tragedy, as much as towards her recovery of self as she engages her creative process. She is a woman who has lived in the shadow of her husband, while yet participating in the creation of the very music he is famous for, and as the music enters the film, each time, it is her reflecting on and coming to terms with all that it represents to her, including, finally, the bridge to her salvation....This is not a typical Hollywood redemption tale handing us the standard prescription for such a tale of woe, no ""how to reclaim your power as a woman course 101."" This is a tale of truth, and we believe Binoche every time she makes a decision because we are not only privy to her experience, but fully involved in the process of transformation that becomes her liberation.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
This is a must-see film if you love French cinema,"The French movie Trois couleurs: Bleu was shown in the U.S. with the title Three Colors: Blue (1993). It was written and directed by Krzysztof Kieslowski. (It's one of the Three Colors trilogy by director Kieslowski. The other two are Three Colors: White with Julie Delpy, and Three Colors: Red with Irène Jacob.)The film opens with a tragic accident. Julie Vignon (Juliette Binoche) is riding in a car with her husband and young daughter when the brakes fail and the car smashes into a tree. Her husband and daughter are killed. Julie is seriously injured, but survives.This isn't only a personal tragedy; it's a national tragedy as well. Julie's husband is a famous composer, and he was in the midst of creating a major piece of music that would celebrate the possibility of a united Europe.The rest of the movie shows us how Julie copes with her new life situation, and her possible love in the person of her husband's colleague Olivier, played by Benoît Régent.Binoche is at the center of the film. She is the sun around which all the other characters revolve. I don't know if the movie would have worked with a different actor in the role.Binoche is outstanding. We know she's outstanding. She knows she's outstanding. Most important, director Kieslowski knows she's outstanding. She's in almost every scene, and, in almost every scene, she's front and center. That's because Kieslowski can't take his eyes --or his camera--away from her.Binoche is beautiful, but in a unique way. Some of her contemporary French female actors--Anne Parillaud, Emmanuelle Béart--are classically beautiful. However, Binoche is beautiful in her own strong, intelligent way. OK--as my wife pointed out, her cheekbones have cheekbones. Still, she's not standard ""movie star"" beautiful. She's a great actor who happens to be very attractive. It's a wonderful combination.We saw this film at the excellent Dryden Theatre at George Eastman Museum in Rochester, NY.

Where are the French, Italian, Spanish, Mexican, British, etc, movies?)Everything is marvellous, the music, the photograph, the history, the actressJuliette Binoche had the best work I had ever seen on her,  (and she was magnificent in Damage, The Lovers on the Bridge or The Unbearable Lightness of Being). The music by Zbigniew Preisner isn't only a background; it's a part of the history, indispensable.This isn't a typical movie; there are many people who don't understand that. Perhaps they believe it's boring or dark, but here there aren't dinosaurs, indestructible policemen, violence or teenagers' licentiousness. The spectator will see the human being showing his innermost thoughts and emotions, the weakness and strength, the man showing his nude face and nude soul; Even without words! Juliette Binoche doesn't need to speak to show her soul storm.I highly recommend watching Blue, White and Red (observing the French flag colours order).When Krzysztof Kieslowski passed away after a second heart attack, the world lost one of the best film directors, but his masterpieces live on.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"Initially Sad, It Won't Leave You Feeling Blue","""Blue,"" the 1993 opening film in Krzysztof Kieslowski's ""Blue, White & Red"" trilogy, sports perhaps the most fitting title of the three. It tells the story of Julie, a 33-year-old woman who has just lost her composer husband and young daughter in a terrible automobile accident. Thrown into the bluest of blue funks (and who wouldn't be?), Julie moves to a flat in Paris and tries to divorce herself from life, telling herself that money, love and friendships are all traps. But what at first seems to be an extremely downbeat film proves rather life affirming, as Julie discovers that maybe there are things left to her worth engaging with after all. Her newfound and unwanted liberty (blue is the color of the French flag that corresponds with ""liberty,"" oui?), her sudden independence, may not be as desirable as she initially thought.... ""Blue"" is a film loaded with all sorts of symbolism and suggested meanings. It features world-class direction, striking photography (although that impressive image-on-the-cornea shot was used to better effect in ""Goldfinger"" some 30 years before) and impeccable acting, especially from Juliette Binoche in the lead. It is certainly not the picture for viewers desiring speed, but nonetheless rewards the patient viewer with its ultimately uplifting message that life does have a way of pulling us back in. Though easily the most somber of the trilogy, it is not at all depressing, and didn't leave me feeling blue at all. Oh...has anyone else noticed that although Julie's daughter is reported to be 5 at her funeral, the dates on her coffin indicate 7? Is this an error on the director's part (hard to believe, with such an impeccable craftsman as Kieslowski) or something else that needs to be thought about by the viewer? In a picture that offers so much food for thought, this is just one more tasty morsel.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
A Truly Visual Film,"A woman (Juliette Binoche) struggles to find a way to live her life after the death of her husband and child.Nothing against the plot, but this is a visual film. As with the other two films in the trilogy, the color of the title features prominently in the color scheme. Here, unlike ""White"", the blues (and greens) jump out everywhere without being overwhelming. The elements are intense, but well-used.Does it compare to ""Red""?

I tried,"I tried to like it, i really did... but a second viewing just seemed to confirm my original opinionSure, the music and photography were ok but thats just not enough.  For one i didnt really get in touch with the characters.  Julie's character staring every so soften in de camera didnt get me any further.  And then the symbols: after a while i started thinking: ok ok you dont have to shove 'blue' down my throat all the time.  And what's with the fluteplayer, the swimmingpool, the mice... give me a break will ya.  Did the reqiem get written? Who cares... at the end of the film that subject just got dropped. The theme is interesting though: the dead of someone leaving close relatives/friends puzzled.  Somehow i think it could have been a lot better.The film resembles 'la double vie de veronique' (wich i liked) too much: the music, mirrorlight, meeting in the cafe, the main character being a lone woman,...But dont get me wrong though: i like kieslowski; i've only seen a few of his films, but 'short film about love' is already one of my favourite movies, if not my number one.",,Anonymous,Music
Kieslowski's masterful story about freedom is a must-see!,"Kieslowski is a visual master. This is a very symbolic film that shows Juliette Binoche who lose her dotter and husband in a car crash(Her husband is a famous composer). She starts a new life and moves to Paris. There she lives a wordless life without doing so much.It's masterfully shot and the film is not only showing her problem, it is showing the human nature. Juliette Binoche's performance is so very perfect. Her silent all the time in the film is touching and actually frightening.A very good film that I might though was a little overloaded some times(what I trying to say was that it was might a little much for me to understand some times). Still a superb film and a film that you thinks very much of after you have seen it. It is the first of three films about the French colors, the other are white and red. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Music

Quality art-house material where style overrides content.,"A French woman loses her famous conductor husband and young daughter to a car accident and has to build her life afresh.One of these films that has nothing really new or original to offer but gets high IMDB marks because it is an emotion wrangler and has the quiet (almost silent!) appeal of Juliet Binoche in the lead role.(In competitive diving they have a tariff system which takes away marks for easier dives. This is an easier dive, but that doesn't mean the dive isn't excellently performed. I would take a whole point of the IMDB score under any such system!)While I admire cinematography and symbolism in movies I believe these are the support structures to the story. Here they push the story to one side and take over - to the point where there is often nothing but mood, posture and music.A move dedicated to grief and re-building is hardly going to be a laugh a minute, but Binoche wants to be frosty and controlled through the vast majority of this short (for a main feature) movie. Sorry, people don't grieve like that in real life - it is more a rollercoaster of emotions.We know so little about this now-ended relationship. How was she before the accident? How did they really interact? Was it really a happy relationship? We know that her husband was no angel - but how do we know this wasn't known to JB? A checklist of questions is not what I want in a movie that exclusively takes on one woman's life experience in such close up.Thankfully the final message is positive - life can be rebuilt. Wounds do heal. You can move on from tragedy.Here is a movie that may leave you entertained and moved, but it is far from a voyage of factual discovery unless you are an expert on body language and mind reading. Maybe there should be subtitles for this too?",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Beautiful Pain,"""Most of this film is about feeling directionless and hopeless after a tragedy, and not knowing what to do with oneself, not knowing how to cope. I've read that people have interpreted this film as an anti-tragedy, and I could absolutely see that, because when her family dies, Julie's character shuts down, but not in a typical way. Julie's character seems driven to forget about what has happened, so much so that she doesn't even seem to really process the tragedy that's happened to her. Even though we have never met the person she was before the accident, we can tell that she has become a different person than she used to be from the interactions she has with characters that knew her before. Kieslowski's direction is amazing because he's able to capture the feeling of isolation through his framing, and the colors he chooses to use. Oftentimes, Julie's character is partially obscured, or the upper half of the frame will be shrouded in darkness, as if she is hiding away her emotions, or if a dark cloud of depression hangs above her.
Binoche herself is spellbinding as Julie. It's hard to play emotionless without being boring. Julie goes into her emotionless state and doesn't outwardly change much at all, but through some of her interactions with others, we get glimpses into her psyche. She doesn't cry or sob when her child and husband die, but she will call an old friend up for sex and then discard him immediately. However, after that, she felt horrible about doing it, as shown by the scene where Julie drags her knuckles across a brick wall. Throughout this time, Julie puts up a stoic front, even when she's alone, but slowly, as time goes by and more things come out about her husband, Julie starts to let down her defenses. It really speaks to Binoche as an actor that she is able to show this subtle growth in character, for the way she processes grief is so muffled that it takes someone of her quality to make those subtleties shine through.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
About emotional freedom and learning to cope,"The first film in Krzysztof Kieslowski's Three Colours trilogy, named after the colours of the French flag and loosely themed after the values of French Revolution. With this one obviously named Blue and dealing with the value of freedom.The story follows a young woman, a recently widowed Julie (Juliette Binoche), who lost both her husband and daughter in a car accident. She struggles to cope with this enormous emotional gut punch by distancing herself from her past, from her old life, from her memories. She tries to free herself from her anguish and sorrow.The story is not a bad one and the film is certainly well-acted, but I have to admit that this whole trilogy shines for me because of its technical aspects. The camerawork is superb, the acting is really nice and the locations are evocative. But mainly it's the use of colour. Shocking, I know. This film is so blue, and in a really inventive way that supports the story. Blue is a melancholic colour, it's a deep colour. But it's also a refreshing colour, a cool, calming colour. And that's all reflected in the film.I'd call Blue a good gateway film into more artistic films. It has a plot, it has characters, it has an arc, but a lot of the subtext is only implied and has to reasoned out from the colours, from the score, from the imagery. Not a huge film, but intellectually pleasing nonetheless.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
A little of the Paradise's Blue,"It is very hard to comment on a film that was so intense. Three magic things happen: the photography (excellent, excellent), the music (eternity), and, of course, Juliette Binoche. The film is in first view a film about a memory. A memory that has to be forgotten (and thus it is by a revelation of the past). However we can read it as a metaphor of the present of Europe, arrested in its past, that has to be forgotten to have a full present as a united Europe (the music Concert for Europe is the proof). It has a poetic treatment and thus it has to be seen, with an astonishing look. (sorry about the english)",10.0,Anonymous,Music

Trois couleurs,"Really boring.
The film is from top to bottom a homage to the sufferings of the individual bourgeoisie person.I had absolutely no joy watching this, could not relate at all to her suffering, thought all the characters were shallow, the dialogues artificial, the conflicts manufactured. The lead character is not charismatic at all, the whole film she essentially walks around bossing people, acting like literally everyone owes her the world. The weird thing is that the film seems to support and romanticize her bad faith.

Moody blues.,"I had a hard time motivating myself to watch Bleu, which I have only ever heard glowing reviews about. People have been recommending the movie to me literally for several years, and I never got around to watching it until last night, after I recently purchased the trilogy for a whopping 30 yuan (about $4.25), thanks to China's total indifference to copyright laws.The movie is suitably depressing and highly artistic, and although some of the technical experiments didn't really work for me, the story itself is outstanding. Early in the movie there is a clumsy use of a flashing blue screen that might remind some Hitchcock fans of the psychological use of color in Vertigo, but it's one of the examples of the overuse of blue in the movie that came to me to be a little redundant. The movie is called Blue and it's an emotional color, I don't think we really need to be hit over the head with it so many times.Juliette Binoche stars as Julie Vignon, the wife of a famous composer who dies in a car crash, along with their daughter, throwing her entire life into total emotional chaos. She responds by trying to erase her memories of her lost past. She sells all of her possessions, moves to a new place, and goes back to her maiden name. Throughout this time, she immerses herself in her sadness, just like that astonishingly blue swimming pool.Obviously, music is an extremely important part of the film, it takes us on an entirely separate journey through Julie's sadness and emotional development. The movie illustrates her loss of feeling, her inability to form meaningful connections with other people after her catastrophic loss, and through the thoroughly unexpected turns of events that take place throughout the movie to allow her life to continue, in completely unexpected directions.There is a lot of focus on minute details in the film, long shots that focus on seemingly trivial objects but that create a surreal environment that is almost impossible to create in any other way, similar to the effect that Binoche gets with her particular style of under-acting. There are a few moments in the film when the screen fades to black for a few seconds and then fades back in to exactly the same shot. I imagine Kieslowski was going for some kind of temporary mental blackout, triggered by an emotion or a sudden painful memory, but it just came across as campy to me.Nevertheless, the movie has such a powerful and involving story that it's easy to overlook things like this, although this is certainly not the feel good movie of the year. By far the film's best feature is the story, which is brilliantly written and takes us on a fascinating journey, followed by the stupendous performances. Kieslowski is not one of our most accessible directors, but certainly one of the most enduring.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"Binoche is captivating in ""Blue"" film","The film ""Blue"" is very blue. Dark blue in fact. A lot of questions were brought up in the film and none were answered and thats what makes this interesting and well made film aggravating. It is a film to be admired but the open holes make it hard to embrace. The one thing that cannot be denied is the terrific performance by Juliette Binoche. Even in a film that is hard to handle is watchable because of her. And this is a very good performance by her. Her character Julie is interesting as we watch her separate herself from her past and most of the outside world. But then she is slowly dragged back in. This film seems to be overrated by some critics and underrated by others. Its a very good film and an excellent performance, but those holes keep it from being more than that.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
A masterful character study in desperate grief,"Krzysztof Kieslowski's first in the ""Three Colors"" trilogy, ""Bleu"" (1993), is a masterpiece in illustrating the complex aspects of grief, in both visually and tecnically sophisticated ways.Juliette Binoche is nothing short of amazing in her role as the grief-stricken Julie, who in a matter of seconds loses all she loves. The plot of the film revolves around the events following the car crash that killed her husband and daughter.Visually, it is a deeply impressive film, often drawing on storytelling in mere cinematography.

Is it a veneer?,"Ticks all the European Film boxes: Death? Mourning? Intense love? Long lingering shots of faces? Moody lighting? Yes, yes, yes and yes.I was very engaged throughout, but writing this two days later I can't help but feel a bit unfulfilled about it all.I'm going to sound really up my own backside here but I think Martin Amis said something about stories having to be secondary to style now. His point, if I remember rightly (and maybe you shouldn't trust me on this) is that we've heard most stories before, so all we can do now is just try to tell them in ever more interesting ways. I think that's what he said, but try as I might to be an intellectual the brain isn't up to it frankly.This film has little in terms of twists and turns and plot points. But the simple tale is shown to you in such a way as to please you immensely. There are moments of two people talking that are lit so beautifully you want to grab other directors and say ""why can't you make people look as absorbing as that? You haven't been *trying* have you? Stay behind after class."" On the other side of the equation the DVD extras have a bit of the director telling you what he was trying to achieve with the close-up shots he was using and Binoche goes on about her painful dedication to her art and you sort of want to say ""yeah, OK, chill out"" and you feel like after they gave the interviews they might giggle behind our backs and laugh at how they made us all think it was all dreadfully clever.So, I would rate it above average, but I'm suspicious of it all and I'm not convinced this film is going to stay with me for long. However, I will see the rest of the trilogy and I wouldn't want this review to put anyone off renting it. Your eyes will come out of the experience feeling fulfilled.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

Losing family members is something I relate to based on my own life experiences, but it's not overdone in a ""Hollywood"" way. It feels very real. At no point do the filmmakers hand you information on a platter for your easy digestion. This is a movie of subtlety. You have to actively participate to pick up on little clues. I didn't realize on my first watch through that the lollipop she voraciously eats was her daughter's from one of the first scenes.

This is the first of a trilogy of films about colors by Kieslowski, and it is about as pretentious as one would expect with such a contrived premise. OK, we get it that grieving equates with blue, but the director raises the indulgence quotient to extreme levels with weird sound and visual effects. Sporadically, the screen goes dark - it's not clear if this is symbolic of the widow's mental state or just a case of sloppy editing.

"Liberation, your name is Juliette Binoche","""Trois Couleurs: Bleu"" often ranks only second in Krzysztof Kieslowski's trilogy dealing with liberty, equality and friendship. True, the picture doesn't have the emotions on the forefront like Rouge does, but in its coldness, estrangement and portrayal of unspeakable desperation, its painful observation of someone who just cannot go on anymore lies its strength. Juliette Binoche plays a woman who epitomizes loss: her husband is dead, so is her daughter, all in an instant. Gone is what she was used to call her life, her passion for everything she ever cared for, the money has lost its importance, even her demented mother doesn't know anymore who she is, and it doesn't end there. Staggering on the brink of the abyss there is no will anymore to leap over the cliff, but even with the decision to retreat from everything the lives of others are affected...""Bleu"" is the perfect combination of a visually oriented director, great script and editing (e.g. with inventive fade to blacks) - and an actress who perfectly understands how to play a grieving, inaccessible widow and at the same time the fragile being who could shatter any minute. Oh, and we shouldn't forget the importance of music in this movie, as this is what it's all about: To bring back music in someone's life in order to liberate the self from, well, let's say: being blue. It works so well that it hurts - but that's the purpose.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Blue..,"Kieslowski kicks off his Three Colours Trilogy with this 'Blue' first chapter...The movie, featuring a somber mood, beautiful cinematography by Slawomir Idziak and some brilliantly haunting score by Zbigniew Preisner unfolds almost like a melancholy...with Juliette Binoche playing the central character of Julie.The premise deals with an accident claiming the lives of Julie's daughter and her composer husband.

The rest of the story revolves around how she tries to shun away the grief by ""liberating"" herself from it..It's a simple story told in an almost poetic fashion by Krzysztof Kieslowski and Krzysztof Piesiewicz.Juliette Binoche delivers a stunning performance as the sorrowful Julie.

Extraordinary use of music,"The cover of the box in which this movie comes says ""Mysterious.  Sexy."" Blue is not really either one.  It is very straightforward, and sexual where appropriate, but not at all sexy.  It is very pretty, and it is very, very intense.My American prejudice forces me to assume that any movie in French will be visually stimulating.  I expect gorgeous locations, pretty people not necessarily model-perfect but dripping with style, and fabulous scene compositions.  In this aspect, Blue certainly does not disappoint.  Blue is also extremely well-acted, and overall a touching, sensitive, and honest exploration of grief.  However, the aspect I most want to comment on is the way sound, particularly music, is implemented in this film.  It's absolutely ingenious.Most films addressing dramatic events or tough emotional situations seem nowadays to hammer in their points with overblown music -- violins for sentiment, bassoons for majestic landscapes, drums for suspense and action. Audiences are not allowed to simply let the experiences the actors are delivering wash over us and sink in naturally; we must constantly be ordered to notice each nuance through the insistent blare of overweening musical backup.  The most refreshing aspect of Blue is that it does not do this at all.Natural ambient sound is the most frequent background in Blue.  This is shockingly effective.  Ordinary noise -- traffic, or the sounds of a person moving around a room alone -- provide all the atmosphere necessary to make us feel what is being conveyed.  Surprising sounds surprise us.  Startling noises startle us.  We feel everything that each sound makes each character feel, because we have experienced it in exactly the same way.The only place that the very wonderful music is used is when the protagonist or another character of the world of music thinks.  The protagonist is a musical woman, a composer and a composer's wife, and it is perfectly right that she should feel and think everything first in music.  When she or someone else reads music, we hear what is being read, just like a voiceover. When the protagonist is impacted by an image, an utterance, or a memory, we are impacted by the musical chords by which her mind and heart respond first.This is not only very effective, but it's also very respectful of the actors and of the audience.  I have never, ever had the pleasure of a film experience like this before.  Although the film falls apart a little at the end, rushing where it shouldn't and turning slightly derivative of Wings of Desire, and although it's probably not a movie I'd watch twice since half its impact is based on not knowing what will happen next, it is a very good film and definitely worth watching just for this amazing experience of hearing music and sound handled so expertly and with such dignity.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Three Colours: Blue,"Juliette Binoche is on fine form here as ""Julie"". She is driving her composer husband and their daughter along a country road when - next thing they have an encounter with a tree. Now the audience can expect this - we are shown the leaky brake fluid at the start, but we are not necessarily prepared for what is to come as she has to reconcile her own injuries and the difficulties (and opportunities) of her new life. That involves her taking herself deep into the anonymity of Paris - but she is soon to realise that her need for much desired isolation is not reciprocated by her friend who have no intention of letting her disappear under a rock. Things truly come to an head when she re-encounters old flame ""Olivier"" (Benoît Régent) and there might just be light at the end of her tunnel? It is quite an observational piece of work, this, and Binoche is well capable of demonstrating just how the trauma and drama of this incident and of her subsequent choices impacts on the character - a reaction that could resonate with many, I suspect. The dialogue is sparing and the pace of this rather potent depiction of grief and it's consequences moves in a measured fashion with no obvious conclusion to draw upon. The supporting cast do exactly that, they provide brief moments for us to recalibrate and adjust as ""Julie"" herself has to adapt, and though I could have been doing with just a little humour to relax the plot at times, it's still a great example of a well considered story and an actor at the top of her game.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

Three Colours: Blue,"This, the first part of a thematically linked trilogy of films inspired by the French flag and its motto 'Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity', is centred on Julie. In the opening scene she loses her husband and daughter in a car crash. After leaving hospital she decides to make a break from her old life; she moves into a new apartment and disposes of most of her possessions, including her composer husband's unfinished masterpiece. She tries to avoid making connections but inevitable she gets involved with new people and reconnects with people from her past who search for her.Director Krzysztof Kieslowski does a fine job bringing this story about how one woman deals with loss to the screen. It isn't about visible grief but the numbness that leads Julie to try to isolate herself and move away from her old life. The blue motif is used to fine effect throughout the film; whether it is the pool Julie swims in or the blue ornament in her flat, one of the few things she kept from her old life. Juliette Binoche, who is rarely off screen, does a brilliant job in the lead role; making the viewer believe in Julie's situation. The story plays out well with as it depicts Julie's gradual coming to terms with what happens. Overall I'd say this won't be for everybody but if you enjoy 'art house cinema' then this is definitely one to watch.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
4.16.2024,"BLUE, the beginning of Kieslowski's three color trilogy, or like Jonathan Rosenbeum from Chicago Reader called the work that ""this is a movie in which Kieslowski's own liberty manages to sing and soar."" Well, perhaps it's sophisticated to understand from that single statement, because it has the background of that critics commonly agreed what those three color: Blue, White, Red are stands for the French flag of: Liberty, Equal, Fraternity. Later we might hear some rumors about ""this is not what it originally about"" or ""it was kept by the producer's will"". But we somehow as a literary human being can see some threads of those assertions in the trilogy just from the color-building process. But still, I would prefer not to have those preconceived mind to get into a film, in which it's not healthy for neither film critiques sphere, nor what the film's magic inside of it.The reason why I saying that is also reasonable, because like all those guesswork surrounded the BLUE, they work same as the ""liberty"" innuendo, you can put the martial concept, life and music, self-consciousness...etc whatever including the liberty. To this point, I think those colors and annotations became not that fundamental approach to interpret the work, but the fundamental approach to politicalize the work (from the aspects of post-communism Poland, and a Polish director doing a French dialogue film about European liberty).So let's put away all this politics and see what are films about it. There is, of course, ""liberty"" in it, but in a different way. It's one of the most mundane and ponderous cinematic tour de force that articulated what is liberty-the glass. Last work you might see so much glasses is probably Varda's 5 TO 7 CLEO. But those glasses are different, Varda's glasses are mirrors, Kieslowski' glasses are glasses. The old saying from Jean Renoir, later exercised by Jean-Luc Godard in VIVRE SA VIE, is that the glasses in cinema stands for a matter that isolated character and the freedom in the other side, characters can see it, but can never touch it. And this became the very motif of cinema: the struggle between the freedom and limits.In Kieslowski' BLUE there are so much examples of the glasses, and we this is the direct way that we can feel this cinematic motif of liberty in the whole film, including the beginning shot of heroine's daughter (I don't know what you guys recall, what made me think is Tarkovsky's SOLARIS, and PIERROT LE FOU's car scene, but those vagaries of mine don't seem to connect to any of the plots about) through a glass from the back of a car.Is it impressive? Yes. But this is hardly to make it a ""masterpiece"". Because those tactics from classics maybe half a century ago are brought back from time to time, and mass audiences seem to tired of watching those old tour de force twisted in our modern eyes. And almost the most of poetic sequences in the film are lame and direct, like the fading frame and the interruption of music. It created a sense of the heroine's mind presence along the whole film. But what still I mean is that that is what it is all about.

Beautiful and quiet,"'Trois Couleurs: Bleu' is the first out of three movies directed and co-written by master Krzysztof Kieslowski. This is the story of a woman Julie (Juliette Binoche) who loses her husband, a famous modern composer, and her daughter in a car crash. She deals with this tragic event on her own way.Blue is the first color on the French flag and it stands for ""liberté"", which means freedom. Julie moves away to an anonymous place in Paris where she is free of her past, and therefor free of everything. From here on she has the freedom to do everything she wants.The movie looks beautiful. Of course the color blue is seen a lot. In her old house she even had a ""blue room"". Juliette Binoche is perfect as Julie. The movie is not one of the most happiest and most fun to watch ('Blanc' from the same trilogy is a little happier for example), but there are so many beautiful things to enjoy. Just enjoy this great quiet movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"OK, OK, but what about grief for the daughter?","OK, OK, we get to see Julie struggle with her grief over her husband's death, as is evidenced by the music, the incomplete score, Olivier, the mistress, and so on, but what about the daughter???????Apart from the blue-gemstone-hanging-thing and the blue lollipop, there's almost nothing in the movie about what Julie thinks or feels concerning her daughter, and i'm a  bit puzzled by that.We get to see none of her daughter's friends, her living quarters, her daughter's interests, either at the beginning (when Julie is blocking everything out), or at the end (when she starts opening up to her grief)Are we to think that she was a detached mother to begin with, preoccupied with her husband's career and music?Maybe the scene with her killing the rat and the babies also points to the fact that Julie was a detached mother?And maybe her invitation of the pregnant mistress to come live in the house represents a coming-to-terms of Julie with her detachment as a mother, and thus she would want to make up for lost time?This movie leaves me with more questions than answers.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Blue,"Blue is a Polish film in French, Polish and Romanian with English subtitles. The film is about a woman named Julie who survives a car accident while her husband and daughter were killed. Julie tries to start life again on her own in an apartment in Paris. Along the way Julie discovers things she did not know about her husband and she has to come to terms with her life now that her husband and daughter are gone. Winner of The CEC Award for Best Foreign Film at The Cinema Writers Circle Awards; The Cesar Award for Best Actress (Juliette Binoche who plays Julie), Best Editing and Best Sound at The Cesar Awards; The Goya Award for Best European Film at The Goya Awards; The Guild Film Award Gold for Foreign Film at The Guild of German Art House Cinemas; The Silver Ribbon for Best Female Dubbing at The Italian National Syndicate of Film Journalists; The LAFCA Award for Best Music at The Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards; The Sant Jordi Award for Best Foreign Actress and Best Foreign Film at The Sant Jordi Awards and The Golden Lion (for director and co-writer Krzysztof Kieslowski), The Golden Osella for Best Cinematography and The Volpi Cup for Best Actress at The Venice Film Festival. The film has good direction, a good script, a good performance by Juliette Binoche, good original music, good film editing and good cinematography. The film's director and co-writer Krzysztof Kieslowski made this film in a trilogy of films he called the Three Colors trilogy which is followed by the films White and Red. Blue is a quiet and small film in many ways. There is not a lot of dialogue in the film and the general story is relatively simple when you first view the film, but after viewing it you will later think about it for awhile and have some questions about it. The movie is good looking and I think Juliette Binoche did a very good job expressing her emotions just by her facial expressions and mannerisms instead of using talking seeing as there isn't a lot of that in the film. The film also has a beautiful yet haunting look to it which is very artistic and stylish. Although the film is a little slow moving I was never bored with it and as it moved on I grew more and more curious about the Julie character and I really wanted to see what would happen with her at the end. There is also some neat twists and unpredictable scenes in here that I thought worked quite well too. I must also commend the film for it's great character study of Julie, a woman who is grieving and is also in a state of self discovery. The film is a small and quiet film but it is fascinating and neat to look at and also is quite a thought provoking and intelligent film.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

In this move we watch how the life of a woman changes when her husband and her child die and we can see how she tries to continue her life after all of that.I think that Juliette Binoche (Julie Vignon - de Courcy) who plays as this woman who lost everything makes one of her best interpretations and she is really great.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
A Grand Film,"This movie is more like an 8.5.I had previously watched this film before when I was younger and I did not like it. I was probably to young to grasp the full power of the film and what it represented. I know for the first time saw it for it really was.I can go on and on about the film's many outstanding qualities. Juliet Binoche gives an Oscar caliber performance as the grieving Julie Vignon who has lost both her daugther and husband in a car accident. She performs on so many different dimensions it is hard to describe. Ahh, the music! It was beautiful. From the street performer and his flute to the orchestras going on in Juliet's head to the operatic ending. I don't think music has affected me this deeply in any movie before.

"Stylish, beautiful,","For me, this is the definition of an art movie. Minimal crew, confined spaces, slow pace. Deliberately choosing some key objects and constantly returning to them as for some symbolism. It reminded me of some earlier Ridley Scotts' movies and of some lynch movies, though without the shocking images.Beautiful Juliette Binoche plays, wonderfully, a beautiful, both inside and outside, woman. I have sympathized with her character. Both the idea of the movie and the point at the end are very clear, and portrayed very well. In contrast to other movies where we have some turn in the plot, here we have a turn (change) in the character. So this is mostly a character driven movie.There are lots of concentrations on blue chandelier, blue swimming pool, showing Julie relaxing herself. Such accent on the art made a compromise in the plot. So there was not much going on. For an hour and a half movie, it felt slightly longer than necessary.

The peremptory withdrawal into an existence of self solitude,"A blurred image of a car driving along a country road first, hardly perceived by the young passer-by. And after a few seconds the CRASH, awful, appalling, ineluctable. The half-conscious eye becomes prematurely aware of the death announcement. Almost before the woman realizes it, things have gone too far and it's impossible for her to back out from living damnation. So from an hospital bed of suffering a scream of anguish arises suddenly, seen as a peremptory withdrawal into an existence of immeasurable self solitude, as a controversial evidence of a disillusioned and insignificant future.There it is, the cathartic route to desolation row of a woman voluntarily immersed into voids of memory and determined to erase the past from her mind, doomed to cancel the loss of her family as a free self-imposition thank to the complete repudiation of every sentiments, as if her fate weren't discouraging enough.Julie's route is intended as a cry for freedom. As a release from musical reminiscences thrown into the dust-bin, from the possession of material things whose recollection can stop the healing of open wounds, from love involvements in the enclosed space of some anonymous, empty rooms. Julie's freedom is very heavy, it makes her perceive its oppressing presence every moments of her life, but on the other hand it helps her to empty her mind of every sad recollections of her past. But the line between pain and oblivion is very thin, and sometimes she doesn't even realize she's crossing it.Juliette Binoche puts her heart and brain (more the last one than the first one) into acting the disconsolate widow. Her performance is personally inspired by Annie Dupré's book ""The black angel"", based on the death of the writer's parents in a car crash. Her character is damned to perpetual interior torment, into the BLUE, deprived of the faculty of emerging cathartically to light, necessary intermediate stage to reach a new existential balance.And we can find the BLUE everywhere. BLUE like the reflections of the swimming pool, faithful companion in solitude, relaxing amniotic liquid whose embrace is so welcoming! BLUE like the color of her empty room, once beaming with joy. BLUE like the chandelier, brought with her as the only memory of happy days gone by. BLUE like the notes of the scale that run after each other on the musical pentagram playing a growing hymn to love. But mainly BLUE as symbol of the cold void of the soul fallen on her back, temporarily deaf to the bells of life resounding around it.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
More poignant today then when it was made,"The existentialism remains the same but in light of the ""Me Too"" movement, the struggles of the protagonist have more meaning as we realize the equal rights movement of the 60s and 70s made gains but failed in dissembling a patriarchal culture. Binoche wrestles with her characters inner conflicts wonderfully and depicts desire and depression masterfully. The film has an intentional, slow pace that works as the pauses leave aching moments that quietly propel the story. It is to be ""sipped like a fine wine,"" not gulped down.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

Bluea feature film on an abstract Biblical chapter,"A film on ""I Corinthians Chapter 13"", just as Kieslowski's ""Dekalog"" was based on ""the Ten Commandments"" The later works of Kieslowski never cease to amaze me. Here is a film so spiritual in content with no markings of being a cinematic essay based on an entire abstract chapter in the New Testamenta chapter that could fit into the holy books of any religion and is not strictly limited to Christian theology but universal philosophy that could find equal acceptance by, say, a Sufi scholar or a Hindu mystic. But then Kieslowski made 10 marvelous short films called ""Dekalog"" each loosely based on one of the Ten Commandments. But if the viewer is not well versed with theology or philosophy, the film can be viewed as story far removed from such lofty heights. It would be a mere story of grief and reconciliation to loss of kin (but then Ingmar Bergman did a better job of this subject in the little known 1971 film ""The Touch"" or ""Beroringen"" with Bibi Andersson and Elliot Gould). Kieslowski, was a product of Communist Poland but a Christian in spirit and upbringing. He knew all of us had to make difficult moral choices in life constantly. Interestingly, Ingmar Bergman made another film taking a leaf from the very same Biblical chapter""Through a glass darkly."" In ""Blue,"" the moral choice the lead character makes is to love. Love whom, one may ask? Love the boy who makes a great effort to return the stolen necklace with a cross, the husband who cheated on her marriage, the mistress of her husband with his unborn son in her womb, the husband's colleague who seeks fame from adding final touches to another person's unfinished masterpiece, the unfinished musical work that needs a loving inspired end, love the neighbor who is a prostitute, the servants of the house, the mother in the old age home (most of the images are reinforced towards the end of the film, as excerpts from the Biblical chapter are sung). Ms. Binoche was able to allude to a faint smile at the last frame, the actor's contribution to the film after her understanding of the end of Anton Chekov's play ""The seagull."" Kieslowski retained the contribution of the literate and sensitive actor.Blue--one of the three colors of the French flag. It is the color that defines melancholy in the English language. Blue is the ""untrue"" reflective color of water in a swimming poola cathartic venue where the lead actor swims to rid her fear of rats, a venue that suggests purging of her past fears and marital shackles, a venue where she curls up like fetus in a womb to be reborn.There were unresolved passages in the filmthe despondent face of the daughter staring out of the car, the lead actor's obsessive interest in her dead husband rather than the loss of the daughter and why the mattress was the only furniture left behind in an otherwise empty house. Wish Kieslowski was alive today to explain these loose ends! The film is a superb example of sound editing, music composition and camera-workeach technical department competing for top honors. ""Blue"" was made for Venice Festival just as ""White"" was made for Cannes and ""Red"" for Berlinthe three top film festivals. Venice Festival loves such subjects as ""Blue"" presented""Blue"" was designed for it, each shot from the dunking of the sugar cube to epiphany of the street flute player to the laceration of the hand (spiritual reference to shedding of blood?) on the stones in self mortification.In the final evaluation it is product of teamworkmaking a swansong triptych of a talented director who probably knew his time in this world was limited. If I had not seen Bergman's works mentioned earlier, I would have voted this film as the best of the trilogy. My vote therefore is for ""White,"" as it is more original in style and more complex of the two. Yet each of the ""three colors"" is a work of a master of cinema. I consider it a privilege to have met Kiesolowski briefly and talked to him, through an interpreter, in 1980, much before he had bloomed into a great filmmaker in the early Nineties. At that time he had only made ""Camera Buff"" with Jerzy Stuhra film that impressed me but clearly lacked the maturity of his later works. Poland should to be proud of its great son.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Grief and release,"I saw ""A Short Movie about Love"" a while ago, and it was my first experience with Kieslowski. I liked that movie a lot, so I thought now it's the time to check out the color trilogy.The first part, blue. Well, at first it seemed difficult to approach but in the end I liked it. It's probably one of those movies that get better with time and multiple viewings. There is a lot of symbolism and connections between the images and themes... like, what does the color blue represent in different scenes. Perhaps a bit too artsy and metaphorical for my taste but it kind of pays off in the end.The story is about the main character trying to cope with her grief after the loss of her family. I think the movie leaves a lot of room for interpretation, like, what's the viewer's own life story might also affect a lot on how to understand the film.Overall it's not the kind of movie I usually watch, but pretty interesting drama. Even though it wasn't the most entertaining watching experience ever, the movie made some kind of lasting impression.

Blue,"I find it very difficult to write about Blue. So much has been said about it already, especially by Annette Insdorf (who provides a superb commentary on the Miramax DVD and a video essay on the new Criterion Blu-Ray), that anything I could put forward would be mere repetition. The truth is that as dense as the film is, it's also quite simple. It doesn't require great effort to decode it, certainly not as much as Veronique. Kieslowski's ideas -- about ""liberté"", grief, love, the need to not be completely free of connectedness to others -- are very close to the surface. But there is such elegance to its simplicity that it never feels obvious. Only in hindsight does one think ""Of course that's how it should be done"" because it is all done so perfectly.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

Didn't work for me,"Before I get into my (very brief) comment, I do regard Troi Couleurs: Rouge as one of the best, if not the best film I have ever seen. But I found Bleu flat, and worse, intensely boring. It is, to me, a meandering, pointless exercise in the meaning of fidelity / freedom. Characters behave quirkily without any seeming motivation, and arrive and leave seemingly at random never to be seen again just so that we can have another incidence of infidelity dumped into the picture. There is just too little backstory to make you care about Binoche's character, and too little plot to propel you into the film. I guess what I'm trying to say is that while ""idea based"" films can be enthralling, they can only be enthralling when there is a plot which successfully carries the idea (which is exactly what makes Rouge a masterpiece). Here, there's no plot, just the - pretty primitive - idea, which is exactly why I think Bleu is not a masterpiece.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
"Music, Family and Death","Kieslowski's ""Trois couleurs: Bleu"" (1993) has been among my favourite films for as long as I can remember, yet it manages to surprise me with each viewing: it's so perfectly nuanced, emotionally heartbreaking and demanding, visually coherent and ipso fact perfect elaboration of film as art and art as something of value. The rest of the trilogy is just as mind-boggling in its brilliance, tenderly radical in its visual determination. But this! Nonpareil filmmaking only equaled in the past 20 years by Wong, Malick, Tarr and the Brothers Quay.Kieslowski sees beautifully: organically, rooted in true presence of not only the characters but us; us not only as observers but as participants. He does not only show but truly takes us there, not only refers to emotion but charges each image and sound abundantly with that which we may recognize in ourselves. Reciprocally, not patronizingly, so effortlessly.The smallest of objects become amplified in their significance, and this way Kieslowski and Tarkovsky are alike: the objects are given life much richer than what they usually are as simple décor. They are given memories and this makes them alive for us, since we can see them interface with the people inhabiting this lonely space.This film in particular speaks to me with such force because three things in particular it shares with me that I can share with it: music, family and death. All this in a work of art that exhibits powerful visual ingenuity and radical rethinking of the use of sound and image.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

A very solid drama,"This is very first impression based, so I may post another review afterwards, but after watching it, having not seen White or Red, I think this is an incredibly acted solid film. It reminded me of two films, Cronos, the debut feature from Guillermo Del Toro, and Amelie, the classic from Jean Pierre Jeunet. Blue and Cronos both have a very small scale, low budget, independent feeling about them, focused on one character's journey in a couple of different locations. It seemed like the opposite of Amelie in that they are about women in isolation, but in Blue the isolation is self imposed.
And that is the most interesting aspect of the film to me, this idea of running from your grief and locking yourself up as to avoid it. Juliette Binoche's performance is brilliant and captivating, completely cold, telling that where there once was feeling is now numb.
The interesting use of editing of fading to black at dramatic high points and kicking in the orchestral music was just that, ""interesting"". I'll know on a rewatch whether it works fully for me or not, but I appreciate it had a purpose, although partially distracting.
The naming and colouring of Blue, White, Red could become pretentious but in this film it was not subtle at all, although less distracting after a while. The film gets away with the colour because it really is entirely written around it, capturing the emotions of what blue can represent, beautiful but cold, enticing but distant. The theme of liberty seemed to me to be chastised by Krzysztof, this concept of it being not only a torturous existence to truly imbrace isolation, but also impossible in the world we live in.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

Trois Couleurs: Bleu by Krzysztof Kieslowski,"The theme of grief is one of the most complicated ones to elaborate, which is often explored through poetry and philosophy; they both usually give specific details, about what kind of meaning the grief might has. Some authors might describe the grief as the meaning of a burden, which must be lately thrown away, to feel the freedom again; while other authors might describe the grief as the meaning of something, which must be reflected about the mistakes committed by anyone, who try to search answers to see how far the grief will go. The auteur filmmaker Krzysztof Kieslowski has been interested, to explore this theme; to connect it with one of the three colors of the French flag, which is the blue one that represents freedom. In 1993 came out Trois Couleurs: Bleu by Krzysztof Kieslowski with Juliette Binoche and Benoît Régent. The movie's plot: After a tragic auto wreck, Julie (Juliette Binoche) is filled with grief in her soul, as she has been told her composer husband and her daughter died from the accident. Julie tries to free herself from the grief, by thrown everything away which is connected with her husband's work and other precious objects. She even tries to avoid to have interactions with anybody around, until her old friend Olivier (Benoît Régent) would bring her back to the reality; he would show her, how important it is to have interactions again. The movie shows to be visually captivating, to tell a complicated thoughtful theme, from the beginning to the end, without breaking the narration's rhythm. Even the movie has some missing essential details, to connect its themes with a specific context, which could have been reflected about one specific impactful event, which can be considered relevant with contemporary events. The production designer Claude Lenoir has build the different settings of the story, which the spaces are filled with specific objects and the colors, especially the blue one, to connect with the themes of the movie. Especially to connect with the feelings of the main character, as the spaces and the colors of the settings change, from being initially dark to lately become brighter. The cinematographer Slawomir Idziak has captured some shots to be fundamentally essential, in every camera movements as well as in every angle shots; the camera has been used in the most precise way, to be helped by the lighting, which creates some unique frames to be visually creative. The editor Jacques Witta has elaborated the narration's rhythm, which edits together different shots in the most precise way; some of the most essential frames, which have been edited together, create some of the most poetic sequences. The score by Zbigniew Preisner has been elaborated with musical notes, which describe the emotions of the main character and the themes of the movie, in the most precise way; the musical notes surprise the audience, in some of the most unexpected moments of the movie, by elevating the emotions of the sequences. Juliette Binoche did an excellent performance as Julie, a widow who tries to be free from the grief which is consuming her; once she finds a way to be free from the grief, she would find a way to understand how important it is to have the interaction again. Even there should have been more details about, if Julie has any kind of wishes, to have done more for her husband and her daughter, before the accident; some specific details on the things she hated at most about her husband, while she is suffering and tries to get rid off the grief; the specific details of the happiest memories Julie would lately regain, after she finds what she needed at most. Benoît Régent did a well done performance as Olivier, an old friend of Julie who would lately help her to find the most essential things she was searching to regain. Even there should have been more details about, if Olivier shares some memories he has on Julie's husband and if there are things he misses about the composer; the purposes Olivier wishes at most to have accomplished, but he regrets to have not done; if he has any kind of regrets to have not said to Julie, before she got married. Trois Couleurs: Bleu is one of the most important movies with unique poetic moments, even the movie did not used enough essential elements to be a complete story.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Emotional Liberty,"""Three Colours: Blue"" is the first part of Krzysztof Kieslowski's Three Colours trilogy, the other parts being White and Red. These are, of course, the colours of the French flag, and according to Kieslowski these three colours symbolise respectively liberty, equality, and fraternity, although this is not an interpretation that has ever officially been adopted by the French government.The central character is Julie, a young woman whose husband Patrice, a famous composer, and young daughter Anna are killed in a car accident. Julie herself is also involved in the accident, but survives without serious injury. Her way of attempting to rebuild her life is to cut herself off from everything she has known before. She sells the family's elegant country house and moves to a small flat in Paris. She distances herself from old friends, staying in touch only with her elderly mother, but this does not really count as a tie to the past because her mother, suffering from senile dementia, no longer recognises her. She destroys the unfinished score of the work her husband was working on at the time of his death.Cutting herself off from her past, however, proves to be more difficult than Julie had anticipated, especially after it emerges that a second copy of Patrice's score has survived and that his friend and fellow-composer Olivier Benoît intends to complete it. (The piece is always referred to as a ""concerto"", but the piece we actually hear, a setting for soprano, choir and orchestra of words from Saint Paul's first letter to the Corinthians, is not a concerto in the sense in which classical musicians would normally understand the term. Perhaps Olivier has radically altered Patrice's conception of the work). Julie also discovers that her husband had a mistress, Sandrine, who is pregnant with his child.So what has this story to do with liberty? Kieslowski was clearly asked this question himself, and his answer was that the film is not about political liberty (which is how the French revolutionaries would have understood the word) but about ""emotional liberty"", a rather more nebulous concept. Julie wants to free herself from all emotional bonds but finds that she is unable to do so. No man, and no woman, is an island.Besides being the supposed colour of liberty, the word ""Blue"" has some more literal meanings in this film. In keeping with the sombre theme Kieslowski uses a restrained palette with few bright colours; whites, greys, browns and dull blues and greens are the predominant hues. One of the few brightly coloured objects, however, is a mobile of bright blue beads, which is one of the few possessions which Julie keeps from her previous life and which presumably has some significant meaning for her. (It may have belonged to her dead daughter). Some scenes are also shot under blue light.For a film which deals with what must be among the most traumatic situations imaginable- a young woman suddenly and tragically losing her husband and her only child- the emotional temperature is always far too cool. Julie's attempt to cut herself off from her former life only makes sense if one interprets it not as callousness but as the only strategy she can think of to deal with her extreme grief, yet I never got much sense of this from Juliette Binoche's rather restrained performance.

A Superb Movie,"A great movie from a famous director. For the first time, i knew ""Krzysztof Kieslowski"" by this this movie and suddenly, it makes me feel restless for watching more and more from him. Be specific on ""Blue"", this masterpiece could be watched over and over and every time it looks mysterious and challenging. Excellent directing, engaging screenplay, smooth and glazing plays especially by actress in leading role ""Juliette Binoche"" and last but surely not least music composed by Zbigniew Preisner make this movie unforgettable. Noteworthy, Blue is part of trilogy written and directed by ""Krzysztof Kieslowski"" that the other two are White and Red.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"A Study of Dissociated, Interior Conscience, Thus Blue","Juliette Binoche is impressively becoming in her role as a woman whose husband and child are killed in a car accident within the first five minutes of the movie. Then proceeds a story that we imagine must be about how she wrestles with her loss, but as she is abruptly set free from the connection of family, Julie attempts to fortify herself from everyone in her life and live in isolation from those former ties. However, she finds herself making new connections she can't seem to help but make. What a beautiful capture of humanity that is. Many of us would love to take advantage of a golden, if heartbreaking, opportunity to sever all ties. Yet the film presents a profound question: To what extent do we need human contact? Is it something even the most walled-off of us can do without?Blue is the perfect color for such a subject. It's a moody, quiet color that evokes water, which complements emotion in many ways. Kieslowski has made such a personal film, such a deeply personal insight which feels like, for him, it was bold. He parades proudly his telling story with a theme of powerful music.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Pure nature sets us free,"Truly, a masterpiece dealing with freedom and the ability an individual has to live totally free in the real world. A somehow slow-going movie, definitely unsuitable for action films fans, Blue is the touching story of a woman, whose family is killed in a car accident. However, she survives and decides to move on and tries to set herself free from her past, which proves a very difficult thing to do.The direction is wonderful and Juliette Binoche is absolutely terrific. What I really loved about this film, though, was was the heavenly classical music throughout. Juliette Binoche's husband was a composer in the film, and she also has a thing for it, so we get to listen to some beautiful pieces that classical music fans will enjoy very much. The music sets the perfect mood, and is so brilliant that points to the real meaning : freedom does not come by denying your surroundings and living anonymously. Freedom is achieved through doing what you feel like, through not turning your back on your nature. A free person is the person that does everything he likes doing. Which, in this case, is composing wonderful music.A must see film for all meaningful movie lovers.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"Nebulous plot, sublime execution","This movie left me quite conflicted as it really is a strange film. On the one hand, like in typical art house style, the plot stagnates. While Juliette Binoches performance is outstanding in what ultimately is a one woman show, I cannot help but feel it peculiar that Julie's icy cold callousness and brooding can last quite so long into the film. Certain scenes like that of the mice in her apartment also feel as if they serve no purpose. Despite this, there is no doubt that the director is at the top of his game. The technical execution of this film is simply sublime- the camera acts almost as if it were a being with agency and purpose, every shot is pitch perfect. The directors use of the colour blue, through blue reflections, a blue foil, or some blue beads is both clever and artful. The music used is also superb, where the natural diegetic sounds are suddenly interrupted by stirring notes of the score for dramatic effect. These three techniques- the camera, the music and the acting- communicated information on emotions, motivations, and plot, whereas other films may rely solely on dialogue to do the same. Regardless, I must say the film sometimes leaves too much to be implied and too less to be explicitly communicated through dialogue, leaving some things more nebulous than I would have liked. It ought to be remembered that Three colours blue is, all being said, still an art film which might rely too much on ""show, not tell"" for a general movie audience.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"Artful melodrama, though not flawless","""Blue"" is an emotional study of a woman trying to cope with the sudden loss of her husband and daughter.The pacing is moderate which is fine during the first hour, but since there is no tight storyline to follow, the last third is a bit strenuous.One of the strength of the movie is the unique use of music in connection with fade into black. I think its intention is to show how much music is inside the character of Juliette Binoche. Due to her mourning she is trying to suppress this music but it still finds its way to the surface.The movie contains some very impressive closeups, i.e. a feather on a blanket, a reflecting eye shot, a piece of sugar which is soaked up with coffee, etc . I think it underlines the inner conflicts and sadness of the protagonist, who is trying to shield herself from what is going on around her.The color blue is nicely present everywhere. In particular I enjoyed the exquisite scenes in the swimming pool.I was disappointed by a subplot with a young woman who is a neighbor and works in the red light district. I know that Kyszlowski didn't want to explain everything in his movies and leave room for interpretation. But here it seems to me that they had to take some scenes out of the movie which leaves this subplot underdeveloped.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

Courage,"In light of the many glowing reports on this film, it takes a little courage to admit that beyond a few impressive story telling techniques and some memorable uses of color, Blue was altogether unremarkable.  After the inginuity, one's audience still must invest in the story, or at least in how one is telling it.

BLUE has incredible scenes of human emotion, but also has scenes that are utterly pointless.

I love the scene where she gets locked out of the house and we are allowed to search her face for, what it seems like, several minutes.  Wonderful acting!

Grief Presents a Different Path for Each of Us,"When an automobile accident claims the lives of her husband and young daughter, a distraught French woman fades from view. Deliberately removing herself from the trappings of her former, affluent life, she ghosts her friends, rents a bare apartment in a slummy part of town, frequents the local coffee shop and waits for a new life to come knocking. Which it does, along with a few pesky remnants of her old one. In the end, she must choose between cherishing the best years of her early adulthood and discarding their memory in favor of a fresh start.Although this is a film about loss, it's not a drag. Not entirely, anyway. While she's frequently stung by echoes of her past, Julie gradually grows to accept and appreciate these reflections as more than just monuments to a misfortune. Over time, she opens herself to new people and experiences she would've avoided before the accident. After she's had time to think it over, she uses an unfinished musical composition to explore different aspects of her ex-husband and the relationship they shared. Personal tragedy isn't the only challenge we see Julie face, but in showing grace and generosity to solve other obstacles, she learns to process her loss, heal, and let go. I found that beautiful.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Hollow and Overblown,"Overrated movie by Kieslowski. The lead actress, Juiette Binoche, gives an acceptable performance, in a story that lacks the depth it purports to have. The movie is a vehicle to promote the Lead Actress.
Shallow characters, superficial study of grief, masquerading as something intense and grandiose. This type of "" Designer Sentimentality"" needed more courage and a much better story to succeed. The movie is very plain, and actually banal and conventional. There is no real exploration of grief, and no real darkness. The end of the movie is extremely bad. The plot and characters do not get the audience involved. I saw this movie in Madrid in 1994 for the first time, in the small theatre of a University. People normally behaved. In 20 min, many people were talking, unable to pay attention. Nobody liked it but two wannabe critics that always followed standard intellectual opinion without questioning anything. I watched again the movie yesterday, 30 years later, with my partner, who loves French Cinema. In a few hours, she told me i could not even remember how the movie finished. Pedantic film.

Simple and complicated.,"A sombre start to a trilogy directed entirely byKrzysztof Kieslowski. It's plot begins almost immediately as Julie deals with her grief of losing her husband and daughter in a car accident.There are many emotions throughout and these are played expertly by Juliette Binoche who gives a powerful, yet subtle performance. Three Colours: Blue starts bleakly but somewhat brightens up throughout the film. Julie has her own way of dealing with grief. She believes she is ready to move on and the easiest way to deal with this is to simply try and forget. Perhaps she is right.Nothing in this film is overly complicated, from it's minimalistic soundtrack. Krzysztof Kieslowski allows the environment and the surroundings take centre stage. At the same time, there is much interpretation that different viewers will take. An excellent start to it's trilogy and I'm looking forward to seeing more.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Alireza.akhlaghi.official,"Awesome and lovely blue movie is one of the three feature films of Kishlovsky's famous and well-known director of Poland.
As you can see, the trio of white and red were synonymous and complementary, but with separate stories that can be linked together.
With the sudden death of husband and child, life has found its diffrent way.
One kind of confusion is to find the way that July (the first character of story) is somehow calm, though superficial.
Finding this path at the start of the journey is in the form of a test and error, so that in the first place a story is an unconditionally close but divergent condition, and it is in the next departure.
The new way was so unclear that when July left the house forever, he dragged his hands to the wall, indicating a sort of punishment for escaping and not confronting the truth of the matter.
The path of the story goes as if the Miserables are not over; the suicide attempt, the confrontation of the mouses, the challenge of ejection the infamous woman, and the confrontation with Alzheimer's mother, completes the black puzzle.
However a fearless and conservative character perform the story of a passive and radical approach.
The fight against the baby mouses is somewhat radical to perform that the audience has not forgotten that at the beginning of the film, the first character of the story also saw her child's death.
Leaving the cat at home to fight the mouses and also tear off the music notes of the Alliance of Europe seems to be a clear indication of a kind of unconscious revenge as long as the story changed.
The confrontation with the mistress of the missing husband along with the child leads to the movie spin. As far as we can see, Kishlovsky's triple blue at the end continues the music.
In this movie, we see that the elements, although simple, are well displayed.
The blue necklace, the cross necklace, the flute player are frequent indications of the film, which is even attractive for repetitions.
Music in the film sometimes appears as an Aggressor, but Effective in the story line.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

Navigating life despite it all,"Three colors: blue is the first part of Krzysztof Kieslowski's trilogy.The movie is about Julie (Juliette Binoche) who loses her husband and daughter in a tragic car accident. We follow Julie as she tries to navigate her new existence.The movie has an almost dreamlike quality to it at times with blue being present throughout most of the film. It's always nice to see films utilize colors in interesting ways, instead of the generic stuff in most big blockbusters. However, the use of blue is not exactly a gimmick, it never feels as if the filmmaker is trying to be profound.Blue is not a film where an awful lot of things happen. We see Julie go through her emotions in an effort to live on with the immense burden of sorrow that rests in almost every frame of the film. Julie is a stern and strong-willed character. At first, she comes off as almost too stoic and indifferent to everything; this is partly justified due to her having just lost her family. Yet throughout the film, we see her make connections with other people. She forges friendships and bonds with strangers and helps them along their journey. A very interesting juxtaposition is thus created between the way Julie represents herself and the way she acts.The film is full of moments that will stay in your mind long after the film is over. The film takes its time and lets these moments sit, this creates a slow pacing that fits and further enhances the film. The slow pace is never a problem since the film is only 90 minutes long. The cinematography and direction are both top notch like when Julie is told of the ascendant at the hospital, the doctor is reflected in her eye and we do not see her. Juliette Binoche delivered a performance for the history books with a powerful yet underplayed performance.Regimented to people who like:

Incredible use of music.,"Since I saw this movie in 1993, I've seen it again many times and appreciated it more every time I see it.  The one aspect of it that caught my attention first was it's dramatic use of music.  There's a distinct lack of atmospheric music, which becomes blaringly obvious when, during the grieving process, the lead character is suddenly hit with a severe sadness; something I find to be an accurate depiction. The overall feeling of the movie itself seems, to me, to be >like that of music: not forceful in it's attempt to provoke emotion, more of a subtle feeling of sharing in the human experience that is both painful and beautiful.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

The use of musical stage and color is very successful. My favorite movie in the trilogy.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
5/10. Not recommended.,"I watched this movie 20-something years ago and i disliked it so much that i didn't even want to watch another Kieslowski movie ever.Recently, i watched ""THREE COLORS RED"". Whereas i didn't find it a masterpiece, i consider it as a very good movie (7,4/10). So, i decided to revisit the BLUE once more.I was somewhat wrong, this is not a bad movie, there are some positives here. Juliette Binoche is excellent, there were some strong scenes, music was great and overall, this is an artistic creation with merits. But still, i didn't like it. At times, it was painful to watch, not because it was heartbreaking but because it was slow as hell. Slow and uneventful. Almost nothing is happening, nothing meaningful at least, exciting, even sad. It's flat and blund. Many reviewers praised its cinematography. I disagree. Dull and gloomy and so urban. I didn't find any beauty in this movie, stylistically/visually/aesthetically. I get that this is not a happy movie but if it meant to be a tragedy, i still didn't feel it at all. And if this was exactly the point, id est a woman who finds the strength to carry on, i didn't feel even for a moment her struggles and what she was going through. Nothing.

The ingenious phraming of every shot i found brilliant and the way he managed to integrate all of the themes into this was again breathtaking. It is the story of a women's attempt to come to terms with the death of her family. However we are not only shown the relationships she has lost but how this has affected others.

A triumph of the human spirit...,"This film has been a constant source of inspiration for me since seeing it five years ago.  Juliette Binoche turns in an amazing performance as Julie, a woman who loses her husband and young girl in an auto accident that she survives. Numbed, Julie reacts by giving up her material possessions and turning her back on humanity.  After starting life anew, however, she is forced to come to terms with and help the eccentric characters she meets (including the sex-show worker who is despised in Julie's building and the lawyer carrying her deceased husband's child).These characters force Julie to feel emotion and ambition again. Watching Julie finish the grand musical composition that her husband began is to see a triumph of the human spirit.  Despite the tragedy that made her want to ultimately withdraw from life, she brilliantly perseveres in the end. ""Bleu"" is a truly inspirational story.I highly recommend watching Binoche in ""The English Patient"" and ""Damage"", two films which further show-case her talent and beauty.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Melancholy but truthful,"It's a romantic(?) drama set in the early 1990s, primarily in Paris, France. It follows the first six or seven months of a widow's life after losing her husband, a famous composer, and her daughter in an automobile accident.The movie begins with the fateful accident. Julie (Juliette Binoche) is too injured to attend the joint funeral of her famous husband, Patrice, and her five-year-old daughter, Anna. She returns to their country home, sells all the furniture, and tries to destroy the uncompleted score her husband was creating for the new European Union. After an enigmatic liaison with Olivier (Benoît Régent), her husband's closest collaborator, she disappears into Paris to silently absorb her loss.While there she is occasionally reminded of her past and builds a modest relationship with a sex worker, Lucille (Charlotte Véry) who lives in the same building. Olivier tracks her down, but she puts him off until she later learns he has a copy of the uncompleted score and is trying to complete it. She also learns her husband had a mistress, Sandrine (Florence Pernel), who is pregnant with Patrice's child.The film then resolves Julie's relationship with Olivier and with Sandrine.This is a beautifully filmed (cinematography by Slawomir Idziak) story. The ""blue"" theme resonates throughout. The storyline is melancholy but struck me as truthful about one response to the painful death of loved ones.

blue,"Although it has the usual stuck in quicksand pacing so beloved by this director and at times verges on misery porn this is the best of the hues trilogy, in my opinion.

"""It's only after we've lost everything that we're (almost) free to do anything.""","Freedom is a beautiful word but ""Blue"" deals with the kind of freedom we'd rather not confront once, the one born from the rejection of all achievements, possessions and items of meaningfulness that defined our life... after a tragedy struck.Julie loses her husband and daughter in a car accident. She tries to commit suicide but living is too strong a call to be ignored, she spits out the tablets and apologizes to the nurse for breaking a glass. Later, she sells her property, gets rid of her fortune and starts a new life with what's at hands: anything but the past that would drown her in an ocean of melancholy. The only concession to the past is that Julie knows she'll never be happy.And so she moves to some random apartment in Paris and has an affair with the man she knew was in love with her. This is the freedom she doesn't enjoy as much as she undergoes it in a sort of survival and cathartic move. Whether it's truly freedom is left to debate, but we're never left with the feeling that Julie is seeking joy, maybe contentment, acceptance and pinches of satisfaction here and there. So life goes on and appease wounds but allows a few corridors to the past, weakening that fragile 'rebirth' edifice.And I guess the appeal of ""Blue"" relies on that very fragility, one that only Juliette Binoche, one of the sweetest and most delicate faces of French cinema could portray. Binoche is so great an actress that even her expressionless moments deliver the right amount of emotionality. She never looks totally happy, nor totally sad, but always at the verge of two totally opposite emotional directions, whatever they are. She's walking on a tightrope with the past acting like gravity and the wind of present blowing, she can only move forward, never look down, any step back and it's the big plunge.This is not a character but a feeling's study, a remarkable exploration of the complexity of a brave soul from Krzysztof Kieslowski. The late Polish director uses many shots that emphasize Julie's perspective: a close up on a sugar cube absorbing the coffee, a fight seen from her balcony, a street flutist, an old lady with a stooped posture, a family of mice found in the new house. Like the sugar cube, Julie absorbs all these encounters as micro-experiences and then drops everything, never letting any encounter rooting in her life, she finds comfort in the vacuum of the present.It's easy to regard ""Blue"", the first opus of the famous ""Three Colors"" trilogy as an auteur film without a tangible plot but with an introspective look on life. The film might strike as too slow, too contemplative, too bizarre in its editing but it could only work as long as Binoche was consistent with her character... and she always was, as a woman who, unlike Blanche Dubois, depends on the comprehension of strangers. Life has been so unkind to her she can deal without kindness and this is why she has no scruples throwing her husband's last opera partition (composed for some European Union ceremony) in a waste truck. But maybe Art is too great a thing not to survive and Kieslowski the storyteller can't side anymore with his muse and allow the music to resurface in the story.In the end, it's up to Julie to accept that she can't pretend her past doesn't exist because her husband affected so many lives and those lives still depend on him. There's an arc in Julie's journey in the way she cancels out a few clauses of her existential pact after realizing the way her selfishness deprived people from something that meant a lot in their own lives. The director is too passionate an artist to have a great piece of music being sacrificed, even in a fiction, and there might be a symbolic parallel between the posthumous oeuvre and one baby leaving in the womb of a mistress. Life like the show must go on... and perhaps the greatest triumph of Julie would be to face the present without pretending the past doesn't exist.I think it's a film about grief more than any exhilaration of freedom. The photography is always intimate even in the external shots, served by a beautiful cinematography, exploring any possibility to paint the screen in a shade of blue (a swimming pool, emerald stones, a blue room). But beyond all these photographic tricks and this is coming from someone whose favorite color happens to be blue, the story was so absorbing that I could find a whole world in Binoche's blue performance. Whether it was intentional that the ""Blue"" opus would be that sad I don't know but it's a film that I won't forget any soon... not on a personal level. As a father, I can't imagine how unbearable life would be if something ever happened to my daughter. I don't know if I'd be as tough as Julie, but I guess I would try to find a way.It's a cathartic experience indeed, difficult and serious but short enough to sustain that heaviness in gravity. I won't forget that shot where Julie is in fetal position in the swimming pool, she doesn't sink, doesn't float, doesn't swim, she resists like a baby in the mother's womb... waiting for the miraculous rebirth, as a woman without a past. At the end she's a woman with a past and a future, reconciled with time and able to let a timid smile slip from her face. Just because tears are flowing all over your eyes doesn't mean life isn't worth a little smile, after all.There's probably a lot to say about ""Blue"" but let's just see what's behind ""White"" now, the story about equality... though I suspect it will rise above these values' gimmick and be another powerful statement about something about life. We'll see...",9.0,Anonymous,Music

One of the worst films of the '90s,"This film is one of the worst films I've seen in a long time.

Disengaging,"A woman (Juliette Binoche) survives a car crash which kills here husband and child. Her life wrecked, she sells up and withdraws from life. Fortunately she is extremely wealthy  her husband was a world famous composer - in fact we are led to believe she wrote his stuff for him. This had me groaning - the woman's existence is on such impossibly ethereal plane that it undermines the emotional core of the film - the old problem of watching someone suffering who has less excuse for suffering than most. Far more tragic, surely, if they had been struggling and she had been left penniless, but then, Kieslowski is clearly only interested in dealing with refined, precious people - even his Dekalog series dealt mainly with doctors, lawyers, professors and suchlike  it's probably significant that my favourite episode deals with a taxi driver (though not the murdered one). As a result of the socio-economic distancing, Binoche's post-crash trauma is too indulgent, too minutely detailed, too drawn out. The sterile affair she then has with her husband's associate seems predictable, and the salvation achieved in the latter part of the film when she takes to working on the music is only banal.There are some nice things here though. The sense of throwing everything up and withdrawing from the world (""I have only one thing left to do. Nothing."") is something rare and valuable in film. The scene with the rats nest is memorable  it was perhaps the moment in which we can relate to her most. But on the whole, Binoche's character is a priggish, hard-headed, snooty bore, too willful and self-controlled, too wealthy and too preternaturally talented to be of much interest. No doubt Kieslowski was chummy with world famous composers who live in country mansions the size of small citadels and who have wives as tasty and accomplished as Juliette Binoche. The rest of us have to put up with real world.",,Anonymous,Music
Real grief,"Anyone who has ever experienced loss of the magnitude experienced by Julie, the central character in ""Blue"", will find in this film an piercingly accurate portrayal of the grieving process. This is a film about falling apart -- and slowly, painfully, learning to put the pieces back together, taking a single step into the world, and then another and another. This in itself would make it a remarkable film, but it goes even further. In addition to its emotional intensity and depth, it also has a strong plot, a magnificent soundtrack, wonderful characters and even humour (the mattress incident alone is worth the price of admission). And Juliette Binoche gives the performance of a lifetime, one that is human, raw and achingly sympathetic. What more could anyone possibly want?",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Beautiful grief,"When viewed by its own right, and not as part of a trilogy, Blue is simply a beautiful movie. Above all the heavy layers of symbolism and social commentary - which, I admit, were a bit too heavy-handed for my taste - there's a simple and touching drama about grief, loss and recuperation. Beautifully shot, beautifully edited, and played out with subtle and minimalistic perfection by Juliette Binoche.Most of all, stylistically, Blue excels in its juxtaposition of image and music, and it does so on almost every shot. Some of the elements that try for symbolism felt to me like they try too hard - the excessive use of blue colors, or the brief blackouts. But at its quietest, simplest moments, the music and image compliment each other to create a perfect mood, and cinema at its purest.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

True Bleu,"Kieslowski's ""Bleu,"" the first installment of the ""Trois couleurs"" series is a rapturous splendor, treading gracefully upon the grounds of hopelessness and disillusion experienced by Julie (Juliet Binoche) with a vibrance and intimacy that has never been matched - there is a certain parity at all times between Binoche's visceral performance and the serene metaphysical landscape painted by Salwomir Idziak's cinematography, which is constantly involved with the extraordinary aspects of the everyday that most refuse or aren't capable of seeing. Although Julie's spiritual transformation is the film's central focus, that metamorphosis isn't possible without Zbigniew Preisner's score. Like the balancing act of the camera and the performers, Preisner strikes a chord (if you'll excuse the pun) that resonates softly, initially, but as it drones on begins to echo the lingering antagonisms of consciousness that haunt the protagonist after her loss. On the other hand, it is in fact the harrowing reminder that is the music that allows Julie to reach the other side, to surface amidst the beautiful elegy that is closure and, in turn, release.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

The first installment of the best trilogy ever created,"""Blue"" (along with ""White"" and ""Red"") is a cinematic masterpiece and one of (if not the) most innovative and powerful films of the 90s. Director-writer Krzysztof Kieslowski suggests an anti-climactic approach to a more visual interpretation of both physical and mental pain. How does one cope with loss of a loved one? How do we continue living if we're totally alone? Kieslowski forms a narrative around the characters in the story, and around their whole existence. Although the story is a deep focus of the heroine or protagonist, it shows the world both through and outside of her eyes.Juliette Binoche stars as Julie, a successful woman who has everything one would ever want, until one day when driving in a car with her family, the car crashes killing both her husband and daughter. After losing her family, Julie detaches herself from any memories, thoughts, and pain by giving up everything she's ever wanted, and starting a new life in an obscure area. Julie's deep passion always was and will be with music, and through her subconscious the music comes back and reminds her that she once was a happy woman.In the first five minutes of the movie you're completely hypnotized. It opens up with a closeup shot of a wheel from a car spinning on the street as the car drives. The cinematography sucks you in and almost foreshadows a more saddening mood, suggesting this road ends before the car reaches the destination. We're only shown the back of the characters in the car and we're left with very little to think about in terms of their psychology. Kieslowski knew exactly what he was doing by opening the scene in such a way. When the car crashes (in the most detailed and realistic crash scene I've ever seen), the movie cuts to a closeup of someone's eye in which we can see a man's reflection. We automatically know we are inside someone's head and that they are almost too tired to look at the man. Kieslowski's incredibly cinematic opening scene is just the beginning of a visually stunning and deep film.The eye is that of Julie's, who's lying in bed as the man tells her that her husband and her daughter are dead. We expect a big scene where the woman breaks down, smashing everything around her in a dramatic attempt to kill herself. But all we see is her shift her head and we know that she's suffering without having to show it. The idea of ""Blue"" is to question whether or not someone can start over and heal without going through the mourning process. We are lead to believe that Julie can, but something always comes back and reminds us that maybe we are wrong. Some scenes create this illusion by having the picture fade to black as we hear music then fades back to the picture. We all know that a technique in editing where fading to black is used to represent passage of time. But in this situation, it's nothing of the sort. Julie constantly blocks any memory from her mind, but the mind always pushes those memories out. Her husband was a composer and the music she suddenly hears is both a reflection of her past and a reminder to her that she is still alive.Every minute of the movie we are exposed to the pain that Julie is experiencing. This is more of a statement than it is an expression though, since Kieslowski uses magnificent techniques to draw out this emotion. In one scene, Julie is swimming in a pool (where she goes every night to let out her physical energy so that she doesn't explode with everything she's been keeping in), and her husband's music starts playing in her head. She pauses and allows herself to sway back into the pool, in the part of it that represents death. Juliette Binoche describes this as a form of a fetus who's not yet pushed into the real world.Kieslowski loves to pay attention to detail. Everything that's on the screen is a form of reality and a symbol of pain, suffering and isolation. For example, the scene in which Julie is in a restaurant drinking coffee exemplified just how much this woman is emotionally constricted. She hears music that she and her husband wrote, and she automatically shelters herself away from it, to disallow herself to have her memories come back. She quietly puts a cube into her coffee and watches the sugar turn brown. To some extent this is a perfect example of how not only Julie is withdrawn from life and others, but so are we, the audience.There's no doubt that this allegory is a masterpiece in film-making. Kieslowski often moves in and out of the frame with the camera, showing us a world that we're meant to see, instead of just placing an element in a frame and keeping it there to blatantly smack us with the message. To some, ""Blue"" is a masterpiece and to me it's also inspiration. Everything from its incredible cinematography to the haunting and memorable score, is flawless. Whether or not ""Blue"" is the least favorite of the trilogy, it comes in at my list (and many other's) as one of the best movies of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Perhaps I'm clueless...,"Okay, this movie is undoubtably one of the top technical films I've seen. Its use of solid colors and those corresponding shades on everything (especially the use of blue and green) was a good job on that aspect. My gripe comes with the story. Maybe this old Hollywood brain of mine still can't comprehend French cinema, but this movie seemed a tad predictable. My other gripe is that I couldn't connect with the Binoche character. She seemed unfeeling to everything (which is fine if she chooses to live her life like that) and it was hard to see her destroyed over killing innocent mice but not over her child. Then, I was wondering if I was going to see the ""tangled web of lies and passion"" the stupid back of the video box promise. I got this half-baked idea that didn't pan out anywhere that I could have inferred from the first 5 minutes of the film. Maybe a re-watch is in order for this ""just okay"" film.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
"Kieslowski masterfully paints all of the colors, Blue, White and Red: see all three!","It is not only difficult to comment separately on the three parts of Kieslowski's trilogy, it seems obvious that the filmmaker wants us to do just the opposite:  view them in order, Blue, White, and Red, and consider them together as one complete work.  It is true they are distinct stories with distinct themes: liberty, equality, fraternity, and each them is developed with unique applications of intrigue and artistry.  They are each well worth seeing independently, but I believe they are best seen as one work.  Collectively, I would rate the trilogy as a 9; separately, I place each in my top ten for the years 1993 and 1994.Blue is the mood of a grieving woman who lost her husband and daughter in a rural car crash; it is the shadows playing on her face in a cold hospital room as she watches television coverage of the funeral; it is light shining into an empty room of her house.  Blue is the color of her dreams and memories, which she tries to erase after the tragedy, and of the liberty she seeks after the disappointing turn in her life.  Liberty is the ultimate theme here, corresponding to the three worded French motto, `Liberty, Equality, Fraternity.'  Of the three Color films, Blue is the most stunningly photographed and conceptualized.  The plot is almost secondary and the dialogue is sparse, which gives all the more emphasis on the visual and on the thematic.  With excellent acting by Juliette Binoche, this movie rates a 9.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

A Film Which Gives the Term 'Art-House' a Bad Name.,"I was dragooned into this one by my ex and a friend when it came out. Yes, it is a striking-looking film, but my personal reaction was total uninvolvement with Binoche's character despite the obviously tragic situation. One had the feeling of watching a particularly long-winded film equivalent of a colour Sunday supplement in which every mood was calculated to the Nth degree.One wonders how many people actually liked the film as opposed to thinking they should like a work deliberately aimed at a particular type of niche audience.

An awesome film to look at but not to watch,"Trois Couleurs: Bleu is one of the most amazingly crafted films I have ever had the privilege to watch. Being the first in Kieslowski's series of films about contemporary French culture, it was naturally the first and (up to this point) the only one that I've seen.It is visually perfect: Kieslowski's direction, his attention to detail and his sheer style ring truer here than in Amator, the only other of his films that I've witnessed. He also manages to extract a marvellous performance out of Juliette Binoche who portrays a female composer dealing with the tragic and unexpected death of her husband and her child, basically without grieving. She's essentially a fairly frustrating character, comparable to the character of Stephane from another great French flick, Un Coeur en Hiver. She effectively isolates herself from painful feeling by similarly isolating herself from the people around her and from her music. The onscreen result is brilliantly sad in the way it is portrayed, however it is unfortunately quite thin, and at times a little slow.The overall effect, then, is not exactly a film to sit down and watch repeatedly. Once is enough, and you can feel happy that you've watched a master at work. But like I've said about other films, Trois Couleurs: Bleu is far more of an exercise in artistic filmmaking than just a film. You can scrutinise it, analyse it and appreciate it for all its brilliance but not watch it 'just for fun'. I'm not saying this is a bad thing, because it sure isn't. It's wonderful that there are films out there like this that care far more about artistic merit than taking the audience 'for a ride', it will always help to expand the range of cinema.And while I may often sit down to enjoy a high-explosive Van-Damme popcorn flick, it's far more of a delight to see a tale like this being brought to life with such exceptional quality.****1/2 / *****",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Wonderful and Powerful,"Review In A Nutshell:Blue tells the tale of a woman who is trying to cope with a recent car accident that involved the death of her husband and child.Blue is one of those films where one couldn't predict the ending, as there wasn't a measurable goal established during the first or second act of the film and the director was aiming for a sense of realism when shaping the lead protagonist, therefore the character would not be following the traditional path of absolution and instead making one that is tailored for the character. I truly admired Krzysztof Kieslowski's approach with the film as filmmakers these days seem to try their best to cater towards the audience's expectations and resolve the character's story the way that is acceptable for them, which at times hurt the film's emotional and thematic impact. The film doesn't let us get too close to our protagonist, Julie, we never at any moment get inside her head, we only have her actions and her words to shape our perspective of her and I think this approach kind of left me a tad bit detached at some moments and finding it hard to empathise, but I think the director wanted us to not let the film speak itself too frankly, he wants us to keep coming back and observing her, hoping that each visit would let us become closer to the character and develop a unique understanding of who she is, what she is feeling, and how she would get through it.The film also explores Julie's coping mechanism of her depression and grief. Julie's way of coping is definitely not something a psychiatrist or counsellor would recommend as her remedy is to isolate herself from the objects that could bring about memories of her loved ones. Julie also engages herself in activities like swimming, which at first I thought was her way of distracting herself from the recurring thoughts of her family, as the film went on I started to see what Kieslowski was trying to create with those scenes, she is swimming in her sadness and at times drowning herself in it. This held me back in thinking she is close to moving on with her life, but since the director is going for something more realistic in dealing with depression, I was more willing to let myself accept the decisions that the characters make. Throughout the late second-third act of the film, we are treated to a side of Julie that wasn't primarily seen at the start of the film. We get to see her immerse herself in the art of music, which I found to be highly entertaining as this gives us a glimpse of what she used to be and how talented she was before the tragic event.I cannot go into high subjective detail on the film's cinematography as I feel that I need to go through this once more before I could properly criticize the choices that both the director and cinematographer have taken. All I could say for now is that the photography of the film captures that distance between us and the protagonist perfectly, no matter how close the camera is we could never fully penetrate her. There were a couple of times where I did feel the use of the color blue was a bit too emphasised in a couple of shots, but then over time I was able to get through it and appreciate it's usage, particularly the scenes that involves Julie swimming in the large pool. The film at times switches between mounted and stable shots to hand held tracking shots. The director is manipulating how much of the character we see, there are times where the film lets us in and at times we only see partially or are too far away from the character.The film's score was a definitely one of the film's highlights as the score creates this sense of impact during particular moments in the film, accurately representing how she feels at that given moment. The film was clever enough to have the film's protagonist be aware of the music, as the music seems to play as a reminder of the event and at the same time a sense of inspiration in how his husband's magnum opus composition should turn out. Since both the protagonist and the audience can hear the music, we are able to feel a sense of empathy, which is something of a rarity throughout the film.The film's acting was mainly anchored by Juliette Binoche and she does a wonderful job here. I have only seen the actress on Abbas Kiarostami's Certified Copy which I thought she did a great job with, but her performance in this film took my perspective of her even further. Binoche is an outstanding actress who definitely deserves more credit than she currently has as when he embodies a role, she does it with such precision that one's previous understanding of the actress would be wiped clean when starting a new film. Just on scenes where the camera captures a close up of her face, she doesn't reveal much but it definitely does not seem hollow, there is something there but one has to look harder in order to obtain it.Blue is a great film that contains a wonderful and powerful performance from Juliette Binoche and a story that avoids from being predictable. If one places an effort to understand and connect with the character, then one would be left highly rewarded by the end of the film.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

"""A movie that is filled with emotional power and a close-observed character""","Trios Couleurs: Bleu is a movie that I really enjoyed, it's such a beautiful movie filled with some beautiful scenes and shots that will take you into the mind of the character Julie.Julie (Juliette Binoche) is a young Frenchwoman who is struggling to find a way to live her life after the death of her famous composer husband and her child.Blue is a movie that needs patient, it's a movie that's filled with emotional power and a close-observed character. In Blue I felt like I was Julie, I felt like I was seeing what Julie was seeing, I felt like I was listening to what Julie was listening, and that's the beauty of the film.I loved how the movie's name is Blue and you will notice that in nearly every single scene / shot the color blue or at least a certain shade of the color Blue is there even if it's a small thing like a sign in a street or a shirt that a character is wearing, blue is just always there and you will know why the color Blue has a big effect on Julie and it takes on deferent meanings to match Julie's emotions. The Cinematography & colors were just so beautiful and pure.The Production design was so amazing, the beautiful streets of France, the swimming pool, and Julie's apartment, it just gives you that weird grief feeling that Julie is feeling inside of her.The incredible score (the symphony) that was so weird, full of emotions and starts to play suddenly, I loved how in some scenes pieces of the symphony suddenly play over the soundtrack at emotional moments and how Julie seems to hear it as if it's surging up from inside her own mind, also the scene when she throws the sheet music into the garbage truck if you listen closely, the song distorts as the trash compactor's teeth tear the paper. We are hearing everything exactly the way that Julie is hearing.Juliette Binoche's performance was so crazy, she didn't have many lines in the film and she rarely speaks but, she was able to give us such a deep performance as her character navigates grief, in one of the scenes that I can't mention or I'll spoil the movie, Juliette Binoche was able to play Julie's hurt and anger, but also her curiosity and maybe even envy all at once. She was just incredible and was able to act with her facial expressions more than with her speaking or saying some words.An amazing movie that I really enjoyed and highly recommend it.My rating is: 8/10(credits go to: ""CrashCourse"" from youtube for their video: ""Three Colors - Blue: Crash Course Film Criticism #11"")",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Meditation on grief,"The first film in Kieslowski's trilogy, Blue is a rather sombre introduction that lives up to the cool nature of its titular colour. After the death of her husband and daughter in a car accident, Julie reacts by denying the life she has left behind. All three films exemplify the theme of rebirth (signified oddly by the motif of a bottle in a recycling bin) and Julie's rebirth is a painful and self-inflicted one. After trying to escape everything she knows and loves in a secluded apartment, she gains new connections and a newfound appreciation for everything she has left behind. The ties of the past simply weigh down on her until she can no longer deny the bond between the Julie of the past and the Julie of the present, with the legacy of her husband's orchestra and unborn child determined to unite them into the future. Blue is a slow burning but affecting meditation on the way that grief demand a surpassing of ourselves and not a denial.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

I don't like movies that I have to watch several times just to understand 'everything the director is trying to say'; if a director isn't able to clearly convey what he/she wants us to feel, maybe they're in the wrong business. Being vague in a mystery can be a plus; but in a drama it just makes the plot murky and confusing.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Stunning and amazing,"""Blue"" was incredible.  Like Kubrick, Krzysztof Kieslowski uses symbolic images -- in the case of this ""trilogy"" it is very often colors as the titles would suggest.  Where Kubrick makes serious commentary about society and the civilized world, Kieslowski paints a picture of emotion and the human psyche -- many would argue a more daunting task.Truly the interpretation of this film is personal to the individual who watched it, but here's my take.  ""Blue"" was about one emotion, one state of mind:  the numbness we experience before grieving.  It is something that every human being who has suffered goes through, whether it is for just a few minutes or for a lifetime, as we feared Binoche's character would do. I felt the plot was a vehicle by which the director painted these emotions so vividly.Binoche's character suffered intensely and seemed numb to the world around her, but at the same time she also became more empathic and sensitive. She could not stand the thought of others having to suffer -- which was the case in her interaction with the prostitute-dancer and with the mice in her closet.  These many paradoxes in the human mind seem to be a running theme in this film (another is the closeness and anger she felt for the lawyer who carried her dead husband's child), and possibly his others (of which I have yet to see).To anyone who has a weak stomach for wrenching emotional imagery, stay away from this film.  However, if you want to see an artistic and poetic triumph in a film, you must see ""blue.""",,Anonymous,Music
Worth Viewing For Juliette Binoche's Masterful Performance Alone,"Representing one of the three ideals of the French Revolution, Blue is the first entry in what constitutes the Three Colours trilogy, and examines the liberty aspect of the principle. Permeated with a deep sense of loss, grief & melancholia and driven by a soulful performance from its leading lady, it is a thoughtful, meditative & emotionally engrossing effort.Co-written & directed by Krzysztof Kieslowski, the story opens with the tragedy that sets its plot into motion and patiently covers the journey of our protagonist from her self-imposed isolation to eventual healing. Kieslowski's direction exhibits both calm & composure, and the incorporation of blue hues, props & lighting into the narrative are tastefully carried out.Juliette Binoche is extremely convincing in her role, articulating her character's loss, trauma, pain, sorrow & inner conflict with emotional precision while also highlighting her road to recovery with a subtle touch. Her arc trajectory is interesting throughout and Binoche almost single-handedly steers the film past the finish line. The score is another key aspect that stands out with ease.Overall, Three Colours: Blue is as hopeful as it is heartbreaking, and features an exquisitely scripted & elegantly directed story that's brought to life with grace & compassion. Making deft use of close-ups, fade-outs & quiet movements, the camera stays in vicinity of its character at all times while steady pace & smart editing provide ample space for the events to play out. Worth viewing for Binoche's stirring rendition alone.",,Anonymous,Music
Broken homes and solitude,"The baby skin is so red and thin that a stroke of light or wind could make it burst. Mama's desperation shows in her eyes and frantic manners when the next - where she quietly raises her brood - is suddenly uncovered. It's just a mouse family and yet their physical vulnerability and strong family ties draw us close to them. We pity their ordeal; we mimic their fear and pain. We are reminded that one day we were defenceless babies, too. For a few moments, we no longer distinguish between human and rodent feelings.Three Colours Blue is an acutely well-observed study of human solitude and broken homes. The protagonist Julie (Juliette Binoche) has just lost her family (husband and daughter) in a car accident. She is disheartened and despondent as she attempts to recreate her life. The encounter with the mouse family represents the newfound feeling of sympathy. She is unable to kill the mice because such barbarous act would represent the perpetuation of her own family disintegration.Finally, Julie borrows the neighbour's cat in order to carry out the murderous task. Her decision is contradictory but also liberating. She finally forgave herself for the death of her husband and daughter and decided to move on with her life. There should be no room for guilt and fear in our lives, Kiéslowski reminds us.",,Anonymous,Music
One Sunday Morning,"One Sunday Morning I awoke on my friend's sofa, feeling a little groggy but, at the same time, pretty mellow.  I reached for the remote and channel surfed through the garbage until I came upon the opening credits  for ""Blue"" on Bravo.  I watched with pure intrigue for the next two hours. I emerged feeling as though I experienced a new High.The film is an amazing delight of visuals and sound complemented by the angelic glow of Binoche. Sit down one night or some early morning and view this brilliant film.  Perhaps by yourself and see if you experience what I did, for words cannot describe the feeling.",,Anonymous,Music
Just a character study,"Juliette Binoche gives a wonderful performance, though the movie is merely a showcase of the transition that her character goes through after her husband and daughter die in a car accident.  This character, Julie, is initially suicidal after the accident, but later decides to sell all of her possessions and move into an apartment in Paris where she intends to shut herself out from everyone.  You get to see Julie lose all emotion....and at the same time, she loses interest in almost everything.  Binoche's performance and the innovative cinematography are the best things about this movie.  Worth watching if you like seeing Binoche in movies....but there's nothing special about this movie.  The next film in the series (Three Colors: White) is much, much better than this one.",,Anonymous,Music
Wonderfully complex psychological drama,"""Blue"" (Polish/French, 1993): Starring Juliette Binoche, and created by Krzysztof Kieslowski. It is the first in a trilogy of films (""Blue"", ""White"", ""Red""). Worthy of your time...they are wonderfully complex psychological dramas, I will see them over and over. Aside from the obvious use of colors within each film, and some of the symbolism (which I suspect the European art crowd finds nicely elitist in that secret-society way, no one will absorb the full depth of these characters after one viewing. I also suspect that the issues portrayed in ""Blue"" are related to European politics and issues of solidarity, represented by various characters and circumstances. You'll continue thinking about them, and, fortunately, they are open enough to use as comparisons (symbols) within your own life. That begins to reach Art. The color photography is superb, the scoring, although perhaps over-extended, is also superb.",,Anonymous,Music
Exquisite Filmmaking! Kievlowski was a true Master,"This film lingers with you for days. It is shot beautifully and possesses a haunting suspensful edge. Our voyeuristic desires are  satisfied when we're invited to enter the main character's psyche. Unlike Hichtcock, who was wonderful at manipulating our emotions with his contrived form of suspense. Kievlowski examines the intrigue and strangeness which exists in our plain reality. How truly fascinating is the seemingly ordinary human animal as seen through the eyes of a great filmmaker. Elengant, perplexing, thought provoking and ultimately liberating are the words to describe this film which much be watched as an event, not just another rental. The film also brings out the extraordinary talent of Juliette Binoche, in what I believe has been her best role to date. Don't miss it. Catch it with a special friend or loved one and some good vin rouge.",,Anonymous,Music
Good,"One is destine to see the plot for this and think that it's yet again one of those very slow, artsy foreign films. And hey, they may not be wrong, but this is a pretty good film (not as great as the reviews say though). I liked Binoche in it, but I somehow wish another actress could have taken the role and done even more soulful and deeper stuff with her performances. In a way, it seems like a wasted opportunity. There are some truly dazzling and visually amazing shots here, the cinematography really does give the film that murkiness of the pace and of what the director is trying to get across. Overall, I recommend this, although it's not perfect.",,Anonymous,Music
The best film of the trilogy,This is in my opinion by far the best of the 'trois couleurs' films. Far from any stereotypes it shows what is really going on in us. It leaves me literally breath- and speechless. It shows also the best performance of Juliette Binoche(and that means something!).If you like 'real' films about life then this is for you.A masterpiece.,,Anonymous,Music
A puzzle,"A film about freedom like sense of life. Introspective way and forms of disillusion, fight against the past and steps of self-definition. And the masks of music, ambiguity of search, nooks of desire. A beautiful film about the relation with life and image of the other. Exercise of honest description of reality like collection of different pieces. A subtle form of catharsis and anatomy of gestures. A meditation about values and expectation, trust and desire, about skin of things and the memories as parts of a lamp.A fascinating puzzle in which every piece is bone of a seductive game. Every scene- step on a soul ladder, every symbol- sign of passing away. A Kieslowski film, with same taste, images and nuances of recreation and description of empty world, with delicate art to reveal the essences of days and sacrifices, with same mute hope, glass realities and stone hours.A film about love like only way to exist.About freedom as circle of self-definition.About fragile world beyond the shadows, truth as not result of conventions, silence as perfect refuge, the other as reflection of own universe.Pain as mirror. The images, the illusions, the mud traces are details of a impressive puzzle, the place of pieces are image of perpetual search.",,Anonymous,Music
